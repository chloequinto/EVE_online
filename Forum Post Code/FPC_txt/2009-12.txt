700 mil waste of iskies my sin has been sitting in the hanger for months did a couple of sb hot drops one day for the fun of it thats about it really the sin stayed in hi sec all plated up for fear of gankers no way id take it into low sec due to its fail combat statsi think my mains corp has a small pos that needs fuel so i might bridge a couple cov haulers from hi sec to the pos to refuel it then ill park her till next month when the pos cries againblack ops needs a lot of luv
ive been having my sin for about 5 months only use of it is for hotdroping with bombers and this rarely happens due to laughtable jump rangebos beed 10ly jump range after skills apply better resists and cov ops cloaks i know this was highly disputed since they were introduced but weve seen by now that ragular cloaks dont cut it and since they are outperformed in tank and dps by their t1 counterparts cov ops cloaks will give em more situation to be useful in instead of making them any kind of solopwnmobile
i unwisely started training for the widow as soon as they were announced ive used it for its intended purpose a handfull of times and was disappointed when i didthey need a better jump range and fuel capacity either increased hold or decreased consumption not being able to make many region jumps defeats the primary role of these ships i dont think dread range is unreasonable for a ship whose hull costs as much as some carrier hulls they need to warp cloaked being the only ship in a blackops gang that cant makes using them even in a recon and bomber gang a minus in many cases they either need their hp restored or they need t2 resists and commandshiplike mass and agilitylook at what the ship costs to justify that cost the benefit that they provide needs to be a must have in other words nobody would even consider taking out a recon and bomber gang without a blackops that isnt the case now not even close
this change does make sense to me but i dont want to see suicide ganking get nerfed that heavily id only support it if concord spawn timers were lengthened significantly to compensate
no one should be getting insurance on getting concordd or self destructingits what makes it possible for most people to suicide gank without any loss or cost short of sec rating

it may look like nothing more than a wire frame but dem mimatar nose hows to use dat duct tape
i personally would rather see the current freighters adapt so they can fill this job if not though is the price going to be close to the jf
some ideas i had was to either go with the car carrier idea and have a ship thats nothing but a bunch of external clamps you would be able to visibly see that ships clamped to it lower the number of ships that it could haul 20 assembled battle ships seems like a hell of a lot or a tug boat design where the ships are towed slightly behind it in bubbles

great idea
actually ccp already has a system in place to calculate the actual value of goods in evethey only use the prices of goods when those goods change ownership low buy orders and high sell orders are ignored because no other player accepts the termslets say 4 market orders for trit are placed each involving an arbitrarily large quantitya buy order at 100 iskb buy order at 23 iskc sell order at 25 iskd sell order at 9001 iskonly orders b and c are ever engaged in actual trade a is unsatisfied since b overrides it and d is unsatisfied because no one will pay 9001 isk per unit of isk so only b and c impact the moving averagethe only exploit is if a person goes to a station with no orders for that good post it way too high then buy it with an alt however imagine the quantity of that good changing hands imagine the concerted effort necessary to inflate the average market price of tritanium and exploiters have to pay both a tax 1 and a broker fee at most 1so lets ignore broker and just say 15 to add 1 unit of 1000 isk trit to the moving average costs 15 isk if 10 billion units of isk change ownership every day at 200 isk it takes 10000 10 thousand 1000 isk transactions to increase the average to 2997 isk per unit that is 150 million isk lost to the black hole of market tax and broker feethe price exploiters post at doesnt matter the higher they do it at the fewer transactions are required but the same 15 is still lost in taxesfeesif someone wants to pay the fee to increase the perceived value of tritanium they are welcome to do itthat exploit is preventable by ignoring extreme outliers but if someone wants to invest the taxes to increase the price i say let them
yes
i agree
i approve of garr mainly because she of her sweet voiceand mainly because it keeps the amarr carebears away while the minmatar miltia decimates the amarr pvp fleets zomfg x up you fkeing carebears in their miltia channel
an overheated drone would have the same 20 increase in its effectiveness in a way that mirrors a 20 reduction in cycle time of the modules it emulatescombat drones would fire 20 fasterecm drones would cycle their jamming attempts 20 faster other ewar drones would have 20 increased range or strengthmining drones would mine 20 fasterrepair drones would repair 20 fasterall drones capable of movement would have their speed increased by 20 when overheatedoverheating a drone would require drone interfacing iv sounds good in keeping with the dominion changes to lowering skill requirements for learning thermodynamics from v to iv and thermodynamics i implementation into the ui would be another option in the context menu when rightclicking a drone in your drones window toggle overheat onoffthis would bring drones into line with other weapons systems as having the same functionality making them more appropriate as a primary weapon system for the ships designed to use themthis is not a  about drones being subpar i love my dronesedit fixed a typo in the subject line
all ew drones should get strength not cycle time changeswhich is a pretty tiny bonus all told that said i like this its even better because with drones you can actually see how the heat is affecting their hp directly just be sure to balance heat damage for the fact that they have hundredsthousands of hp and not 40
supportingtotally not because i finished training drone interfacing v recently 
yesits a pain to recall a damaged drone than not be able to tell which of the 6 in the bay is the bad one
i still cant for the life of me understand why or how this has been overlooked for so long guess its another one of those situations where it shows just how l33t we are for playing like how pushing an engineless sports car around your neighborhood and saying vroom vroom is l33t
this is without doubt the most boring as bat  type of mining in the game the entire gas harvesting system needs to be replaced

hello everyone hello ccpteamim a player from germany and during the last few days i got an idea regarding the look of eve here it ishopefully my english isnt too badwhy are some spacestations positioned that far from planets even if they got a colonized one nearby it definitly would look more realistic if they would have a lot lower orbit so that the immense mass of a planet could be seen in eve universe it seems that spacestaions are a lot bigger than planets and thats definitly not very realistic be honest have you ever seen a spacestation bigger than a planet even deathstar was just as big as a moonso why not let ships and stations interact in lower orbit of planets i mean space is gigantic and no place looks like the other but in the unsiverse of eveeverything looks almost the same and that might be a bit boring the best example for what i mean and how it could look a bit more realistic is the dominionwallpapers the proportions look realistic with the planets trabants and all the asteroids in near orbit everything looks interesting and got a lot of varietygeneral speaking space is massive a place filled with huge objects objects that are a million times bigger and older than humanity so why not give the player the feeling of beeing tiny in comparison to space to give you a more detailed picture of what i mean please look at the picture down here i know its a totally different game but it gives you an idea of what i meanlow orbiting spacestationi try to describe my specific idea with wordslets say you are about to reach a spacestation of a planet with your shuttle while warping station and planet are coming close very fast but on first sight you cant see the spacestation youre warping to the planet grows bigger and bigger and finally covers all of your screen as youre still in warp just in the last moments before dropping out of warp you see the spacestation coming close very fast you got to move the camera around to get the size of the planet just as you drop out of warp approaching the spacestation you realize how massivly this planet really is andin my opinion most importantrealize how impressive and dangerous at the same time eve can be for just one human beeing on the other hand side the game would become more interesting and get a lot of places to visit i mean travelling makes a big part of the game so why not filling space with remarkable placeslets think a step further the planned feature to walk on spacestations if we take dust 514 as an example the view out of the control central that weve all seen in the gametrailer just imagine you stood at the window of a cafeteria chatting with one of your corporation members and got a scenic view like it was in the trailer of dust 514 scenic viewif new players would see that in first place right at the beginning of their career i could imagine they would be very impressed it also would give players the feeling that the station that theyre walking on has an economic and social connection to the millions of people who live down on the planet particularly in regard to the planned feature to interact with planets and the connection to dust 514 it would be a more natural feeling of a spacestationthats just one of my ideas to make eve looking a bit more interesting its beautyful as it is right now but i think there could be done a bit more in my opinion the proportions of the games interior would benefit from a bit work on it so that scenes like the one i described could get realized however things like that can be done i think ccp can do it of course i know that this idea might be a bit bigger scaled than other ones but i thought you all should hear itits just an idea so what do you think about it
you are right if local chat were removed there would be no need for logonski becuase nobody in their right mind would ever do anything but dock if they were agressed at a station without some way of assessing the threat youre facing one has to assume that the attacker is doing so because theyre confident they have more backup close by than you dobecause the death penalty in eve is relatively severe most tactics revolve around luring an opponent into a fight thats stacked in your favor and unfortunately folks arent above metagaming logonski to do it the current mechanics allow the target of the metagaming tactic to disengage the proposed mechanics dontremoving local will just make the population in general more risk averse becuase again it will be difficult to impossible to assess the threat youre facing the net result would be less willingness overall to pvpi think docking games are lame too and id like to see them go away but there is a serious hole in this proposal that needs to be addressed
bump disguised as supporting my own topic
t1 destroyers are already poerfull v frigs although there are some imbalances between them i wouldnt mid seeing a small logistics destroyer but really id like to see them balance dictors better
t1 destroyers are woefully underpowered i have seen many desties soloed by frigs the destroyer has many of the faults of a cruiser sig radius speed and many of the flaws of frigates ehp cpu pg capacitor there are many proposals out there to fit destroyers in general which i support however my op is designed to make a destroyer that is capable of dealing with t2 frigates as there is no ship that has dedicated role bonuses for this task
aml caracalalso arty thrasher and coercer glass cannon fit 2 te2 hs are deadly for any frigates even t2 the thrasher got the potential to one volley ceptors
the aml caracal does have the capacity to kill frigs and the arty thrasher is a force to be reckoned with however i think that cruisers should be fit to fight ships of equal size and that destroyers of all races should be able to scare a frigate pilot to no end
i support the idea not sure about the statistics though would need a good look at it to make it a fair shipbut yeah t1 dessys are a poor and useless ship the only thing they are good at id suiciding hulks
alright well i originally posted this under features and ideas and i thought i should move it here because of some positive commentswith dominion and the new fleet system you can enable loot logging i love it also ive recently noticed that you can see what system a player of your fleet is in what ship theyre in or if theyre dockedso i was thinkingwith the new ability to save ship fits along with the new fitting window wouldnt being able to see your fleet members fits be not only interesting but a great added factor in fleet strength and tactics now one may ask how is this different from linking your fitting in the chat window its very different and more convenient first off you dont have to save your fits and you dont have to link them second an fc or others maybe the fc designates who can see can easily pull up ships by players names and quickly see what they have fitthink about it you could be in my fleet and be like look at jades fit lolololololol and then kick me out also what if you want everyone to fit rr for spider tanking and someone didnt get the memo instead of being a super cereal tool and shouting saying if you fit a pppproper ship youd be able to look at the fit and tell the person to get on the ball and fit itit may seem rather simple and inconsequential but these small additions will add more to not only preparation of fleets but overall fleet strength that and it will be easier to give people advice unless youre to seriousone other though i just hadwith the system now you cant see a players ship while theyre docked so it would probably go hand in hand that you wont be able to see a players fit if theyre dockedand heres the original thread if anyone is curious
to be honest i kind of like this teaching carebears cynojammer takedown tactics proper subcap fleet fits integration of rr into their gangs and all that other stuff seems like a great idea to me more pve content should be so good at giving people a hint of what pvp is like and op no its 00 space for a reason  dont whine that its full put together a battleship fleet and start reinforcing poses
this seems to be a good idea in empire space the ruling power already maintains communications but in 00 it should be the owners responsibility to set up a comms system
ive thought about this very thing i enjoy the lack of an active local in wh space and it makes sense that uncolonized 00 no sov shouldnt have standard subspace communications like empire space i believe the ops requirements for a local chat are a little much but either way i support it
against my better judgement i like this idea it makes sense in terms of game mechanics seems logical in terms of the way systems are being developed by ccp adds another element to the system takeover  do you go for the economic center outpost the infrastructure center hub or communication center firstwhile this will mean that systems without sov claimed by someone will probably become slightly more dangerous these systems are few and with dominion hopefully fewer but common sense should keep you alive more often than notalthough not perfect maybe the module requirements could be lower i likebut id be interested to see if anyone comes up with a good why not other than why should we
im ok with it as long as lowsec and pirate sov 00 still have it
they should because lowsec is controlled by empire factions and pirate sov is still sov
woho the best solution to this proposal ive seen so far and yes nullsecpiratesov should remain the local chatthis opens up for intresting monitoring systems
i guess i am for this just wondering realistically how much of 00 would this leave without local chan  would it be significant enough to be worthwhile 
on a day to day basis this would not be worthwhile but in terms of conquest of sov space this could add quite a bit lets face it 99 of what is typed in local in 00 is gf its not used to communication its used for intelwith this i would hope that the attackers would be able to put the commo hub in reenforced mode and eventually destroy and thus turn off local in a system or that the defenders could turn off and on with suitable delays localgiving you scenarios like this your attacking an enemies outpost you know from local that you have superiority in numbers and your happily got its shields down to 50  all of a sudden local disappears your scouts report that local went out in the enemies adjacent systems and some nervous fella reports cynos opening on the directionalscanner are you about to become a grease smudge in space will they have similar numbers and it could be worth standing your ground  or is it just all a bluff to test your nervesintel is an important part of system warefare i believe this would add significantly to it
well if you like it and support it make sure to check that box saying that you give your support i like seeing big thumbsups for things that i support the more the merrier 
the ops concept actually is good with having local channel dependent upon an anchored and onlined structure definitely supported
the idea sounds good but in normal space unlike wormnole space you have static things to warp to ie roid belts etcetc and because of this no need to scan things downi fear this would leave covops too unbalanced and overpowered as there would be no way to counter having a cloaky gang sit on your stationin your beltsat least in wormholes you can keep an eye out for probes this would lead to lots of space being left unusedboth because of cost and riskresulting in people going back to empire lvl 4s or blobing all together in dead end constellations with scouts to warn of any hostiles cominggetting rid of local sounds goodbut it would mean many other aspects of the game would need to changefor it to work wellnot supported as the op doesnt cover the problems that would arise in systems without the special structure due to current game machanincs
as long as its a cheap and easy upgradestrategic 1 can be moved in a hauler minimal upkeep and its not required in npcowned space i like this idea i could probably be talked out of it but my first impression is positive
i think that its a good idea not sure how easy it would be to code thoughanother alternative idea not trying to hijack here would be to also implement something like if you jump into lowsechighsec00 from a wh you should not be displayed in local until you are near a stargatestar base i mean what is there in space that automatically detects you when you jump in from nowhere
get eve to 600k subs no can flip on new playersim tired of seeing brand new miners in high sec get can flipped they dont know any better so they shoot back pretty much every time and pop this is grieving that hurts new player subs and the people that are doing this are bored but too scared to go into lownull sec and do any real pvp this is an activity that makes little to no isk i would prefer a game mechanic that prevents this from happening to new players old players are fair game imhoi know there is a rule against doing this in new player systems but i see it happen at a very high rate in systems surrounding new player systems these are characters that are just barely getting there feet wet in eve they are mining today but the might move on to pvp or other activities later onsome data collection might be in order to see just how common it isi use 3 accounts 2 hulks and an orca when i mine so can flipping is a thing of the past for me but what about the new guysgalswith all the work done on the new player experience its a waste when new people give up at the start because they get the wrong impression of the gamecsms what can be done to stopprevent or punish these actions so that ccp can achieve its goal of 600k subscriptionsthey dont have a voice so someone needs to askthere are a lot of solutions that could be implemented herered colored unflippable cans from noob shipsundetermined punishmentsmake it cost isk put the hurt in there walletsconcordable actionhuge hit to sec statushow about a pop up message to new players that explains the rules of engagement and the dangers of using canstalk amongst yourselves
better education of new players might be a good idea  have a popup that explains the rules the first time you jet a can say but covering newbies in bubble wrap is not the solution  we want them to be playing eve at the end of the day besides itd be exploited instantly  newbie alt miner main in corp unflippable hulk pilot so while i dont really object to your point your solution is a bad one
this is a good idea but your ideas to fix it arent
did you even bother to take the time to think about what you where saying before you postedno seriously no troll here just stop and think about what you sayingwhats to stop someone from getting a new account to mine for the duration and then transferring purchases over to a mainno i didnt think sostop emoraging and start using your head before you come up with ideas10 troll attempt  o pps the can flipping is not a problem its a very minor problem so i fail to see why its so earth shattering i mean you simply ignore or you set up a trap get people to help you if your going to whine and cry and quit your better off going back to wow at that point there are far worse things in eve to turn players off can flipping is very low on that list
this is a very insensitive comment to the problem that was brought up i dont see any emowhining as you say and saying that such a thing is occurring puts off the creative thinking to an ageold problem that keeps getting brought upwhy would people continuously keep bringing up can flipping because it is a problem sometimesccp says the current game mechanic is intentional  space debris is anyones to have changing the way this works wont happenbut what i think is a good idea is notifying the player the first time they drop a can that its not permanent storage and that its not recommended to use jetcan mining tactics ever
as have said will gence how to solve this point  upgrading defender missiles  not the best way i think they are all or nothing  upgrading them will risk make missile boat uselesscreate sort of disruptor agains missile launcher  its not the launcher who do the work its the missile rp speaking modify the missile action by disrupting the launcher is strangewhat i propose is a new module  missile disruptor med slotwhen actived this module create a small bubble around your ship that will make missile explode before touching you missiles will always damage your ship but the module will indirectly reduce the damage amount they do the more the module skill is trained the more damage are reduce cause missile will explode sooner
or you can look at it this way the missile and the ship are in constant communication during its flight sending and receiving updates to adjust its flight path etc think wireguided missiles of today by targeting the ship and activating a launcher disruptor module you interfere with that communication and thus negatively affect the missile the launcher disruptor module can have scripts much like the tracking disruptor with each causing a different effect a tracking script for lack of a better term causes the missile to miscalculate its point of impact thus making the speed of its target overexaggerated whereas you only may be traveling at 200ms the tracking script makes the missile think you are traveling 300ms and its damage is reducedan optimal range script again for lack of a better term causes the missile to think you are further away than you really are and causes the missile to deactivate prematurely that torpedo that should have hit you at 50km will now with the script active deactivate at just 30km
or you can use ewar and break the lock which invalidates any missiles traveling enroute to youexcept space bombsdont think theres gonna be much support at that ratenot that i have any problem with the idea in the first place of course
wouldnt get used any more than defenders get used now reason is that youre giving up a midslot to defend against weapon system thats out of favor for pvp anyway when you could fit a damp or jammer instead and get some defense against everyone

you realize the wording of this thread is exactly what they did in this patch right now ms are even more useless than ever before thanks you 
updated opedit  lith at the time of posting moms had hp buff so that wasnt an issue and as you can see in the op and thread no one asked for the removal of that buff
it also didnt say to keep it you realize they removd ms buffs because they believe a large chunk of the playerbase didnt like any iteration of them right this thread is likely part of thatedit there is also no mention of bombers and why the hell do we want to keep the clone vat bay have you ever used yours seriously
youre missing the point entirely
basically we all know that in the real world most every battleship or cruiser has in addition to a bunch of guns for shooting big ships a bunch of ittybitty guns that shoot at missiles aircraft and small ships that they cant hit with the big cannons and we also know that a lot of people dont want battleships to become solopwnmobiles so i think i have a solutionmy solution is to add a new class of weapon called the point defence turret each class of weapons laser projectile hybrid missile would have them as far as graphics go each gun would appear as a quadset of gatling laserscannonsrails or as a small cluster of rocket pods mounted on a turret their firing animation would just be a small storm of machinegunlasersslugsmissiles shooting at up to 5 random targets within 10kmthey would target missiles drones and then frigates in that order of priority ie each cycle the system would first shoot missiles then drones then frigates the weapon would do minimal damage 15 or so tops of the racial racial damage type of the weapon the fitting cost would be 200pg and 40tf but destroyers would recieve a 95 reduction in powergrid and 50 reduction in cpu costs the ammo supply would be 40 rounds max so as to prevent abuse in the form of a permanant missile shield capacitor drain would be in the 50gj range but destroyers would have this cut by 50 they would require level 5 in their respective small weapon skills to usethe main purpose of this weapon would be to engage drones and missiles and also to give destroyers a new role of cheap missiledrone defence in large fleets as it only tracks 5 targets per gun at a time the computations in the server would be less complex than a smartbomb so it would not greatly increase lag plus who wouldnt like to see their ship shooting a zillion little projectiles at those drones attacking them
without a mention of rate of fire its a meaningless proposal seems to me like a waste of a high slot anyway  also a further nerf to jamming would it be effected by tds more detail required
they saw that the gila and rattlesnake  fail so they changed it so i think more ships need changing
huh or you could just not use those ships in pvp i mean is it me or are we over thinking this where is it written that every ship has to be good at every tasknot supported leave my typhoon alone thanks
but people got the option i am mostly missile specced and the new typhoon is finally a decent armor tanked missile bs for me so i will train matari bs just to get the phoon with 5 torps and 3 utility highsi was concidering it with the 44 layout already but the new layout just makes it more sexy my corp mate on the other hand will pick the phoon with acs because he doesnt have the slightest clue about missilesi like that kind of flexibility and yes i also abused the rokh as missile boat p
eh  i mean this sincerely did you not understand the proposal  hes not suggesting removal of split weapons systems just that the 2 dmg bonuses that are often applied to them and are only as effective as 1 bonus on a single weapon boat are rolled into one leaving another bonus slot free this would improve the typhoon why wouldnt you want that ill try to ignore the implication of ur post that the typhoon doesnt have to be good at pvp incase i am misunderstanding you
actually i was referring to the ops reasoning for the change  that these ships arent preferred for pvp if they arent useful for pvp im not saying i agree but thats the point hes trying to make then why do we have to change them to make them useful why not use a ship thats better at pvpif you just want to boost split weapon ships then lets stop obfuscating the purpose of the thread behind a mask of make it more viable for pvptbh i like my cruise missile spewing multi remote repping typhoon with its massive drone bay i even gave it a name that suits its role its called multitool because it was shorter than swiss army knife with the new slot layout ill probably drop one repper and add another cm launcher  but tbh the rest of the ship doesnt need to be changed i say that because in order to add what is in reality a third bonus that means something else about the ship has to be nerfed
i really dont think u are getting this at all hes just saying that on a boat such as the cyclone the bonus would become 5 bonus to medium projectile turret and launcher rate of firethis is one of the main reasons ppl dont use the cyclone all that much 3 unbonused hi slots when ppl do use it its because they have crystals and pills this is pretty rare or because it cheap its all very easy for you to casually say just use other ships without split weapons but especially regarding minmatar boats that leaves few options split weapons do indeed suck just ask a naglfar pilot i appreciate that in some cases this may make some ships op cane perhaps but that could obvoiusly be left as it is but for the split weapons ships that do need some dps lovin this is actually a good ideaedittbh i like my cruise missile spewing multi remote repping typhoon with its massive drone bay i even gave it a name that suits its role its called multitool because it was shorter than swiss army knifeand this idea would not alter that in the slightest no slots would change the bonuses would just be rolled into one 5 bonus to large projectile turret siege and cruise missile launcher firing speed per level leaving room for another utilty bonus or tanking etc etcthe typhoon is a marginal case anyway i would argue that it would be a ship where adding cpupg would be a better change considering the 5th launcher point but it was useful to demonstrate what i meantto clarify then i support adding this to ships that need it only
no i understand what hes saying my point is lets call this what it is  a boost to split weapon ships and then be aware that if they give you this theyll most likely take something else away to compensate for itthe point is the ship really does have two bonuses the rate of fire bonuses dont need to be lumped into a single bonus and add a third on top of it in the form of a tanking bonus because thats going to make the ship op frankly unless they nerf something else in conjunction with itpeople may not like the two rate of fire bonuses especially if they dont actually mount both weapon systems  because then it seems like a wasted bonus but that doesnt mean the ship needs to be changed
eve is made for pvpsupported ofc boost mai typhoon so i can kill other tier 1 in 1vs1 if you look at it typhoon only got 1 bonus cus the 5 damagerof bonus is split system so atleast add 1 more bonus to typhoon like 5 armor each lvl 3
there are exactly two ships that this would apply to after the sansha and gurista ships got changed  the typhoon and the naglfar the nag needs this desperately given how thoroughly it got screwed in dominion  5 rof and 5 dps on both weapon systems might almost be enough to make it usable again the typhoon probably doesnt but id be fine with it getting it anyways as long as the second bonus wasnt especially good  5 speed maybe but not 5 damage so yeah im fine with it its only really one bonus now them getting a second is cool by me
nope  there are already enough reasons to use the ships you assume are suffering youre trying to solve a problem that doesnt exist its not like the rupture or phoon were left on the pvp shelf anywayhave you even noticed that 90 of amarr ships only have 1 real bonus the 10 cap use bonus just removes the pain of the chosen offencive configuration should this change no  players choose what they train for its the same for dual offensive ships they have inherent advantages no cap use  always doing at least some damage missiles but doing some high dps damage turrets if the situation is right so leave them be
cap usage is a penalty which balances out the great range tracking at optimal and reload speed of lasers saying that 10 cap use per level isnt a real bonus is like saying the damage bonuses on minmatar ships which exist to counteract the normally poor dps of projectiles arent real bonusessupported
the example of exotic dancers was just a simple one  further down the line and more importantly there are other inconsitenciessuch as the mammothgiven datamass 1250000 tonnesvolume displacement 255000m3 can be approximated to l 150m x b  50m x d 34mnet tonnage 5625 tonnes cargo capacityequivalent hold size 25m x 25m x 9mcompaire this to a cargo ship on earthknock nevis jahre vikingvolume l45845m x b688m x d298m  939932528 m3net tonnage 21479300 tonneszirk
ah so this is a stalth boost the cargo capacity of haulers whinefirst and foremost the total volume of a seagoing vessel is not equal to its displacement the displacement is actually a factor of the ships mass to whitso trying to equate the idea of displacement to a starship is sillysecond point eve ships arent rated in the amount of tonnage they can carry but in the total volume they can move that mass number is as you pointed out in your first post occasioanlly silly but ultimately useless in terms of cargoyou can see this yourself with this simple demonstrationrepackage a covetor stuff it into a mastadon and then jump into a class 1 wh assemble the covetor at a friendly sma and try and jump back out youll get a nice message about the ship being too heavy i admit its a glitch in the mecahnics but it proves the point tha tcargo mass isnt really that important in evefinal point even assuming ships of exactly equal interior volume and thats the key since a ocean going vessel can load stuff up on the deck and cart it around thus adding to its tonnage carrying without adding to the interior volume of the ship i would expect a space ship to carry less enclosed cargo room why more equipment you have items that a starship needs that an earthly vessel doesnt such as life support and air processing systems to name a couple if you want to compare these ships to anything you should compare them either to submarines not a really good comparison tbh or to the space shuttle which has many of the same issues
if there was any change to volumes needed itd be to make mineral compression disappear by scaling down the volumesor quantities of lowend minerals tritanium ingots should be the most compressed way to haul the stuff not seemingly the least but exotic dancers theres about a billion things more important than that to worry about besides i always took the livestock masses and volumes to be a joke on ccps part theres no need to change this
you like big butts and you can not lie 1m3 is 2m x 1m x 05m  thats a lot of space standing i know eve players are fat but dancers more than 1m wide and 50cm deep lets keep them with 1m3 so when i put 100 in the cargo hold i can imagen them all bumping and rubbing together when i turn the shipeither way youre quite wrong about the volume but you may have a point on the weight  60 or 65kg may more accurate but who cares
something along these lines seems sensible to me defenders shouldnt be good but they should be at least marginally usable
im all for t2 tier3 bs hulls but to be honest im not sure if a bs sized hac on steroids is what they should be i like the flagship idea i saw in another thread about t2 bs have the option for warfare links and corresponding bonuses with the ability to field a hefty tank and of course still be able to put out respectable dps possibly specific bonuses designed to buff fleets beyond the warfare links no idea what just a thought otherwise i support the idea of more t2 bson a note about their usability sure they wont be cheap but if they are effective and are worth it for those that can fly them who cares how much they cost i am by no means mr moneybags but i can afford to use my nightmare in pvp without much worry because it is effective for what i use it foreither way i would like to go ahead name the t2 abaddon before anyone else assuming no one has beaten me to it yet either the paradigm or the paragon btw i believe gargoyle was appropriate for your example ship

this has been up for years now it had some ccp guys working on it and still no improvement in dominionwhy is it so hard to fix something so simple
no there are still people out like me that dont have one of those and neither have the need nor the intend to get one
a bump disguised as me supporting my own topic
afaik all deleted items are not actually deleted straight way they are sent to an item graveyard of sorts for about a month so i dont think it would be too hard to implementstill while i have not had the problem i can see how it helps
cloaking iv 6 requires 271530 skill pointselectronics v 1 requires 256000electronics iv vs v is about 210000 spbut that just lets you fit a covert ops cloak to the proper ship to fit it to requires covert ops electronics upgrades v 512k sp and all covert ops ships require a racial ship skill at v for frigates it is another 512k speven without factoring electronics iv about 48k i am still seeing 10 ranks worth of level v or about 256 million sp but that is just prereqs doesnt count covert ops i not the missile skills to get to torpedoes and bomb launchers or the additional fitting skills to be able to cram that stuff in not requiring electronics v saves about 210000 sp or less than 10now i understand not wanting more stealth bombers drifting through 00 but this change isnt going to cause them to sprout out of nowhere either
missile velocity is ok with me for the most part my biggest beef with rockets is the painfully low explosion velocity and dps would like to see both upped at least to the point where fitting rockets to to the rocket boats gives you better performance than fitting turrets additionally since were there i think hams could use a slight damage boost to make them more viable compared to their guided heavy missile cousins less than double dps for less than 13 the range and not getting the precision skill bonus is painful
i was wondering if you could check this post here  as it has many of the points i would like to see changed with missiles on an unrelated note what is your opinion of destroyers ie should they be rebalanced should there be more variety can we haz another t2 
had more than a few people mail me that i was their top match or close surprised i didnt make the list just goes to show how popular the site became i guess all in all id call it a much needed win for the whole election process
i completely agree with you and have been trying to point this out during the last two campaigns here are some of my thoughts on the possible future of csmi think dierdra did a great job with the vote match but mainly because it is a step in the right direction the focus is too much on the issues and not enough on personality and social skills i believe that those skills are a true key to the successful interaction between players csm  ccpthat is another reason why i also believe that csm candidates should be allowed to take longer terms or more terms in office we should try to develop a sort of csm candidate standard based on player and ccp feedback and in time a group of professional csm officials will emergei believe once such a system will be firmly established a natural split between left and right liberal and conservative views will occur so when it comes to elections players will choose the most qualified candidates based on skills and they will choose their issues based on candidates left or right views of course in the world like eve purely left or right views are rare as most candidates will want big changes in some areas liberal and stability in other areas conservative ultimately such devisions are not meant to artificially separate the candidates into parties but are rather aimed at focusing the development legislative process in one area its seems that ccp has used specific player input on several occasions relating to improvements or fixes on existing game mechanics on the other hand when it comes to bigger expansions they generally prefer that players do not go too deep into game design as to leave their devs room to move from that perspective creating a kind player political system would allow ccp to better gauge the majority vote of the players and it will give the players a stronger influence over ccps priority list often the big questions boil down to this do we focus more on improving the existing or on expanding the new
interesting reading and many thanks to dierdra for putting in the effort imo more effort than some of the candidates seemed to put into their public campaigns though i guess if you have a large alliance behind you you dont need to scrabble around for votes like the rest of us i can pretty much pinpoint where i screwed up on the questions and lowered my match scores i should have just answered a couple of the questions that i didnt have a strong opinion of just to get a better match though it wouldnt actually have reflected my position any better anyway i feel it was a useful tool and hope it gets taken forward and developed for the csm 5 campaign
i dont disagree that is extremely important that a csm member is driven willing to put in the time and able to make proper proposals and work diplomatically with the council and ccp however as i said before you cannot measure any of thisthis website isnt about being the only tool for a user to decide who to vote for it is simply a way to cut down the huge group of candidates into a smaller group of candidates that match your vision for eve which of those candidates you choose is up to you this is clearly advertised on the website as it encourages people to look into their shortlist in detailso yeah this focuses on issues and not vague notions of social skills and executive abilities because a candidates position on issues can be measured do not try and make this website into something it isnt
dec 2nd
i completely believe you but where did you get that info i always seem to miss everything on this website
this dev blog has the datesthus any issues to be discussed by the first meeting of the new csm needed to be raised by the 28th of last month 7 days before the meeting
first meeting is usually an info session and handover from previous csm
i am always down on that list
i agree about the shuffle and i was posted at the top i am not sure if i ever actually said it i know i typed it a lot hard to keep straight what i do and dont edit out if i didnt it was because i didnt want to seem falsea button to showhide characters after the 1000th or so in the candidate about me area some candidates had some major walls of text
maybe it is a idea to add the titan cloak restriction to the black ops and give them cov op cloak the titan cloak restriclion for 10 min after u have fired the dd is actualy what u need to make cov op black ops not to over powered
oh hell yes this needs to be done asap i think the simple problem is that theyre weaker in combat than t1 bs despite being 1020 times as expensive and taking 50 times as long to train for yes i know their primary role is not as a combat vessel which is good because currently theyre pathetictheyre t2 battleships we should be getting what we pay for here make them at least as tough as the t1 equivalents

bumping massively supported nobrainer topics lalala
supremely disappointed that such a heavily supported change got removed from dominion bumping in the hopes that we see it come back

sigh bumping again
its been about a year since the last time ccp put any new alliance logos into the game if memory serves it was the fallwinter 2008 expansion that saw the last addition of alliance logos here we are apocrypha and dominion both released and we have not seen the additon of new alliance logosthere have been many threads about this going back over the last year or so but here are two recent examplesingameboardaspatopicthreadid1224306ingameboardaspatopicthreadid1223346ccp has been asked countless times about this i made a thread about 6 months ago about this and the response from ccp was something along the lines of were revamping the system there was some story in there about the person who was supposed to handle it having changed jobs and the person thats supposed to take it over is on vacation and will look at it when they get back but still we have nothingi on the behalf of the countless alliances out there waiting for their logos to be implemented am formally requesting that the csm not only look into this but directly ask ccp what is being done about thisi know this will seem a minor thing to many people out there but as has been proven over and over in mmos players like leaving their mark on the world even if its as simple as people seeing a unique logo when they look at the alliance info its a mark its not a difficult process and ccp could very easily allow alliances to put their logo into the game and then have the playerbase police it im certain that it would not take long for someone to complain about the large phallus logo that some alliances will put ini recently played aion and they have the legion logo submission process built into the game and its then automatically updated with the next server downtime with how much more advanced eve is in comparison i dont expect that it would be much more than a couple of hours of coding and another hour of testing to get this ready to goso csm i hope that you can resolve this where ccp has seemingly ignored it

i havent noticed this in the minutesanyone having accessibility issues with dominionedit for those users of sippuff mice the zoom buttons have been readded as an option turn them on from the cap dial dropdownchanges like these would be cool to have on an accessibility portal where users of these kind of devices could keep uptodate with changes that effect them
when you put it like that i agree
webs used to kill speed with multiple webs pinning you to a spot i order to stop this ccp reduced web strength from 90 down to 60 tech2 i believe stasis web are now underpowered especially as scramblers can knock out mwds which reduces the speed more than 2xwebs whilst only using a single mid sloti would like to propose a boost to 66 again tech 2 level while a minor boost it will make webs more effective and crucially 2 webs will drop the target ship slightly below its pre mwd speed the targets continued cap drain and sig bloom compensating for no points and extra mid gained by just using a scramblerthere will be more incentive to fit a web and theres a serious reason now to use a minmater recon over the gallente ones

did this change happen if so i support switching it back i think the fw guys should be the ones driving the market for faction gear i would actually be glad if the faction stuff went down in price right now its all but nonexistant in pvp because its too expensive economically speaking i dont see the big issue much of the complaining about this idea is irrational what is the current status of the fw missions
the new stars are nice and it would be perfect if it werent for these nebula please allow us an option to disable these i am so rediculously sick sick sick of seeing themplease pretty please
ahand so it beginsdominion hasnt even been out for a day and folks are already complaining and coming up with socalled improvements
to be fair the ability to disable the nebulas and to make space actually black has been on the wishlist of many players for years since space actually looks nice now the nebulas are just even more annoying
i agree the odd nebula etc looks ok in the distance but cloudy space just annoys me i want space to be spacey black
cant agree more
back in rmr there was a bug to where the nebulae would disappear things looked really cool for about 5 minutesafter that with every system looking exactly the same it started to get very boringi like the nebulae now

yes pleasethe harsher and colder space seems the better
warning actual science content aheadthe eve cluster would be brighter than the space were used to seeing in our night sky for the simple reason that the stars are packed more closely togetherive looked at things like the jump calculator website and there are actually stars within a light year of each other in eve  that sort of closeness doesnt happen in our stellar neighborhood our closest neighor is something like 4 ly away  in eve you can run into literally a hundred stars in that distancenow where goodness gracious do all of these stars come from you guessed it  all those nebulae you folks are complaining about stellar nurseries and all that blah blah blah astronomical stuffthe end result of all of this is you have a lot more light per unit volume and a lot of things to reflect that light which means sapce actually should look brighter than we mere earthlings are used toleave the backgrouns alone and address an actual problem  like fleet lag isk selling and the database crashing at odd moments

ok i was going to bump the thread about not making dust 514 a console exclusive again but then i basically accepted that this far into its development cycle ccp isnt going to change their minds about such a fundamental decision so instead im just going to propose that dust 514 be kept a completely seperate game from evewhile the idea of dust 514 interacting with eve was initially intriguing making it a console exclusive ruins it while its obvious why ccp is making it on consoles getting a slice of the huge and immensely profitable console market its also the single most effective way there is of ticking off eves massive and dedicated player base tying the fate of the deepest longestrunning most communityintensive and most outright hardcore mmorpg there is to a shooter community is dangerous enough but a console shooter community what were they thinking apart from dollar signssince eve players are to the last man pc gamers not necessarily exclusively pc gamers im a console gamer myself but you have to at least be a pc gamer to play youd think this would make dust a nobrainer pc title unfortunately no brains seem to have been used here if dust is going to have a significant effect on the eve universe then the kind of people we want playing it are the kind of people who play eve ie existing eve players not ritalinpopping 14year old xbox players who scream racist obscenities into their headset mike and ragequit right at the pivotal point of a critical operation or start teamkilling for the lulz pardon the stereotype but its a stereotype for a reason ie because its true pvp eve players either take the game reasonably seriously or get themselves spread all across space and theres no way we can expect this from console gamers who we wont even be able to communicate withso by all means make dust 514 a console exclusive but for gods sake lose the eve connection make it set in the eve universe if you want but dont make us reliant on console gamers for important matterssnobby pc elitist face facts we are elite eve is serious business compared to every other mmo out there and we dont want it damaged in any way
i really do not understand your problem for all i care i hire those mercs and if they do get the work done they get their pay if they dont i will find someone who can get it done i do not care if the are 14 or 41 years old as far as the business goes its that simplewhen i buy good in eve i do not care who is selling it as far as its not a scammer as far as the business goes neither do i care who i hire if they get the job done no support because flying internet spaceships has never been a more serious business

signedany one of the following implemented will suffice1 no self destruct when in combat2 longer self destruct based on ship size3 self destruct timer appear under the ship ala plex capture or ecm timer4 move the message out of the combat messages so it is actually visible5 no insurance on self destruct when initiated in combat6 loot drop on self destruct not yet read a good reason why not
support
what reason is there to selfdestruct outside of combatwhy insurance when out of combatid think one of the main reasons for sd is to prevent the opponent getting any lootthe other probably to deny the killmail personally i wouldnt mind a killmail where it states that sefdestruct was initiated and completedi see no reason why an sd should give loot its not a pinata youre not guaranteed to get something
hows about if you contributed to the cause of a persons selfdestruct an item drops that has the description ofi helped cause someone to selfdestruct and all i got was this tshirt
not supported because i have a better ideajust make it so that a ship which selfdestructs while engaged in combat gives a killmail and full loot drops as normal simple
you know this nerf is even worse than i originally thought it was going to beswapping the gun rof bonus for the missile one was bad enough but also nerfing the damage bonus back down to 5 which might i add wasnt mentioned in the patch notes is just plain cruel i doubt the ship is even worth the mineral cost anymoreplease for the love of all thats holy look at the naglfar again and undo this travesty of a modification
1i support this messagethe naglfar trainning time is already ridiculous but now its even worst all you got is a mediocre ship with lesser bonus than the before the fix i found innaceptable and somebody already express that point is the lack of logi
i have not the slightest interest in flying a naglfar but im still with you guys this is stupidid like to hear an official explanation from ccp attempting to justify this crap in the face of all this public opposition itd be amusing to see what warped twisting of logic they can apply to mangling this ship so badly again
although ive already been beaten to this by others reubtting this point before me ill put my money in anywayyoure wrong period because youre making the fundamental mistake of thinking of the caldari as the kinetic race caldari and not the kinetic race theyre the missile race the same way that amarr are the laser race minmatar are the projectile race and gallente are the droneblaster race yes when theres a weapon which is used by all 4 races its acceptable to flavour damage bonuses to race i am referring specifically to bombs here but limiting caldari damage bonuses to kinetic missile damage only is the same as amarr ships only getting a cap use bonus to one type of their laser crystals minmatar only getting a damage bonus to one kind of ammo or gallente only getting a damage bonus to their thermal gallente dronesand incidentally why arent the vengeance malediction and heretic restricted to only getting a damage bonus to em rockets although i do find it amusing that the eris only gets a bonus to thermal missile damage but the eris has a screwy weapons system anywayof course youre not debating this point youve decided your position and will defend it to the death no matter how obviously blatantly provably wrong it is i think we need to call people like you imbalance denialists
even though the faction ships have been adjusted the vindicator is still lacking at its current state is by at least double in cost and double in training time to be too close to what you would get in a megathron navy issuei propose increasing the 25 damage bonus to large hybrid turrets and the 125m3 drone bay to375 to large hybrid turret damage and 150m3 drone baythis will make it the close in your face melting ship it is supposed to be it also makes it worth training a second race battleship skill to level 5
given that a ccp dev was following the testserver feedback thread already i am not sure you need this one
they expressed interest after they closed the feedback just because its done does not mean that its balanced i guess because they are done with motherships then they are balanced of course not
well motherships got reverted and i think the vindicator wasnt touched as the discussion started to close to the end of the cycle i would just say wait for dominion 11 and see what you get though for the first 12 weeks they will be busy with new bugs introduced in dominion i have opened 3 bugreports in the first night s

its been several years since the introduction of invention invention predates the introduction of the lp store while designing invention to have negative me numbers was originally meant to protect the margins of t2 bpo owners fewer t2 bpos remain in the game now the result of negative me bpcs has been a windfall for holders of high end moons albeit one that has received some nerfing of late i propose that a rp store designed in a similar manner to the lp be instituted rp points would be tradeable for bpcs and with the right decryptors and enough rps bpos this would apply only to t2 items current invention mechanics would be retained for t3
well ccp could always add jetcan and aggression mechanics to the tutorials teach them what canflipping is and the consequences of shooting back or taking from the can give the newbies the knowledge to defend themselves not some dumb mechanic that is not only exploitable but it takes away from what eve is a game of consequences
heres what i have a problem with that my friend is a blanket statement i can flip all the time yet pvp in lowsec and 00 about everyday but enough of that back to the matter at hand im not really sure how i feel about what you are asking on one hand i feel there should be a a system in place to prevent this from happening on the other i feel it should remain the same heres why many people dont know this but you cant flip cans in the newbie starting systems also when you go to take out of a flipped can a little pop up comes up and tells you plain as day that you can be attacked by proceeding now you cant say i and only people like me are able to flip cans because they dont know any better ive killed many a afk 8 month old player while doing this its one hell of a lesson to learn and could cost you hours of work that soon into the game but its a lesson that needs to be learned its horrible and they might ragequit but did we want that kind of person to playing anyways are we just going for quantity now not quality i love eve because of stuff like canflipping and i believe even if there is 110th of new players that see that and say wow you really can do anything in this game its not so bad so i suppose i cant support this eve has gotten the amount of players it has with how its working so far and if changing the rules to not allow this means letting 100000 new yet emoquiting players then keep it the way it is if thats the only thing thats stopping them from enjoying this wonderful gametldr version not supporting if it aint broke dont fix it
so you want them to be can flipped later on and lose a hulk instead of early and lose a retriever yeah im sure that will raise the subs
yes that there that is what makes eve great impervious people in a little bubble of invulnerability printing iskwe need more of this something like that new shocking undock message theres one guy out there that can shoot at you in the whole of eve do you think you should undock or sit here until the nasty timer has gone awayi think they should have a message pop somebody has tried to steal your stuff before it leaves your can would you like to withdraw from space pvp and keep your stuff yes  noyes this is really what eve needs more than anythingand you know what eve will get it to
im ambivalent as a miner can flippers are not my friend however this is eve eves lessons are the school of pain compliance it hurts a little now but its for your own goodon the one hand it is a game with a ludicrous learning curve i was blind when i first came in you see the interface you can do all the things in there but you have no vague clue what it means or why youre doing it in that context can flipping a new subbie is very unkind they barely saw all the dialogs before they hear loud noises and all of as sudden their pod is blinking amidst the rubble of their once shiny space ship you could ask the can flipper do you really need to do this what went wrong in your life that ruining someone elses game became a fun thing to do especially someone who really has no clue yet what its all about im not saying they should get away with everything but ninja please cut them some slack alreadyon the other hand this is eve the can flipper is a first valuable lesson of the rules that apply in the universe bad things happen to good people the kind of personality that will whine about losing their 30k isk ship is going to be a problem in their future corp its a harsh place we need resilient personalities my first hour experience in eve was being podded by a gate camper if losing a ship is too much of a burden to bear eve is not the right place to be it smarts certainly more so when it was an expensive ship but it is a reality of the game thats how it works if a new player cant accept that eve was not their best choice of mmogstill seeing as how can flipping can occur when one is really new and green as grass some kind of warning might be offered someone might be totally ok with the harshness of the game once they understand some of the basic rules being stomped on the second hour in just isnt going to be fun a new player is also not going to call on friends for help he doesnt know anyone yeti believe can flippers have cost ccp a significant amount of business already new players are asked to accept that they can be lured into a trap an accepted game mechanic and to be shot at by experts against whom they have no shadow of a hope of defending themselves lots of people just wont take it and quit before they get a real feel for the gametldr i dont like can flippers the mechanic should stay in the game the really new player should be informed in consummate fashion that this is not myfriendlypony land the spaghetti will hit the fanab
that would be finebut theres already a warning that pops up
theres a warning that pops up for the flippor but not the flippeetrash in space can be taken by anyone and yes you might become aggroed for it but it is taking something you dont ownthe problem is that the jetcan miner who was taught this method that isnt supported by eve doesnt understand how jetcans worki disagree with the idea of giving the miner a chance to withdraw i think that by putting that jetcan out there theyre already subscribing to the risks of thefti think the learning curve is ridiculous and having to learn these little lessons will become aggravating to new players if not already i think the only good solution here is to make a warning splash popup that says something like the following
are you talking about the null sec where people are scared of the afk cloakers also what is real pvp i though pvp was when you interacted with another player in some way that removes things from hisher possession be it isk minerals market share hisher ship you know hisher stuff and not always with their consenti have always been of the mind set of learning by doing the new people will learn not to shot by doing it the first time they get can flipped learn at the start of your eve life when you are in a frig then later when you are in a bigger and more expensive shiplets leave it the way it is its called tough love treating another person harshly or sternly with the intent to help them in the long run
eve has enough subscribers ccp doesnt need to dummydown the game to get more i got here just fine with the way things are anyway why would i want newbies to think that theyre protected everywhere they go the whole point of eve is that there are no rules only laws laws can be broken without being banned from the game why teach newbies otherwise
its a harsh old universe out there full of pitfalls for the unwary if you fix can flipping for new players when are they going to learn and what will you fix next if being killed by a flipper turns them off eve then its not the game for them
before this degenerates into a flame waroh too late anyway can flip restrictions are already enforced in starting systems doesnt fix the problem but helps in the little way ccp wants it to
not really ccp gave you exactly what you asked for here i think it is you that missed the point

ccp removed all the changes we wantet abrathur and replaced them with what we didd not want  nozh  and after we complained about nozh changes they removed them all and have refused to answer anyone in any post about it
with the advent of the fleet finder i was wondering if we could step it up a notch what i am proposing is a realtime graphical fleet representation tool for the fchere is how i think it should workthe fc can pull up a map that shows all of his fleet members positions in space their current hp their ship type and any hostile forces in visual rangethe map would look like a simplified version of the system map and if fleetmates are in adjacent systems the map would connect the systems at the gatesif fleet mates are not in adjacent systems the map will show a dotted line connecting the two outgates of the system according to the autopilotfleet members and hostile forces show up as colored iconsperhaps it would even be possible to give someone in the alliance or corp a role that allows them to see all fleets that are deployed and their relative positions
positions of fleet members in system map just got removed as they never really workedhostily position should not be on the map at all thats why you got scouts
good grief why are we being forced to bump a topic which alreqdy has this much support again
discrodia please allow me to throw my 002 isk into this idea with some of my ideas and some numbers first the current mechanic uses defender missiles these missiles are no more than ammo to fit in any existing launcher that automatically track and chase down incomming missiles the damage that these defender missiles is 70hps of explosive damage and travel 7500 msec base before skills and mods lets look at the targets of the point defense weapons rockets 70hp  2250 msecstandard missiles 70hp  3750 msecheavy missile 70hp  3750 msecheavy assault 70hp  2250 mseccruise missile 70hp 3750 msecstandard torps 280hp  1500 mseccitadel torp 1920hp  1100 mseccitadel cruise 1920hp  3500 mseclightheavycruise fof missile 70hp  3750 msecnow the proposed weapon needs to be able to track a target flying right at it i would recommend either 3 sizes of weapons small medium or large or ammocrystal in the same sizes for existing guns obviously using existing guns and a special ammo would be mirroring what is already in place assuming this using high rate of fire high tracking weapons ex pulse lasers autocannon projectile either blaster or gatteling rail gun for hybrid using small turrets should be best to track the fast moving rockets standard missiles these should have no more range than 10km and should take only one solid hit maybe two per missile taken down using medium turrets should one hit heavy or cruise missiles and need multiple hits to take down standard torps with about a 1520km rangeusing large turrets should be able to take out a standard torp and take at least 3 shots to hit the citadel torpscruise missiles to help with balance the large turrets should not be able to track anything faster than a missile traveling at 1150 msecalso the medium turrets should not be able to effectivly take down standard torps or capital missiles this would lead to small turrets being used for most of the work with their limited range and only being able to take out maybe 23 missiles per turret would still offer a good deal of protection example of ammo for a small turretdefender small projectile ammo35 kinetic 35 explosive range bonus 50 charge size small tracking speed multiplier 150usable only in small autocannon projectile weaponsas far as the rest of the ammo it would follow the same line and just scaled up for the increase in size of the targets if you want to take out drones or frigs use standard small turrets or your own drones if able imo i hope this helps a little
minmatar splitweapon ships start out with 2 strikes against them firstly that you need to use bcus as well as gyros to get full damage bonuses secondly that the second bonus which only affects half your weapons takes the place of a real second bonus such as those gained by other ships technically the typhoon only has one bonus which is already 5 per level to large projectile and missile rate of fire this makes it a blatantly inferior ship to its closest equivalent the armageddon which gets bonuses to both cap use and rof the scorpion and dominix are different ships altogetherim with the op split bonuses that do the same thing only in a more inefficient manner make no sense its just bad ship design
supported
would be nice i understand lore reasons why the minmatar have split weapon systems but i dont understand why the bonuses cant be merged wheres the harm in that
id prefer gyros to give a 85 boost to missile damage its a small change but makes up for the weakness in split weapons systems without having to rebalance the minmatar ships whilst not challanging bcusim supporting the proposal because i think something should be done
the volume given for an exotic dancer singular a db error making them plural is for more than the body that is being transported that volume also takes into consideration the requirements of life support and little else think sleeper coffin or suspended animation vat
hey look i like a good backside but huge is not my thing however my meaning is there are lots of small things that many people would consider insignificant or irrelevant all i am suggesting is a one person intern even to take on the role of the boring bit of sensible database housekeeping small revisions nothing big but just such that little things start to make sense lets face it if they cannot get something that trivial right what does that imply for the rest of the data all our beloved items are founded onthat i would accept as a measure for the volume required to transport one dancer stasis chamber plus luggage less volume could also be assumed if one was to just dump them in the hold with no amenities assuming a dancer is approx 17m x 03m x 04m  25 shape factor  0153m3however this was just an example an obvious one i though we could all relate to in some way as being nonsense data for for the item entryto say that the weight of the cargo is irrelevant is well wrong as you add payload mass or weight to the ship you will directly affect the global mass of the ship itself and thus the performance of the ship both in maneuverability and accelerationzirk
yes this is completely far fetched and probably too early to even propose but what the hell i think wormhole dwellers should eventually be given the option to spend fuel on perhaps an outpost that accompanies a pos within this outpost players could dock in their pods and exit their pods to a meager space outpost perhaps the luxury of these outposts could vary with price and fuel expenditure needless to say unknowing whether or not the technology would even allow this i think it would be sweet
yes ccp i want to anchor an outpost and build a titan inside my wormhole systemwhat happend to the sandbox 
has anyone noticed that the inbox tab and the all mails tab are exactly the samewhen you click on your inbox there is no way to separate out your personal mails from your alliance and corporation mails the only real way to differentiate the mails is to look on that column on the right side of the mailboxthis seems a bit counterintuitive i petition that the inbox be allocated solely for personal mails received and that alliance mails and corporation mails not be shown in this menu thats what the all mails tab is fori notice that every mail that come into your mail system is automatically tagged with an inbox label it would be great if your alliance and corporation mails did not have this inbox label associated with them that way you dont have to manually deselect the inbox label from all of your alliance and corporation mails
go to the corp label  mark all mails  right click  remove label  inboxsame for alliance and mailinglists and suddenly the inbox is more readable
i knew this was going to come up and it is a very valid fix for the problem except for one thing every single mail that comes into your mail system is marked with an inbox label this label forces every mail that comes in to be dumped into the inbox labelfor an example you can go through your corp mail and select all of them and deselect the inbox label from all of them this is all well and good except when you receive a new corp mail this new corp mail gets dumped into the inbox label this forces you to go back into the corp label and select the new mail and then deselect the inbox label from the new corp mailheres the thing why not have all of the alliance mails be only labeled with the alliance label and all of the corp mails only get labeled with the corp label this way the applicable mails go exactly where they are meant to go and the personal mails dont get mixed up forcing people to micromanage their mail
after installing dominion i noticed that the 10 corp tax was then being hit with a 50 tax on agent payoffs and big ratkills can anyone tell me what the deal is

make the new lack of borders around buttons optionalthis new design with the narrow gradients and the lack of visual distinction between elements is causing unneeded eye strainplease allow me to turn the borders back on as eve is currently making my eyes go all funny i cant play for any more then 20mins at a time like this
except that defenders can be launched from rocket launchers which have a much higher rof than cruise launchers also since most people group missiles nowadays and defenders deal more damage than a single missiles hp a single defender kills 1 cruise missile plus a percentage of the next so no you dont need nearly as many missile launchers to counter a missile boata lot of work would have to go into making defenders both useful and not overpowered
those resists are the same as those on the vulture and you dont hear people complaining about that we can always tweak the rest of the shield numbers if theyre too overpowered anyway i never did have a great head for stats its just an examplewell i was just bothered that there wasnt a t2 bshulled main battle ship neither the marauder nor the blackops ships are really made for battle the marauders are optimized for pve while blackops are well the name says it all neither can be unqualifiedly stated to be simply better than a t1 bs in battle which makes them as t2 bss an outright bad choice because of their absurd cost yes a hac costs more than 10 times the price of its equivalent t1 cruiser hull so why do we see so many of them because theyre better i just want to see a better battleship i was just surprised that gargoyle hadnt already been taken i like the name paragon anyone have any suggestions for the hyperion and maelstrombased ships gallente ship names are fairly random but there seem to be quite a few based in latingreek so how about carnifex executioner yes i know we have a ship called executioner but its in latin so its ok right for the maelstrom id suggest the name stalker

thanks to all of you for your votes and more then a few interesting chats and ideas keep them coming
asolutely this site is a great tool helping the voters to sift through the candidates i am merely pointing out that your effort to create such a tool should encourage other such efforts aimed at improving the whole process my hat is off to you sir however one could also argue that even though sorting candidates by issues is more logical and straight forward focusing only on that aspect actually obscures the real purpose of the csm which is to influence ccps decisions correct me if i am wrong here  i am really guessing here based on observations alone but it seems that simply heaving strong opinion on any number of issues does not automatically win ccps attention i suspect that the more coherent csm is as a group the greater the chance of their success with ccp therefore ability to see the big picture and all those negotiations skills are crucial at every stage of this processof course so far csm in my opinion has been surprisingly effective but i imagine that their voice will get much stronger if more people vote and we have more skilled candidatesi sincerely hope that the preelection evaluation process to which you have contributed greatly will expand in the future to include those vague skills as well in my experience defining the vague stuff is as important if not more important because in the end it leads to much greater transparency the more clarity the whole csm concept has the more voters and so onmy comment was not intended as a criticism of any kind i am simply trying to contribute based on my understanding
well you came close hopefully they will need an alternate again on this cms too bad there were so many tards who based their decisions on a ticker rather then research
thanks to all who supported me i came in as first alternate so its a pretty fair bet that i will get to do some work at least in this csm and ill certainly be running again for csm 5im certainly very encouraged that i polled so high without any official alliance support

as a caldari pilot heavily invested into covertblack ops and such i cannot stress how important it is to have the right tools the black ops battleship concept is fabulous the implementation is epic failjust in general there is no doubt that any t2 ship should have superior stats than its t1 base having subpar hp is inexcusable give them at least the same structure and armor as t1 if not more give them t2 resists i dont expect them to go toetotoe with a golem or rohk that is not their role but they are battleships for crying out loud not battlecruisersthe role is called black ops they are supposed to drop ships in behind enemy lines follow wreak havoc then get everyone the hell out why do they not have covert cloak when every other ship in that role does another fail make it happenjump gate range is too short 1 or 2 jumps for range is totally fail may as well just use the darn gates oh wait no covert ops cloak failprice tag  chaching  are you kidding no one flies these not because they are hard to produce very rare or even difficult to find but because they suck with so little demand for them why are they still so expensive manufacturers should be giving these away by now slash prices to increase purchase incentive more folks will buy them and perhaps find more inventive ways to use themfail x4  epic fail these issues can be fixed easily so lets make it happen
yes please eve is practically renowned for eyestrain end that
i would say some minor changes at least no need to overhaul the whole freaking thing also letting us choose our font perhaps
it wasnt widely supported  the ab role bonus in place of a 4th bonus ie it wasnt a role bonus they put it at a 4th bonus was pants on head ed
af dont need much but they need a buff for the price of a af hull you can buy and fit a few cruisers that are in almost all ways better than a afa hac does almost bs sized dmg and tank in a much smaller package for nearly the same price this should be the case with af give them a slight dmg and bonus fix and they will be back in line with t2
i didnt mean the ab bonus specifically although at least that gave afs a better defined role in heavy tackle i just meant any boost to them at all so that im not paying 25mil to do something i could do in better in a cruiser for maybe 5mil after insurance
notes the wiki pagerof penalty is fine as isbonuses changing  no a small pg buff all around  yeshp buff  yesdessies arent meant for knife fighting really theyre meant to swat frigs from afar as far as that goes theyre fine though cat could use its bonus changed to optimal and coercer could use a 20 cap use reduction instead of 10 hp give them roughly the hp of a tier 3 cruiser 19k armour and hull but not shield builtin hull resists would also be interesting this would also make them a little better at knife fighting not sure if this should propagate to dictors or not probably notalso give them another slot low for minniecald med for amarrgallmain problem with dessies is they dont have the survivability to hang with snipe hacsbsetc as far as the frig killing goes they die but one zealot takes a fancy to you and welp
yes please for the reduced sig boosted pg extra lows for cormorants and increased hp however i am begging you to change the cormorant to a missile boat and the catalyst to a drone boat or at least introduce a new t1 destie that can do that
i support better destroyers or another t1 hull
poor destroyers are so neglecteda sig radius decrease would be welcome too
not all ships need to be for pvp my cormorant makes an excellent salvager4 x tractor beam4 x salvagersalvage tackle x 3currently ab with mwd to comeit has its use  just not in combat
bumping again caldari navy hookbill now has 3 launchers which is all i ever wanted for christmas problem is rockets still suck
rockets need a fix they are sposed to be anti frig missiles but they fail for this af are fun to fly but you only are gonna pick a missile one up if you are gonna kill something much bigger in a fleet
any measure to throw sand in the cogs of isk sellers and improving account security can count on my supportill raise this for csm meeting 2wiki issue here
excellent and detailed suggestion tamber since you are an alternate and not allowed to raise issues i wish to raise it for you i have credited you fully in the wiki document ccp will see i wish i could give more than one thumbup for this but i cantwiki document here
i like this idea eve has needed something like this at least an ingame calender for the corp for a long time
i searched and could not find a csm post on this topici would like to propose for further discussion the battle recorder i forward ninjaholics thread in features thread as it contains all the information neededbattle recordera summarya battle recorder that retains info on ship actions modules etc that does not record audio and video itself but reproduces it within an eve client or similar program if eve client itself can not be rigged pun to do this i request the csm and all interested in such a recorder to throw their support behind this and please encourage ccp to place this firmly on their develpment future
this is a good idea and if it could be done without massive server overloading it would be a very useful tool for newscasts or for movie making the ability to view a battle from any view and full camera movements would be uberbeing able to share your flightdata with others and sync their data with yours for a more complete picture would be sweet thanks to csm4 for supporting this idea and for taking it to ccptamber

1 corps should be able to grant medals to players outside the corp the reason for this is that alliances can then give medals to their members without having to recreate the same thing over and over in all member corps ceos could also award people with medals for services rendered without requiring them to join the corp already brought this up last year and ccp said they would fix hopefully within the year well the year is almost over and i dont see it happening any time soon do it now especially when we get spacebook it would be nice to see the medals there with the twoway contact lists we get in the future medalgriefing which ccp used as excuse not to implement this soon can be prevented by only making medals grantable to people that acknowledge you as friend2 medal text should be changable for a fee right now the only option is to make a new one and have the borked medal clutter the medal list for all eternity3 medals should be deletable to prevent clutter and revokable dishonorable discharge hand in your medals4 minor bug and reported but ccp said working as intended when a player deletes a medal from his list it wont disappear and actually clutter the array for all eternity in addition the medal cant be granted again fix this

i already brought this up with the current csm board but ill post it here for some thumbscurrently individual players can sort their assets by many criteria though it could certainly be betterunfortunately corporations which can very well have considerably more material than individual pilots cannot sort their deliveries or other corporate assets in any wayi would like that this functionality be brought to corporation assets at the very least sort by regionconstelationsystem running around picking up market goods is a complete pain in the ass with the deliveries tab as it is now
badly needed ever so much
if there is any change it could be fixed so t2 ships didnt pay out less than their t1 ver
your wish is granted all t2 ships pay out considerably more than the t1 version generally about 50100 more iirc note you will have to actually insure them to get the full payout
ive always found it amusing that the game has a race that is corporate run caldari and a race that is heavily involved in the entertainment industry gallente but ingame marketingadvertising is extremely subdued if nonexistent not even a ticker in stations if for no other reason than rp there should be ads in the gamewhere would advertisements bethe easiest solution is to have it interspersed with some form of ingame news in the game lets be blunt as nice as it is to have the occasional news story from isd they are simply too few and far between for a game with as much going on at any given time as eve even if it was nothing more than system generated announcements ascn titan destroyed in c9ncc or goons pl it battle in 3in0v 631 ships destroyed showing up in a ticker for everyone ingame would improve the general recognition across the player base of what is going on in evethose are just the events that should probably be broadcast across the game it would be nice to have local news announcements as well the smaller the scale of the event the more localized the news announcement would be obviously announcing locally every time a ship dies in a fleet battle would be silly so there would have to be some delay to some announcements so the system can have time to gain perspective on the eventthat knowledge would serve several purposes it would increase player interaction see pvp as such events would attract people to the location of something that is happening it would potentially help retain new players as they generally dont have the foggiest clue of what is happening in the game until someone tells them  and eve is heavily focused on being involved in something with other playerswho would advertise and whylow involvement in eve events corporations organizations and playermade services points to the fact that knowledge of such things comes by wordofmouth many things that are advertised in the forums are often only found by serious forumers or mentioned during inoutgame conversations there are so many things players have come up with that are missed by the vast majority of the playersone of the most glaring examples of this is the csm several people in my corp hadnt even heard of csm when i mentioned that it was the last day for voting if there was actual advertising ingame and by extension csm advertising i would be willing to bet voter turnout would be higher simply by the increased awarenessthe corporation finder that was added a while back was sort of a halfhearted advertising addition if corporationsalliances could promote in a visible way in the game finding a good fit in a good corporationalliance would be easiermy experience has been that i find out about most ingame events after they happen when wordofmouth gets around allowing people to advertise their event tournament lottery stock ipo whatever would significantly improve involvement in these eventsadvertising scale and costjust like rl the wider the audience the more expensive the ad is additionally things like the average system population would also be a good modifier for ad cost color coding the ads based on localconstellationregionaleve would also serve to give perspective on the ads as wellwhat about unwanted advertisingspamobviously there would need to be some way of flagging ads as inappropriate additionally the ability to customize advertising blocking ads by standing andor block lists would be importantone huge thing though is that ads would cost isk to get a mildly broad audience would require a more substantial amount of isk the larger the amount of isk the easier to track it back to its source goldisk spam would likely lead to ccp being able to track down who is doing it far better than they can with the current local spam in jita for instance
allow a corpalliance to advertise a news announcement basically trumpeting something they did or had happen to them to a wider audience than the news announcement would have normally gone toit might be nice to have a news announcement probably local for completing a story line mission  rp value at least i mean they are supposed to be important missionsfor militias a constellation or regional announcement that a claim bunker is being flipped might be a good news announcementfor 00 the same could be true but for sov  ie the claim unit is being attacked would be worthy of regional news i would think blockade units going up would probably be constellation news worthyalso if ccp ever decides to fix local which everyone hates in one way or another to something new that everyone will hate in one way or another the news ticker could be potentially be part of such a change simply announcing that a noticeable number of people have entered the system the local population doubles in a short period of time  or something like thatan example of where this would be a major change is jita jita should be like times square not this silly free local spam if people had to pay for jita ads there would be a lot less rattlesnake for 500m 1 unit tritanium spam not to mention the goldisk spam that can often completely clog local
get rid of the dumb timer between scans atleast make it 1sec
what about a cache you update the cache every 1 second but let people spam a local cache as often as they likeserver lag is reduced since you do not update every time you hit the button but it lets you scan practically constantly to help you narrow down the last known location fastersome people will bemoan the fact that with a cache you might locate someone but in actual fact they left 099s ago considering that they could leave the location within the few seconds that it takes you to warp there an extra second is not a huge difference
yes it isfw is for people who want to pvp whcih is great but missioning as it was allowed many people to earn over 100 mill an hour nowhere else is this possible i couldnt make this much isk in oo and the difficulty is much higher out therehaving pickable agents is a very bad idea and this seems like a good response from ccp
this is a public announcementthere is no nerfjust request accept quit request accept quit request accept quit request accept quit you only get standings loss when you decline missionsyou may now resume your farming activities
side note ccp is aware of the bug and will fix it 
i do not support the proposal put forth here for one single reason consistencyfw missions are still missions and should follow all the same rules and restrictions as other missionsthat means no cherrypicking of missions without penalty
lol  its not a bug is it they are just stupid and didnt change it
not supported the bottom line is that the ability to select which missions you will take without penalty is part of the pay out problem both the reward and the salad bar are interconnected you cant simply hold one constant and change the other right now fw missions allow for a iskhour rate that seems out of balance when compared to just about every other in game isk generation operation in as much as that is true fw missions need rebalancing and that effort should include all aspects of running those missions
love it it allows for alliancecorp fleets to know what people can do with out providing easy intel to enemies i say easy intel cause theres always char sheets and if the alliancecorp is very diligent they could create a database on every enemys capabilities not feasible though
should have been that way to begin with at least at the corp level
supported i would like to have my certificates posted for my alliance but would rather keep that information away from anyone else
yes
seems logical to me do eeet
to all ideas but at least the op one will get the ball rolling on more drone changesi like the reload one to the one right up there
yesmore ideas i liketotal ui fixa reconect to drones button or similler if you dcdrones are set on paper just need improved implimentation
implants that affect drones would be nice also we have implants for evrything else why not drones
im not really sure that a whole new ship is really necessary but a rig or something or give one of the existing mining barges a bonus for gas harvesting give gas harvesting some kind of love
more gas love ftw
give the procurer a boost with gas mining kill two birds with one stone
nice calculation youve got there but your forgetting one oh so important fact if this is introduced it will cut down the price for these gasses immensely as the market is not staticalso youre mining in a very hostile environment with only the scanner as your eyes i wouldnt want to do that afk for one risk vs reward comes to mindto opthis has been needed for a looooong time as the situation is comparable to the old way of mining in battleships way back either a gas strip miner or a specialized ship with compression abilities would be good

i agree with veshta that there are many things wrong with fw ankh has raised this particular issue in the past and i agree that the spawning system is borked and ccp should fix it as they promised to csm2 this issue was scheduled to be fixed right after apocryphafor the sake of continuity ill raise this issue for csm meeting 2wiki document here
plex spawning is not so big issue at allthere was at least 10 bugs related to fw and ccp managed to fix only one in dominion most of those bugs are somehow exploitable and people use those bugs to benefit everyday it is hard to say if they use it on purpose or is it just accident but ive seen many who do it on purposebut abusing bugs is not the biggest problem problem is that original planning of fw has so quite amazing things that are working as intended previous members of csm has not taken those things up at allfw needs lot of rethinking to make it work like players want we need at least better reason than rp to take systems so we get real fighting for systems now pvp in fw is just for fun and die for nothing
nothing like running a major for 10 minutes warping out to help a friend next system over to come back and seeing the plex has dissapeared only recently have i learned this is a bug or exploit depending on who and how it is used somehow warping out of a plex while within range of it while it is counting down causes it to bug and continue to count down but not giving any points plus not respawning until the next dtissues like these are all over this stuff is getting on my nerves how may hours have i wasted orbiting buttons or fighting wts to get a ing bugged plex days spent running plexes only to see your work undone one morning after dt by the opposite side running a few 40k stabbed frigates to despawn plexes and decontest systems having no more plexes to run where you want them notwithstanding the fact that work that takes dozens of man hours can be undone by alttabbing a new trial account every 15 minutes to move on to the next plexthen there was this isk printing machine called fw that we all abused to no end to farm their fix doesnt fix  and only frustrates more people by having them press an extra button essentially increasing mission browsing time by 50 every alt in eve can join fw and farm these missions now it takes no team effort just mindless farmingif ccp doesnt do anything about fw soon i may as well consider moving on for greener pastures where there are actually objectives and meaning to what you do in fw space you are treated as a second class customer where your game is not important enough to warrant a week long of dev work to fix a dozen bugs that have been documented and implement something into the game that players have proposed everywhere over and over again to make thing more enjoyablebugs npc imbalance dt spawn mechanics use of alts or gimmicks to run plexes fw mission farming to generate hundreds of billions of isk for night effort which destroys pvp because suddenly everyone can farm for carriers and has no time for fights and who is to blame them there is no reward for fighting besides the adrenaline rush and kms no objective besides a couple of words on the left top screen why spend 20 minutes fighting npcs in a major when you could be making 100mil isk in the meantime running missions sometimes with no risk as all you need is a cloaky stealth bomberdo something about this before it is too late and we leave lowsec for good
fully supported this is just one of the many problems in fw that could use some serious attention on the part of ccp
like evevoice can be enabled without turning on all the extra soundsso audio alerts should be able to be enabled without any other soundsan extra bonus would be the ability to assign audio alerts to a specific channel on a soundcardthis would allow users to of headphones route it to their speakers insteadat the very least give it a separate volume slider so that all other sounds can be turned down to 0

the npcs in fw need a defined role regardless of what role you envision for them they fail to fulfill it1 npcs of different factions add very different difficulty levels to complexesedit as i was told this is already being addressed  sorry for not being up to date there  the 2nd point remains2 npcs care too much about standingsthe fw complex npcs will not shoot you if you have high standings with their faction even if you are in a hostile militia in the actual primary hostile militia this is somewhat balanced by gaining standings fast for capturing complex and thus losing enemy faction standing fast so you can not do this for long but if you are in the off militia eg caldari for minmatar amarr for gallente etc you do not gain or lose standings for plexingthis leads to the situation where the most effective offensive plexing is done by a rookie alt with sufficient standings in the off militia as they can run offensive plexes without npc interference ie a t1 frigate is enough for even unrestricted complexes and as the off militia do not get any standings from plexing so do not lose that abilityi do not think that this is the way fw should be played so this game mechanic has to changeproposed solution have fw complex npcs shoot members of hostile militias regardless of their standings alternatively to diminish the ability of third parties to interfere have fw complex npcs shoot everyone who is not part of their associated militia or the allied militia if you need an rp justification hell you are trespassing on a very important military installation even if youre blue gtfo and yes im in one of those 3rd parties so ill hate that change but its a lot better than the current situation
first part has already been raised by erik finnegan in csm3 and will be fixedsecond part i agree with but i do think that allies should be able to capture eachothers plexes without being shot at by npcs
i must have missed that sorry for the curious here is the link i found
strongly supported the current situation is just ridiculous
aaaaah so thats why i saw damar hanging out with amarr plexers didnt know this was even possible supported
standings has been issue since begining of fwbeen used before to capfight in plexs by many me includeddoes need to be adressednow tha tdamarperv alts doing it on industrial scale in minnmataramarr space look forward to lack of any meaning full plex warfare as is situation in galcalthis is one reason why mr damar was unsuitable as a csm canidate
strongly supported without further need to justify why not just broken its insane and is currently exploited on an industrial level by said characters this will break the so far fair and working amarrminmatar factional warfareact fast please

working as intended c ankhesentapemkah
fully supportedand i know why this thread is here it is because it is what we do in matar space right nowhowever according to ccp and excsm members of zods party it is working as intended we asked ccp two months ago if this is exploit or bug and would they mind if we used it against matar answer was outright no go aheadnow let me state clearly this tactic is incredibly lame broken and stupid and in fact i feel dirty for doing itbecause we did not get our candidate into csm who would have wanted to fix the issues we dont belive ankhs party would since she was happy to use this tacticwe are simply going to make this issue so big and broken that ccp has to take action and correct the fw bugs this included which gallente still uses against us along with bug that causes friendly npc to open fire on friendly militia also used by gallente thank youdamar rocarionbrigadier general
forgot to check the support box oh well doing it nowagreed this is stupid mechanic and should be fixedid like to point out that ankhesentapemkah or eric didnt want to address this issue while ankhesentapemkah was using it to capture caldari plexes during her time in the gallente militia double standards ftw i guess
tbh this that sounds a little bit like you are whining andimho  makes you a hypocritenow we all understand that that is broken but neither the amarr and the matari were using it yet  that level so although this was broken you could have said that both sides were on an unspoken mutual agreement to not abuse this and try to play the game as intendnow because it is broken for your war you have to spoil it for the others who are trying to play the game as intended and out of their own will are not abusing the systemi do appreciate your support but tbh i would feel more supported if you would stop doing that
because we did not get our candidate into csm as i said this is why you lost csm people know what you are
the question whether a game mechanic is good or bad does not depend on whether it is unbalancing enough but on whether it encourages the kind of game play you want to have encouragedthis game mechanic encourages the game play where you create an alt get him high standings and then run offensive plexes in very cheap ships primarily avoiding pvp as its a very lowsp altthat does not seem like the kind of game play i want to encourage in fwhence this should be changed
stupidly broken mechanic is stupidly broken
agreed this needs to be fixed and with priority
thats the same response i got when i reported it as a potential problem so dont twist it on me i also reported it right from the start and got the same stupid reply by ccp as you did yeah this is working as intended go use itbut we all know that the only reason you use this bug is because your untrained alts cant deal with the strong minmatar npcs like they could with the gallente npcs and this is just a lame excuse npcs which you didnt consider a problem you always whined about me using it and now you use it yourself you are a hypocrite and you ruin the spirit of fw just like you did with your army of untrained alts and exploits to make timers count down magically on the gallentecaldari frontgo ahead and abuse this the sooner ccp will take away the broken plexing system completely and reset the systems to their original stateoh yes one more thing why is this issue a problem for you there is noone using this against you and if there was you can just capture everything back with your alts and timer exploits so the real reason is that you just want to screw up everyone elses joy in fw just like you guys always did selfish hypocritical and against the best interests of eve im glad you never made it to csm as you are totally unsuitableid like to point out that that was the only valid way and affordable for a solo player to deal with the caldari npcs as well as the alts and exploits used which mr damar thinks are perfectly balanced and working as intended
so why didnt you had any interest to fix it during your term in csm and quite contrary constantly bragged about using the standings to capture plexes to me when we chased you away from plexes this is a legitimate question and im sure you would like to answer to all those concerned about faction war in fact you said to me and pervs working as intended many times so now that we decided to do the same to show what is wrong in fw it is bugexploit in your opinion strange logic i must saydamar rocarionbrigadier general
but didnt think it needed to be fixed you could have done something good for fw for once after all you do take credit for fixing lag issues having something to do with lolbalanced fw missions etc etc surely you could have had this one fixed too i guess you were too busy taking the caldari plexes who is this mysterious we you speak of we do this because ccp doesnt react to a few individuals taking advantage of this we shall see if they care when a few more do itand how are you not a hypocrite i remember you bragging in local about this working as intended and so on well you didnt deny being a hypocriteyes we will just like you the only way how does this justify you using it how about making some friends i heard it can help you a long way
actually that makes you a hypocrite as wellif you used this you were ruining the spirit just like he is nowif you have found out about this and reported it thats good but if you continued to use this no matter if you want to proof a point or get an unfair advantage youre not better as any other common exploiterand i say exploiter as you see this as broken mechanism that needs to be fixed thus you are exploiting a broken mechanism according to your own standardsi hope this was meant to be ironic because before damar started playing the loophole amarr and minmatar were so far happy with their meaningless occupancy it was all driven my incharacterly driven pride and fun in having pvpjust because caldari and gallente got a broken toy and dont like to play with it they dont have to ruin it for the amarr and minmatar who were at least so creative to play with it even though it is broken if you in a general sense and only loosely aimed at ankhesentapemkah and damar got a problem with the state of fw adress it to ccpjust ruining the game for other is not proving a pointits just griefingso we got two hypocrites pointing fingers at each other pointing out that the other is a hypocritethis would almost be funny if you two wouldnt be ruining the game for others
this tactic is most efficient way to conquer all systemthis system shows what happen if you remove npc from plexes or make them inefficient like amarr npc is now our alts does not have to care about those at allthis method also proves that plex spawning is not an issue if you attack on whole area not only in 1 or 2 systemshere was only couple things what this can show but we all can learn from it if we wantfact is that this is legit method at this moment and every one knew it exists if minmatar was not prepared for it they can only look at mirrorand i find it funny how minmatar is crying about it while they had use some of the methods in caldari space on some scale all the timebut maybe all lame things are just ok if others does not use them against youwe did not invent any of these methods we just put them all together and made lamest machine in fw historyand last i want to thank ankh for making fw missions easiest way to grind alts for this operation and earn some nice amounts of lp what is ironic is that these lame traitor alts has millions of minmatar lp to use
surprise i did ask ccp to fix this just like i asked them to fix the cloaking exploit and the timer exploit and the whole plexing mechanics which basically encourages people like me to avoid pvp while they run plexes i used this tactic to become luminaire general and hoped this would wake up ccp and get them to fix iti told them that the current plexing mechanics of fw make it more profitable to use recycled unskilled alts which avoid pvp than to use established characters who fight over plexeswhy i bragged to you about it cause you were bragging about your own alts and exploits and because you were always smacktalking and insulting me rather than hearing me out and working with me to fix the issues that troubled fwdo you think i was in fw just for my own fun not really it was homework which ccp gave to me as part of the csm when i was in csm1 empyrean age was just released and ccp asked me to write a document about factional warfare i had tested fw on sisi before launch and saw it was released in a pretty incomplete state so i thought hey i can make a difference for these players if i specialize here none of the other csm seem to care i didnt have the knowledge of the game that the 00 players had and i just thought this was the best way to contribute to the community as i could so i signed up with amarr my favorite faction surprise learned the ins and outs became the first divine commodore and wrote a long document about the flaws of fwthe standings issue was noticed somewhere in june 2008 got together with some amarr players which i plexed with at that time and one of them reported it we got the reply that it was working as intended as it was a necessary evil which allowed allied militia members to be in the plexes if they met standing requirements i thought this was pretty stupid and mentioned it to ccp on the 22nd june 2008 they would look into it but didnt just like the other more important issues were never fixedccp introduced a new round of fixes at the end of july so i rejoined as gallente abused the standings to get max rank and wrote my second rather critical report the only time i joined for personal reasons was in december as i was hoping to get a medal for capturing the most sites this was the time where you encountered me and we got to hate eachother ccp organized that event later on and i rejoined the gallente to motivate them to plex for once never really cared about plexing and the system capturing business myself but since ccp had an event i thought i should be there to see how it went and provide feedback the average gallente turned out to be an ungrateful dck and had no interest in the event so i quit againit was here that i realized there was fishy stuff going on with the plex timers and how you guys were using alts and gaming the system also became painfully aware of the lag issues plaguing fw which i only remotely heard about and never thought much about used my influence in the csm to get ccp to fix the lag and fw mechanics problems did this through ccp directly as the csm voted down a lot of fw issues including the lag one as they didnt deem them important and wrote a new document about the problems with the fw plex mechanics as well as the npc imbalance issueswhen the gallente finally started caring about the plexes i joined eleutherian guard but we were put off by the overpowered caldari npcs your use of alts and all the exploits with the timers i finally managed to reproduce the timer exploit and reported this to ccp seeing no point in playing fw in this state i quit
could i ask all of you to move the discussion about caldari vs gallente the accusations of hypcrisy and other such stuff to a different threadthis issue deserves more than another derailed thread of personal dislikes
this we all know the pervs and damar are just a bunch of smacktalking griefers they dont care about this issue they just want to ruin the game theyre the goons of fw
finally some recognitionactually i personally do care and i dont see any other way to get this to ccps attention beside ruining fw
supportedwhile its still broken i might as well use it broken plexing mechanics are truly the death of fwtoss some lp for taking plexes while youre at it
you guys already ruined it on the gallentecaldari front so the reason for ruining the fun for the rest of the players is
mining currently faces a series of issuesbesides the awkward covetor skill requirementsthe biggest issue is the lack of interactionall the player has to do is lock and fire up the lasers the rest you knowthe truth is that it is boringi propose that mining is reworked to become more interactiveengaging and interestingmaking it require the player to do more things while mining will be a direct blow to macro miners thus increasing the income of real miners like myselfmany suggestions have been made such as laser frequencies and multi ore asteroids and many others that would help with the issues described abovei hope that you agree with me and that the newly elected csm will bring up this issue to ccpthank you very much for reading
have you tried mining with battleship i mined long time with maelstrom before i got skills for hulk that takes reflexes to mine with battleship with 8xmining lasers but it gives good yield and only hulk or covetor can compete with it in yield i mined to cans and used industrial ship with cargo expanders and cargorigs to empty those cansi got my cash for maelstrom when i mined long time with scythetry gas mining in wormhole space theres some true excitement you need probe launcher and probes for that
im going to say no to this i just dont like the idea of making it interactive i have a mining alt and i use it either when im reading studying for a class or rattingmission running on my main basically im not going to like anything that changes it so that i cant mine in eve and do other things at the same time
ccp have implemented this to a small extend in dominion but i would like to see the stations even closer to the moonsplanets
i would agree
i agree when i warp to a planet i want to feel like i warped to a planet not a really large moon with rings
supported
some space stations in eve are not that much smaller than the moons they orbit i believe the caldari food processing plant station not a specific place im referring to the 3d model of that name measures 95km long according to the data in the object preview window and it certainly seems that long next to a ship in fact i recall something in the lore that says the positioning of stations has to be carefully planned and monitored because their enormous mass can have noticeable effects on the orbit of moons same goes for titansso while the stations are in fact gigantic i agree that placing them closer to their celestial anchors would help create the dramatic effect the op talks about and that would be cool supportedjust keep in mind being closer to planetary bodies will inevitably mean a lot more warping through planetary bodies an experience that is as immersionbreaking as grand views of said planets is immersionbuilding
id much rather have the distance from the station to the planet be greater to reduce the possibility that you constantly warp through the planet to get anywhere i understand the lolrp of warping through solid objects but i dont want to be constantly reminded that planets are just a flat planar sprite with a pretty texture mapped to it
ive always thought the lore conveniently ignores this ingame phenomenon altogether because its not really how the devs imagine the tech in the eve universe working people have come up with excuses for why you are seen warping through solid objects in the game but ive never seen it mentioned in the chronicles or other canon can anybody link to some if it exists
make that 17199 km 3 for cheap optimizers but whose counting rightalthough im a miner i find myself not supporting most of ops ideas a good idea would be to reduce the ore reclamation from rat loot there must be other types of rewards that can be used as a substitute cant be all that hardone thing i do agree with is that the miners profession deserves some love and respect it takes time and money to get into a hulk and then you sit in a ship that you either tank and reduce the effectiveness of its primary mission or you fit it to be the best miner it can be and then youre flying a ship with the resilience of a wet paper bag the people with guns on their ships then feel good about themselves for having destroyed yet another ship that has no defenses thats just how they roll also most importantly you cannot get a better miner than a hulk there are more combat ships than you can reasonably name a purpose for with more on the way all the time there will positively be nobetterminerunderanycircumstance come on live a littleab
1 lol no eve is a sandbox remember 2 no eve is a sandbox remember3 its called an orca 4 fit a tank and watch local5 never encountered it fit an afterburner6 no the quantity you get from mission loot is insignificant
there are some really stupid arguments coming from both sides herefor those saying that fit an afterburner is an answer  try fitting one on a hulkanyway not supported
because it takes 1100th the amount of human input and attention that missioning does and missioning doesnt require that much to begin withif i can sit in a retriever and mine into a can while reading a book and only have to look up once every 6 minutes to move my ore into the can i dont deserve to make as much fine by me but then remove zydrine and morphite and probably megacyte as well from any t1 production costs other than maybe cap ships or such making it so an attempted selfsufficient minerindustrialist has to go into low or nullsec just to produce an emdamage missile or a kestrel or a punisher is stupid if you want rare ores to be exclusive then make them exclusively rare as required materials in production as oposed to extremely common but in small quantitiesalso i forgot to quote your post but in regards to your hulkganking issue deal with reduced mining output and fit a big tank you think hulk ganking is common see how long an untanked badger lasts in space in jita with 400600m worth of goods in it you arent safe mining hisec or not so fit a tank and those suiciders are going to find an easier target one where they can guarantee a kill instead of hoping

well they should just implement some sort of mercrating systemsilly micspamming mercs should become less wanted and receive less iskwhatever and good players should obviously cost more to hire because they are credit to team instead of just drooling around lobbing grenades everywherethis would also create some sort of competitive gameplay as large eve corps would obviously want good soldiers  while smaller would do with whiny little 14year oldsin addition better players would get to play against better players making less of the pr0 dominating complete nubtard syndrome that most fpss use
while i appreciate your passion in this and can understand your trepidations im afraid i dont share either i for one accept our coming dust warrior companions
you honestly think that ccp is going to alter the development of a game based on another thread about this noexcept for the 90 of us who own a console really no it isnt most of us couldnt care less since we own a console in addition to our computersprobably just the dollar signs really ccp is a company concerned with making moneyyou offer no reason as to whyyes all of ccps marketing research clearly fails before your immeasurable wisdom nice generalizationim not even going to go into all of the blinding idiocies that i could justify with that logic please think about what youve just postedsee aboveno lose that pcgamer sense of elitismgood lord eve online is not serious business eve online is a video game give it up and try and understand that ccp despite what you may think probably actually did do some thinking and marketing research before making their decision
i see that not a single person yet supports thisthat makes me happy
as long as eve is not dependent on dust 514 no dice as long as i can  around with out having to worry about planet control unless i subscribe to it just like fw no need to worry unless i join it
ridiculous proposal from a foolish personseriously man look at yourself being a snob about what kind of video games you playvideo games
within the boundaries eg not forgetting that eve is a internetspaceshipgame  i also agree that eve is elite over other mmorpgand unless one is a wowkiddy who recently started eve that should be the general concenseif dust514 doesnt change important things in eve its ok  otherwise supported 
so then well mark you down as supporting this since important is a subjective measure and can be safely ignoredas for me im fine with dust being connected directly to eve make them influence one another give us the ability to be used as fire support in orbit around planets  is that new pvp potential i smell let them be able to issu out contracts for space superiority operations around worlds theyre fighting onin short interlace them so closely together that to the gamers they truly became one integrated unit not two separate entities joined by a lolsov calculation
sorry to ruin your happy you uronksur are a idiot1 where did you get your statistic did you know 90 of statistics are made up on the spot fits your well2 you make more generalizations then he dose and then you turn around say he dose lol3 to use your own words you offer no reason i think you forgot the import part of a debate or argument you try to prove someone else wrong by offering new views besides just ripping theres apart it shows creativity by doing so and intelligencefinally i agree with the poster to have worries that a kid as hes said earliar in his sterotype which is dead on sterotypes exsist because there often true in real life i happen to be a black male hat loves my chicken ribs and watermelon and yes i do have a extra muscele in my leg but i dont like obama hilary should of won for woman have be oppressed longer then any race or creed his fear to feel that a xbox kid could destory in three days what took him or anyone else 3 years to make is disturbing i pay for monthly fee here but not on ps3 and too think my now hundreds of dollars could be destroyed by a one time 50 dollar buy is hard to swollowdeveldrinin short interlace them so closely together that to the gamers they truly became one integrated unit not two separate entities joined by a lolsov calculation cool but not when im paying a monthly fee and ps3 isnt xbox on the other e hand all i have to say is haha line bills pockets with your service fee like i do ccpoh and to fuel you forum trolls i do live in my moms basement as she helps to take care of me after i got disabled in the war and wife left me for my best friend why i was deployed flame that truth and it still hurts literlay ps sorry for the typing harder now adays
i know its called common sense do you really believe that the majority of eve players or a significant fraction dont also own a consolei applaud your managing to provide examples i dont see any i dont have to provide reasons since im not the one advocating a change my reasons are the same as ccps it expands the eve universe to the currently untapped console market potentially generating more subscriptions from console gamers who might have otherwise never even considered subscribing to eve onlineno stereotypes are not often true by your logic you must believe all asians are math prodigies all african americans are predisposed to violence and hispanics are unintelligentstereotyping groups based on popular opinions is foolish and no proof whatsoever that it will happen beyond his own sweeping negative generalizations about console gamers i fail to see how anyones experience as a capsuleer could be negatively impacted by the addition of mercenary infantry they arent getting the full gameand they wont be playing eve online hearsay and do you think that saying that lends your argument any more weight or makes it any less stupid
ive always imagined that with the implementation of dust we will see control of sov changing from some random station or flag in space to control of the actual planets and the population on those planetsof course to take over a planet it would take thousands probably even millions of soldiers i always imagined that players in dust would just be some of those soldiers even if they were elite soldiers they wouldnt really have much of an effect in a battle where one side already had a major advantage although they could turn the tide in a battle where both sides were evenly matchedanyway that was just my thought and in that case it doesnt matter if they are 14 year olds screaming obscenities since all i have to look at is the results and if they suddenly raged and started killing people on their team than the thousands of npc soldiers from both sides would end up trying to kill them although that would be interesting to see if an alliance could get some spies in that would switch sides at crucial moments in those evenly matched battles

i support this topic and raise it for csm meeting 2wiki document here
uhm this has been remedied at least as the patch notes sayfaction booster charges can be sold on the market
yes but there are a lot of other mods that cant im not sure if adding all items to market would be an improvement ammo  charges yes but all factiondeadspaceofficer mods no i would rather see them improve on the contract system for that
i would like to point out the fact that the csm made this change possible and then what happens one patch later the devs change it back thats just down right insultingwhat power does the csm have if its changes dont stick the csm is useless if this change stays
no need for words
i wanted to raise suicide ganking again as almost all csms in the vote match agreed to remove insurance from gankers and a lot of csm found this a hot issue however i couldnt find a thread that isnt a total onesided whinesuicide ganking has already been brought up by ankhesentapemkah twice in the past first because it was too easy to pull off resulting in a quicker concord response time and had too little consequence sec hit was increased and based on system security and the second time because players were boarding ships in space which allowed them to continue ganking when at bad sec status ccp said that they wanted more permanent consequences for suicide ganking being kicked from npc corps having a criminal record etc and i think that the current fixes have been pretty bandaid however the issue is a complex one and should be looked at from all sidesin the interest of the eve community id like to see a discussion on this topic do you believe suicide ganking is a problem or too easy or is it almost completely preventable if the player isnt stupid enough to put too much value in weak ships and doesnt use autopilotdo you think suicide ganking is done for profit or just to cause grief what is your opinion on suicide ganking used as means for eitherwhat role does insurance play even if insurance is removed there is always the option to use recycled alts in destroyers to continue ganking what do you think of thisplease discuss and please keep it civil i will raise this issue the next meeting but the discussion will be monitored after that and relayed to ccp
it is almost completely preventable and players who take precautions to avoid becoming a victim of it should be rewarded for the additional effort andor ingenuity nerfing suicide ganking too much read making it so uneconomical as to be pointless or extremely rare would really take away an important element of the nowhere is truly safe maxim of eve ive been suicide ganked and lost an epic load of isk to the practice once mostly because i was stupid i take steps to never repeat the mistake if nobody was there to gank me that time id still be making the same dumb mistake hold on to every wisp of the games cutthroat atmosphere in rp terms you can chalk it up to pod pilots gone mad with powerimmortality who fly in the face of concord and the wardec mechanic to pirate in hisec its a strange tragic and yet to be reconciled side effect of creating a race of immortals and then trying to tie a leash around their collective necks whilst still in the nursery
well i think that anyone can be reasonable about the insurance payout if i drove my car through someones house with the intent to kill him would by insurance company pay for that damage there are a lot of insurance companies that list what they do not pay for i think this is the answer for whether or not it could be brought under control should be or should not its a matter of economics if you can suicide gank a freighter with say 300m isk of stuff and you use several battleships that get concorded in the process equaling 300m and you lose around 50m isk after payouts then there is still a profit that alone is cause for it and in that aspect there is too much on the side of the ganker but whenever i think of changes in a game like this i must think of enhancement while changes to insurance might relegate suicide ganking to a more strategic or tactical goal killing an enemy corps one freighter or stealing their bpos or their ammo overall changes to insurance to affect everybody could make the game more interesting as wellwhile we reasonably presume that its odd to pay out insurance for ships lost in commission of criminal acts changes to insurance should not be just to screw the pirates perhaps insurance adjustment rates based on the pilot as well lose more ships pay more insurance  until perhaps such point is reached that you are no longer insurable this would certainly light a fire under pilots both old and new to be more careful be it missions or pvp it adds to the riskrewardconsequence aspect of this game as well fly well and you pay less insurance for better ships fly poorly and you pay more for less insurance would only be affected for actual loss of ships that were insured to begin with so those who want to get 20 cheap t1 ships blasted out from under them every day will not become uninsurable as for being avoidable this suicide ganking i see that the people who make their game doing it will harp constantly that its avoidable yes afk pilots slowboating with an expensive load of loot may deserve it but i have seen cases of people getting popped the moment they undocked this was not from war targets or in low sec throw in some lag and there is no defense at alland one more thing many who enjoy the status of poor security ratings boast about it and denigrate all those other players who are still in high security space or base there since the criminals cannot fly a ship in high sec they have no reason to be there why then would the gates even allow them to jump barring them from high sec that they despise so much would be like a badge of honor no
bottom line is there is not a single ship that cant outlast a suicide gank when fitted properly suicide ganking has already been nerfed to a point that things are unrealistic from a rp pointofview and things are way too letsbabysitthecarebearssotheystopwhining from a mechanics pointofview concord response times are almost instant even in 05
much though i find the practice loathsome it is one of the things that make eve the getdraggedbehindthecaroveragravelroad experiencethere are extremely reasonable and lucid arguments to be made to ban this practice or the next to take some of the bite out of the game but you know something i dont want that eve was built to be a morally ambiguous place where the game mechanic allows for horrible things to happen to nice people for no sensible reason much like that other crazy place the one they call real life have you heard about it the graphics and sound are fabulous but the respawn rate sucksif the bad behavior is reduced to a semblance of bad behavior ie somebody shows you a scowl and wags their finger instead of really walking up to you and shooting you in the face then its eve no longer then were on the long tragic road to world of warcraft land where you can be as dumb as you want to be theres no real consequence for stupidity thats not what i came to eve for i came to eve because i read the story of the person who got screwed out of a titan and the game designers said yeah if you dont pay attention that can happen deal with itsince suicide ganking in concord space is criminal behavior there should be an appropriate penalty for choosing to do so though not disproportionally so the cost should not all be for the person being ganked the ganker should by all means pay the price of their choice theyre big on that they want to have the choice ok fine now ante up removing insurance seems like a very sensible step oh you wanted to drive your car into the wall and now you want us to pay for it well im afraid i might have some bad news for you however the risk of it should not be taken away or be reduced to meaninglessnessobviously when the player moves to 04 and lower security space everything that happens happensi am very much inclined towards preserving the original intent behind the design eve was intended to be a dark morally ambivalent place that felt raw it should remain that way all the sensible and wellthought out arguments of why the game should be tweaked just a little bit you know for the newbies to me screams soccer mom in an suv for the love of the god of your choice dont do that to me sure it means the suicide ganker is going to be a featured appearance so be it deal with itab
suicide ganking should not be removed from the game  i think it plays a valuable role in keeping the hard edge that eve online is infamous for and trying to remove it from the game is a mistakethat said i also think that people should have to think long and hard before they pull the trigger on that gank the people who are doing it as pirates are looking for an economic reward in return for the activities the ones doing it for the lulz are the ones that need to be reigned in imothe fine line that needs to be walked is the one that discourages the second group while maintaining the economic incentives for the first
suicide ganking is a problem someone suicide ganks are most prevelent in freighters but really flying a freighter with tens of billions of isk unguarded in even high sec is dumb 1 would you walk down the street in the bad part of town carrying million of dollars in cash even if there is a police station there2 whens the last time you saw someone get suicide ganked in their faction ship almost neverive been a target of suicide ganks a few time and i dont even care they just end up losing isk and standings and then failsuicide ganking should remain a part of this game if you put 12b isk in a shuttle and even get locked your an idiot
id be satisfied with nothing more than the insurance being removed it wont stop suicide ganking it will merely slow it down if you haul pricey cargo that can cover a lost ship destroyers are dirt cheap after all you can still expect that someone might try frying youbarring that closer examination of recycled alts which was called an exploit long ago when people were making suicide alts for smartbombing mackinaws resulting in them receiving a hp boost most gankers are just recycled alts because its easy and effortless but for a bit of skillingone caveat would be that insurance would still pay out if concord barbeques someone thats in your gang happens to rr ships now and then when they hit the wrong button suicide gankers are typically not in a gang with their targets
if you want to make insurance more realistic then by all means go ahead realistic insurance companies would not pay out for suicide ganking losses sure but then they wouldnt pay or for nearly any losses that occur in eve it would be simpler to just remove insurance altogether alternatively you could support my insurance reform proposalempire must have some risk if only to prevent it being overrun by hauler macros the player who is not afk who is skillful who properly fits an appropriate ship to move his cargo who avoids the obvious routes to major hubs should have a significant advantage of the player who does not remember that suicide ganking is not an accident it is deliberately designed in to the game if it has become more prevalent because of player actions then so be itif you want to remove the risk from suicide ganking fair enough what are you going to replace it with a greatly improved wardec system would be a good start but that still leaves the issue of alts in npc corps
removal of insurance no only basic insurance maybeit will increase the cargo value threshold for pro gankers a bit while not being a major disadvantage for newbie mistakeshowever a total reform of the insurance system would be a better thing
why not tie the price of an insurance policy to two things 1 the characters security rating and 2 the number of outstanding policies the character already has characters with security ratings below 00 would start to see marginal and then significant increases in the cost of insurance as their rating fell  to the point of uselessness around 25 moreover holding more than two or three policies at once would increase the price in a similar waywould this not work for more realistic insurance reform and if not why
this would effect alot more people than highsec gankers to be fairi personally pirate in low sec which is not a game breaking problem at all i would hate to be punished even further for my gameplay style i am already outlawed from high security spaceor i could just corp insure my ships as my corp does not have a security ratingso there is already a loophole in your proposal
during my time 10 i gave suicide ganking mackinaws a try with a buddy with us both in thoraxs i can safely say the effort it takes to get it together isnt much but its a drag having to haul shipsmods to low secon top of that you have to find a target that not only is worth blowing up but you can actually kill it doesnt take much to make yourself look not worth the effort for example we came across a few and i repeat only a few mackinaws that were fit with medium shield extenders and hardeners that put us off a lot but faction shield boosters was one of our favourite targets as people fit their macks with faction boosters and then have cap rechargers in the mids so literally have very little ehp was like christmas came early one mackinaw we caught had a shield booster worth around 120 mill plus talk about overkill for a high sec belttbh you can remove the insurance but the people who will suffer are the new players to the game who get themselves concordokkend by accident and the not so new players who make a little mistakemy opinion let suicide gankers do their thing its the only way people will learn that its safer space not safe space and it also rewards the players with a clue who actually tank their barges and dont fly billions of isk around in a tech one untanked hauler tldr leave suicide ganking alone let the idiots suffer and allow the pilots who are smarter be rewarded suicide gankers  clever carebears alike
i basically agree with this i do think there should be no insurance payout if killed by concord or in the case of selfdestructs
i agree dont nerf id say if you must modify the insurence payments just do it in 10 or make it percentage based concorded in 10 no payout concorded in 9 50 concorded in 8 or below full this will just make 1 and 9 safer but not safealso increasing response times based on sec would also help prevent it in super high sec both of these making it a bit of a hunting game for the suiciders waiting for the pray to enter a less high sec system
insurance should be null and void whenever you self destruct or get concorded end of discussionsuicide ganking is possible because you can grab yourself a battleship fit it up and end up breaking even or making a damn profit i find it hard to believe there would be much incentive for alts to grab ships knowing they get nothing back for said action if anything it would be just a bit obvious to the game admins what was going onself destruct is something that people use to deny killmails but lately people use it to make money as well if you want that insurance money so damn bad go get shot down in low sec or something at least make it worth while to the pvpers that waysuicide ganking shouldnt be outlawed but the insurance payout at a minimum should be zerobeyond that i dont have a problem with it other than the unbalanced risk to reward ratio listed above
remove insurance rollback the old slower concordresponse time otherwise its fine as it is
remove insurance for getting concorded and for self destructing
i quoted people that already stated what i wanted to say
removing insurance would almost singlehandedly remove suiciding of large ships freighters and the like while barely impacting smallscale grief ganks happened to me on a few occasionsto perhaps meet in the middle and to avoid completely removing multibattleship suicides perhaps a chancebased system can be put into effectinsurance companies of present day are terribly terribly well known for trying to get out of paying their customers whenever they can after all they are a forprofit entity we could try and vaguely simulate that realism into eve in the form of a percentagebased chance for insurance payouts to occur if undertaken in the process of criminal acts perhaps while you have an aggression timer on you that isnt vs an npc entity like guristas or blood raiders 75 would be a good chance to get your insurance while at the same time making it less likely to commit these acts on a largescale for fear of not getting the payout if the margin for profit was already close or if the randomnumber gods frown on youas one of the first posters in this thread pointed out if youre going to spend 300m in bss to kill a freighter carying 300m in goods and after normal payout youd get back 250m you might now only expect to get back about 187m of that as some of the bs insurances arent paidand you have to modify that a bit either way depending on luck or unluck considering that objects have a 50 chance to survive a wreck youre only banking on 150m worth of goods surviving through that freightergank which also might be a little higher or lower depending on rngmakes suicideganking more calculated harder to do on a largescale or very often while not severely penalizing people who gank weak ships with lots of goods weak ships take less to kill which means cheaper gank ships and thus increase your likelihood of a profit margin
yea but the full cammo just looks ugly in this thread are some photoshopped partial cammos that look very nice
i was just wondering if it was possible to add the possibility to make a public fleet finder advert  i just thought the point of the fleet finder was to find a fleet and if you arent in a large corp or alliance your not going to find anyone also would make things easier for finding people to do missions withthats just my opinionthanks sled
i was thinking of the same however i can easily see this being abusedused for scamming in some way  waaay too easily 
as a pvper pirate and supporter of highsec griefers i support this but only because it will make it easier to find and victimize those who live in highsec believing themselves safe from all the pirates
a lot of people dont like thisctrl  tab can be pressed blindctrl  f9 is a harder key to findctrl  tab is locked so that these keys cant be switchedi want ctrl  tab to hide the ui like it has for yearsplease allow me to reassign ctrl  f9 to ctrl  tab as it has always been
ctrltab hidesshows windows which is almost the same thingan no offence but f9 is right next to f8 and before the map key f10
id like a regiontab for sellorders so i dont get the wrong region message all the time if i want to change prices on sell orders it would make trading life in eve a lot better 
it definitely would  less time lost  more isk p
dont worry about code thats what programmers are paid for besides wormholes already have it no biggie really
i was considerig an active module fitted in low slots powergrid 1012 cpu 1518 capacitor consume 40sec which inject propulsion and power to the ship engines giving a 3540 to the afterburner top speed it also amplify the mass of the ship reducing the manovrability another module fitted in the low  med  slots could be a engine booster which use batteries  charges  to boost the ships speed the value of the boost is depeding by the powe of the charges but it could be around the 40 and the 60 a charge recharge interval of 2040 secs once active the ship will recive a power explosion to the engine reaching istantly the top speed of the ship  the charge bonus decreasing after 1 sec power grid 68 cpu 1720 as microwarpdrives do this module reduce the capacitor by 20 and a stealth distortion module plugget in the hight slots which reduce the signature radius of a ship by 35 those modules are usefull for interceptors and assault ships to enter in a short combat range between 2 big bs fleets and engage hoping they dont have webbers  hooo im sorry for your tracking speed 
so you came up witha a low slot afterburner that ups your powergrid when its turned on um you realize powergrid has no effect on actually using your modules rightb a mwd that uses charges that only lasts for one second that takes 30 average seconds to cooldownc a module equivalent to the pirate implant setswhatever youre smoking i suggest you check the expiration date and then let this thread die
oh wow what an appalling ideai disagreeobviously not ccp is a company and we are their customers they arent under any obligation to alter the product to fit our arbitrary demandsccp isnt required obey csm youve got it backwardsyou make it sound like were funding a charity or are investors we arent were customers there is a definite differencenot to those of us who have a realistic understanding of how a business worksnono per abovewhy should ccp submit to such blithering idiocy as putting themselves under this obligation no other company on earth is obligated to cater to the customers whim like thisno just no this is quite possibly one of the more insane suggestions ive seen here
let me lock rockets missiles and torps and shoot them with my weapons drones id be happy
im curious why theres this sudden rush of people posting ideas about countering missiles either by boosting defender missiles or by adding entirely new modules specifically to counter missiles if you want to start giving missiles the drawbacks that turreted weapons have then youd have to remove the unique drawbacks that missiles havemissile boats generally have slightly lower dps than their turret counterparts in exchange for reasonable high volley and some good reliability when you shoot your missile at a target of the proper size within your range you have a reasonable expectation that it will deal at least some damage to counter this are the fact that you have travel time which factors in any time you have a gap in firing every time you reload get jammed switch targets etc you have to wait at least a few seconds after turning on your weapons before any damage is appliedalso aside from switching to precision missiles or hitting you with a web there is absolutely nothing a missile boat can do to make his missiles hit you harder missiles dont have tracking computers or tracking enhancers many missile boats generally have a small or absent drone bay to boot these things all combine to give missiles a different flavor than turrets it confuses me that people seem to want to remove that flavor
agree with above no support
if this is needed why not just make an antimissile script for the existing tracking disruptor
there already is a medslot module to reduce missile damageit is called afterburner
tray lisans makes a good point perhaps a chance base system where 2 thing can happen1 your module is successfull and diverts the missile or2 it backfires and the missile hits you harder and faster than normalthis would help to balence out the drawbacks inherent in missilesbut imo missiles are fine the way they work now

hii think is good idea make the full game in spanish too option alot of spanish gamers playi can work on it too if is necesarythanks
supported
nowhere does the op say you wanted to keep abrathurs changes thats my point i will gladly support this ifwhen these changes have been reflected in the op
any ms pilots who want a quick chuckle check out the descriptions of your remote ecm bursts good thing ccp refuses to put anything into the game half finishedas they said in the ms threadso much that this gem made it onto tranqhere was a discussion between a corp mate and an unnamed individual on sisi a few days before dominion i expect this link to be removed
so what were asking is just to give ms a hp boost and jumprange can we please get a replyor if ccp does not intend to do anything with motherships i think they should just look at removeing them from game and compensating people with appropriate isk in the region of 1617 bill this would cover pos fuels sov 4 systems capital comp bpc use and this is the price for what ms avg go for on forumsthis thread should be made sticky and this seriousley needs some pr from ccp dev team and spent time onand no changeing them into a new class of ship editor are gmsdevs hopeing people will just shutup

so apparently this bug that everyone is getting where you cant undock while youve got aggression is actually a feature of the game and was tested on sisii for one cant live lik thisi just webbed my corps freighter so he could warp a bit quicker to stn only to find that once i docked i was unable to undock againthis is not the first time this has happened today earlier on it wouldnt let me undock even after my aggression timer was done i had relogged and cleared my cache i ended up clearing all setting pain in the ass and then i was able to undokc againwtf

moved to issues and workarounds from assembly hallthis is a known issue please see the known issues thread for more info if you have any other issues please check that thread first if the issue is not listed please make it known at the offical issues thread
prefaceokay so i got angry at ccp for changing the rules of the game true it is there game and i have no right to do anything really but when joined eve i liked it for a number of reasons1 older player base2 never ending as in wownever played for these reasons lvl 70 game over and kiddie design3 a specialize charater could beat and older charater in eve or right ship and fit like chess4 vast world5 unique player from all over the world6 support forum petitions csm fixs ectwell the reason im mad is i feel that ccp is making it easy to play the game im not talking about teaching new players how to play thats great im talking about the skills they are killing older players that worked so hard to get where there atthis was my mad petition to ccp i know everyone is going to troll and flame this but i still feel i should post it because alot of other players expressed my same concerns in diffrent ways i know older players then me are more ed and i know i could of went about it nicer but thats not important here tell me what you think of the issuesrulesohh plese dont trolll it by picking each sentance apart and making a comment the people that do this never suggest anything i think they et off on it but are to affraid them selfs to get critisized that they dont ever suggest soulutions so bring on the barbaque i love reading it esp people that do the above ohh how much time the forum trolls waste which they will i lured them in by saying please dont lolpetiotion coming soon below
sorry im very angry and so are alot of other people i talked toits about droping thermal dynamics down from lvl 5 engry emissions to lvl 4 i just wasted 17day for a crappy skill and so did a ton of people before me i did it right before the patch for the patch which makes me more ed why dont you just drop titan to 5 days and give everyone one when they start instead you should fix that it takes less time to to fly a tech three command ship which is better then any command ship out there and same for logistics tech three are better and what good is a blackops ship anymore waste of time and isk go get a few carriars instead infact most people can fly a carriar soonerthats 17 days i could of used on gay guns to tech ii since there not like missles are too get tech iis another faili play eve because it took time to achive things and not everyone could be good at everything way to lower the bar your going to see about a 90 increase in the number of people over heating there mods since dominion every pilot and his mother will be able to do it most people didnt train it before because it took to long so it gave an edge to those that didlast thing is having a skill que should be learned or earned i remember waking up in the middle of the night to change skills and missing a month i payed for because i got rapidly deployed miltary so i think for the first two weeks they should have to live without it to get a taste of what we older players have had too endureda postivehey the ship descriptions in the patch notes ie what there to be usedrole for when talking about factional ships should be added to everyship in eve in there descriptionps aready ed from falcon nerf blackbird is just as good and cheaper by a long shot if you want to make eve unige make each ship have a bonus for the more you fly it or kills you get in it improve something about the ship hell that would get people to grind and play longer to max out a ship it would make specializing and flying a ship better have a mod that converts two slots midsinto one high or the other wayyou stripped eve of its charaters indvidulity when you started all pilots at sratch i know the reason i picked my pilot was my starting skills not my race or look i dont like them you made it easy to fix skills so now the reason that i picked my charater dosent matter i share no common ground with pilots who now pick my same blood line anymore since anyone can be anythingccp needs to stop worring about a profit and more about its players and game if someone ever gets maxed skills let me know and i will quit eve will be another wow which i never have played because it has an end lvl 70 game over i hear they moved it to 80 now i liked it because you could become a badass in a niche and beat an older pilot or counter his ship if everyone one can do everything or its easyer then i want all qweens on my chess board t3s for high and caps for low no need to fly anyother ship youll get pwned
i can sympathize with your post i trained archaeology and hacking back in 2006 when i was a noob and the skill prerequisite was science level 5 ccp dropped it to 3 i was slightly annoyed the first time i read that in a devblogon the other hand new players need a chance to keep up with 246 year old vets i remember that the initial skillpoints you got on character creation got bosted from 500k  in 2005 to 800k thats a good thing i heard from 2003 vets that tech 1 battleships used to be very expensive in relative terms back then there were less opportunities to make money and those ships were the biggest stuff you could get nowadays battleships are common and quite cheapi certainly would want my noob corp members to have a chance to close the gap in some skills provided of course that they specialize nothing is more annoying when you ask a noob to fit a mwd and he cant use one but of course youre right that vets should always stay ahead of the younger characters on that note its also annoying to have trained torpedoes when they used to be longrange just before they got switched to very short range having trained cruise missiles for stealth bombers right before stealth bombers got changed to torpedo launching platforms one thing i totally disagree with you because i see it from a different anglei chose my character because of his races backstory and bloodline description im almost a roleplayer i think that having to chose a race just because it will allow you to be the best trader  miner  fighter was the worst thing that ccp had done to the whole rp community so im very glad that this was dropped
my thoughts exactly
congrats delegate
i wish to thank all who voted for me i am quite sure i got more votes than some people thought but was not quite enoughnonetheless i will continue bringing up issues which i consider to be wrong in faction war with this in mind caldari militia has already initiated an operation which will probably soon get attention in various forumsdamar rocarionbrigadier general plan b plan a was to get elected to csm so i could address this issue directly with ccp
you fail and you will always failas for your plan b probably a lot of alts with a lot of standing in a crossed militia capturing sites unhindered yesusing an army unskilled alts to defend plexes with overpowered npcs doing all the pvp for them and abusing timer bugs to claim them while youre absent is more of a problem in my opinion like i predicted you have problems running the rather strong npcs in minmatar plexes which you cannot run with an alt in a t1 frigate like the weak gallente npcs thus you have to use standings to circumvent them meanwhile you continue whining about me doing the same with the caldari npcs which are much more of a problem than the minniesccp is already aware of the issues erik and me already made them painfully aware of the problems youre not needed if you think differently and do want to bring up a csm issue you can bring it up through me or z0d who will represent fw in this csm and has already raised his first fw issue yesterday
but what if someone doesnt agree with the way you do thingsalsolets point and laugh at people that didnt get voted inwait lets not
that is fine but there are several reasons why someone may disagree and one of the reasons is that the person that disagrees has a personal agenda and is not interested in making eve better for all players but only for his own specific niche group or playstyleand thats why im glad damar didnt get elected fortunately the voters realized this as well
you managed to do nothing about these issues and erik managed to nothing so why would zod do it any better
oh well maybe next time right
correction ccp doesnt give a sht about factional warfare and were the only ones providing continuity throughout the csm to keep the pressure on ccp to do otherwise that is how we got the fw lag problems addressed too i started that issue erik finished that issue
that is why there is always plan b make them care you were not able to do that so someone have to do it
there isnt anything you can do which i havent tried or set in motion alreadyfeel free to try though but remember that it took ccp 4 months to fix the cloaked plexing after apocrypha despite me sending numerous mails and even made phonecalls about it despite me reproducing the timer exploit in their office they still havent fixed that either even if you were to capture all minmatar space through whatever exploit theyre not going to care just as they dont care about the exploits you used to capture all gallente spacewe all know that fw is full of bugs and the game mechanics are so fundamentally flawed that the entire thing should be sent back to the drawing board ccp wants do dedicate an expansion to fixing it but the problem is to get them to give it any priority as there is always more important stuff to squash into an expansionthe most youre going to get at this point is some bandaid fixes which will be the npc balance and the plex spawning mechanics we brought up we might even see some exploits fixed but that doesnt fix the fundamental problems with fw at all you know how clueless they can be just look at the entire fw mission debacleone more thing ccp doesnt give a rats behind about the system occupancy systems why cause 95 of the players dont care about it you can care i can care but the fact is that almost noone else in fw cares about those plexes or the occupancy it reads in a small corner of the screen as seen during fanfest only 5 or so people in the whole room indicated they care about it with the other hundreds raising their hand that they just want some pvp ccp laughs at us behind our back that we are so stupid to go through all this trouble over these systems and thinks that we are crazy they thought that the plexes would facilitate pvp and didnt expect them to be run the way we do them just for the sake of getting systems not pewpew
i find the na na na da you didnt win rather poor and do not condone it in the slightest in fact even i find it petty and in bad taste damar did nothing wrong in his running for csm i did think he was too much of a divisive figure to run for csm under a fw ticket abit like myself i know lots of people hate me i cry sometimes when i go to bed however i wish him luck im sure he dont need itall this exploit crap is just that crap anyone can do it its out there everyone knows so everyone likely does itno other peron running for csm has a 4 page threadnaught so congrats at least you have got people interestedi would love to know what plan b is knowning pervs its going to be a doozy
i couldnt wait to get to work and want to raise these issues to the agenda for meeting 2 which date we will have to decide on in meeting 1 this weekendfor those that dont know about the formalities you have to write a summary about your issue at the wiki link to the thread post in the thread and link back and then post it in the agenda thread of the appropriate meeting since we didnt have a meeting thread yet i made one but normally elvenlord will have to do the work if he decides to keep the chairman position that is20th december meetingalliance logos csm intervention requestedblack ops improvements part 2bring logistics warp speed inline with t2 shipsfw complex spawning issues part 2destroyer improvements thread  wikiingame events menu thread  wikilock characters to prevent theft thread  wikiput more faction items on market thread  wikisuicide ganking discussion thread  wiki
raised last csm and being worked on by ccpraised to ccp by last csm and still awaiting minutes of that meeting for their answer to itraised by last csm and if you read the patch notes for dominion it was actually donefirst thing on your agenda should be getting ccp to publish the last 2 meetings minutes
ill start working on a few things myself p
dont get me wrong here as the initiative is very much appreciated but is there not an extensive list of proposals that already have support in the assembly hall sectionshould not these most supported proposals be the first to be tackledand yes i do realise that you have some of those in your list allreadycheers
bloody hell didnt petur promise that these delays wouldnt happen again
congrats aleks i was so pleased to see your vote count so high and now that csm under your name now stop grinning and get to work lol
m8 i think t1 frigates such as the incursus need to be significantly boosted while t2 powerhouses such as the ares need to be hit with the nerfbat what are your thoughts on this
congratulations alek
congrats you got one my votes glad to see so many other people decided likewise
congratulations alekseyev i sense the price of a noir contract just went up you trustworthy bastard you
congrats you got one of my votes even though we sit on opposite sides of the fence in terms of alliance politics i thought your ideas were thoughtful and extremely practical i wish you every success as csm chairman your music aint bad either
you did quite enough mdear many congratulations glad to see you on the csm
ocongratulations
definately more work put into this than most candidates campaigns good work deirdra vaal some improvements i would suggesta add more questions and issues covering other topics not already included to cover agendas not represented with your current topics b add the ability for candidates to assign points to general topics to represent the candidates priorities and display in a bar graph possibly with a dialog box under each topic with a maximum character amountc be able to log in with the new browser and automatically retreive basic character info im sure you have this planned alreadyd gather some basic details from users of the website for post election statistics how long they have played are they in an alliance what their professions ingame are etcalthough i couldnt use your website as it didnt represent my agenda i appreciate the effort you have put in and cant wait to see what you come up with next timetamber
looking forward towards the minutes
ya maybe well just go with 5 mill m3 max for 10 bsesor maybe just 5no thats a little too lowmaybe 8
i like the idea
definitelythat feature is pretty standard for the arena type fps games no additional server strain as it can be done entirely client side the entire scene can be reconstructed with the data sent fromto the server so only this needs to be recorded to a file the biggest effort would be the creation of a player for those files add controls for advanced camera movement  scripting as well as the ability to render frames to file that would be moviemakers dream 
definitely like the idea less overhead than fraps or other screencapture tools theoretically it should be relatively easy to implement too
suppoerted only if it doesnt add to lag
i cant see ccp doing much about this one however i completely support it
i support this fully
couldnt have said it better myself
lazy devs fully supported

due to the amount and availability of methane on eve ships the current color of the afterburner is appropriate yet i agree with the concept of better visual distinction between modules
sure why not
its happened to me a few times that ive grabbed a mwdab in a hurry and wondered why i suddenly had lessmore pg until i realised what id done
guess there are zero market runners in assembly hall
well of course theyre all watching the market
an overhaul is direly needed
i am writing this in the name of all faction warfare players please take your time to read me out post your thoughts and support this measurei have been in faction warfare for about six months now i enjoy the pvp the roams the gate camps the hotdrops the immersion of itover time i have come to loathe some aspects of it however massive amounts of bugs that have never been fixed crappy plex mechanics lack of rewards and objectives lag runaway exploitation of bugs and features massive isk farming etci have decided to write this thread demanding ccp to look at faction warfare and do something about it it is about time they hear us out and implement the measures we have been asking for more than a yearthey have no qualms working with 00 players because honestly that is probably where they all play eve they have no problems with working with players to make their game better either even if sometimes they waste all the collaboration for unknown reasons and create large amounts of grief towards the community that problem notwithstanding they still work to make lag better improve sov mechanics etc to improve 00 gameplay it is their vision of endgame in evewe in faction warfare are in it for a variety of reasons maybe we like the fast paced pvp the lack of dull pos warfare the powerlessness of living in 00 space as a renter or member of a large alliance where you make no decisions and have to do whatever you are told maybe you decided you were tired of doing the same mindless highsec level 4 mission running mining or playing the markets for some adrenaline in the bubble dd and bomb free pvp environment of fwi joined fw because i saw it as a doorway to pvp didnt make me isk but it was fun if it wasnt for the incredible adrenaline and fast pace of lowsec roams i would have probably left eve alreadyi will be borrowing some of the points from here csm proposalthere are a number of issues we have been asking for some time to be looked at and fixedthere is no greater objective in fw it doesnt matter that all systems have been captured by the caldari there is no effect besides some lolrp nobody gains anything from capping systemsthere is no reward for capturing plexes i get more standings increase form farming missions and isk lots of it i lose standings with opposite faction howeverthere is no reward for pvp the amount of lp you get from kills is ridiculous you get more from doing lvl1 missions the lp reward has to be increased ten fold to have any meaning at implementation of this feature people were afraid of exploiting this mechanic it would have been easy to prevent that but we would have seen far greater exploiting somewhere else however devs thought up an idea for 5 minutes and implemented a flawed mechanicfw mission are an isk printing machine everyone in eve has an alt in a militia to help farm lp for the exclusive store items this was supposed to invigorate fw but it had the opposite effect people stopped pvping and went farming instead we have made a total of hundreds of billions of isk doing this myself included almost no risk at all and then they came with their fix that didnt fix anything and now people continue to farm lp moreover missions for some factions are easier to do than others plexes are severely bugged and unbalanced they can be solo run with frigates exploited to be unable to respawn after finishing etc its a messnow i have my own ideas on what to do how things should be done i would like everyone to provide their input however argue your points so we can provide a guide map so ccp can do something about this game that we playi will be proving a personal vision soonfor now just support the followingccp must address faction warfare we as your customers deserve attention fix it now
this is the last expansion or is it the one before why would they fix the last expansion when a new one could be relesaed full of eye candy
increase the lp from kills 5 or 10 times nerfing the missions is fine ive had enough of seeing  manticores running around low sec doing missions and cloaking up when someone enters system but there needs to be some way to get fw lp without losing more ships than you gainand for gods sake make system occupancy mean something so we can actually convince people to plex plex mechanics are borked but not so much that people wont use them as long as theyre given incentives
another look at fw would be nice
here is what i think would do some good for faction warfarethe npcs in plexes and missions are significantly different in the way they operate gallente npcs use blasters and sensor dampeners and can be kited caldari npcs have all sorts of missiles and torpedoes that can hit you to 100km and the best ewar of all the ecm i am not sure about the minmatar npcs but i know they use target painters i know the amar use neutnos and are close range fit can be kited also it would be good to have the npc ships looking different but all using all ewar types and all weapon types to make things more equal and plexesmissions not so easily farmed requiring team work to run them missions need to made harder to do dont allow them to be declinedquit to let you choose where you want them make sure you take no standing hit if the mission expires however 12hours or so this will discourage farming and promote teamwork with roving gangs which is good for pvp also make sure missions work as plexes in system occupancy if you finish missions you get lp and you help with capturing a systemplexes offer no reward for running them you get lame faction standing increases every time you get promoted and thats it allow for increments of 1000lp per plex captured per pilot inside 1000lp for minors 2000lp for mediums and 3000lp for majors you may argue that people might exploit this these plexes have timers you cant farm them and the opposite side can come and fight you and your alts in stabbed executioners and in contrast to missions it is a lot less reward per time spent i take about 5 minutes to run a lvl4 mission now once in system and i get 1530k lp its 10 minutes for a minor and even more for the othersit would be required that the plex spawn mechanics be fixed so that plexes continuously respawn after being run and just as importantly fix the bugs regarding plexes like the one that prevents the plex form respawning until downtime if it is bugged when someone warps out while in range which keeps counting down and does not affect occupancymilitia members who willingly shoot fellow militia members must get severe sec status loss and faction loss if you repeatedly engage people you will be dropped out after a few acts of aggression while if you somehow mess up your overview you can recuperate from your mistakesince a lot of corps like to come into fw dec a member corp and grief them while militia fleet members cant help them make it so if any corporation decs a fw corp it is effectively wardecing that faction all the corps in that militia will be able to kill you wo penalty and the highsec police will shoot at you you want to get easy targets in lowsec be prepared to pay for the consequences
agreeing as hard as i can with neogabriels topic and all who agree with himas hard as i can
fully supportedthere are a ton of bugs related to fw autocountdown on plexes npc standings etc beyond that there are a ton of design problems with it too efficient complexe farming discourages pvp etci would go as far as to say that ccp should just rethink the whole fw approachbut the most fundamental change fw needs imho is morale supportin any conflict the party that is losing for whatever reasons is losing morale once morale is lost resistance is broken conflicts failure cascade like this fw needs a mechanic to counter this trend one mechanic that was in the original design but somehow got lost was the idea that systems are much easier to capture the fewer you have and more difficult to capture the more you havethe losing side then can get some quick success stories which builds morale the better side still will hold larger parts of the territorythis is a fundamental problem because only this way fw can survive the bugs it has there will always be bugs but without this once one side has had an advantage for a sufficient amount of time the other side will crumble and you will not get a rebalance at all
i couldnt agreee more
the only thing i would say is that adding more people inside a plex needs to not simple give each person the full lp that will simply reward blobs and altrunners you know who you are a better idea is either the total lp is split between players based on how much relative time each has spent inside the plex showing up for 1 minute gets you less then staying in it the whole time andor the each person beyond a single player in the plex when it is captured adds 50 of the lp to the pool that the previous person did and the pool is then split evenly that math goes like thisxsingle player lp rewardy total lp reward starts at single player rewardfor each player after the first in the plex when it capturesxx2yyxa simple stacking penalty for the lp reward round up to the next whole lp always for simplicitythat might be a bit harsh and possibly cause its own problemsbolded some items for emphasisim tired of feeling like fw has a rad under construction gif straight out of geocities on it
what ifmaybestick with me here1 fw character per account weed out the free altsif you want to glitch out the system with your 1000 alts you should have to at least pay for them
fully agree the plexes are just to easy for caldarimake the npc guarding it the same or then just with same ewar shipsit has to be done something if not you will lose alot of guys that want to do something in the game and are role playing guys trying to make something in fw
definantly something ccp need to look into i empathize with the fact that they set up the ground work for faction wars and had other things they wanted to put priority on i understand this you only have so many staff and so many work hours in the dayhowever respectfully i think if you have the chance now as dominion has been released perhaps faction wars could be developed more making it into something really special like all us pvp corporations and role players would love to see it become instead of a glorified war decdont misunderstand me i love fw i would also however love to see it evolve and change and become more dynamic and tactical 3 fw
i would like to say fw needs alot of work thier is alot of good idealsand i cant wait to see how ccp responds to it
while i doubt ccp will care enough to stop messing around with 00 mechanics i do hope they take a look at the fw statistics andmaybe realize something is wrong
strongly concur with this sentiment i think spies have done major damage to fw as someone said the other day in chat the caldari have more spies in the gallente militia than fighters in theirs id think a militia would be suspicious after a person joinsleavesrejoins more than once a month also there should be some sort of mechanic to out known spies and be able to take action against them without security loss once a spy is burned its only logical that there would be consequences

if you seem to be missing the point that the gh ii already exists and that the price above is the going rate for c50 so  wha i am saying is not a propasl but that you can already get 54m  hour so i really dont think gas needs any love at alli will agree with you on the point that faster gas harvesting will lead to increased supply which will lead to lower prices imo  this is another and even more valid reason not to boost gas harvestingits fine as is and quite profitable per hournothing in eve should be afk the fact that you can high sec mine afk is part of why its not a high profit proffession same with afk ap you get the 15km warp in so its not perfectly safe to afk ap54m per hour to mine in a worm hole sounds like a good reward for teh risk or go back to high sec mining low risk but only 8m isk per houralso  eve is not a solo game if you want safer mining join a corpwhere do i click on the button for  no support
gonna have to agree with the no support crowd the difficulty is what keeps gas cloud harvesting profitable
one idea for the procurergive it one turret for its one high slot and give it the bonus of 125 per level to gas harvester yield therefore at maximum it gives the equivalent of 725 lasers making it very strong compared to normal ships but not massive in the total intake battleships would have a much higher armor and shields but lower yield and cargo bay so this would be the tradeoffgiven that i can see this in the game conditionally i can support this topic as this would give it a boost without making it unreasonable

it is good that now they ruin your game too my game has been ruined for a while and nobody does anything about it maybe now with all your tears ccp will take the time do fix fwdamar and friends are good because they expose the bugs and exploits its like a virus that forces the organism do adapt or dieand honestly of that is wrong about fw all you care about is that the npcs are imba an they dont get shot they are valid points but you are ignoring the dozen or so bugs that exist and all the other shortcomings of fwi hope they destroy your game and undo all your months work see how it ismaybe then we can get a new one that works
ruined what 90 of fw players are in it for casual pvp plenty of that going aroundbut supported nonetheless botched sovereignty mechanics are botched that portion of the game is ruined but theres still plenty of good features out there
didnt even know about these mechanics till noweditnah sorry this is not a legit method just because ccp is too busylazy to fix the many issues of fw these mechanics are not announced so theres no way for the average fwer to know them unless they are revealed over time through word of mouth this or through extensive testingit seems you guys found this out on the gallente front and have brought this plague to us thankspoint taken can you quit being metagamers

if we ruined caldarigallente front wich we did not on our wiev we did it on legit way not by using any bug or exploiti know that there was some cloaky plexing etc going on on both sides but main attack was made purely legit ways destroying gallente ships and npc in plexes you just lost your systems in legit ways you ankh personally used lame methods most so you ruined this game you tried to made gallente to plex ordered by ccp as you said but they did not follow you never though why they did not follow you because you were lame whiner who used standing exploits stabs and cloack and you did not want to pvp at all and still you whine how others do some tricks too and all of that when you were csm you were model to us example how this game should be played and we took some tips so you got what you wanted
to you three this
supportedfix this bugexploit as it gives an unfair advantage and enforcesallows a war to be fought without fighting not what was intended i thinksame arguments count for the timer bug
i support this initiativeutilising this flawed mechanic is not really so different from using any of the other flawed fw mechanics that doesnt mean we shouldnt at least try to get them fixedat least its not time zone related
supporting this
i think its quite important to fix this right now because the alternative is having the result of the amarrianminmatar front decided by cheesy nearexploits that will cheapen and diminish the results for all involved players i cannot believe that a majority of the 24th crusade players would want to win the occupancy battles in their theatre through the efforts of a standingsloophole like this it makes a mockery of corporations like 1pg and pie and others who have by and large been fighting an honest war so far it is ridiculous that caldari faction characters can contest minmatar complexes without standings penalty to the minmatar just as it would be ridiculous for minmatar players to content caldari complexes without standings penalty in the enemy factionthis kind of gaming of the complex and occupancy system turns faction warfare into a farcical embarrassment for ccp and it needs to be quickly patched before the result of faction warfare and rp consequences from the conflict is decided by nothing more than shortsighted weakness in the core design something needs doing and it needs doing now
it will be up to amarr to give the finishing blow anyway caldari cannot shoot the bunker so amarr can simply refuse to take the system we simply want to bring attention to this bug to ccp only one amarr pilot was actually even informed about it in advance so this is not a joint op or anything purely a caldari operationas said once ccp declares this an exploitbug we stop it is what we want to happpendamar rocarionbrigadier general
ironically damar and ankh seem to have the same wish for fwto eliminate the various bugs and exploits in order to make fw a more enjoyable experience for everyone involvedproblem is because theyre going about it through such wildly different methods they end up butting heads so much that any attempt by the other to help balance out the mechanics gets lost in the personal arguements both by these two and their various supporterslets just try to focus the arguements on the actual problems rather than the people maybe well actually be able to achieve some improvements that wayoh and supported
this op is a bit too one sided in favour to the minmatar for me to support maybe someone should make a more neutral issuefw needs a complete overhaul wardeccing high sec security plexes missions and even system layout of the amarrminamtar warzonewe need faction warfare mkiismall fixes wont do much
i would say that is only because 1 op is in em and 2 its happening in minmatar systems currently i dont believe we will get any changes if we request too broad of a stroke but smaller concerted efforts for the larger issues may net some gain this one the timer bug being my two big ones right nowplease reconsider giving your support to this nephilim as you do seem to agree with the sentimentedit for spelling and grammar
would rather small progressive changes over several minor patches than wait for next years new expansion
please do not take this comment seriouslyhe has only one side of the brain present amon xeno was not there
for those who dont know sasa here is refering to nephelim xenos alt amon xeno a gallente character in an npc corp that follows him around with remote repairers sometimes in a guardian sometimes in a bs sometimes in an exequror also used amply to scout minmatar numbers xeno is not the only one that does it in either side but is surely the most consistent frequent and the most famous

on behalf of mothership owners and pilotsfollowing the disasterous rollback of proposed changes to the mothership class whilst giving the titan its ehp boost and instajib dd of death titans can now roam nullsec and lowsec and basically instajib a mothership at will even with the best deadspace buffer tank only 3 titans are needed to kill a 25bn ship including fittings unlike carriers which can at least be insured motherships no longer fit into the catagory of supercapital since they can be so easily be killed and have no defence against titansas with titans motherships force their pilots to commit to either floating in safespots or being locked up in poss both of which require additional resource constraints on the owners since the omnipresent risk of a hictortitan hotdrop and already titan pilots have been using their griefing tool de jour of rorquals et al means ms pilots are skulking about nervous and wary of being preyed onthis is grossly inbalanced in favour of titans since the ms serves no effective purpose in its current stats for any given combat situation pilots should be given a open option by ccp for gms to allow them to be docked for the duration of this nerf until they are suitably rebalanced to be combat effective againit is grossly unfair of ccp to expect players to continue to pay a monthly subscription fee to simply keep a ship that serves no current purpose or to cover the costtime sink of running a pos simply to protect a ship that they have made so vunerable due to their hurried and illthought out unbalanced changes to supercapitalstherefore i petition that all mothership pilots who wish to be allowed to request a gm to dock their mothership in a station so they can leave them safely mothballed and free up their pilots to use more useful ships on behalf of their fleetthis is not a long term request that motherships be dockable only a temporary measure that will allow motherships to be stored out of harms way while the development team produce and implement a solution that revalidates the mothership to supercapital statuswhile i appreciate some people think oh just sell them that is not a solution many people who own ms appreciate the difficulty in building and buying these assets and wish to keep them longterm until the issue is addressed but due to their inability be an effective fleet participant under the new sc changes they should have the option of longterm storage without related expense of tying up an alt accountpos to do so simply because they are getting no benefit for that subscription whilst they cannot be fielded for any useful purposeso to clarify the petition requestthis will not be a forced dock optionit will be similar to what happened during the speed patch nerf where all snake sets were removed so people had the option to sell them or keep themwhat we are asking for is that ccp enables a policy that allows gms at a players own request a onetime option via petition to dock their ms in a station they can then choose to leave the ship in station and remove their characteranyone who subsequently undocks their ms will be deemed to have accepted usage of their ms under the current stats and would not be able to redock to prevent any abuse of the systemthis is a fair solution i feel to the problem ccp created since those who wish to sell their ms can do so those that wish to continue to use their ms can do so and those who feel the riskreward of using the ship has been rendered them useless can have them longterm stored until ccp rebalances them

im guesing about 80 of all mom pilots got baned from posting 2 weeks ago so wait about 1 week and this post wil have more suporti suport it tho moterships sucks monkey balls nowknowing what you abrathur made then seeing nozh  it all upp has ed off most supercap pilots in game
i agree motherships are a huge liability they also have very little benefit over other options their current state leaves them vulnerable and this needs to be looked intoi dont think they need to be force docked though if its such a huge inconvenience to have a character tied up to hold it or have a pos to protect it then sell it no sense in having 20b tied up in a liability youre seeing no benefits fromif someone wants to drop 240b in assets to kill 20b id expect to be killed relatively quickly
my request is not to make ms invunerable to titans this is not a request for a xyz changes  but to give ms pilots affected by the lack of ms changes and effective nerf choice in what they do in the interimbecause they rebalanced titans and did nothing to ms we all accept in a 60 page threadnaught that ms were effectively nerfed and the risk to using them far outweighs any benefit they offer a fleet compared to fielding carriers therefore for those that dont want to sell them assuming you could even get buyers there should be a one time option to petition a gm to dock them while ccp sorts this mess outall i am asking is i and other ms pilots are given a choice to leave our ms hangered without the expense while ccp rebalances them sell them or use them
supportedi dont want to see many good friends leave the game over this because we know how much work it is to skill for keep and run a ms and its grossly unfair that ccp did absoloutly nothing for anyone after all the hours of testing we did for them the least they can do is let ms alts be free to fly carriers and other ships in the interim and not feel like we are just paying ccp to babysit ships that are hopelessly outclassed for their role now

i think that is one of the benefits of mining you can browse the web corp chat watch tv etc and of course dock at a moments notice if something comes up irl making me do more for the same reward makes no sense if i want more interaction ill run missionsmake more isk alternatively if mining bores you do it in low sec or 00 i doubt youll find it lacks interaction
quoting for truth bored with mining in highsec go to lowsec that makes mining really exciting and interactive however i would like to see mining enhanced but im not sure your idea is a great one isaac
i wait for comet and ring mining they said it will be more challenging and interactive
why should i mine in a hulk when i have a rokh i have a hulk also rokhmegathrondomiabaddon whatever ships other race battleships are used are heavy tanking mining ships you point about raising mining defence capabilities on miners move from your mining barge to battleship why should you use a battleship you should use one because you want a better defence system simple you out mine a rokh in a hulk however a rokh out tanks a hulk seems fair
many of us keep buddy lists with a people that were at war with have good and poor standings towards or some who simply are of interest to us as time passes this list grow to ridiculous proportions same happens with the bookmarks tab the poor people and places interface makes it difficult to managecan we please have a right click feature that allows us to send a contact to the desired folder both in the people tab and the places tab or at least this fixed somehowwhen ccp said it would allowed to ad corp and alliances to the people tab i thought it meant we would have a one click way to add every member of that corpalliance added to a folder in the buddy list i see now that this is not the case and i would never dream of doing it for an entire alliance but being able to add everyone in a corporation to a folder in one click would most definitely be useful

right now if a player unticks everything in the states tab of the overview except war targets war targets wont show up either because war targets are also people with standings be it neutral bad or horrible they are also war targets in ones own militia etcthis needs to be worked out so if one only wants war targets to show it only shows war targets if the problem is an and conditional then it should be changed to an or conditional if the problem is the order in which conditions are checked then allow us to move the order like in appearancebottom line a player cannot make a war target only overview and we should be able toalso drones belonging to players in ones fleet or with good standings will show up despite it being set up so they dont and without any sort of tag like war target drones have having them not show up will not only clear confusion but reduce lag

uh cutting dust 514 off from eve is basically gutting the most unique and fascinating part of the game its pretty much the entire games selling point you may as well be asking blizzard to turn wow into a singleplayer game sure it could be done but whyas for complaining about it being consoleonly consoles arent that expensive these days anyone with a job could save up for one in a reasonable time frame and certainly by dusts release also despite what most whiners here on the forum like to proclaim consoles can play more than one game there are quite a few games i would say would be worth buying an xbox 360 or playstation 3 forreleasing for consoleonly is ccps prerogative it would be hard to argue that it is a mistake from a business standpoint i think the success of games like halo 3 and call of duty modern warfare 2 show the console market is quite large id speculate larger than the pc gamer market but i dont have any data to back that up also while ccp would certainly like current eve players to become dust players as well theres no reason to assume theyre dependent on us for dusts success in many ways dusts success will be independent of eve despite its integral tieins
some of us dont even own a tvtv  console  game  subscription for one game im not going to pay that
and some of us own four tvs a wii an xbox 360 a ps3  you seeing the point for every eve player who wont pick up dust theres probably a noneve player whod love another fps and couldnt care less about the universe as far as ccp is concerned its still an extra subscription or purchase whatever which means that their expansion into the console market is doing exactly what they expected it to  increase revenue the fact that you in particular wont buy it really doesnt concern them that much
dust will come and go away in about 6 months the longevity of console games is simply not there to support fasttwitch evedont worry about it bombard them from orbit

no insurance payout for concord destruction
what about newbie mistakes
i will always second this as far as newbie mistakes go  a lesson learned is always free loss of a ship while commiting a crime in high sec areas should invalidate any insurance
how often do these really occurwhat kind of mistake could that be only those where the player immediately realizes that what he did was stupid a spurofthemoment actionwheres the problem youve get a warning you ignore it you pay for your mistake theres nothing hidden or subtle about it no way to accidently stumble across it
im perfectly ok with having more realistic insurance as long as the change comes with more realistic policeremove insurance for concord losses fine but that must be balanced by significantly debuffing concord
1 first off no where is safe in eve touching this would be like removing a foundation stone that said theres usually certain threshold where a game mechanic can become an issue to the majority of players prior to the recent buffs against suicide ganking you could say almost everyone was doing it nowadays the gankers are little bit more selective in choosing a juicy target and with that there was a noticeable drop in suicide ganking frequency to me the current balance looks allright  or at least until the screams start again onto the second part full laden freightersindustrial time to warp is more than what it would take the gankers to reduce it to ashes so imo theres really little difference between autopilotmanual piloting in regards to gankers making a kill the phrase completely preventable only applies to discerning pilot who takes care not to exceed the threshold cargo value that makes suicide ganking for profit worthwhile 2 i dont think theres any clear line to distinguish between for profit and griefing a human can usually tell but within the confines of the gamecode theyre all the same one solution would be to attach a scale marker to each ship that would modify the suicide ganking penalties meaning ganking certain ships would be much more costlier run the scale higher for ships such as hulks etc to match the current threshold for freighter would be a start to discourage griefing3 insurance is irrelevant imo sure it plays a part but not as a whole metaphorically speaking trying to cure the symptoms rather than the actual cause which may be miles in the opposite direction if you fail to grasp this refer to to the first sentence in 1
all i can say is rofl andonly one thing is wrong in suicide ganking and thats the excessive use of smartbombs on exhumers and thats because of  miners who wont train hitpoint skills or fit tank mods so theres nothing wrong in that either because when it comes to pvp ships you cant have it all max dps read max rocks per second and huge tank for your safety tho as a sidestep i agree mining wont profit much from my experience like 15k20k ehp hulk you need waaayyy more than just 1 smartbombing bs and you can still mine quite fast and random smartbombing keeps people wake upremoving insurance from suicide ganking only removes random attacks from people who dont have the unlimited isk supply like anyone in fw does personally ive made billions from suiciding but ive only carefully selected the targets and ffs if i see some careless hauler worth killing i promise ill shoot him if i get reasonable profit its no problem to catch haulers even when they are not using autopilotsecurity status you should consider this as a value even it can be grinded back up quite fast i personally give it quite a big value what is worth killing not ruining your secits quite about 18 seconds in 05 you got after aggression which is quite enough to  pretty much anything
dont you dare to take away my fun and income
even having done and enjoyed suicide ganking myself this is the approach i support i believe suicide ganking is a valid activity but that doesnt meant it shouldnt be risky removing insurance payouts in the way described would make people think twice and hopefully plan ganks with profit in mind rather than griefing if noobs make mistakes wellby the time they are flying something expensive enough to matter they should be smart enough about the game to avoid such mistakes alsowhat will get you killed by concord might be emphasized more in the tutorials and wiki if it doesnt get such treatment already
what about them theyll learn nobody bails out a newbie the first time they forget to upgrade or buy a new clone
insurance is not needed anymore in any caseships will get much cheaper if we can get away of this isk faucet
lets make something crystal clear insurance is absolutely necessary in one form or another it needs to be ingame i am not against adjusting current system but if must stay because if it is removed a huge portion of lower income pvpers will be severely hurt the people that spend half the time care baringmaking isk in mostly safe way and then sometimes get together and go for a roam and have fun meaning a lot of casual players
qft hisec dwellers use the real life comparison of insurance companies not paying out bank robbers cars then conveniently dispose of the rl analogies when it comes there own practices if we are going down that realism route which in eve is usually bad then we can point out that using ur company leased ford mondeo in a vigliante attack on local criminals would also not be covered by any sane insurance companypoint  remove insurance for suiciding then remove it for missions tooi also agree that eve needs to remain dangerous the constant level of danger even if in hisec it is relatively low gives this game its atmosphere pls dont take that awayedit also ships can be fitted with modules other than cargo expanders ya know mods that will prevent suiciding at a cost when did eve start rewarding greedlaziness these mods are there for a reason
works for me a concorde that doesnt always get its man and not considered a exploit if u do but this needs to be damn difficult  may i suggest the higer the sec the  of insurance payout is decreased if losing ur ship to concorde and a debuffing of concorde in areas below 10either way concorde definately needs looking at as well as insurance
absolutely rather than just insta omg wtfpwndead and then all is forgiven after 15 mins how much better would it be to have a slightly less omnipotent concord leading to high speed chases to the nearest losec gate with concord holding a grudge for rather longer till the following downtime say so that suicide ganking becomes the preserve of the highly skilled bandit executing a wellplanned in a carefully fitted shipto my mind this is infinitely better than the current spawn farming style of ganking in every way
its foolishly simple to evade factions that give chase in fw malitias have often gone into opposing trading hubs with a competent fc and have managed to get kills there while evading the faction policei like the thought however thinking that itll make suicides harder is false you cant remove instawarppwn and also have them give chase or youll have free reignoh and also i support removing all insurance
how about remove insurance for concord response and self destruct and in exchange remove the evading concord exploit and increase the response time of concord to a believable levelie so its no longer considered an exploit to evade concord pwnagesry slowpoke
just to be clear from the start i never suicide ganked anything my opinion goes like this you bassicly want to make suicide ganking harder to do by removing insuranceyour main argument being but the police destroyed them  what about that raven you lost to guristas and that you were repaid  didnt you look for it a little  why would the insurance work then bassicly and ccp know it  insurance was put in place to help the newer player cope with the harshness of evethe problem atm isnt suicide ganker the problem is player moving around with billions in cargo and thinking that no one will shoot at them so the suicide ganking is possible because a profit can be made of it insurance just reduce the amount of isk required in a cargo in order to do it  but realise they are trading sec status for a profit and anything is legitimate in eve as long as your intent is to make profit and at the core of thing every ship lost in eve is a insurance fraud  because the risk of dying to concord while doing a suicide gank is bassicly the same as the risk of jumping in ecp8r in your shiny navy raven so why should insurance pay for either of them  so if you really want to base your argument on insurance fine  as long as your recommandation is to remove all insuranceno concord thingy base systemtldr dont touch insurance unless you intend to remove insuran from eve for all ship and all pilot for any reason  else  its fine as it is move along bear
suicide ganking is part of the game and should be kept in it removing or reducing payment if destroyed by concord rather than just any criminal act would only make it so the cargo that gets suicided to is worth a little more than what it currently is with the arty buff its quite easy to suicide so perhaps a riskreward research and adjustment is not a bad idea
why dont you just admit that you dont like the fact you dont get all your isk back when you sucide ganki dont care if you claim you dont because thats what this is really about when it gets right down to itfitting up that battleship and not getting your monies worth yep makes sense
so it sounds like a lot of the suicide ganking is happening against indys and freighters carrying a load of expensive loot gankers know this cause they can use a passive targeter module and then do a cargo scan on the hauler not much the indyfreighter pilot can do about thatso as my part of my suggestion on how to reduce the suicide ganker problem i would like to propose a new modulecargo scan shieldingwould of course require a new skill to learn to use this module with equal ranks in scan shielding skill on the hauler vs say scan resolution random picked skill from the targeting tree that sounds like it would be used for something like this skill on the potential ganker they could make it something other then an instant oh this guy is carrying five pith a small shield boosters
i have to agree the navy megathrons color change made decide on never buying it id never be able to keep my dignity if i had to fly a giant salad in space
yes they are lazy and chose to change the ingame item over fixing the paint of the collectible modelsigned although i see little chance of success since ccps art department is hellbent on their vision and although there are much more important issues
agreed  i really dont like it one bit
saying no to the salad issue megathron
when ccp adds bushes and trees in space then the camo will make sense
fyi found this post via a search if eveiversecom has incorrect data its most likely due to ccp giving incorrect data in their data dump or not giving me updates frequently enough never the less tell me anyway in case theres some way im munging it incorrectly instead id rather have the site correct when possible of course
hi allbeen doing some thinking about some things that eve could be better with one thing i thought of was how annoying it was that i had to add all my contacts from one character to my alts contacts listid like to propose an option in the contacts tab or where ever it may best fit to export contacts so they can be easily imported to alts and perhaps passed along to other players i imagine it would be extremely handy for those of us that use alts whether it be on the same account or multiple accounts
you cannot moon mine there whyyou cannot fire a dd device there whyyou need charters to run a pos there whywhy put out invisible barriers to another part of low sec 04 isnt that different from 03 space and some 04 systems are more dangerous than 03 etc etc unless you add faction policeconcord to 04 space there is no real reason to keep it more restricted than other low security systemswho agrees
agreed on that scoreread amamake one of the most dangerous systems outside of 00 in eve and its 04remove barriers that make 04 a complete nomansland with no ability for development but oh maintain the no dd limit no dd in lowsec if you please
i hate to tell you this but you can already dd in lowsec
im aware that the way eve is built right now it couldnt really handle the system tracking single shots hitting people who get in the way oops but it would be  in my not humble at all opinion a nice future addition to the game when the server and clients are fast enough and we all have multi gigabyte connections that shots and missiles could hit rocks stations your own corpies neutrals whoever while having a fight it would possibly make for interesting games at stargates asteroid belts etc and would add an fun new factor to fighting in blobs with a chance of said blobbers pwning some of their own mates while trying to pew especially the overeager ambitious guys at the back of the blob trying to shoot through to the enemy
and we await all the nice chain reactions outside jita 44 or other similarly busy stations that feature would add not much to the game except for load and griefing
oh man thatd be a griefers dreami scan down your factionfit missioning ship get in the way of one of your shots watch you get concorded and then loot all your stuffor there is the sudden wall of ibiss or other newbie shipsor barring that a wall of drakes in the front of every 00 fleets groups making that even more ednot supported
simply put this one is old and dry and to quote ms word missing that i bet you will attract more people if you changed itwhen i am on the homepage i am thinking unknown game played by old men which it isnt so unless you want to attract more old men i would suggest you add change homepage  forums to the todo list

hehe since you never bothered to read or understand what i written i will reply with an equally useless post
actually his response to your op was both succinct and carried quite a bit of information its not his fault you didnt comprehend it allow me to elaboratethe average age of the subscriber base is 27 this is a response to your claim that this is a game played by old men unless 27 is the new 60 i would hardly call that oldsubscriber base is rising this addresses your claim that the game is unknown and not attracting new players the fact that you dont particularly like the homepage or the forums isnt really all that exciting tbh
i understand it is fun to make a thread on caod that says happy birthday x alliance or y corp and watch all the responses you get but really these birthdays threads are one of the many things that clutter caod who really goes to caod in search of birthday threads most people ideally goto caod to read about interesting developments drama wars etc not 10 threads that say happy birthday followed by the obligatory congrats for 5 pagesthis is one small step towards a cleaner caod make birthday threads their own subforum lets get rid of some of the noise that defines caod as we know it

i propose that when an alliance has sovereignty over a certain 00 solar system that the alliance would be able to rename said solar system there would need to be a profanity filter and the solar system should revert to having a letternumber designation upon loss of sovereignty i just think that it would add a bit of dimension as opposed to having letternumber designations it is a little bit more territorial to say that you have ownership form such and such a place to such and such a place no one would know what you were talking about if you said we own bnd16 and 8mgj6 and everything in betweem
i like this idea it would make smaller groups feel like they really own this space and its theres to name and stuff maybe make sov 2 a requirements so that the alliance has to hold it for at least a week to be able to rename
i imagine renaming systems is something that will take some database voodoo so its something ccp probably wouldnt want to happen often not sure how it could be limited with the new sov mechanics maybe require at least one lvl 5 upgrade in the system to rename it
while i think that 00 system names are random charsnumbers because the poor bastard ordered to come up with names ran out of ideas i dont like the proposal changing system names would only create confusion for pilots trying to get orientation and many other problemsid much prefer to see a ccp sanctioned submission and voting of names for important 00 systems which then get implemented in a more definitive way
who would change the names on all of my bookmarks crazy talk
i agree it would be a database issue but the simplest way to fix that would be to simply have the new name implemented during downtime the first 15 minutes of which is devoted to databasing
i like this idea and the new sov mechanics support it like sov 2 or 3 is a couple weeks so that would prevent it from changing often and like the person above said during downtime will help the database problemas for the disorienting players i find the random numbers and letters much more disorienting also it will give more to rpers and the bookmark system location names would change which change the highlighting i dont know why you retyped the name of every system in your bookmarks your crazy theyre still the same system underneath the name is just differentalso i believe the op is only talking about 00 solar systems only as in not constellations regions though constellations would be cool
this has come up before and ill respond to this proposal the same i responded to the last oneuntil theres a way for the naming system to reject names like l1ck my ballz and happy homos house of head then nonot just no but hell no

i do not support your suggestions nor your claim that csm is a worthless entity in a mandatory implement the most popular ideas situation influential groups could put forward stupid or selfserving ideas and get them on the development roster simply through having sufficient numbers to vote it to the top besides that ideas often require discussion to work out the details and identify alternative compromises that are doable when the original idea cannot be implemented anyone whos ever been involved in software development or any other kind of project with collaborative outputs knows that in my opinion playing devils advocate on behalf of the player is the primary role of csm and they are doing that csm3 notwithstanding perhaps despite your claims to the contraryccp is a private company with their own business goals and vision we pay for the privilege of using their intellectual property if we decide we dont like that ip or ccps business practices we can simply stop using it in a million billion years i would never support any kind of ridiculous notion that consumers of an entertainment service should have carte blanche powers over the company that invented invests in develops and owns that service hooray for market forces and consumer power and all that but if every single indignant whiner about ccp and how it conducts game development were to stop subscribing right this minute the player base would still be vibrant and viable the disappearance of a highly vocal minority of dissatisfied customers would likely not even be noticednice presentation but no support i hope that csm4 becomes the poster child for how the csm can act effectively on behalf of the playerswhich isnt all about getting changes pushed through by the way
ooh boy this would definitely attract griefers en masse to the forums privatears goons any alliance with a personal agenda would require its members to come vote this would be a quick way to destroy the game
no get more people to know what is csm and vote for the next csm so the right people get elected simple but needs doing

finally 
i support this but if you turn ms into this ccp i swear to god im burning down your entire country
i obviously condone this idea tamber
i support this
absolutely agreed last i heard they were streamlining the submission process which apparently is ccptalk for halting it altogether
either do it or take away everyones
it would be awesome if you could bring this up with the csm
agreed i also like the idea of 1 fw toon per account the spies really are getting bad everybody has a spy alt in the other sides factioni also strongly emphasize doing something about the sov mechaninc the fact that the gallente control 0 systems means absolutely nothing to me why because there is no advantage or disadvantage to winning or losing control of a system absolutely nonev for vorru
supporting the sentiment that faction warfare should be looked ator even reenvisioned
supported the fw mechanics need a serious overhaul devs need to take a look see what works see whats broken but repairable see whats broken but can be replaced with something better that does the intended job and see whats broken and should be scrapped completelythe very first attitude that needs to be scrapped is the attitude that fw is a stepping stone to the end game of 00 after all how many current fw corps have come from 00 into fweve is whatever you make of it whether your endgame is grinding out l4s while shaving seconds off your completion time by fitting the latest pimp combination of ship and modules claiming your own slice of 00 squeezing every ounce of efficiency out of your mining operations wormholes factional warfare etc point is any content could be seen as being end game content to someone so its time to consider all content as being equally worthy of development rather than having the attitude that because 00 is currently seen as the only end game that its the part that deserves the most attention all the time to the detriment of other parts of the game not just fw
i only ever dabbled in faction warfare with an alt but undock games and other empire mechanics made it lame as hell i encourage you to test the waters of 00 under the new dominion mechanics
sounds good to me i like the idea of buffing faction warfare i was in it for about 3 months after it came out dropped because my friends were heading off to 00 decided to go with themthere are a few things however that are as they are now for good reasons killing players for the lp for exampleit cant be increased ten fold because of the risk of players killing off their own alts losing nothing it cant be increased ten fold however it can still be looked atone thing i didnt see in your post i only skimmed it however was the lag i have heard numerous times and experienced it and seen it personally lag also needs to be fixed
well lagwise fw is paradise now i remember the first blob fight i was in fw i had my rrdomi warp to centerpiece only to watch my ship desynch and pingpong through the grid for 2 minutes and only getting back when i relogged and warped into the remains of a large fleet fest littered with wrecks and fortunately my side held the field i can only imagine what cap fights in 00 were likethey managed to fix desync issues so lag only really happens in lowsec when there are massive numbers of people in system like 100 fighting on grid but you can manage it disabling brackets drones explosions etcthank you all for the input everyone has been giving keep it coming guys
support a fw overhaul this could be a major piece of eve if it was redesigned lots of people are just waiting for a good fw model to be implemented
some lp for kills would be great would be because i do not get them at least usually some times it works and as i heard not only i but i do not cry even if i receive the lp the amount is ridiculous and all we got for conquer all gallente systems is medal yes it is cool but it is only medaland doing something with wardecs is a must in my opinion petition did not help
some of us have and 00 now days is all about who has the larger blobor the more naps you should know you had to convince half of new eden to finally strike down bob new sov mechanics will hardly do anything about this its just less pos shooting
supporting a fix on fwthe op list several of the most severe troubles with fw and i would like to see that ccp fixes this as fw is should and can be the entry into the wider game play that eve offers
fw needs addressing as a whole and not individual aspects in a piecemeal approach supporting this
signed
thanks for the encouragement however the idea of fw is prety close to exactly the game i would like to play unfortunately the implementation is not really id much rather play the game in the way that interests me than play the game in the way that interests you
for the most part the lag is much better kudos to ccp for that however fw does need some tender love and revamping in its current state fw is incomplete at best it is more of a half implemented idea lets fix itv for vorru
signed
that is not such a bad idea similarly you could have a gas strip miner that is 15 x the rate of a gas harvester ii so it makes a hulk  45 x ghiis  similar to 5 x ghii and maybe add some bonuses to get it to 55 ghiis then you give the procurer a larger boost so that its single gas strip miner is equal to around 6 ghiisnot a massive increase on what there is now 65  20 but gives the procurer an additional role other than merc mining
btw this key mapping is not locked i can reassign or remove it as i see fit windows client
have there been any updates on this im hoping the new csm has the balls if youll pardon the expression to propose it correctly

while i support this idea unless we plan to bypass the csm with mass signing which ccp admit a mistake would never happen we dont need to continue signing since we have 1 rep supporting it already thanks sokratesz and that forces it to be brought to the csm time permitting

so you want a one time docking because you are worried that 3 titans are needed to kill a 25bn ship how is this different to a small dread fleet doing the same i agree ms need a buff but i say the pilots knew what they got themselves in for when they jumped in a msbuff the ms but dont allow a temp dock based on the fact that you might get 3 titans and a hic randomly on your ass imo if you died from 3 titans you kindda messed up in the first place
iam angry this is stupid either hp buff or docking rights

first of all i would like to start this on a very positive note i would like to thank ccp for all the changes brought on in dominion and i would like to say i am very happy with the result of the graphics upgrade and many other things as well but this is not what this post is abouthere is a proposal to update the current bookmark system there has been some talk around this issue here are some key things that stand out in my opinion1 making bookmarks able to be flagged for fleetcorpalliance 2 changing bookmark folders to databases which you can send to or receive coordinates from friendly pilots through fleet or corp etc without having create an item in your cargo jet it have the other pick it up and load it this game is how many millenia into the future with multi million isk ships and we cant bluetooth a set of coordinates to each othernow here is my suggestion even if ccp cant upgrade the bookmark system on the next release could we at very least take a huge step into improving it by calling it something other than bookmarksi believe for rp and just for general game experience it would be better to call them coordinates or something of the genre which sounds so much cooler then bookmarks i encourage everyone to post ideas for the new naming convention as i think just renaming bookmarks to something else would be something very easy for ccp to pull off and it would improve the gaming experience greatly for players like me all around the universenow i do vote for the csm with all three of my accounts and i do believe this is a valid issue with a very realistic request for change i would greatly appreciate if the fine gentlemen of the csm could support my proposal in order to have it brought to ccps attentionthank you very much for your time and consideration i do welcome any feedback you may havecomari vokha  wormhole getaways
i can drag and drop a ship fitting into corp chat have someone click on the link review the fitting and then save it to their library of fittingsbookmarks should be similarly easy to share in chat in mail etc click  see notes option to add to people and placescorp and alliance bms should be maintained as a separate tab by a director or similar you can drop from the corp list to your own list if you want make a personal copy but you cant add delete or modify them unless you are a directorcorps may assign the ability to addmodifydelete corp bms to some members  typically those with good astrometric skills etc anyone else would just have to send links in mail
definently the system needs an overhaul as a wormhole dweller i do this bms manipulations everyday and i can confirm thats its nightmare
the way bookmarks work now is archaic and annoying would like to see a total overhaul and agree that calling them something besides bookmarks makes sense
bookmarks are important enough to have a separate user interface tooli suggest changing the people  places ui tool for use as a places tool only where bookmarks will receive all the love they need perhaps the new places tool could be integrated with moondoggie better moondoggie bookmark management might be neededthe other people  places components such as buddies blocked agents and corp members could be moved into the new evemail tool those relocated components would function as inbox view filters appearing in the left column of the evemail tool characters whether npc or actual will from then on be forced to use the evemail tool ill look forward to hitting the npc agents with the cspa charge

definitely supported the only issue that might arise is that if a station is in low planet orbit say 500 km an inty could quickly mwd to the the actual planet which might create some interesting scenariosglitcheseditalso as previously mentioned that would increase the number of times you go through a planet which regardless of rp lore looks stupid maybe have the ship fly tangent to the planetmoonss surface and follow the orbit at warp speed to the station imagine a j shaped trajectorydouble editcome to think of it that might pose a problem when align to warp from a planet
i absolutely agree on this this would be very helpfulheck you can even just take the new mail interfacethatd do lol

yeah halo 3 call of duty totally dead right now
cod games were fun the first few days edit and the multiplayer was meh for a few days more p yet ive played eve since 2005and who the hell owns a tv in 2009 seriously
and electricity ill have to start using electricity now neva
well since i have an hdmi input on the back of my flat panel monitor i dont need a tv to play my xbox 360you do have a monitor amiriteim just sayingedit to reduce snarkinessthe point and the reason ccp is engaging in this exercise is because theyre expecting to get new subscriptions frankly while i am sure they would love to have every single player of eve online sign right on up for dust too theyre probably smart enough to realize that theyre marketing to two very different segments of the game playing marketplaceeve online is geared to a particular segment of the market  that being the late 20s person who likes a wide open game with lots of opportunities and doesnt coddle them too much dust like most fps is going to be geared towards the twitchy trigger finger crowd who are at least in my experience in the 14  20ish rangeadmittedly there is some overlap  i for example loved halo cod and medal of honor to name a few so i will probably pick up dust if it looks remotely interesting and has a single player mode that i can try but your false dichotomy of dust or eve really doesnt seem very logical tbh
rather than cutting it off let us orbital bombard the little sods to hell and back dwith mind bulletsand xl artillery d
pretty much this and some basic statistics to back up uronksur since tbh nobody else has i have four rl mates who play eve and all of them have consoles multiple allowing for the fact that my ancient original ps up in the attic doesnt count thats 80 on admittedly a very small sample i also have a crapton of other mates who dont play pc games at all but have multiple consolesits all about marketing to a different sector should it be disconnected in many ways it will be but i really do like the concept of elite corps of mercenaries that can be hired by capsuleers to deal with certain tasks taking stations taking planets etc it would be cool tbhwhat if they ruin your efforts to take space well should have got better mercs tbh same if your capfleet wont undocklog on in a time of crisis same if a corp theif steals all your stuff same result same failure on your part to sufficiently vet people you trust with an important piece in your eve jigsawtldr not supported bring it on
finally someone speaking common sense this comment is spot on it really frustrates me when people fail to understand simple market factors such as demographic multiple audience and profit ccp is a company not a charity and theyre trying to expand revenue  who can blame them for that
sadly i was just trying really hard to appear like a regular forum trollim not opposed to consoles much but ihave no idea why people prefer consoles to computers esp in this day and ageand second while i would probably at some point be able to play dust i dont think it will be popular unless its heavily intertwined with eve its politics and thus be a unique franchisesee most things dwindle and go into oblivion like those flies that dies within 24 hoursand thus dust needs something that will keep people feeling special about what they do and why they should progress farwell in eve this is at the cost of others usually and thats how its gonna be in dust as wellbut how important will it be for eve players that dust is alive and how much less control will we havebtw i have not yet looked at any writings about dust that goes into details about this but i will have a look
bear in mind that if youre thinking this is only designed to appeal to eve players that would be entirely selfdefeating i mean if i were to go and fire up my console to play dust i cant be also playing eve on the pc not without a lot of effort anyway this is about growth not giving existing customers more choice
dust connected to eve is ok it will be a flop anywayif you will have to decide what game you buy soem that all people know and want to play with you or some random planet shooterofc the first most of the console owners never even heard of eve and even if they did clans or large communities will not switch toa newcomer console gameccp doesnt simply have that kind of marketing power in us and asia to afford that if they would eve would have wow sized subscriptionthe entire dust will end on pc anyway with 40 discount anyone remember the time eve voice was payed and only 200 people bought it 
some random planet shooters halogears of warcall of dutyi love how people just randomly spew garbageand before you decide to flame me answer me thisthose first titles when they came out where did they come fromnowherethey where random shooters just like the restthey become popular because people tried it out and liked itanyone here who thinks they know better needs to remember that you dont you cant predict what will happen you know eve we dont even know over half of what dust 514 will be likeso please stop spazzing out will yah
so what suddenly we have to blob everywhere just in case we find a carrier i thought teh peopel didnt like the idea of blobs and were all crying out about the decline of small gang pvppersonally i vote for the if youre pointed you cant self destruct option i think theres nothing better than a slow painful death to remind people not to be so stupid soloing in a carrier next time or bashing a pos with next to no supportalso its not just about the killmail for the gankers its about the lossmail people deny it happened and theres no proof take it like a man and learn from it instead of being a

just used my suicide gank alt with my bro both of us in ravens with smartbombslanded on 6 mackinaws my first cycle of smarties got the macks his first cycle of smarties got the podsall mackinaws had at least 3 empty mid slotspersonally i dont think its the mechanics that are broken
i love suicide gankingaloha ackbar
dont afk autopilot and fit a shield buffer to your haulers problem solved
i have a suicide ganking alt and atm im quite happy insurance being removed is ridiculous just incase you make a nooby mistake and shoot someone on accident weve all turned the warning off and shot someone on accident beforeatm i make profit by buying ship insuring undocking and blowing it upi dont think the issue is with suicide ganking but base prices and hence insurance values need to be adjusted so you dont make profit by losing insured shipsrock
general thoughts on topic1i agree suicide ganking has a place in game therefore i have no issues with pilots doing ithowever a couple of points which i believe need further discussiona i believe steadfastly that losing a ship to concorde should invalidate the insuranceto compensate for this and bring balance i would like to see the nerf bat hit concorde pretty hard i would enjoy seeing the chases of old by concorde i dont want to see the yulai incident returned but make it so concorde use the same damn fittings as everyone else none of these godlike powers they seem to show like insta lock and insta armourshield melt weaponb or as ive already mentioned reduce the insurance payout relative to the system sec level ie 50 payout for 10 sec 60 payout for 08 etc etc2 suiciding ships for a prize worthwhile should occur but it requires to be difficult and costly  insta 10 for the pilot no insurance payout but with concorde nerfed it should be possible with planning prep and daring to take the prize and leg it with concorde burning after you and to be able to get away with minimal losseswill make for a interesting empire anyway lolor keep it as it is the stupid will always be stupid  hauling high value items afk in crappy haulers ect but it would be nice to see more realistic police force without the power of god and obvious technology thousands of yrs ahead of the current tech used by pilots and the racesissue of suicide ganking etc includes 2 major points that walk hand in hand  insurance and concorde both need to be looked at and and brought in line closer to realism as possible
the day you can no longer cuicide gankk for profit or for grief is the days eve becomes wowit does not matter what you do in eve is for proffit or for your own personal amusement because it all contributes to end user satisfaction of the game ie sucsesseful gankk  happy gankker unhappy victim or failed gankk  unhappy gankker and happy pilot that got awayplease understand that the system that allows to gankk also allows more freedom limiting gankk is limiting other aspekts of freedom in eve so its not plain and simpple issua as to remove suiciding as it is to implimenting a ways to bring nonconsensual interaction for players before restricting something that is only way for killing othervice 100 untouchable npc corp huggersbefore you cant propose beter alternative for cuisiding removing it compleetly is out of questionits little same thing with local chat being allseeing inttel tool its must be reworkked and removed but before it is we need to get something that replases it as a inttel tool other than spamming scan every 5 seconds to be atleat viable inteligence toolin nut shellyou dont need to explaing your actions in eve thats what makes this game gratealso mandatory empire space is safer not safe
almost all penalties for crimes in eve come down to a monetary penalty you lose your ship if you can perfectly predict that loss and that loss is low almost any crime will become profitablesuicide ganking for profit is the problem i believe suicide ganks are meant to settle scores or really show you are prepared to lose something to try and kill someone the faster response times of concord have made that harder suicide ganking should never be a generally viable business model it is just not believablecurrently suicide ganking is very viable due to the insanely low cost of losing an insured ship if bankrobbers only had to pay 100 for every bank robbery attempt you can bet many people would be robbing banks fix insurance not with respect to suicide ganks but in general
nothing says that a changed concord has to be as ineffectual as faction police and extended aggro means that you only get 1 attempt per day not one every 16 minutes

supporting my own proposal
during the campaigning period for csm 4 one of the issues that was brought up was to do with the marketplace dierdra vaals votematch site featured a question about whether modifying prices of your orders should have to be more than 2 of the unit price this was a terrible idea and anyone who voted yes to it is dumb however the actual problem should be fixedthe problem is that bulk buying and selling is more of a job than it needs to be  particularly in remote markets far away from your normal base of operations because the current system encourages competitors to list their offers at a trivially better price certainly for high volume items with a decent profit margin such as commonly used ships and mods working the market often involves multiple modifications a day just to keep your orders competitivemy suggestion is to bundle together buy or sell orders that are very similar and treat them as a single order on the market to do this the market takes all orders of the same type same item same location and within a given percentage of the order price and creates one listing on the market this listing has the total number of items from all the amalgamated orders and the average price a simple median average between the highest and lowest in the range any new sell orders that are within the given percentage of an existing order price say 2 or 3 will be rolled into this general order and the order price will be normalised at that average price purchases from this order would be filled from the smallest sell order that will meet the buy requirement  so if three people a b and c are selling 200 500 and 1000 items of a type respectively and i want to buy 400 of those things then ill take most of bs stock if i wanted 1100 then id clear out c and take 100 from awith buy orders things get a little more complicated because there is also a range on them and a minimum buy amount this is solved by only combining orders with the same range selection its important that buyers are able to choose the station they want to buy from so this has to remain open buy orders with a minimum buy amount are also amalgamated and the lowest minimum is displayed to the buyer in this case the order would be filled by the smallest volume order that has a minimum quantity of less than the amount being sold and which requires the volume for saleassume person a wants 200 of an item and has a minimum quantity of 50person b wants 500 and has a minimum quantity of 100person c wants 1000 and has a minimum quantity of 50if i sell 70 units then a will buy them all if i sell 400 then b will get them if im selling 1100 then c takes 1000 and a buys my remainder this means that high volume buyers and sellers are matched up without disadvantaging smaller ordersunder this system if someone wants to undercut or overbid then they have to offer a substantive discount and not a meaningless decimal difference prices will still fluctuate this doesnt remove the competitiveness from the market or reduce the choices that players make in buying or selling their stuff it just makes the 001 game redundantdiscuss and suggest improvements below
sounds like what you will get is people undercutting bellow the bundling percentage until there is very little profit hurting the smaller producers and would only add a new headache calculating what that undercutting price will beand then selling the smallest orders first could mean trouble for the large producers as new orders are introduced very quickly in markets like jita and they often need to check and undercut at a high rate to keep selling their stock while a small producer generally dumps his load and never checks again till a few days not really supporting this but how about sales according to market powerie producers a b and c hold 20 30 and 50 percent of the total amount of an item on the market respectively if buyer x buys 10 said items then he will get 2 from a 3 from b and 5 from c
so to undo the slap in the face to naglfar and phoenix pilots please change the citadel torpedo operation skill into citadel missle operation which will cover both citadel torpedos and citadel cruise missles ccp just took all naglfails and phoenixs out of capital fights for a month as their pilots now have to train the near useless skill of cruise missles v not to mention the new change vastly increases the training desparity for the naglfar and now puts the phoenix in the same boat as more sp for less bang than their coutnerparts
what limdood said
mechanics could be set that the person is not liable for shots that hit others although that could open up the griefing possibility of two griefmates positioning themselves at opposite sides of the victims ship and firing at each other and hitting the victim but the wall of drakes seem like a cool idea a compromise could be that the ships computers see that something is the way of the target and simply not shoot if its neutralnot part of the targets corpfleetetc that way you get the benefit of strategic positioning of ships and none of the griefing possiblities
because that is what a sandbox game needs more situations where you dont even have the ability to activate your guns not to mention the use of neutrals as bodyarmor against hostile fire and how would missiles work selfdestruct or hit the neutral if they hit people will grief if they selfdestruct turret ships can shoot freely while neuts can block incoming missiles maybe even change missiles to instant hit like guns so we can actually ruin other tactical aspects of the game in an attempt to achieve another the whole idea is full of problems the idea isnt really needed and what is worst it is a huge resource hog huge waste of effort and resources for some tactical benefit and a huge set of problemsnot supported
the first part convinced me to vote in favour another tactic we can use and its realistic to bootand i think missiles could possibly be the only exception to this as these things can change direction after being fired they might just bump of a neutral and realign themselves instead of self destructing
im sick of it i went to hi sec and everywhere i looked ppl where playing the game and having fun obviously 11 is not enough if we want more carebears forced into player corps the tax should be 90 at leastheres a bunch of reasons why it should be made 901 because they make more isk then i do2 they refuse to come into lowsecnull so that i may shoot them3 rabble rabble rabble4 there arent enough 1 man corps in the game alreadyim sure you have your own reasons why the tax should be raised please post them here along with your support
ok granted the op is a troll but the sentiment npc corp taxes far too low is very truenpc taxes should be a slow progression from zero for the first week to something extreme like 85 after a year joining a player corp reverses that timer at the same rate so people cant just jump back and forth once a weekfirst week 0second week 7first month 11second month 22third month 33ect ect npc corps are meant to be transitionary posts not lifestyles
nice troll how about posting with your 00 main so we can come and shoot you a bit or are you one of those i dock up when they roam through our system guys
how about we just raise the noob corp yes theyre noob corps no matter what the npc corp members want to call them tax to 40 and call it good if not then i support an ascension of the tax over a year to some obscene amount but if you leave the noob corp your tax will start at 35 or something and start climbing from there again it wont start back at the bottombasically those who have been in their noob corps for years have told me that they dont join pc corps because they dont like dealing with politics and wardecs and whatever else they should have to pay for the right to not be wardecced and 11 of the 510mil an hour they make with level 4 missions is just not enough most pc corps have taxes higher than that so how is that supposed to get them to join one
frankly i dont think we have quite enough downtime in this game the hours and occasionally days of it server crashes with 1hour reboot times i find it all terribly exciting theres definitely some awardwining potential there
no to mention login cues they need to be much much longerin all seriousness what other webbased product out there puts you through the ringer in this fashion on as regular a basis theres no excuse for this but im sure well hear plenty else the topic will be simply removed
i understood it and oh boy i did read it i spent quite a while reading it as it took me quite some time to fully accept that your proposal really was as inane as it seemed your idea is idiotic and makes an assumption that is contradicted by all the subscription demographics surveys
i give up if you guys arent going to read what i said and just make up your own stuff then theres nothing i can do fair comment about the old statement but if you bothered to read old and dry you would understand that my suggestion is to change the homepage i never at any point said ccp arent attracting customers i just said based on the old and dry home page  forums it most likely looks like it is attracting old peoplebut apparently from my op you thought i said ccp arent attracting anymore customers i also said i am thinking it is for old men based on the design but somehow you read is for old men even though i immediately said which it isntfeel free to make up stuff i dont mind thats what free will is all about
we did and frankly its frivolous and based on a perception of eve onlines demographics that i refutedyou could always show us how we misinterpreted what you said but i suppose its easier to pretend to be some sort of martyr and whine about how mistreated you are based on the concern that the player base was old and stagnating when this is not the case clearly the home page is either quite popular or has no effect whatsoever on subscription numbers and demographicsand i showed how this was completely wrongclearly it isnt perceived as designed for old men since the average age of a eve subscriber is 27 we didnt you just had the misfortune of people in possession of logic and google seeing your thread
nice spin so your first post is random stuff that i never said where you are adding stats funny since i said attract more people but you dont understand what that meansnow you contradict yourself by quoting stuff disagreeing with what i say yet fail to quote the additional parts in the end you have just agreed with me and added some random thing about stats and googleobviously you are unable to admit your mistake and now derailing to google because a mainstream generic search engine really has anything todo with what i said if you dont agree dont then no need to make up stuff that have nothing todo with what i have saidyou bore me so i will let you make something else up and have the last say
no my first post was perfectly relevant your entire premise was that eve online looked like it was designed for and had the possibility to attract more old men which was factually incorrect as i showedyes because you thought eve was going to appeal to old men which a simply search on google for eve player demographics refutes a search engine helps you find things like statistics that refute your idiotic premiseim not making anything up its not my fault your suggestion was based on such a stupid premiseah the i am a martyr appeal for sympathy
i am web designer and i must say the website is ok it cannot be simpler or nicer simply due to huge amount of information for site with this amount of info its structure is nice easy to find what im looking for and graphics is not that badfor new design browse to dominion site where you lack any info 
proposal that every cosmic anomaly have a clearly marked structure that will cause the anomaly to despawn if all rats are killed and the structure destroyed
contact me in game ill help you to find c2c3
no
given that 95 of the rubbish that clutters up this game is irrelevant id say your idea is not completely terrible maybe just use the forum as a trap anyone who posts there would get taken behind the barn and the problem would solve itself
lol i can see both sides i mean it is a bit pointless but then we did it too and got some old members and friends calling in on the thread and saying hi which was niceits difficult to know what caod is for though to be honest if you get rid of nice threads like these they tend to be nice normally i didnt see too many people calling us out on our terrible alliance history  then caod will pretty much be 50 lies and 50 propagandai dont know maybe it belongs alongside the recruitment stuff anyway not supported for now convince me otherwise and i might change my mind
except that as its your space youve onlined a gssc or whatever the op wants to call it so you do in fact still know what you used to know before ie that the cloakys are there  somewhere only if you dont bother to fit this upgrade will you not see local according to this proposal or it would be an opportunity to go and take that space and set up your own communications structure and as an aside god forbid anyone should have to use scouts omg thats like hard mode or somethinggood idea op its the best ive seen on this topic in my viewedited for failquoting and failtoticksupport
a rather good idea if i may say so
i agree with this assessment at first glance it looks like a good idea probably needs some tweaking in the area of balance it makes logical sense with the way things are being implemented in nullsec atmsupported
i dont think this is a particularly good idea now dont call me an expert or anything but basically nobody will spend their rps on datacores for a year building up the rps for a blueprint then get the bpo never need datacores again and omg there goes another piece of the market datacores to zero t2 prices crash after rocketing whilst everyone hoards their datacoresalso what rps are you proposing you would need items generally need more than one type of datacore often not provided by other agents of the same corporation are you suggesting the rps should be combinable across all corps  factions into a single buyyourshinythingshere galaxywide rp storetbh after typing all that i now feel like ive been trolled by a grumpy inventor with the wrong decryptor
this this is what makes eve what it is after all it is a cold dark harsh place and knowledge is what helps you surviveyou can get tablets  
almost every patch since i joined eve was accompanied by issues that appeared rather easy to be spotted and fixed yet they still made it into the version deployed on the production system tqexamples include the jump gate bug people getting stuck after using a star gate not being able to patch or clients refusing to continue after the splash screenexamples from the time before i joined include the infamous bootini disasteridea introduce a eg 2 week delay for releases to mature on sisi before moving them to tqi always thought the test system sisi is not really used that much and that a lot of potential is being wasted there now i know that sisi is already used for some tests eg large scale fleet battles but it still seems like changes are made till the last day before actually deploying on tqthe thing im talking about is making a proper release and deploying it to sisi and then doing bugfixes only on that branch for some time eg 2 weeks before deploying that branch to tq no more functional or nonfunctional changes no matter how smalli understand the choices for release dates especially for dominion but there is really no need to try to cram as much features into each release and ending up with ditching some of them again meaning set an internal release date two weeks before the official release and cut the feature list accordinglyi think the majority of the player base will prefer a smooth release they could test extensibly over a release with more features but also more problemsi also know this will not and cannot eliminate all bugs or problems but the difference can and should be that people can actually test and complain about issues without having their normal gameplay on the production system compromisedbut this takes time not everyone is interested in doing this not everyone has time to do this within a few days before the actual deployment to tq and not everyone knows about  can access sisi  we are not your testers but some of us would really like to helphaving a generous amout of time to test on sisi and enough announcements to reach most of the player base eg motd could eliminate a lot of the superficial issues taking the form of threadnaughts were seeing for every releasethere is really no need for users reporting i cannot patch  i cannot start  i cannot jump issues and i will be the first to live 2 weeks on sisi if i knew id be betatesting the upcoming release and not just some snapshotbut right now it feels like testing some intermediate release that will undergo a lot of changes before getting deployed meaning testing something that is not going to tq anywayban doga
this sounds like i want to help but i dont want to make the minimal effort so completely change the way you patch the main server in order to facilitate my unreasonable wantsno thanks there will inevitably be bugs in every patch i think ccp is already more then diligent in having sisi and opening it to anyone who wants in
could you explain the unreasonable wants partim not sure what it refers toeditor to phrase it differentlywhat would have been worse for you if ccp had deployeddominion 10 on november 17th sisidominion 101 on november 18th sisi dominion 102 on november 27th sisi dominion 102 on december 1st tq
so since it changes at down time have a dev say yes hell no to each request
hmmm  goatse gate  no thank youi like the idea in principle but in practice whilst you can name your system anything you like ill want my star map will always call it by the old name  the name ill search for when i want to go theremaybe if you have held sov for 365 consecutive days you can rename your capital in the region
worst thing in this game is that planetsmoons are not solid you can fly inside this should be changed otherwise it makes it 1995 game dont u think  scanners shouldnt be able scan out someone who is behind planetmoonstar hiding spots would improve realism and fun in this game otherwise is it too easy  if ure not cloaked
thiscan it be that hard to fix what about implementing curved warp paths problem solved right there with no drawbacks to speak of i also like the idea of using celestial objects to hide from scan
i dont mind warp thru planet warping is done light speed  so its ok  but the rest should be implemented and is not that difficult just make them solid we dont need mass gravity and other things just dont wanna see texture dissapear when i get too close 
i just get very simple idea how to do it as programmer i would do it like thisif planet closer than 350km than set orbit at 350kmelse fly free why 350km as found in wikipediathe thermosphere is biggest of all the layers of the earths atmosphere directly above the mesosphere and directly below the exosphere within this layer ultraviolet radiation causes ionization the international space station has a stable orbit within the upper part of the thermosphere between 320 and 380 kilometers auroras also occur in the thermosphere
problemeve really like to relocateresize my panels most often when i open one thats close to the location of one of the currently enabled panels this is a pain in the neck esopecially with the pinned and locked panels eve automove them anyway and i need to unpin them to move them where i wantproposaleither totally remove this feature or add a checkbox somewhere that allow us to disable it not all of us have 30 monitors our money are spent paying subscription already
good for them my favorite was this one seriously none of these amount to more then whines because ccp isnt keeping the game static which means that newer players can actually compete with the older ones

ok i am a hardcore pc gamer one that can play crysis on ultra high the simple lack of anti aliasing or shadows that are soft seems absurd to me i love the game in general and i could play it as is with no problem for a year except for this it absolutely drives me crazy what type of company makes a game without antialiasing or soft shadows it completely ruins the planets they have made not to mention the ships and it certainly isnt because one has a crappy computer they could just turn it off is it because ccp is lazyexample for how the planets are affected are the temperate planets ones with water and such the continents and such seem to be set as their own physical body and there are a bunch of jaggies around them i have tried to use work arounds and to no avail the jaggies are also right below the atmosphere the planets surface the ships are just horrid as they have multiple levels and bumps it seems and the engines used to hack the game to make the aa better only make it slightly better and you can still see the bumps
or you are just too lazy to searchyou want aahdr on nvidia card in eve premium look here
yes but this is flawed why doesnt a game that costs 120 a year have it
iirc the problem was that the nvidia driver normally doesnt allow hdr and aa at the same time which seems to work on ati cards cant check that as i dont own ati cards since years
which is why we need aa
finding graphics card setting that work with eve is like pulling teeth
exactly which still brings the point why ccp hasnt added aa  all modern pc games have it to prevent jaggies and the point of soft shadows is because the shadows have jaggies as well
please for the love of god bring us ships that dont look like infinite staircases and shadows that dont look 8bit
i approve of said message
i have to agreeafter looking into this problem for a while the best i have been able to do is make the game look nice but it dosent have anywhere near full aa also for me the shadows arent the nicest things i have ever seeni run an nvidia 8800gtx  so along with other nvidia users have had to fk around trying to find hot fixes  work arounds with no 100 luckyour best bet mate is to search google as ive had more luck with the latest nvidia drivers 195 somthing i believe together with the nvidia control pannel edit  of course try playing around with the lastest drivers and nhancer version 257  that should improive thingsso yea defo supported
also motion blur and depth of field plz  make eve look like the newer trailers
one person posts a fix that works for 15 people and you call the problem solved as it happens that doesnt work for all nvidia cards nor is the socalled fix applicable for every driver version youll note im sure that different people had to use different compatibility settings and not all are provided by default in nhancer this is not trivial getting aa  hdr working together at all is extremely difficult for some cards  drivers which is why valve spent time developing their own custom shaders to get around the problem and why they have aa  hdr available on their games  anything sourcebasedon the topic supported i couldnt care less about hdr but it seems incredible that after years of graphics development eve still doesnt have any aa support or testing built in forcing it through the drivernhancer can be quite complex and just shouldnt have to be done is this a professional game or not more to the point eve can no longer really call itself a niche game for a few thousand technicallycapable players mainstream games do this sort of thing in their sleep  its called being userfriendly
for the love of god give us antializing and soft shadows it ruins half the artwork that our dear art team spends so much time doing yes that solution of forcing aa does partially work for me but only partially and only on one of my 2 pcsit is damn important

it would be nice to see what z0d the take care candidate that mentioned bringing this to ccps attention plans to do about faction warfarei appreciate zastrows input and i agree that lowsec docking games with capital ships neutral reppers and an inadequate mechanic for this sort of thing make it lame go visit tama station and you will see what i meani dont know what you mean about the empire mechanics but many of us are in lowsec fw for the light atmosphere of fun dont have to worry about bubbles hotdrops mostly bombs etc although the new mechanics of dominion are luring it would be nice to get similar improvements for lowsec
sigh perhaps the biggest advantage of eve over other mmos is that there is no end game that no matter what you do and where it should be fun we should not all have to gravitate to 00 to experience bugfree fun gameplay
fix it for the love of all things good please
fw is very important to the story in the game but completely untouchable for anyone who actually wants to stay immersed in the storylantorn has been held by the amarr for too long we have to free our peoplewe cant  i have to work during the day amarr will have taken all the plexes by the time i get homefrankly if it cannot be fixed get rid of it at least in any way that touches on the story

very well supported though i must say i support any thread with qcats reluctantly for various reasonsdamar rocarionbrigadier general
easy to fix all you have to do is place a stacking penalty on killing a person over the cource of one week if you kill him once you get 100 of the reward you kill him second time the same day you get 80 you kill huim third time you get 50 and so on untill it goes down to 0 or something it slowly recovers over the course of the week so you can kill your alt once a week if you really whant to but its not gonna do much

when i first witnessed an incarnation of this an amarrian capturing minmatar complexes without being shot at by the npcs i bug reported it 60498 20080726 162737 the reply then wasthis is indeed the case there a minmatar just to cycle factions around a bit all sides have used this at some point or another capturing amarr plexes will get minmatar standings thus lose amarr standings so this will solve itself over time  actually rather quicklythis new incarnation is different though as the allied faction does not get any standings so the caldari fw pilots with high minmatar standings do not get any amarr standings for capturing minmatar complexes which in turn means they do not lose minmatar standings so this does not solve itself as the other bug doeshence i have bug reported this new incarnation of the problem 88013 20091202 193540 noting that the original design of this problem balancing itself out does not work hereno reply on that bug report so far
jade constantine i appreciate your naive belief that pie had honour but take a look at igs where pie is rubbing the new system occupancies in our faces and even in this thread they only give conditional support shame reallystill its not pies fault theyre only riding on the back of the inevitable damar wouldnt listen to them as hes on his own crusade
not being shot at by npcs at all or just that gallente for example should be able to help minmatar defend minmatar plexes without being shot at by minmatar npcs
kade the systems went vulnerable and were occupied by amarr forces of course we are going to rp this its what is happening in the game world i understand that its not fair that a bug or exploit was used but that is life sometimes its up to ccp to fix what is broken because fw is their projectthat said i support the standings issue ccp should fix it asap
this is not really much different from the speedtanking issue we had to deal with since the nano changeswhether a frig sits in the plex not getting shot at all or orbits the timer with ab while being shot by 30 npcs not taking any dmg is really not much of a differenceand yet the same minmatar that heavily abused speedtanking in the past and still do are now outraged because of this standing issueso who is being a hypocrite herefixing only one of this issues will only benefit one side while screwing over the other onealso since the plex mechanics in fw seem to heavily reuse existing eve mechanics i doubt that fixing this would be easy probably involves rewriting a lot of code and decoupling fw mechanics from non fw onesmaybe there should really be some kind of fw round table where all 4 militias sit together and formalize one csm issue covering all problems and then get the members off all 4 militas to vote for it aswellas long as the issues remain small and too one sided you wont get enough supporters
damar you are exploiting small e a ridiculous loophole in the fw system to remove the enjoyment of thousands of players the war that has been fairly decently fought by those players will be brought to a conclusion in weeks now by what will be commonly recognized by as cheating the system while ccp gms and developers have thus far failed to see the implications of this loophole i do not think it gives you free reign to act like this and destroy the integrity of the faction warfare conflict like a spoilt child raging against a lack of parental attentionif the war ends like this the amarrian rp community will never recover from the taint any 24th crusade corporation publicising victory posts will be viewed as sharing your exploiting of the game system and all that will be left will be the same kind of bitterness that stalked and ruined the black rise zoneto your motivation i cannot agree i dont like login traps it doesnt mean that i logout my entirely alliance at gates and perform such traps 247 to make my pointyou are ruining faction warfare for thousands of players right now either admit you are doing it for the agenda of griefing which lets face it is certainly an eve tradition or stop doing it unless the tlf players can summon up a goonstyle threadnaught on general forum of 200 pages in the next few days to complain about this situation then i cannot see ccp being able or willing or act fast enough to prevent the end of this warzone through this tactic
yes it is very disappointing to see pie making rp propaganda mileage out these system captures achieved purely through the caldari plexing technique i admit i expected more from them on an ooc levelwell ultimately if they use the advantage to win the war they are complicit in pies place id have simply wardecced these caldari for ruining the spirit of the war for everyone involved but then thats me  and im pretty wardec happy at the best of times
i can not blame pie for making rp out of it i would love to make rp out of it too the minmatar are supposed to be the underdogs and hell my alliance has been saying well be losing the war fast if its started so it actually fits into my rp background  but its just not possible to go uh well the caldari have brought a large group of barely trained pilots that are not being shot at by our fleet if they are capturing the complex and we failed to set up regular 12oclock fleets and im not helping because the republic doesnt want my alliance to help   the bugginess of the mechanics makes icerizing the whole thing absolutely impossible for meon the other hand i am not worried about losing systems that just means there are more options to capture them backwhat i am worried about is that the minmatar militia will lose active pilots interested in plexing because losing is demoralizing thus breaking the nice balance we had between the amarr and minmatar militias for a very long time the lack of balancing factors in fw just means that the normal failure cascades in large groups have very permanent effects
yes the amarr could refuse to take the sys wait was that 3 minmatar systems being taken in quick succession by use of this bugwith respect players no matter what side theyre on will not care how a system goes vulnerable all theyll care about is that its in a position to be taken those 3 systems prove thathave to admit its certainly going to be interesting seeing ccps response to this as theres no way they can claim that this is working as intendeddestroying the warzone that was best balanced however was probably not the best way to do this had you done it from the gallente side to do in a few weeks what honest plexers have been trying to do for months then youd have made a bigger pointso what do you think dont look at it from the point of view of a leading caldari plexer but from a purely neutral point of view  with the use of this tactic could you reset the battlelines in the gallentecaldari war within a few weeks could you undo what dozens of players on the caldari side had put several months of constant effort into achieving
i have to ask why why on earth should you be able to seize an enemy factions military outpost without anyone trying to shoot you
then perhaps you could support the topic that calls for a fix to itedit im a doofus you actually did

fw has many problems not just the standing i believe there is an attitude problem with ccp in regards to fw for this reason ill be supporting the following thread here as that is a broader issue
i probably could it would be horrible and lame and gallente arewere already doing it such as val erian with his alt ramad noinacor and few others understand this we simply had to take this desperate course of action before it exploded on our face in our front let me repeat it already i dont personally like what i am doing but eventually someone would start it and destroy fw anyway it is better to get the attention to ccp now we tried for over a year in forums and bug reports no helpdo you think gallentes would be any different and honourable than amarr if the position was reversed no the actions in that nennamaila fight already proved it well enoughdamar rocarionbrigadier general
now after the sov revamp a full fw revamp would be nicei think it can be made into something usable but to make it into something really good you need to remove the division between plexing and pvping so you dont have two different and almost disjunct crowds for thosebut that would require a rather drastic change to plexing all in all and i have no idea what kind of changefixing the bugs and making it balanced even for vastly different militia sizes and participation is quite straightforward and doable so doing that first would be a great
aha so this is all about your own selfinterest after allyou have to put some more effort in defending as in use 10 untrained afk alts to sit at the buttons the caldari systems now because there suddenly are more than 2 people that can deal with overpowered caldari npcs so off you go grief the minmatar until they start posting whinethreads so you have your way and you can keep on defending caldari space with your 10 untrained alts
this is the first im hearing of this and yes it does greatly diminish the victories lets hope ccp acts quickly on all the fw issues though im not holding my breathas to the rp side i dont think it can be expected that we ignore the systems going vulnerable and seeing what the caldari have done in such a short time when she and the rest of the 24ic plexers have been busting their humps for just about a year and a half has really put mitara into a depressed state
it should be addressed along with the bug fix for the dodgy timers that keep going even when the plex is empty
agreed whole heartedly how that particular bug has survived in the wild for at least 8 months when it is know and reported ill never knowplease consider supporting this thread as well
to be honest the bugged timers are worse than the standings issuethe real and most simple solution to both of these and pure speed tanking is the requirement that all the navy must be destroyed before the plex can be captured
what makes the standings issue more of a problem is that the plex bugging can be petitioned the standings abuse cant so the former can not be abused on a large scale such as it is currently done with the standingsbut yes there are so many idiotic bugs its not funny anymore
if i learn one thing from this its that i cant stand plexers and their pathetic game ruining pendantry and oneupmanship whether they are gallente or caldari please just sod off all of you and take ur silly metadramas elsewhere i for one am sick to death of all of youedit tbh lets just get this over with all matari should just completely ignore all plexes let the caldari take them all and get ccp to do something about it so we dont have to listen to them and the gallente plexers ing on about a mechanic that means nothing to most ppl in fw over and over and over 
in truth no i dont believe that as long as this or any other loophole exists then there are people on all sides who would gladly exploit it no side is whiter than white when it comes to thati can only speak for myself when i say that ive never deliberately triggered off any of the assorted exploitbugs there was one time when i was forced to warp out under heavy npc fire when taking a plex solo repaired my ship and returned to the plex to find that the plex timer was still running no idea how it happened and no idea of how to reproduce it in sufficient detail for a bug report im told that its been bug reported several times in the past however by people on all sidesas to the plex i was in i got back within range of the timer and finished off the rats to successfully take the plex legallysomeone did say above that plexes should require you to kill all the hostile rats to close them on that id have to agree however there should be rats spawned from both sides to make it just as hard to take a defensive plex as it is to take an offensive plexthe requirement to kill the rats would solve the standings issue as the person running the plex would be aggressed to the rat faction it would solve the t1 speedtanking frigate issue as they would not have the dps to take on a plex solo and it would solve the bugged timers problem as finishing the plex would no longer require you to orbit a button just wipe out all the npc rats of the opposing faction before the other side can wipe out the rats of your factionof course itd damage your standings towards the opposing faction but then there should be consequences to getting into fw after all with the level 1 agent changes from dominion its now impossible to permanently lock yourself out of any factions space

there is a topic for shared corp bookmarks hereimprovements to the bookmark system are overdue
lots of really good ideas floating around regarding the bookmark system i completely agree that bms should easily be dragged  dropped whether its a chat window or email i am unsure of all the suggestions made but here are some others to consider1 allow users to copy bms from the bm window onto the combat view displaying an icon with its text label maybe even the ability to turn off text labels imagine access to a handful of bms immediately without the need to scroll through the bm window or to even need it opened taking screen real estate it would also be nice if the user can place these bm icons in any place within the combat view maybe even set the icon size andor even copying of bm folders kind of like what users do everyday when they create shortcuts on their desktops2 when editing the label of a bm eve does not prevent you from using other windows3 give users the ability to assign colors to bms nothing crazy just a small palette of colors naturally if the bm can not be used it still remains grayhopefully ccp can take some time to start hammering out some of these critical gameui changes nice thing about these kinds of changes everyone benefits
as mentioned by almost everyone of you warping through objects just looks silly right now i agree but i think to avoid that planets are revealed as flat circles with a texture there could be created an effect like fading out the sourrounding as you warp through a planet just for a second it could look like the planet itself would create a shadow in warp just because of its mass it also would sound even relatively feasible to me
this and i want stars that arent all uniform in size planets that come in more then 2 sizes stations that come in more sizes i want a more obvious size difference between other ships even
a geosynchronous orbit requires a orbital body like a sattelite or a space station to be about 42157 km away from the planet any other orbital distance would lead this body to move either faster or slower than the planets rotation making communication with it difficult at leastand as we all know eve is always absolutely physical correct

i agree with you that there is a problem here for dominion so i am throwing in my support for a fix to docking gameson the other hand i am not sure that an extended aggression timer is the solutionin normal space why not let people dock up to escape pirates combat etc if you do not have a gcc then run for a safe zone pirates just need to tackle better to prevent you from doing soas for player sov space think of it this way for the dominion patch you are fighting on their home turf so they get the home ground advantage of local repairs it just means that you need a bigger force to over come themthe infinite repairs is an issue i see no reason that a person cant dock repair and region the fight its the fact that they can do it indefinitely which is the problemconsider these 2 tweaks to the system1  repairs are not instant armour  structure take time to repair and shields and capacitors need time to recharge in a station you pay and it may take 510 minutes depending on damage for the repairs to complete players should get the option to cancel repairs at any time if they are in a rush but this leaves them with some damage and a loss of any isk they forked outthe rate of repair is should be equivalent to about 23 times the largest remote repair modulewhat this also provides is time for you the aggressor while they dock and repair you get time to repair as well their repair station based is going to be faster than yours ship based but not immediate just make sure that you bring several logistics ships with you in a conquering fleet2  repairs are limitedgive the station a limited capacity to repair just like manufacturing you need to wait for a slot in the repair bay starbases in normal space have a huge limit to keep mission grinders happy but player controlled stations and outposts have very few repair slots which could be another part of the long term sov upgrade adding more facilities such as improved repair bays stations should also have an equivalent to a capacitor in normal day to day operations this will remain stable at close to 100 as they would have a cap recharge rate to remain stable even with half of the repair bays in use in a large defensive campaign however when you have ships of all sizes docking up all repair bays are in use and there is a queue formingthe cap will drop and eventually run out then repairs stop until the station can replenish its battery bankswhat this providesit does not set out to solve docking games at a normal station if a pirate goes after someone and they do not have a gcc timer then they should be able to dock and reach safety i do not see a problem with this at all if you are hunting someone and they dock up then wait get a better tackler or choose a different targetwhat it does provide is a limitation on player held regions of space if your cap fleet arrives to take on their cap fleet then you can take them down they have the home ground advantage but its not infinite and immediate you just need to make sure you have an overwhelming forceissuesthis could be extended to all parts of the game not just player controlled space but would impact on mission runners trying to repair and head back to a mission imo  tough eve is not safe so learn to minimise damage and warp out before its too late
you sir are right that local chat removing whuld make it more intrestingbut bear in mind that removing local is two edget sword that swings both waysyou dont know if they got more they dont know that either

for a moment this seemed all too baaaaw fest until i read thisthis is reason enough to support the cause
some of you need to realize that your small gang isnt supposed to pwn everything no blobbing isnt the answer but neither is it to nerf everything to hell because your small gang cant kill it in under 2 minutes jeez what next nerf titans tank so that a trio of hacs can take it down in 2 minutesif it selfdestructed then you caused damage be happy and move on stop asking ccp to nerf everything you and your buddies cant killnuff said
there is one more way a small workaround and that is to apply the same rule as with npcs that was doneif a person self destructs in combat a killmail is generated and the person with highest damage gets it note it has already been done and i guess it shouldnt be too hard for ccp to implement
whinemoar sorry you cant just gank everything you want and make profit
exactly see a target that your gang cant handle try leaving it alone pack animals in nature seem to have a good handle on knowing what to attack and what to leave alone pirates in eve are supposed to be like a pack of carnivores try acting the part for oncethe selfdestruct mechanism when viewed with the above in mind is a defense mechanism basically telling you that you picked a target too big for you to handle when such a mistake happens learn from it instead of coming here crying about itguess what smallgang warfare is a thing of the past small gangs of 10 seem to be the absolute minimum these daysfor fw i dont even want to know what the minimum size is out in 00and before you say itno the selfdestruct mechanism is not a major factor in that developmentand the op shouldnt seriously this nonissue argument is brought up over and over again solely for the sake of epeen waggling and eve doesnt need more of that no matter how much logic or common sense is behind any arguments put forward in favour of this its clear as day that theyre all used to hide the obvious selfish fact you want your kills easier and your killmails fatternot supportededit cleanup

i think even the suiciders are not finding much reason that any insurance company should always pay out for ships lost in commission of a crime and that could go to noobs too but noobs get a free rookie ship anyway and it would teach them a lesson such as this is not wow and there is no duelingno insurance on missions too why not i never think of things as screw the gankers give me a leg up i think changes to the game have to affect everybody in the same vector if suicide ganking is to be reduced via removal of payouts for being concorded then there has to be some balance to that point that losing a ship voluntarily means you will not collect the same could and this must be admitted apply to lowsec its logical actually for any insurance company back when i was a marine mechanic on the florida coast many of the large yachts had to leave the caribbean before the first day of hurricane season or their insurance policies were canceled this kept me busy because they had to be checked out before going to sea and heading north therefore why it seems very fair to revoke insurance payouts for those who decide to commit crimes and fair for those who put their ships into combat in missions and fw to not have a payout or pay a higher premium it would also be fair to revoke payouts for anyone who takes their ship into low security or 00 space too i dont think i personally like it but it seems fair and lets face it most of the pvpers who would be affected by this are either gankers or working for corporations that have plenty of isk and resources so they will not be crying as big a river as they say they would basically insurance is for accidents and losses incurred through a set of circumstances in a given contract most medical plans dont cover scuba accidents for example but you can get scuba insurance that could cover the cost of airlift and baro if you get bent and thats like 100150 a year missions faction war ganking in hisec and going into lowsec these are what no insurance company in its right mind would cover a ship for and a side bar about this realism thing it people dont want any sense of realism where its logical such as comparing how a real insurance company wont pay out for cases where the owner is stupid then stop it with the eve is hard get over it or hello kitty online is that way whats it going to be then if voluntarily undocking and getting popped is your fault then suiciding a ship and not getting payout is whose fault many who tout this anti realism stance while using game mechanics for a lowcost effort are fooling themselves and this is indicated in their attitude that suggest it was the fault of their target for well not being like them thus if the eve is hard thing is to be worn on the sleeves of those who want to rub the noses of other players into it then they should all petition for removal of clones no more clones thats it then and only then can someone playing a game chalk up any accomplishments over which they can in the real world boost their real life ego
removing insurance will just have more people spending more time mining or missioning or whatever else they do to make isk short of removing highsec theyll find a way to do it in relative safety the only real effect i see of that is a greater divide between rich and poor  the rich fly the fancy ships the poor stick with cheaper ships or pvp less given that by definition not everyone in eve is a pvp genius on average the rich will come out on top because as much as eve purists like to tout that sp and isk dont matter as much as your brain  experience they are only halfright particularly since some experience can be handedwritten downit wont even have the effect some would like of making the game more expensive because the market just doesnt work like that any more ironically all those people who will be on average making isk more will be influencing the market to provide even more supply because they too want some money at the same time as demand drops due to lowercheaper pvp activity youd probably find a shift away from iskbased economies to mineralbased ones as people try and mine their way to victory instead of buying it ie build and produce your own ships  modules with minimal iskrelated costslets also not forget that money injection is a good and necessary part of any functioning economy with an increasing population to counter the typical successful mmo deflationcould the gamecommunity cope if insurance was removed almost certainly would it be a good thing to do short term probably not longterm is for those with crystal balls id call it 5050 between the community getting harder and harsher and sticking through it and some reduced to poverty after repeated wars thinking screw this why am i paying a monthly fee for this masochismthe games got to be fun after all and if theres one thing that is based entirely on individual perspective its funabout time someone said that es me off when posters expect everyone else to be their identical twin the entire point of an mmo is that we interact in a varied way so why the hell we should all play the game the same way is completely beyond meedit i think at the core of this is the problem that there are two sides in a realism debate  at one extreme people who want absolute noclones harsh world total realism and at the other people who want a fun game that they enjoy and lets face it if reality were fun wed not be gaming
i like where the resulting discussion from this post is going but frankly i think its a pipedream no matter how you implement police in a game itll either be ridiculously easy to evade them or come across as random and unfair lets face it the eve community is pretty bright and ccp just dont have the resources to outthink every devious pirate in the game the moment one way of evading the cops is discovered everyone will use it ccp will change things people will cry rivers about how the game is getting easier because they can no longer exploit some dumb ai until they find a new way and well go into the same cycles were having currently with suicide ganking like this threadpeople hate to lose especially to seemingly random game mechanics and thats what concord would have to be to have even a cat in hells chance of being realistic and yet capable if on average in say 75 of encounters with concord the pirates are caught and destroyed then intellectually speaking its not a bad deal but for the players involved itll just appear random and annoying you cant outthink or outrun random consequenceshow exactly would you implement police to give a chance in a way that guarantees that even smart players can lose sometimes as i love turning the whole stupid risk vs reward meme on its head if theres no risk for smart players in this new concord there should be no reward so how can it be made riskybear in mind this has to work even if the player decides to log off or safespot or dock after committing the crime  any guaranteed no consequence route after a crime can and will be abused ive thought about it and i cant see a way of doing it that wont just be bloody irritating the best one so far is keeping the same mechanics but changing either the response time dynamically or whether they turn up at all eg 10 of the time they just dont come it doesnt strike me as trivial to implement anything more fun and id beg the question as to whether the problem deserves that much time and effort devoted to it
i do not wish to see insurance removal if you want to remove the insurance from a concord death then you need to put the concord reaction times back to what they used to be

yes yes i know the horse is already 6feet underbut i got to thinking wouldnt it be great if you could give bounties that only gave isk to your corpmates alliance mates why not and while were at it lets just make it standings basedcurrently the bounty system is open for everyone meaning its easy for the one with the bounty on his head to get a friendalt to kill him and send the isk over to the pirateif the bounty system was standings based this issue would become almost nonexistent im not saying to get rid of public bounties as this has some epeen meritsitll work like this1 global bounties remain as they are everyone can see them and everyone can claim them in the character show info screen you will see as usual the bounty available this would now be the total bounty hover over that number and you will see the public bounty isk offered and the standings bounty isk offered2 the bounty office now has the following tabspublic bounties  same as the current most wanted tabstandings bounties  bounties which your standings allow you to claimplace bounty  this is the beef of my proposed system fortunately not much will need to change everything stays the same up till the part where you searched the character currently you have a window to put your isk in and just a place bounty button in addition to this the new system will have 2 radio buttons from which you choose the type of the bounty public  standings to keep it simple all bounties which are labeled as standings automatically make the bounty available to anyone above neutral standings public bounties would still require the same negative sec status to place but that would not be needed for the standings based type of bountyi think this system would work best and would make the feature be used for its intended purposes more for example if theres an outlaw wreaking havoc in providence cva could offer standings based bounties if they want to get rid of him really badit might be a good idea to have an option to place seperate bounties for your alliance or corporation as it would make it less likely for the bounty holder to get a friend from the inside to kill him but it would also make the system more complicated which just isnt neededi couldnt find this type of idea posted so there it is
i approve of this message

really cause im pretty sure that currently no af in the game should die to itneither should any other ship for that matterjust warp offits not like the ret pilot can stop you
note that my suggestion doesnt simply fill smaller orders first it fills the smalest order that can handle the volume first this is important as it tends to match high volume sellers to high volume buyers rather than simply filling up the small guys and leaving the people with larger volumes in the coldthe issue with prices creeping down happens already and the market fixes itself routinely if prices start to favour one side or the other too much if theres no volume at lower prices then buyers will offer more and drive the price up again my suggestion doesnt alter that
edit support tick appliedthe actual problem seems to me that nobody wants to see hisher orders being queued up the 01 isk game only serves to get your orders up front again the 2 of the unit price rule could help in that market participants would reach the threshold faster where its painful to further raise or lower the priceyour proposal does the same but has the additional effect of masking the queue even further there would be several simultaneous queues depending on the volume of the order thats a nice touch but what happens with the many 12 item orders i guess there would be only 1 queue inside those lumped orders if they are served on a first come first served basis then your proposal might workthe only question that i feel would need to be answered is would it be better to 1 show the orders which are lumped together as one order with the sum of all the orders at that priceor2 show all individual orders allowing me to determine whether i have 1 competitor selling 100 items or 100 competitors selling 1 item each this would be the better solution imhoi could see this working out but nobody should expect higher profit margins through this measure this simply eliminates the 01 isk game by raising the amount by which you have to raise or lower your price to get to the top of the queue again and you wont be able to snipe in with a new order either
id rather see a combination of two approaches1 if two buy or sell orders are at the same price a market transaction will apply to both of them based upon the s for example person a is selling 40 units at a certain price and person b is selling 60 units at the same price if someone buys 10 units they get 4 from a and 6 from b2 the 01 isk game is a little ridiculous and i wouldnt mind seeing it changed to a drop of  of prices but only if combined with idea  1 if you can only drop or raise an order by a minimum of 1 not 12 thats too high but you do have the option of selling at the exact same price and getting a percentage of the market action it would change market strategy
do not support
it doesnt really because youd just do it as two operations raise your price by 2 then drop it after the 5 minute timer by 2001 to get the 001 isk reduction you were after in the first place thats why the limit on modifications was a dumb idea
in general a good idea aggregating several orders within a given isk range into a single orderanother thing that would put an end to 001 annoyances would be the transaction tax just make the seller pay the tax again every time they adjust the order or if they adjust it more than once in a 24 hour period
navythron has seven turrets vindicator has 8 thats a 429 damage bonus if you compare it to the same baseline as the navythron the drone bay isnt perfect but none is  if you want light drones stick them in its supposed to be good not perfect
navythron also has an 8th high slot an 8th lowslot more drones half the cost etc etcyour argument is a non starter
yes and no every other pirate ship has one thing that it does extremely well in addition to put out good dps with the bhaalgorn you have neuts with the nightmare you have an insane tank with the mach you have amazing speed and agility with the vindicator i think it still does need a bit of love in some way or another to put it on par yes it has the highest damage capacity of any pirate ship but to me the difference of 200 or so dps between a vindicator and a navy mega isnt worth double the price tag id love to see it get a bigger damage bonus so it can put out 2k dps with good skills and still have an ok buffer tank but regardless of what buff it gets i think the vindi does need some loving to put it onpar with the other pirate battleships
im proposing that taking a fw plex while taking advantage of npcs not shooting a pilot in the odd faction is classified as an exploit until it gets fixed ie a matari militia pilot with good or no caldari standings taking caldari fw plexes for the gallente dont let some jerks ruin whats left of fwedit and yes i am complaining due to it happening to the matari now essentially because i didnt know it existed before and no i wouldnt use it against the amarr its lame
ccp refuses to name the magic timer countdown an exploit too despite me whining to devs for months and months and people that abuse it systematically being reported over and overin my opinion tear down the system capturing aspect of fw and send it back to the drawing board its full of bugs and fundamental game design flawsthe standings issue is lame as hell and i asked to ccp to get it fixed in july 2008 they would look into it like they promised to look into basically all fw issues i raised thing is that the standing thing doesnt provide that much of an advantage yes you can capture plexes solo and unhindered but thats what the caldari and minmatar could do with t1 frigate alts anyway nothing new there
i have been saying for years that ccp need to put a watermark or something on bpos so we can tell them apart from bpcsdoes anyone agree and if so can we get this implemented imo it would not b a big deal to do it and would save alot of frustration for us
this has been asked for before and according to ccp it would in fact be a big deal
perhaps then it is time for big deals this blueprint bpobpc issue is annoying me for years now skip the next expansion then and redesign this blueprint stuff honestly
the underlying mechanic of claimed complexity cant be so difficult to implement as some of the stuff that theyve had in the game for years and never fixed to work right no ability to sort corporate assets ect blueprint original and copy definitely need some method of visual distinction between them
so we all love the new evemail system and so on but theres still one very very annoying problem with it all mails sent go directly to your inbox and even though you can set labels you have to set them for each mail and each time a new one comes in you have to set labels for that mail aswellso solution is let us separate received mails please 
let us set up some rules for teh emails
i obviously support this 
this just one of the many features that could have been gained with pop3 or imap instead of proprietary evemailgmail already has filters
you can set the labels to multiple evemail by highlighting multiple ones then you remove the inbox label bit more cludgie but better then 1 at a time
yes but any new mail that comes in is still gonna go to your inbox so it takes a bit of the annoyingness yes but it doesnt solve the problem 
while i am aware that this is hardly a new topic i have a dream that one day ccp will realize that missiles need a boost to be more pvp friendly to that end i propose the following changes1boost missile velocity by 75200 while reducing flight time so that range is unchanged2eliminate the guided vs unguided missiles distinction so that signature radius reduction applies to all missile types3specific missile changesrockets 100 damage increase minimum explosion velocity 1000 mslight missiles minimum explosion velocity 800 mshams 25 damage increase minimum explosion velocity 600 msheavy missiles minimum explosion velocity 400 mstorpedoes minimum explosion velocity 200 mscruise missiles 25 damage increase minimum explosion velocity 300 ms
first i began to felicitate you for your effort in trying tofind a way to make the naglfar a competitive dreadhowever i do not agree with your solution the new missile skill make trainning for matar more long but i dont think the problem is in the learning time i think ccp need to adjust the bonus naglfar before anythings else its not 2025 days that make the naglfar not worth it in the moment its his lack of efficiency compare to the others dreads
its not 2025 days anymore its now nearly 40days longer training than the moros and revalation and 2025 days longer than the phoenix what can ccp do to make up for that kind of training desparity
this is a serious issue that has run rampant lately the activities of creating and disbanding alliances really need that confirmation windows every aspect of the game except alliance management has confirmations i cant spend 1 isk on anything without a confirmation popping up which can be shut off yes i realize but there isnt one at all for alliance stuffi am not talking about timers or votes or anything else previously proposed just a window that says are you sure you want to do this yni accidentally created an alliance because there was no confirmation a pure waste of a billion isk for nothing all because of a lack of confirmation
better vote here
nope this isnt the same thing this is a simple confirmation would you like to do this yn not some mechanic to make it harder to do it mynxees idea is a good one also but its not the same thingedit seems i already supported that thread anywaybut if that isnt implemented id like this treated separately
as part of the warning consistancy and in addition to the main alliance thread i support this
supported
yeah this could be handy
disagree  i like there being some kind of progression that isnt just concordgate gunsnothing 04s status as semilowsec is good for that imo
they eliminated most of the really abusive fleet interactions when they brought in fw if you go around joining random fleets im not going to feel a huge amount of pity if you walk into a scam and without that concern this seems reasonable as long as we can sort it
how about we just eliminate locked keybinds entirely
sounds good to me
since csm members come from a diverse background and time on eve to better be able to test and evaluate issues brought forward it would be of great assistance if they had access to all aspects of eve for testingin that vain i propose to have csm members and alternates have their skills on sisi set to level 5 so they can better test the issues set before them
in that aspect to help us see issues and problems that need to be addressed arranging sisi demonstrations by eve players could also help us better see any issue and bring them forward to ccp after seeing them first handz0d
should add support for the idea
i concur
it makes sense to me
naturally then you will not see the issues brougth for by having low skills you can always ask to get a specific set of skills increased fo some specific testing and if some dev has the time and you give a good reason you will get them
supported
what exactly could you test that had actual value to any issue not any ship balance or weapons issue since those are either obvious to any observer when presented with the data or require actual knowledge of how it all comes together on tq to understand if there is something that doesnt work or need improvement surely the descriptions of those affected are enough for you to see the issue or if they arent you can ask for clarification on the problem so could one of you describe situations where this would actually contribute something meaninful to the process if you dont know the game and have low sp why did you even try to get to the csm im not trying to claim you need to be a vet to apply but the few valuable things such a person could provide to any discussion is the low sp newbie perspective the actual people who do it on a regular basis on tq know it better though and sisi testing isnt going to change that
i dont see why this would be a bad thingtamber
counterargument when it comes to things like ship balance using a perfect vs skillset to test with could be just as misleading as not having the skills to fly the ship at all
i dislike the idea of creating a privileged class of players even on the test server if messing around with skills is necessary for testing its necessary for all players not just csms now that said i think it probably is a good idea but it shouldnt be a csmonly thing remember the plan of giving it to everyone was rejected by a past csm not by ccp
if that goes trough anyone should be able to alter skill levels on sisi its really hard to get all people with necessary skills to sisi at same time to test thing or anotheredit also factiondeadspace items should be available on test server ofc it ruins ffa but who cares p
idea introduce reverse auctions as a new contract typefrom
already in gameitem exchange auctions want to buy but are generally only used to grossly undervalue the item sought so are generally universally ignored
actually theyre notthe word youre looking for here is tenderbasically its like putting out a buy order and then having players undercut eachother until the deadline is reachedim not sure itd really work but it sounds like an interesting idea in concept
per this thread on the general discussions page it is apparent that ccp overlooked at least some of the nondefault newbie and temporaryfallback npc corps regarding the new 11 tax instituted in dominion it is fair and reasonable that the tax should be extended to all npc corps as there are apparently old characters who remain members of corps like ishukone who are not currently affected by the tax furthermore since players in the newbie corps and temporary npc corps ie garoun investment bank aliastra etc are now paying something for the wardec immunity those corps enjoy i propose ccp allow players to join any npc corp of their choice let a personal standing of 50 with a corp be the cutoff to enable joining rpers would benefit from this as well this is a small and unimportant change in the broad picture but it shouldnt require much effort to implement will fix an error and will give a small community of interested players more options in the sandbox if you cant articulate why this would be a bad idea please support
selfsupported
actually this has come up in fi plenty of times after lengthy discussions some of which centered on how its pretty much impossible to implement at the moment server update cycle  internet ping for starters are about an order of magnitude too slow several things came up  it makes formations and fleet combat vastly more complex and tactical because you can no longer shoot through your friends it makes missiles more complex in terms of their fuel  range because they have to alter course around obstacles it offers cover in the form of stations and asteroidsthe whole concord thing is a major thorn but when presented with one unrealistic scenario its easy to add more to solve such things such as unintended fire in highsec merely dissipates due to superclever tech that only concord have that they installed in highsecsummary fun concept pointless to discuss now as the technology needed is probably thirty years away so what the hell ill support but its going nowhere
overseer effects got severely nerfed with dominion with the loot table being completely random many times they are the only source of income from a complex especially a 1010
they just want you to spend money on upgrades before you get good stuff again or maybe you just get more of the bad stuff who knows
most corps i know have 10 tax and given ccp said the average tax over all player corps set the value for the npc corps it seems 10 is very common
you know what youre absolutely right lets force the npc corps to pay 100 taxesof course they might want a few things in return like instant concord responses and giving concord the ability to pod people with gccs but hey theyre paying for it now right so its fineor you could stop ing about the people in the npcs corps and go look for someone to shoot in say low sec i hear theres actual people there and stuff and guess what it doesnt matter what corp theyre in  you can shoot them anyway
develdrin i think he tried that lowsec thingie wasnt really successful it seems
if youre gonna resort to personal attacks mr carebear at least cite a place that has my entire record evekill seems to have missed quite a few of my favorite fightsconcord responds instantly in 10 but that doesnt matter if youre going to talk about paying for things in an rp sense of the phrase you have to realize that your corp taxes dont go to concord they go to the corp youre in and even if they did go to concord how could anybody expect a police force to respond instantly their response time is already at least twice as fast as normal game mechanics would allowand why would law enforcement pod somebody after blowing up their ship thats like the police shooting a criminal after theyve already wrestled him down disarmed him and put him in a position where he is not possibly a threat to anybody besides if their sec status is below 05 its much more fun to pod them myself why would i want concord doing it
yeah that freighter definitely gave you a fight that pve fit fleet pest mostlikely aswell especially 3 on 1 4v1 on a ferox is also a good fight so we are left with that 2 bc vs 3 bc  1 frig you got one fight and 3 ganks proud of itwe are proud of youand i leave it to you to find my pvp alt

new csm revised and tldr version of the last 4 years worth of the dead horse pos thread nice summery of the whole thing the thread linked is a new thread on an old idea revamped and brought up to date with current game mechanics and answers all of the current questions asked by ccp in the old threadjust seemed like the right thing to do tbhcome on guys support this and csm dont ignore it like the last 2 csms did and dont make a joke of it like the first one did

with the release of apocrypha weve seen corporations who took upon colonizing wspace and found out how important bookmark usage to navigation is for most of those corps the daily routine is a scan of their home system bookmarking sites and wormhole exits and then share the bookmarks with the rest of the corporation through the usage of a hangar in a poshowever this approach is highly inefficient as copying of bookmarks becomes tedious move the bookmark to your ships cargo hold transfer it to people and places then make a copy from your bookmarks back to the corp hangar and the information presented on the bookmarks themselves while in a container or hangar is practically nonexistent even if you check the info of a bookmark leading corps to devise naming schemes for their bookmarks that relay the information lacking by the game to the corpmatesa suggestion there would be a new bookmark handling mechanism for shared corporation use similar to the saved corp ship fittings one a corp role for corp bookmarks access is created with viewmodify permissions the shared corp bookmarks scb tool would work pretty much like the people and places pp one scb should support folders and subfolders for organization purposes scb entries should indicate time of the bookmarks creation as well as the system theyve been created in much like the pp tool does and finally the first creator of the bookmark when adding a bookmark a user should have the option to add a description for the bookmark much like what happens with every other user transaction which would be visible if a person hovers the mouse over the bookmark in scb or pp right clicking on a bookmark in scb should have an additional copy to function which would open a tree of the users pp bookmark folders to copy to much like the tree of available chat channels when a person right click on a player and invites them to one a destination should also be ship cargo hold if the user is not in a pod the same functionality should be implemented on bookmarks found in a users pp such as copy to  corp bookmarks  all bookmarks or copy to  corp bookmarks  user defined folder dragging a bookmark into a chat channel should create a link to the bookmark pilots who click on it get an information window with the bookmarks details name coordinates date added system description first creator right clicking on the link should pop the usual functions along with the copy to onesuggestions found on various sourcesidea by den mcconan ability to align to a bookmark locationideas by kirith kodachi make add bookmark able to be bound to a keyboard shortcut for precise bookmarking during midwarp allow pilots to show bookmarks in the present grid both in the bracket and in the overviewidea by wonko allow squadwingfleet commanders to warp fleet at any distance between 0 and 100km from a bookmark rather than just 0this bookmark management idea ties in perfectly with the game lore as well since bookmarks are nothing more than an encapsulated set of information including vector coordinates and textual descriptions are entities that can be transmitted through communication channels and there is no real need for them to be exchanged as physical items in fact and this being an educated guess here if bookmark management and sharing got totally disengaged from bookmarks being treated as inventory items it could help with the stress the database undergoes when bookmark instances are created as items need for speed initiative anyonealso discussed in the features and ideas discussion forum

moard dps100 dps more on paperthen the same class amarr bs with 3x lower range is patheticdo not touch fallof and optimal and possibile onlsy slightly buff tracking if you are able to tackle target properly and manevrou so you apply maximum damage good for you  if you cant then its your problemanother solution would be to do not touch dps but significally buff tracking so you could actually move while shooting but i prefer more dps verisionalso  self repair bonus on brutix is broken armor repairs  mwd  blasters  dead capobesides it makes it better shield buffer than armor buffer if you wanna keep fearfull dpsit should either have bonus for armor hp or speedagility
signedive been flying blaster ships since 03 and they are in serious need of some help really like gabriels ideas
hyperion needs a slight buff as wellwhy its a active tanking bs that is suppose to have fat tank and fearsome dps with blasterswhy it does not workyou cannot fit neutron blasters with reppers withought exceeding powergrid and you also need a speedmod and a heavy cap booster you cannot have any damgemods withought that resulting in you having pitiful tankyou cannot buffertank it properly either because you have only 6 low slots in pve it isnt quite as bad but still does not live up to its name solution8 low slots and 3 mid slots for decent tank and dps but lack of tacleewar eccm other supplimentary midslot modules a little more powergrid to allow proper fitting of the sayd ship blaster buff as sayd above in the difference of the op i would prefer a tracking increase so you can speedtank ammar ships at close range but either way would be satisfactory i agree that britux has a stupid bonus it does not have the slots for a proper active tank in the difference of myrmidon rof bonus would make it fearsome agility would be out of place imao 10 bonus per level to armor amount owuld fit the best imao
see this graph it shows the required tracking to hit an orbiting object based on the range it orbitsas you can see the closer it gets the tracking does not increase linear but exponentially thus a blaster has 5x less tracking than a pulse laser currently dealing less dps at optimal
very intreguing feature fraps adds lag to a degree which comprimises pvp performance on many peoples machines if this can be done inclient without a similar drawback i think the benefits to the player base especially us ceo types and ccps marketing efforts would be worthwhile

thank you to all who have thrown your support into this lets get ccp on it
i support this
already the case when you get a new medal it is set to hidden at first and the recipient needs to set them to active if he decides to trash the idiot of the week medal then the corp that offered it just wasted 10 mil for nothingi agree its a low priority issue however the bugs and limitations are very annoying for the roleplayers and medalwhs like me
all points supported would be very useful given the types of medals we award within our corp more than once ive wanted to award a medal to a friend outside the corp for exemplary support and would really like to be able to do that
please remove restrictions for who medals may be presented toif i wish to present one to a gm then i ought to be able to do sotime flux detectedyou are going too fast wait five minutes and try again
now i have been searching the eveonline knowledge base and evelopedia and for the life of me i cannot find a list of exactly what ccp considers exploits the closest i got was a small paragraph informing players to report exploit users with petititions when they see them well this is not really feasible when players dont actually know what is or isnt an exploitclassic example i had someone on the forums tell me jetcan mining was an exploit obviously somewhere a huge list needs to be made that highlights what is an exploit describe said exploit and tell us what arent exploits this way we dont do something we think is pretty smart and find when we log on the day after to find out what we did was actually an exploit and obviously so that we can hunt down exploit abusers betternow if there already is a list of exploits and i just havent looked hard enough it needs to be easier to find
not just yes but hell yes theres too many parts of this game that are still unfixed and merely patched with someone declaring it an exploit for that list of declarations not to be publicized
yes
op i dont know how to hack into a server farm and steal sensitive data so you should tell me how to do that so i can make sure i never do itthats what you just said the phrasing was different and the purpose probably isnt malicious but essentially thats what you asked fortheres a reason ccp doesnt publish details on game exploits its more or less the same reason you dont post your bank account number on a public forumbut what the hell ill support the proposal just for the chuckles if it actually gets implemented
i can see ccp not wanting a list since it gives people directions on what to do i think it will be up to ccp to decide on their risk management with this one but i support the idea of having one so players dont get screwed over by not knowing
doesnt read that way to me  it reads please tell us what is viewed as unacceptable so that when we see it we can report it or point out what is clearly an exploit instead of hoping the gms can figure it out and also when some idiot claims something is an exploit we can point to the list and say does it even remotely look like any of thosetheres a big difference between a list of howtos and a list of what was already in the past listed as an exploit as evidence of these are the things that if caught will get you banned its why in real life we have laws police and why ignorance of the law is no excuse  you can find out the law with clarity this is not the case with exploits  you have to guess petition repetition and hope someone at ccp is awakenobody asked for details  guidelines wouldnt hurt part of me says that such things are common sense but thats in such short supply these days
we already have a guideline  if it violates a game mechanic to provide an advantage to a small subset of users its an exploitbut im willing to give this whole list them thing a chance just dont be surprised when half the player base goes huh so thats how you do that and promptly goes off and does it were all human and humans are an inherently selfish animalhmm i think my cynicism might be showing today
not only this but the inverse would also be a problem well its not on the exploit list so its obviously not an exploit
wikisee exploit even if ccp posts a list im fairly confident they will still get petitions every day from people who couldnt warp because another player warp scrambled them or couldnt lock because another person put ewar on theman exploit is about intent you cant list intent if something is listed in the forums or wiki and no one from ccp says exploit in those locations i would think it is safe to say it isnt an exploit
that wiki article above me pretty succinctly covered what an exploit is i see no reason to post the list as while you may have the best intentions at heart most players will not and will use those to their advantagesorry but while i can see the utility of such a list i can also see distinct reasons why they would not list them and think theyre on the right path i do not support this measure
for those of us who hate slavery can we have the option of i dont know maybe freeing the slaveswe come across in game letting them die in spaceselling them onleaving them to gather dust in a hanger is just wrong hell as in ancient rome players could pay an admin fee to the state to buy the poor misfortunates freedom cue station sound effect cheerapologies if this has been raised already
thumbs on the left
just about everything you fw players desire has already been asked for in one way or anothernow ccp must commit themselves topic strongly supported
currently there is no reason for this one to get into fw even though this one was created specifically for that purpose with the way thigns currently stand i may as well go pirate to get some pvp training
when it came up at fanfest the blank looks from the game design team suggest they really dont have fw in their field of viewit was hyped then dropped the attitude seems to be 00 is endgame we dont want to improve fw it has zero priorityfw is a fine part of the game which is very fun who cares about endgamefw requires finishing it has not been revisited properly since release just put on the backlog and forgottenwe complained a lot the volume of complaints got too much for ccpthey added lp for pvp kills and made a devblog this was very successful at shutting us upwhen the feature arrived it turned out to be completely ineffectual its only real accomplishment was reducing the level of complaints

by the way before anybody says again fw dont matter and working as intendedi would like to change the fw occupancy thing to something similar to zerosec to allow us militia to claim the systems by the same mechanism as in zerosec this will also allow pirates to claim systemswith all consequences means an automatic nrds policy that means no enemy fw militia is allowed to dock anymore in claimed systems and so on and with the navyrepublic fleet npc of cause attacking all enemies means with a nbsi policy blue is friendly militiathis would make way more balanced and we would not need our own part of code but share the up and fate with the zerosecs still it is a great basis for roleplay b good preparation for zerosec much better than nowi say give the whole thing in our hands when we fail we know its our fault
i somehat agree with alicias idea it would be nice to have some sort of mechanics following nullsecs new dominion stuffi still like plexes though because it allows for an unique tactical situtation where you cannot outclass the enemys ship class it would be nice to incorporate a sort of plex with the dominion stuff
agreedwhile faction warfare still offers good fights from solo to middle sized gangs some of its mechanics are broken beyond belieffaction warfare missions are still even after dominion patch so unbalanced that its impossible to imagine why it was not addressed these missions must be tweaked as soon as possible by increasing the risk significantly reducing the rewards or maybe both they could cut the lp price to half and they would still be worth doing secondly giving more rewards for plexing and pvp just increasing the amount of lps from kills would be good start but i would also love to see more meaning behind the system occupancy and militia ranks
jUFFFD vinsamlega
not only should many things be fixed in fw but also the pirate factions should be added originally this was the plan from what i was told but for what ever reason its never happened
fw is a classic ccp broken promise broken mechanics and a promise to finish them in quantum rise which never happened the mechanics need readdressing and fixing from the plexs to the kills lp to the mission farming its silly and should have been fixed after release in empyrean age 11 not several years later hell at this rate it will probably be in the walking in stations 11 patch
fw has developed two distinct mindsetsthe pverp side and the pvp side success in one does not necessarily affect the other all one has to do is look at the calgal front the cal mil maintains occupancy on all available gal systems yet is without question losing the pvp side of fw the trick imho is to get the two to merge while still maintaining the openended nature of fw
please we want improvements in all fw areas 
replying from another thread as this one is more appropriatethe whole bunker concept is broken once a system goes vulnerable the task of actually defending it is neigh impossible  not only do you need to fight a big fleet battle where the other side can throw in everything they have you also have to get people to plex in other systems hoping that one of those plexes spawns in the vulnerable system so you can make it less vulnerable again only to get it once again vulnerable should another plex spawn there and you see it too latejust remove bunkers completely make it so that a system has a vp scale that you change with plexing at some point it switches over  no need for dt wait it just switches over and is called occupied by the other side plexes turn into plexes of the other side but its highly contested you now have to defensively plex in it to secure it more such a moving scale would be much better in reflecting actual activity in the areas
i dont agree with you there kady bunker fights are great but it usually ends before the defending side can mount a resistance happened to amarr before is happening to us now its been buffed before just not enough i think
unrestricted plexes should be that and not i managed to sneak two frigs in to take aggro and cap it while the defenders didnt know it was there 
probably due to the fact there is no notification that a system has gone vulnerable only way to know is to be there when it goes vulnerable
when fw came out it was presented as ccps gift to roleplayerswhat we are faced with now however is a set of problems so immersiondestroying they make the game world completely unbelievable by way of illustration here is what my character would be having to say to her government around about nowsee next post
dear san matar shakorfor the last 4 years i have laboured loyally on behalf of both our nation and our people as their freely chosen leader you have my unquestioning supportor you did having reviewed the facts of our current conflict with the amarr and caldari i feel there is something i must sayhave you had a ing lobotomyseriously how herbivorously stupid do you have to be to come to a set of decisions like the following1 there is an alliance that has pledged loyalty to the republic has served it for over four years and spent all that time waiting and preparing for exactly this war and you will not let it fight unless it cripples itself by atomising down to its constituent corporations we became an alliance because we are stronger and more effective that way not just because we fancied an extra billbut alliances arent trustworthy i hear you cry that would be why most of us are floating around with ratings like my own  the minmatar republic apparently considers me 98 trustworthy it lets me anchor starbases in its high security space most of its corporations waive tax on my behalf and let me use their medical facilities to create jumpclones but gods forbid i should fight on its behalf that would give me too many opportunities towhat exactly get our arses conquered you are already doing just fine on that front2 im not sure how it works in professional military circles but i honestly think our military installations might be more effective if they didnt surrender to the first person to make them dizzythis ties into my next point which is3 you should probably only surrender if the enemy is actually there after theyve left you can consider yourself to have been let off4 the enemy will likely be defeated much faster if you shoot at them i have found this to be a very effective tactic on numerous campaigns and if you try it i assure you you will be very impressed with its efficacy5 on a related note the converse is also true it may sound wildly implausible but making the enemy work hard in order to beat you should be a priority for any nation which stands to have its people shipped off in freighters for indoctrination into slaveryin particular it will make it much harder for the amarr and caldari militias to capture our installations and much easier for your own forces to defend them if you didnt mandate that all new installations must be set up right after lunchin closing i would like to sum up with a message to our fleet commandwhat the  is wrong with you
some good points well made

factional warfare is really in a catastrophical state right now  and since it has actual impact on the game it needs to be fixedkudos to those people whore still putting up with it but i dont see why playing a game should be a chore due to horrible game mechanics
supported  fw in this state is ridiculous
suported
very much supportedi see no reason why it should not be compulsory to wipe out defending forces in order to cap an enemy plexit also seems ridiculous that a militia is kos to a navy in high sec and yet ignored in low sec unless ccp wants to introduce plot to split up the two alliances between the high sec factions then allied militia should be just that and should be capable of capturing systems for their allies all that would need to happen is a tweak to have systems on the matari front switch between the empire and the republic systems on the other front would change between federation and state regardless of who takes them
this one does not see faction warfare in eve factions are not warring on each other or rather all factions seem to have agreed to a truce since navy ships sit in complexes and yes the caldari titan sits on top of caldari prime thats an uneasy truce herepodpilots may hunt each other and shoot each other some rp it some do not either way it has nothing to do with factions factions fail to react to podpilots actionsthe only way npcs react to capsuleers seems to be isk lp or dps thrown at them  that is a fresh bucket of sand is either being put next to you or emptied upon your castle in most cases players have learned to build castles which are resistant to falling sand sometimes they react with ingame content but that happens way too rarelyif by design capsuleers are supposed to be able to make a difference and some do try npcs must react to players fighting in their war in fw that may mean thata npcs participate in actual fighting on both attacking and defending sidesb npcs may or may not assist players effortsc npcs themselves set up operations in warzones which players may or may not assistd etcagain currently npcs are not struggling with each other they just sit there shooting certain groups of playersyes that would require a lot of work from ccp and gms but that is what i see needs to be done to make fw have some meaningfor now i would suggest immediate ceasefire until better so to speak daysedit supported of course
i know its pointless but i support this completely
i would like to fix broken things to especially since they are fixable and improvable things to fiximprove
supported fw is broken fix it please
ditch the spam improve the flow of informationi would also suggest that sov play a role in providing better intel on nonallianceblue people entering a system
1 it seems to me that the initial seeding of fw plexes is part of the same downtime process that seeds wormholes exploration plexes and all other temporary sites so changing this behaviour might be difficult or even impossible2 if you understand the game mechanics of fw plex respawning you can actively plex an area 237 so it comes down to who has the most active presence not the initial seednot supported
the postdt problem is caused by a special script that moves fw plexes the op has a link to ccps description of itthis is true as long as there is not just a handful of systems within hostile territory once that happens plexes captured in those systems have a high chance to spawn in wrong systems and be undiscoverable only to be moved back to where they can be discovered during dt if you cant capture them right post dt you will not find those plexes anymore during the whole day unless they accidentally spawn in one of the good systems again

to let people know i have put it on the agenda
this bug and all bugs in fw should be properly fixed so me and the whole 1st praetorian guard supports this call for changemeanwhile abusing this loopbugexploit in extreme to get the attention of ccp and so spoiling the game fun of many does not get our support we have always been against any use of loopsbugsexploits and will not actively support a campaign based on itfor this reason the 1st praetorian guard has pulled back from any offensive plexing a few days ago and now made it a corporate wide decision we will not shoot any bunker we will not capture any minmatar complex and will not put any roleplay based on this campaign on igs until the situation has normalized yes the situation before the 1st of december was not perfect but it had many moments of fun as a game those moment of fun are now gone and i dont know who i have to thank most ccp or damar or and ccp get your act together if you launch a game feature then you dont have an obligation to developed it further on but you do have an obligation to fix bugs and exploits
i have the greatest respect for 1pg for that that can not have been an easy decision
support this change essentially attacking a military installation without repercussions cause your buddies doesnt make any sense in any setting game or otherwise
yep its rather daft
mad props to gangleri and 1pg for taking such a stand on this issue
i have to give you respect for this gangleri appreciated
much respect bro
applause for ankhesentapemkah and gangleriback to the drawing board even giving lp for the plexes will not work defensive plexing can and will still be done with alts and plexing in general has little to do with pvp the system needs to be reworked completely and be more pvpcentric instead of encouraging all this filthy metagamingedit support thread
i wholeheartedly support this topic and think both the rats and these standing mechanics should be fixedhowever i have no illusion that ccp cares about or even knows of the near exploit tactics used to capture these systems which completely remove the pvp from factional warfare as shown in the list of issues ankh listedminnieamarr enjoy the exploits and army of alts weve been dealing with for a long time now
i cannot add much more than gangleri has already set outthe decision by gangleri and the command staff of 1pg was actually quite easy to makethe news of systems falling makes us all feel very hollow at the moment after the many enjoyable and engaging battles we have had to date in fw there is simply no nobility in what is currently happening the use of the exploit is not welcome amarr victor but at what cost
i find your reply rather funny considering we got the idea from ankh and val we just made their methods public knowledge edit something
a great man once said i would rather lose this stupid war than lose our standards just before he steered the focus of our corp outside the whole fw arena and let me bring it into cvanothing has changed i will condem the recent exploitation of the system to capture solar systems and echo gangleris words that ccp need to get their act together on this one
i joined fw rather late in the game to nonexistent plexes during my tz and alt corps lol throne guards that warp away the second my lone frigate enters the plex with uber rats spawned on their side if they started it you guys sure perfected it on a mass industrial scale as i saw far more noob alts plexing on the caldari side than the gallente in my roams in us tz fw space when i was finally figuring out fw mechanics ankh herself switched to the caldari side was previously on the amarr side so i am rather amused at this whole ankh and her gallente doing these plex exploits theme agreed though that the standing mechanic in plexes is lame whoever uses itregardless i dont want to hijack this thread with another galcal fw plex ing in the wind especially since most of the proposals ive seen from you on the forums ive agreed withlets let the amarr and minmatar have their glorious exploit ridden ing in the wind contests now or just have them blame the caldari works too 
for over a year now i have seen the amarr call out for changes to fw and these calls falling on deaf earsi find it sad that only now when these bugs and loop holes are bringing down minmatar systems that the crys now get louderi rejoice that finially these voices will be loud enough that they may be heard and changes could be madewhile some ends do not justify the means it is a means that will now echo what needs to be done and should have been done from the starti will support this as long as ccp draws the most experianced members of faction wars and are bought together to fix what needs to be fixingi pray that faction wars the unwanted child of eve will now be givin the love it craves
i hadnt realized i was the most important person to you guys in fwthat creating one alt would lead you to abandon your so dearly held principals and noble purposesafter all this was as damar said  a desperate measure on your partsyou absolutely had to do it  as someone told me once these are just excuses
its quiet statements such as this that are the most significant not least because they do not seek the limelight just what is right thx 1pg you stand head and shoulders above your peers  o7
translation we know we cant do it any other way so we have to use exploits that everyone knows is an exploit and everyone thinks is lame howevr because ccp says its ok simple because they dont care about fw we will do it we will then come on the forums and support a proposed change because we know by the time ccp gets around to changing it we will already have taken all the system using it this means we get another medal and can brag on the board saying how great we are meanwhile we can turn around as say hey we really supported the change
the way things are occupany means nothingexcept to rpersthis is where i then give my thanks to 1pg for showing their nonsupport of this immersionbreaking mechanichow are we supposed to rp thisthe amarrminmatar front was in a deep stalemate until an armada of unarmed caldari ships who happened to bribe all our officials into setting the systems to vulnerable decended upon our systemsyet theres going to be ig repercussions for this the amarr will get a big pat on the back and the empress will say theyre amazing and amarrians will feel great that they were able to piggyback their way to victory thanks to an exploitpeople who have put over a year of work into maintaining minmatar occupancy are being slapped across the face by damar  co this mechanic was rarely if ever used on the minmataramarr front for the most part we have maintained some honor for eachotherwhile fw is fubar this is unacceptablei have already spoken with damar and he tried to justify himself in every whichway possible justification is easy i stole candy from a baby because i was hungryif you choose to be an asswipe youre not the first you think this will make ccp change it wont fw is a small base of their players when juxtaposed to empire carebears and 00 hermits we are not even on their radar there are amarrians who still dont even know that its thanks to you theyve capped over 5 systems in the past 24 hrs they dont stop to wonder why all of a sudden our systems have been heavily contested in a matter of hours but blow up the bunkers cuz they think its fw i should take this time to mention there needs to be a global notification to the home militia when their systems go vulnerableanyways just wanted to let you know youve illegitimized this games rp and future pf for me thanks for acheiving a whole lot in terms of ruining my personal game experience
fw has many oddities bugs and poor game mechanics the longer the game draws on especially for those in fw a long time they become more noticeable and more irritatingthe minmatar had the advantage of the speed tanking bug while the amarr had the advantage with the postdt bug while both could and did make use of the timerbugsince these strategies were effectively dictated by game mechanics they could not be countered through ingame means many players on both sides felt aggravated by these bugs and felt justified in making use of them because they felt the other side both gained an unfair advantage through use of these bugsthe standings bug we are talking about here has existed since the beginning of fw it is now a problem because of the industrial scale on which it is used a scale with upset that delicate balance in the amarrminmatar conflict that is the problem if an army of speed tanking alts had come out and started to capture amarr plexes by the hundreds i have no doubt the problem would be just as large such strategies are not simply not counterable within normal gameplayfw has many large and interrelated problems and i would like to see them solved but i honestly think that as long as ccp sees us getting by with all these problems they wont be motivated to change a thingperhaps it is time for this war to end perhaps stagnation will motivate ccp to undertake action however perhaps it will convince ccp to just abandon fw altogether and fw will end up as a kind of redvsblue with faction flavor and lp farming thats a risk of the current strategy but just plodding on isnt going to change anythinghaving faction warfare being won simply isnt good pr to convince newer players to join it and those player experiences are what ccp cares about deeply us addicted old vets will likely stay on anyway to ccpi would vastly prefer a reset with new and more interesting mechanics rather than plodding on for years with tiny fixes to flawed warfare concepts its been fun but its time for a good overhaulic for me it is simple i follow orders and unless my orders tell me to stop fighting i cant only reasonable way i have of not participating is not logging in or leaving my corppeople are angry people are frustrated people are disappointed let us not forget that dubious game mechanics are to blame for most of this and not the people making use of them i can no more be angry at damar for using this ccp approved bug than angry at sf for selectively wardeccing militia corps or matari plexers speed tanking amarr plexes im angry at ccp for allowing such mechanics in the first place and not doing anything about them for such a long timeim happy ccp solved the desync problems but other than that ive not seen any significant positive changes to fw
eran i have not been able to properly rp many things in fw how can i rp the order to find and capture still cloaked friendly plexes in so called pileup systems that are still uncontested yes go out and find and uncloak or secret defensive installations in systems that are not under attack even the message from the navy and lack of standings says me that this defense was unneccessary but from a ingame standpoint it certainly wasyes sir the mighty amarr empire has fallen to a swarm of unarmed vigils in the hands of junior pod pilots thats just as bad however but it is the realitycommander merdaneth your presence is required right after prayer time if you are not there you will never be able to assist us in capturing systems bunkers or fight decisive battles i mean wtf they are slapped in the face by ccp damar is merely one bringing the bad news it is difficult to wage a war dominated by faulty game mechanics in such a way that the warring parties need a kind of gentlemans agreement not to fully make use of the strategies available to themdamar is angry at ccp for their lack of attention to fw for their insistence clear gameplay gaffes are really working as intended he more than anything wants to fight this fw war although mechanics make it something of a farcewould you think ccp would fix the oneclickalliancedisband button if there wouldnt have been any scandals and uproar involving iti dont believe damar will achieve to get ccp to fix things on a short notice maybe hell and we through our anger and frustration at what his happening will achieve ccp to hear the issues on the table maybe not and in that case it will have been a bitter pill to swallow
supported  its time for things to change seriously ccp
this has my support
what a shame the rest of your corp dont see things the same way one can hardly move on the igs without stumbling into a post from a pie pilot crowing about victories handed to them by the caldari using broken mechanics its really rather pathetic perhaps you should tell them to take a leaf out 1pgs book if you want pie to retain any credibilty after this debacle is over
if caldari alts should be allowed to capture minmatar plexes without minmatar npcs shooting at them then i should be able to gank badgers in jita without concord shooting at mesupporting op plexing is completley broken with this feature included
its an exploit ic i love it but ooc its cheap do something ccp
i think it is the time for a fast and particularly drastic response by ccp this time please dont take to much time to fix this predicamentthank you
ooc supported ic might be time to poison the well
bugs in game our never very good however let face it the mins have been using bugs from day1 of fw timer bug most often used the mins still have numbers over the amarr  other corp supportyou can still plex and run them out like any other player for now get on with ityou have also use player with good amarr standing in plex  but have been chased off you have the chance to fleet up and take us out at bunkers as well but as ever u dont cry mr a river some where else
at least you have done something in gallente this would be nice but only after complete rehaul but i wonder what would be roleplaying explanation 
pervs damar and emperor throne guards has never used any exploitsusing alt to defend is not an exploitusing standing advantage may be lame but it is not an exploit this standing thing is used on minmatar front in many different forms especially by minmatar friendsyou have to realize that those alts do not find plexes automatically those must be controlled by player still so capturing 6 systems in one day do need lot of effort and gametime from many players so you can counter this by plexing defence plexes more than we do attack plexes or you can kill us all again and again problem is that no one cares to do boring part of fw you want that you can keep systems sitting in station and undocking only when you get kills that is not possible now on minmatar front you have to do work a lot of work and that is what caldari does nonstop plexingsystems are not flipping because there is some bug they are flipping because caldari is attacking
neutral like your neutral alt whom remote reps you in every engagement im sorry but you are one of the last people whom need to be speaking out against exploits
i know its lame but i am finding this situation awkwardly funnya few guys with an army of alttab alts was able to quickly overturn the course of the war by using ingame mechanics no exploiting just playing the game by the rules ccp madehows that for gallente suxorz they lose all teh plex and how bm said its not like they are using bots they have to control those alts if there were enough people to counter their plexing after dt im sure you would be ok right maybe minmatar are just lazy and dont like to plex because they dont have people dedicated enough to plexing rightdejavu this is the epitome of what is wrong with fw we are waiting for ccps response maybe someone should post a bug report on the issues forum titled faction warfare is not working halp11
just fix it metagaming nosense
hypocrisy is strong in any discussion about bugsi have seen amarrians use the standing bug before but as amarrians not as caldari else i would have created such a thread before i have seen amarrians use the timer bugi have seen minmatar use the timer bug im pretty sure there are minmatar who have used the standing bugand even our friend from pervs is right just because you have a dozen alts running around your space in t1 fitted frigates for close to 9 hours a day does not mean all is lost what makes it a lost cause is that plexing is such a damn boring thing against alts because it does not bring any useful fights so those who do not have the alt army lose patience much much fasternot to mention that using perceived bugs in the system demotivates people even more than they already areclever use of game mechanics i think its calleddoes not make the standings issue any less of a ridiculous game mechanic so please fix
i repeatmake capturing a plex require destruction of all the navy in the plexin one swoop  no speed tanking no standings loophole no timer bug
well i have to admit i never really liked you guys but i have to give you hats off and props to this its too bad other corps whom are in the lime light within the amarr militia dont also stand up refuse to be part of this non sensecorps that have openly supported these actions by joining in or rping about the shallow victorys will always be remembered as just that shallow and weakat least you guys have a bit of honor it appears so hats off
fix it b4 amarrmatari fw is ruined
did ccp fix that they did not fix it when it happened to bob they did not fix it when it happened to cva the only difference with cva was ccp stood up and righted the wrong on the flip side bob lost their alliance yet it was not fixed even a year later as it did happen to cvawhat you guys are doing imo is pretty much the same to fw as one man disbanding 00 alliance you are ing in the work of what hundreds of players have done since fw startedas part of a rp corp you are even more guilty and at least 1pg made a stand and decided not to partake in this nonsense its sad to see your corp with the history its had take part in something so selfish and childish
gangleri the stand by you and 1pg is highly admirableuseabuse of broken mechanics shouldnt be the determining factor in the factional warfare theatres it is unfortunate that ccp has chosen to downplay or ignore the problems for so long and while i have no expectation that they will act soon i am more than glad to add what support i can to the effort to get the developers to give factional warfare a higher priority in their backlog

oh come on now jadeon an rp level what are we meant to do when a system becomes vulnerableignore it we would be failing in our in character duty if we did so and you would be the first to make capital out of itooc most of us think that the current mechanic sucks but then we also think that the mechanic that allows the minmatars to take a single vigil into an amarrian plex and capture it without sustaining a single point of damage sucks and we think that the mechanic that causes the timer to keep running even when nobody is there sucks tooi mean whats the point of changing things so that someone will get shot at by npcs in the future if they still dont have to be there to be shot atremember  in character statements and actions do not neccessarily reflect out of character views and opinions
follow the example of 1pg and cva in this very threadno i wouldnt and if you think i would then it shows how little you really understand the motivations of your fellow eve players at the end of the day its a pathetic cheesy exploit that has already ruined the integrity of faction warfare and will destroy the amarrianminmatar front and the enjoyment of many many players you had an opportunity to take a principled stance but decided instead to ic showboat your success on the back of the most tawdry gaming of broken mechanics imaginableyes there are many problems with fw mechanics in general but the system and integrity of the fw battle on your front did not collapse until you decided to cooperate with the caldari exploiters and ruin the experience for all concernedyes i am sure that if you hadnt done it other people would have collaborated with these spoilers but the fact remains you were faced with an ethical choice and you choose wronglyat the end of the day i think you will come to see this and regret your actions
and my point is that whos to say that exactly the same thing wouldnt have happened had fw not had this standings issues because it would still have been possible to not even be in the plex and have the timer continue to runand the latter has been a known bug for a very long time
as far as i am aware that bug has been classified as an exploit by gms and you can counter it by petitioning those using it and both sides can have a gentlemans agreement not to cheat similar to the agreement i think you had until a week ago
supportedthough it might already be too late to undo the damage done
i always thought that gentlemens agreements were a bit sandboxy for you what was it you once said oh yes
and here was me thinking that the jaderodj love spat was all ic seriously chill fellas were all on the same side on this onesimplest solution make destroying all navy in the plex a prerequisite for plex capture goodbye speed tanking goodbye standings loopholesintermediary solution ccp declares the standings loophole an exploit same as abusing the timer bug already is
perfect
that would certainly be a good solution
i think 1pg have set a pretty good example as to what a corp such as yours should be doing in this situation maybe you should look back to a few weeks ago when your fellow cva friends fell victim to a game exploit which caused their entire alliance to collapse undoing the work that had gone into it from many yearswhile i will admit i did get a good laugh at it as did most of us but even within the minmatar militia we thought the way it was done was wrong and im pretty sure it was a general belief that we supported righting the wrong by ccpmany people despite their disagreements or even hate for cva came out and supported them because what was done was wrong more so the ability to do what was done happened due to faulty game mechanics this is much the same case you are supporting the undermining of countless peoples work just to gain a little bit of satisfaction with a forum post in igs is your honor and your corps reputation really only worth a few chest thumping posts in the igs forums when cva was disbanded many people put aside their rp to show support which likely helped push ccp in the direction of righting the wrong and not just letting them fall to the same fate as bob did your corp could also put your rp to the side and stop supporting these ill gotten fake gains what you are doing is wrong and what you are doing will forever stain your corp reputation
theres a slight difference between this and the cva disolution in that the former is a result of flawed mechanics that have been known about for some time and some of our opponents have apparently themselves used in the past whilst the later was the result of out of game hacking activitiesif its any consolation look at where the recently fallen systems are on the map
there is no difference there is only a question of right or wrong you know what you are doing is wrong regardless of what you wish to call it
yes 1pg were dignified enough to do exactly thatsorry but you seem to be implying that your rping actually controls your actions you make it sound like some debilitating disease ffs well we could have chosen not to shoot those bunkers but as you know we suffer from role playing syndrome and as such are completely unable to control any actions of our in game characteryou sound about as credible as a npc republic fleet officer explaining why he was unable to shoot at a caldari plexer shpooting the bunkers was one thing i could almost understand a couple of them getting shot from excitementmisundersatnding but you shot all of them and them you all crowed about it ic ofc on the igshow convenient to have the plausible denial of ooc statements saying you dont support this tactic but still get to indulge yourself in yay we won lulz comment on igs if rping really does control you to this extent i suggest you visit a head doctor or perhaps an exorcist in game of course
thats sort of what rping is  having your character do the things that your character would do and yes my character does have different views on things to the reallife me you may be surprised to hear that i dont support slavery in rlbut really i fail to see what pies ingame response to the issue has to do with the actual problems that this topic is aboutyoull notice that i actually agree that the current mechanic is a problem that needs to be addressedyoull even notice a thumbs up from me in this thread
then that sir makes you a hypocrite you are saying you will gladly take the benefits of using this game breaking exploit but will publicly claim it should be changed so no one else can take advantage of it in others words its cool for you guys to use but ccp should defiantly fix this so it cant be used against you meanwhile you know they likely wont fix it before you guys are done using it this all works out very well for you
supported
supported although not really any hope this will be fixed as these problems have been known a long time my bet is on fw being mostly lp farming ground in a few months time anyway the whole system is rotten to the core
people please i know frustration and anger levels are high but this is not a who is to blame thread neither a lets condemn some people thread let us not turn it into onethere are issues with fw mechanics all people agree that they need to be solved and be solved soon rather than late that we dont agree on is what to do in the interim but that is not the issue under debate here also i believe the issue of what to do in the interim is interlinked with many other fw issuesplease start another thread or get people together ingame to discuss a solution for the meantime but placing blame in this thread certainly isnt going to solve the problem
oh gimme a breaki really dont want the caldari to ruin the amarrminnie battlefront but omg theres nothing i can do to stop my character capitalizing on caldari abuse of broken mechanics and then crowing about it on igs  hes out of control 11isnt it time you realized that even from an rp perspective this situation is massively broken and you should take a step back from it 
the blame game also achieves very little  its like arguing over the result of a rigged match duh it was rigged the outcome is irrelevant because you can never know what would have actually happened in fairbalanced circumstances it renders the actual effort of those not using inappropriate tacticsbugsexploitscallitwhatyouwill also irrelevant because youre no longer comparing apples and apples arguably the current victories for any side are null  voidnobody seems to be arguing that the current situation is correct  therefore the situation needs addressing the only reasonable way to do that is to fix the problems  start again compare it to the moongoo exploit  ccp didnt say well weve discovered the problem now and fixed it but the ill gotten gains are ok  they removed the ill gotten gains they pretty much couldnt fix the economic impacts but lets not wander offtopic ccp can find reason to fix the problems and reset occupancy along with preferably giving occupancy meaning and all the other requests for fws improvements thats what we should be asking for not getting distracted by blaming each other
sorry but trying to claim you are still against this is like seeing the opposition football team all held at gun point but then still deciding to shoot at goal while saying you disapprove  you cant have bothif you want ppl to actually believe that you are actually opposed to this mechanic then you should stop engaging in it its pretty damned clear cut
extra bunker hp cant hurt either
i replied in the other thread which is about fw as a whole
rodj or anyone else from pie cant really make a statement similar to the one made made by 1pg for a very simple reasonwe do not offensive plex except on rare occassions our primary task has been to hold the line as best we could a vast majority of our time is spent clearing the debris after the vigilsrifters of doom has passed through friendly space ic there is no way to speak out against reclaiming of systems without instantly commiting treasonheresy or that is to say i can not think of any way to spin itit is a crummy mechanic thats for sure but look at the bright side  blood finally started to boil  we as players need to be feverish and drooling like rabid dogs to make ccp take notice fw has been puttering along with all the game breaking features because we have lacked the the massive outcry necessary  we plexersrpers have been ridiculed in every thread raising the issues going back over eighteen monthsps timer abuse is not an exploit as far as i am aware properly merely frowned uponccp has a very poor trackrecord when it comes to making that declaration and seem to only make it when they have the bugmechanic nailed and merely waiting for the code to compilethis is the only list i know of with actual notifications  hardly extensive
it is considered an exploit and petitionable i have asked explicitly that question via petition got a yes its an exploit back and have petitioned a few pilots for it
supported fw has a number of flawed game mechanics as others have mentioned the implications of this particular one i feel will result in the failure of this piece of contenttime to take a serious look at faction war again ccp and to take onboard suggestions from the players who actually enjoy playing the fw game as it is intended

correct the epic stupidity supportedmaybe if they do something before another six months when they reevaluate motherships again or would that be again again maybe ill resub that account
im not a mothership pilotcaptainadmiral yet but i can understand the current concerns i support the docking of these ships if it is done as the op suggest
ccp is doing an excellent job of encouraging new players never to get into a super cap maybe that was their goal
as one of many someanyone whose dreams are to fly this capital piece of space junk signed dont screw up my seriousinternetspaceships dreams even for a while
while in general i dont think ccp should devote too much attention to what is tbh an UFFFDberdedicated but miniscule portion of the player base in this particular case i agree that their seemingly petulant refusal to make any changes to moms in dominion was just plain dumb let them at least dock up
signed let me get into action in something less worthless 
too right
signed if they arent giving it atleast the hp boost with the amount of titans in the game and the cost of a mom its a decent idea
aye
i dont fly one and this makes sense  that or actually completing the intended capital changes i empathise with the desire to get the changes right but people still need to be able to do what they do until that happens

i like the idea of being able to subscribe to such a list which could also include those isk spammers

if theres going to be a subscription type list then there needs to be a way to remove yourself from it or ccp is going to have to maintain itotherwise im a moderator on said list  jitasellalt is in direct competition with me i toss him on the list and viola no one buys his contracts anymore even though he hasnt done anything wrongtake a long hard look at the us no fly list specifically the problems its caused innocent folks before you start asking for a subscription type listtradeable lists im fine with since my assumption is once i import such a list i can modify it at will as if it were my ownsupporting tradeable lists
that sounds like the workings of a trade coalition gain enough regional clout or offer incentive to get everyone to subscribe to your ban list and slip in a few of your jita competitors on the ban to reap better profit then if a playergroup of subscribers has a tiff with part of the coalition they simply discontinue and subscribe to one of the competitorsban list subscriptions may add a neat element to the corperation trade gameeither way tradeable ban lists would be a great thing to implement supported
imagine the fleet of 30 covert ships trying to take their optimal position on the field that is the real pain to make them all on their places and not decloak eachother at the same time we have a good in position broadcast button but it doesnt show the position of your ship in space to the others in fleet it will be very helpfull to have the option to show your position to the others so they will not decloak you by the accident
makes sense
visible just to the fc of course
i would like that they have made some kind of stable 3d formations in fleet will be fun and helpfulbut your proposal will work too

the titan weapons were designed to barbeque mss says so in the description of the modswhats the point in giving ms hp boosts  that would increase there invulnerability to all weapons systems without reasonif dds are op then its the alpha of the dd that needs reducing not the hp tanks of momshaving moms with 5x there current hp while there still able to deal there huge damage againts smaller targets  pre fighterbomber armaments  would make them 5x the omgwtfbbqsolopenmobiles they are today and is unjustifiableso you mom is no longer invulnerable  welcome to the cold harsh world of evepersonally i dont see the issue2 x titan is like 140b worth of ships to kill one ship worth 20b the titans are completelly stuck where they are for 10 minutes long enough for any fleet to drop in reinforcements and try to take them outthe problem here is pilots flying ships they cant afford to loseyour not gonna get dropped by titans everytime you take one out and anytime you do the attacking titan fleet is exposing far more valuable ships than you have just had bbqd
indeed although im pro a halving of the rof of the titan dds in tandem with a halving or such as 75 of the current damageyou rarely get to see a lone titan in a decisive capital fight or am i overestimating titan usage

im not in nullsec warfare atm but ill support this anyway especially that its causing so much grief
oh so theres a second thread
indeed
signed
while i somewhat agree with the above a mom ship when fit properly should be able to tank 3 dds and i dont mean full out screw everything but tank with some slaves fit either just the normal run of the mill tank is three dds worth of hps too much to expect for a ship that expensivesupported above in a previous post
reduces dd alpha rather than mom hp buff i cant imagine the extra amount of pain a empire mom will be if buffed
throw the hp buff on them right now and then play around with balancing or what ever but get that hp boost on nowlike within 5 days
the mothership hp buff was designed in line with the titan doomsday change as the mothership buff never happened the dds are now functioning outside of design specsand if you really base any opinions at all on descriptions please contract me your stuff asap as you really need to gtfo of eve

supportedhopefully they give us the role of flagships so we lead the charge into battle and make the fleet better with bonuses but until the time that ccp actually decides what role theyll best be used for there needs to be an immidiate hitpoint buff so the ships might actually be taken out of a pos and not 1shot

the strong point of the mothership always used to be lots of drones and the immunity of electronic warfare including the ability to not be scrammed by nondictor class shipshowever as it stands now the mothership is even worse off to destroy one tackling is no longer needed all you need to do is press the win buttonreplacing one mothership for a fleet of say 1015 carriers would be better because they end up costing them same but cant be destroyed in a single whimtherefore the hp buff should be implemented as soon as possible to even out this flaw even if it doesnt still have a defined role now still
sok you obviously havent been listening to me whine in corpvent i am soo ed off training for this damn ship now its just no fun any moreconstantly having to respec long ass skills just to make the ship reasonable on those odd occasions you need it less now with dominionthere are other parts of my game i want to train geez ccp pleas end this torture
we have a lot of players displeased by a directscan delay but that was made to reduce the server loadout and im not sure ccp would change it back so what i want to introduce here is a compromise to improve the useability of directscan this thread
one of the things thats constantly annoyed me since the dscan change has been the lack of visual indication as to when you can scan againsigned
i like the idea so simple
1those error messages are really annoying
supported if probes are added to overview so they can be filtered on the scanner results
this
why not just get rid of the need to spam that idiot buttonmake the basic directional scanner a passive system thats always on even if youre not paying attention to it its not particularly accurate nor immediate identifying a ship with very little additional information depending on rangesig of the contact with smaller contacts getting much closer before showing up at allgiven enough time itll give a rough directiondistance to the contact massive deviation in the range of an au or more at the limits of the sensor sweepif the pilot wants more information they can either a use a probe or b use their active sensor which just like a submarine sends out a highenergy pulse and reads the return echo it gives much more detail but also lets the other ship know what and where the pinging ship is within a large deviation at range not enough for an immediate warpto this pulse however can be used by other ships to augment their passive sensor sweepsccp should use the analogies of modern antisubmarine warfare when it comes to scanning for ships its simple and straightforward keep quiet and youre not blind as you are now but you cant see well make some noise and you can see better but can also be found more easily

yes please change it to something better dark green  black cameo would even be better than the current ugly green edit i agree with the others this probably wont make ccp change their minds there is always hope
before i start it seems quite a few people dont know of the change that has happened since apocrypha so have a twisted opinion on this since apocrypha the mechanic changed the ship you shoot no longer stays in space for 15 minutes if you have aggressed them they only stay in space for 15 minutes if they shoot backthis means they can jump into a camp and log and if they survive 1 minute and 30 seconds their ship just disappears they dont warp off and allow you to scan them down anymore they just disappear from spacenow you are up to date on the situation please read the belowcurrently low sec camps and quite possibly any type of small camp with a couple of people no longer work against anything that can tank that small gang for a minute and half this means you have to get together a big gang and basically blob this is surely against ccps aimsthis is because there is no longer an aggression timer on a ship that has been shot fe a rokh jumps into me and my friend in a phobos and claymore we get two decent bumps on him and were taking his shields down relatively well we get him to half shields and hes still miles off the gate suddenly he just disappears no emergency warp or anything just disappears from space like he cloaked but instantly we realise he logged from local and theres not a thing we can do about it but we wait for him to come back once again we tackle him off gate and once again he logs and disappearsthis really needs sorting please dont let characters disappear due to logoff if they are pointed if they have more stabs than points then obviously they can warp but not if caught by a hics infapoint this still means you have to get a lock before the ship emergency warps but this is still easily possible if that ship choses to logas for the point of knowing whether a ship logs or is disconnected isnt there a petition for ship reimbursement particularly designed for that scenario where they can claim their ships back with sufficient evidence it was a server problem how about we go back to using itplease sort this as its ruining a lot of peoples low sec gameplay i know especially for the smaller corps that cant get big enough numbers to instapop such shipsimportant if you reply and agree please tick the support checkbox when you do so this is how these posts are officially tracked please also get your friends to support thisthankyoumike

dont support  get better but dont change eve to fullfill your insufficient skills
how does that relate to insufficient skills in any senseliterally theres no skill you can train to point people who logoffnon literally you cant bump these people to stop them logging you cant point them to stop them logging you cant do anything but add more dps to kill them within a minute and half which on a passive recharge rokh or any other extended  plated ship for that matter is quite hard to do within the time limit with a small gate camp then they simply just disappeari dont see any logic in what you just said at all other than you love logging off yourself to save your ships
i support this as it is spammed in oo aswell dscan means nothing if they just log off when you get there and as a solo pilot you dont have the dps to kill something in that time
so what  turning off the log off button till every noob had a chance to shoot so we all stay online 237take it like a man if you are not good enough to take a ship down in time
where does it say in my proposal anything about removing the log off buttonthat would be the most ridiculous suggestion everof course people can still log off but once they have logged off their ships are not invulnerable to electronic warfare so they can still be killed so people cant purposely log off on a gate to save their ship been killed
fit some ing probelauncher on your ship ffs 
so let me get this straight if i log off after being attacked i can evade death sweet will try this asap 3 thanks for the advice
doesnt work anymore boppi try itthey dont warp off anymore there is no longer 15 minutes to scan them down upon shooting them only if they agress so if they shoot back then log you have 15 mins to scan them if they just log while you have a point on them they just dissapear from space in 1 minute and 30 seconds no scanning down or anything now you see them now you dont stylenot a lot of people know this mechanic had changed but it has since apocrypha try it yourself if you dont believe me
they know nowshooting yourself in the foot ftwedit to stay on topicim not sure how i feel about this proposal the server code as written doesnt know if you disconnected or hit ctrlq all it knows is it cant talk to your client anymore and it responds appropriatelyand ccp has a long standing policy of not reimbursing for essentially random client disconnects so if they do legitamately disconnect and you blast them theyre not getting their ship back the issue ccp faces is how do they balance the i got them pointed shoot them crowd against the wtf i disconnected and when i came back im in my medical clone crowd
id rather have it fixed
i hate this forum as i feel its the place to whine to developers to get your way but i must agree to what the op is sayingi remember when people would jump through gate and immediately log off so they would disappear after the 30 second cloak timed out even if they had a gcc or an aggression timer it seems really lame for ccp to back up and make it fair again to log out to save a ship if you fly a ship and get pointed you should stay in space till u break the lock dock jump through gate lose your ship or kill the people shooting you if you do not want to lose your ship do not fly it in low sec or 00 or during war
my only problem with this is sure it is a shady tactic but there may be a case in which somebody actually dcshow would this be handled would you simply make it that all log offs make you visible in space for 15 minutes after emergency warp otherwise then what would be the point of logging of in space in lowsec at alli myself have never logofski and never will but i see it from both sides sure you want to give the campers a shot but at the same time why make it nearly impossible to get through a camp if your not in a small ship or cloaker how this turns out will be interesting
having your ship dissappear cmon seriously how am i gonna explain that to anyone sanesupported for sanity and the love of humanity
i support this
you fit warp core stabs and a tank malalso as i said in one of my posts above there is a petition for ship reimbursement for such cases if you do get disconnected due to a server side issue if its your own connection its tough and always has been if ccp caused it and you can prove it you get your ship back
ugh  fix it
just clarify something mikeeven preapocrypha if a ship jumped through a gate into a camp and then logged while still cloaked it disappeared in 60 secs it only collected a 15 min timer if it was aggressed before the server decided the client had disconnectedis this the issue you want fixed
yeah
i didnt actually mean that situation fat however that situation would be covered by this suggestion and also stop it happening the mechanic changed post apocrypha though say that you did get the ship aggressed before the server decided the client had disconnected now after apocrypha that ship still disappears in 1 min 30 now its only if they aggress that they stick around for 15 minutesmike
the lights topic
thank you for your support guysalso shameless bump
with dominion the way people rat has changed with ihub upgrades now able to keep a constant stream of anomalies coming as more and more ratters move to this kind of ratting over belt ratting it makes it harder on those who hunt the ratters to find  and kill  them currently if you find someone on directional scan and figure out that they are in an anomaly you have to scan for anomalies and then initiate warp to each of the results to find out if they are in the correct direction give anomalies that you have scanned out with your on board scanner or probes a bracket in your in space view like belts planets etc so you can instantly determine whether or not your target is in the correct anomaly ratting has evolved ratter hunting needs to follow
petitions or signed posts are a version of bumping and likewise are not permittedplease forgive me
a setting that we can set to have cans be blue by default when we kill i mine a lot and kill a lot of rats but cant be bothered to loot or salvage usually but i get tells from folks and mail asking if they can salvage and loot the wreaks i would like to just turn on the make them blue option by default
seems reasonable to have as an option
you can always right abandon all nearby wrecks having a perminant toggle sounds fine to me though
hmm apparently you have to support your own idea by posting twice even though you can tick the support box when you first create the thread
not supported i see the 01 isk war as part of the game if you dont like move your sales elsewhere i dont like that to compete and keep my orders moving i have to check prices daily in certain places so i moved my orders away from where so many sellers work and the price changes several times a day if not a dozen other players may sell more faster but i generally make more isk per itemsmall sellermanufacturer and spend less of my time updating orders which is how i like itif people want to be at the busy hubs then they have to deal with all the other people undercutting them and modifiying orders over and over to get the sale perhaps something like this could be implemented for places where a minimum of 5 or so sellbuy orders of the same item are up same for multisystem buy orders easiest way to circumvent this is to sell at different stations but i dont think all orders should be subject to this idea when the main problem is in the super hubs and the people that choose to sell their crap with the other 50 people no business owner would setup shop selling the same goods right next to someone else selling the same thing along with another 50 merchants
i am against this idea it will lower competition it is is also complexone should want their orders to be seen individual this is a great tool in a trade war
as we are dealing with commodities there is no ability to differentiate the market would function better if it was an exchange sell orders should be setup to have a minimum sell order anything above that min price would sell buy orders would have a max anything below that would buy this doesnt currently happen or maybe it is supposed to and is buggedunless ccp wants to put in place tools to allow people to function as brokers which would contradict the fee people currently pay to place orders it would be logical to have a fee per transaction transactions include order modifications prestochangeo increasesdecreases of 001 cease as they no longer are worth the cost to modify the order lets be honest if a person were to place a sell order with their broker at the beginning of the day above the going price then step it down penny by penny throughout the day their broker would  them in fees for good reason each modification costs the broker time if nothing else in the game each modification takes bandwidth and sucks on the server in both cases there is incentive to dissuade people from such activity the simplest solution is charging fees each time it happens
remember that were not just talking about modifications to existing orders but also posting new ones if it wasnt possible or economically feasible to modify an existing order then that would give a major advantage to later traders who could simply outbid you by a cent also there is a point where modifying orders is more expensivemore hassle than simply cancelling them and relisting
when someone create a fleet with based on standing option the own corp members cant view the created fleet because the corp members is neutral for other corp membersso need to add a new feature or need to add own corp members to positive standing when created a based on standing fleet
just get your corp to set its self blue  fixedits realy not that hard
we didnt know why are corp members cant see the standing fleet in fleet finder system all we are neutrals for each others can you make a select corp members and based standing or make automatically corp members positive standings 
you cant add own corp to blue standing
the problem is still an issue with large corps so i second the idea
you might remember a while ago you used to be able to use more than 5 droneswell they dropped they number from 10 to five due to apparent lag from it personally i think you get more lag from fleet battles and can spam than those dronestherefore i propose that the ability to use 10 drones be reinstated into eve after all surely now the servers should be able to handle it
agreesorry but lets face it with the major cluster upgrades and the fact that major fleet battles will be laggy as hell no matter how many drones are on the grid as a carebear agreed
id just like a noncarrier version of the drone control unit module at least one for the more dedicated drone boats domi myrm etc
pointless change honestlyif they allowed up to 10 drones theyd cut their damage and hitpoints by 50 so that interceptor is still going to mow through your 10 in about the same amount of time they currently mow through 5 factoring for the added lock time20 10 5 or just 1 they will adjust them to do exactly the same damage and have exactly the same survivability
lets not forget about having to cross train to another race to fly the vindicator simply put at its current incarnation the vindicator is simply not worth the time to train or the double price tag than that of the equally as effective navy megaboost the damage bonus
you grossly underestimate the power of a 90 web never mind two
first sorry if this has already been proposedso how about faction spawns have faction salvage and from that people can build faction rigs yes they would be expensive but some people like expensive stuffand who wouldnt want a set of large dark blood trimark armour pumpssorry its a short post but lets face it it doesnt much explaining
bumpies
i think it would be fun if corps had military ranks kinda to go along with the whole medals thing
0nce i joined this starcraft clan and after so many wins the clan leader would promote you and you got to change your name it got addictive and i couldnt stop playing and forgot to do all my homework for a week but it turned out you really dont need to do homework to graduate from highschool
wouldnt it be cool thou i mean right now all there is to tell whos who in a corp is just to see how long they have been in the corp which is kinda lame cause it makes mining alts look like some tuff dude but they really arnt but if there were ranks that the ceo could give out say like you have alot of fun ops and blow some ships up and the ceo can check that one tab out that shows everything the corp has killed then he could like hand out some promotions so like some dude with a high rank would prob be some awesome guy who has killed alot of stuff and is pretty decent at pvping and all the new guys could look up to him and it would be awesome to fly with him and learn how to be a good pilot so they could be like me one day
i loldi got very funny looks from my coworkers so apparently i really did lol010 for mentioning starcraft we do not acknowledge the existence of that other gaming company herein before this thread gets trolled into a lock
yes it does need fixing and ccp should look at it asap a more serious problem in my view is the way a single vigil can attack an amarrian plex with immunity from the npcs because of their crappy weapons they should fix that too
all the mentioned bugs and loop holes can be simply fixed with a small additionan offensive plex may only be captured once the npcs guarding it are destroyed for every thread that is started and supported that has purpose to fix fw will have to bring attention to have some one look into it or get a official response from ccp
dear ankhesentapemkahyes we all agree that fw is broken and plexing is brokenbut some have enough imagination to give this broken system as little meaning as it can have and still have at least some fun with itplease stop asking a total tear down of fw in totalfw needs imho a three stage reviewfirst fix the little bugs and exploits aka balance fw mission reduce the rewards the standing issue 2nd an introduction of intermediate fixes fw mission only spawn in contested missions more lp for kills and lps for plexingand then as third step you can do a long term evaluation of what fw could be and can be and redo it all oversince just asking tear it down make it all new will just end up getting it removed and not replaced by anythin wthin several centuries least have us that little fun we have with what is there right now and get the little bugs and exploit out of the systemat least post a general proposal of changes and outline of what fw could be but just asking tear it down is in my very humble opinion not really constructiveotherwise supported
supported even the people doing it openly admit they know its a exploit and should be classified as one and imo the system taken should be reset amarr never would have captured those system if not for using this exploit
it doesnt need to be called an exploit because fw needs to be broken so bad that ccp will go back to the drawing boardsystem captures should be a large event bordering on weeks to capture a single system with massed pvp fights and not something done quickly after downtime due to plex respawnsthe guys who made pirates of the burning sea had a better idea in that pve bs only gets you a ticket into the final pvp fight pve should count but it shouldnt capture systemsccp know enough that they dont just let you blitz poses but they made it so you could blitz systems in fwi only just came back after a three year absence mainly because pos fights and 00 blobbage bored the crap out of me with the hope of doing fw but it looks like at best i will just be randomly killing people because the capture mechanics suck
the point of his topic is to not yet again argue about what should be done in the future but rather classify what is being done as a game breaking exploit and start banning abuserschanging fw will take months if not a year worth of planing classifying this an exploit can be done now before a few s can ruin the work that has been done by many over a long period of time
supported
because even if it was fixed orbiting a beacon for 15 minutes is great gameplay right the whole plexing thing is dumb and should be redonesomething amarr and gallente can agree on
my objection to this is not just this but capturing plexes with lowlyskilled alts and without risking your ship against npcs in general is a problemi would dislike to have this same discussion one month from now when damar still angry at ccp simply gets a lot of pervs alts transferred to the tlf and starts massspeed capturing amarr systems instead to make his point as i pointed out the exploitability has been there all along its only the current industrial scale at which it is used that makes it a problemi would be angry as well if i logged into eve to find out hordes of alts in vigils speed tanking the amarr plexes every day i would be just as helpless against this tactic and it would be just as fun destroying think about itfw is broken in many places it will take some dedicated or angry players to expose these issues but it can be broken in many other ways too as far as im concerned its flawed at its core and frankly im very tired of fighting idiot game mechanics rather than my opponents
this sounds like a solid suggestion
for sure
yes definitely and may i suggest someone put up a matching thread for the timer bug
i was the alliance leader for a long time and the standing management was a real pain once you get positive standings with one alliance you have to set standings with all their petsalliesalt corps ets so the idea is  make the ability to importexport the standings lists so coalitions can simply update it and publish on their pages
well atleast the export for the first time
hopefully something like this is in the works for the new corp and alliance management coming with new eden more things need to be exportimportable
yes
my bet is onwe all know how well thought and tested ccp content intgroduction is right
thumps up i really hate it to find a bpo between alot of bpcs
it is not redesign the blueprint stuff it is redesign the database and that is the problemto resolve the bpobpc issue would require to always register every bpc as a different item instead of using a generic bp template for each item and adding the bpc data only if the item is queried seeing how each bpc has thousand of combinations of mepenumber of copies it would increase the database size bye several orders of magnitude not a good idea for the gameso ask for a better science  industry interface allowing us to better manipulate the blueprints and dont ask something impossible
if we cant have a new bpc template design then even capitals for the bpo in blueprint if possibleaugoror blueprint  bpoaugoror blueprint  bpcwhatever the outcome a way of easily seeing the difference would be goodalso signed for the better science and industry interface tamber
your suggestion unfortunately doesnt solve the problem venkul is describing im not saying the problem is insoluable and i would certainly like to see it solved but unless ccp already has a major db redisgn on their drawing board dont expect to see bpobpc differentiation anytime soonthat aside i would also love to see a better si interface
everyone else may have an excuse for proposing this tripe but you do notyou you know who you people are already know the answer to this question you have been there and you have read ithow disappointing that you obviously cant read let alone rememberplease stop embarrassing yourselves people ccp has said no and they have said whygive it up the whole mess would require redesigning the entire system beating a dead horse is only going to make a bigger messthis isnt a matter of opinion anymore it has been said countless times give it upits like demanding the sky to be turned pink aint gonna happen
although there may be some great improvements with the new dominion email system and interface such as being able to see sent email versus that of apocrypha i do not claim to love it the automatic grouping of messages by sender and the online status indicator with portrait are missed
i support my own proposal
a lot of people have posted doubling the missile velocity and halving the flight time to come up with a faster missile at the same range but there have also been arguments that the physics engine cant support those speeds at this point the idea is well known and you just have to leave it to the devs to decide oni would agree with removing unguided classification from missiles it seems a bit odd to have the skill only apply to half the weapon classthe rest of these changes are pretty much unneeded barring rockets missiles work reasonably well against their intended targets if any changes are needed its really rebalancing of some missile based ships ie the hawk which should have its damage bonus boosted to a 10 and obviously rockets need some love
your ham changes are over the topwith that you would get a 875 dps ham drake thats too close to a brutix especially since you wont have tracking issuesalso the explosion velocity changes might toast ships too easily as speed tanking them will get almost impossiblei am a missile user myself but your changes are over the top
i calculated the velocities so that an afterburning ship with minimum skills take max damage but an afterburning ship with max skills will take reduced damage if you are mwding you take reduced damage as well
missiles are already very deadly weapon systems rockets not included they have their advantages perfect tracking both close and long range damage sure you need to wait a few seconds for your long range damage but its a part of the mechanism that allows you to have no tracking issues no cap choose your damage typein order to apply your full dps you need to apply some webs just like blasters unlike turrets there is no counter lol defenders vs tracking disruptors and you can fight in a great variety of engagement rangesalso a ship fitting an afterburner is gimped for many other aspects of pvp some people still laugh at ab fitted ships as useless others say they are op imo there is now choice between fitting an ab or notnot supported
cruises and rockets are a joke they need a rework
missiles may have perfect tracking however they are affected by sig radius and velocity which makes up for that also missiles are the only weapon system for which it is possible for someone to change their velocitydistance from you while your damage in enroute so an inty can see you warp in at the edge of your max range and then accelerate away from you so that they are out of range by the time the missile reached them and that totally sucks
cruise missiles probably just need to be brought closer to what hmls are make them rockets just plain lolkets atmhowever i do not see any needed change to lightshmlshamstorps hmls and hams especially both are powerful weapon systems torps are very powerful against bs and bc sized targets while light missiles dont have much in the way of dps they have very good alpha for frig weapons with stupidly long range
and turrets arent sig radius and velocity of the ship given flying both affect turret trrackingwhich adds variety other weapon systems have their tradeoffs and id rather not every single weapon system be exactly the sameas others have posted most of the missile systems are already very powerful what you propose would make them far overpowered
the funny thing is that if some sort of gallenteblaster buff goes through as proposed in fi some sort of generic missile rework would be justified as we would by then quite definitely be playing power creep online

i fully support thisi want a player operated station to look like a station not a bunch of stuff floating around by itself in space come on csm lets get this on the table again
flog
yes pleasegreat ideas
signedthis is good
hope someone picks this up
this is the same post your putting on the agenda only this is a summery of the last 4 years worth of the dead horse pos thread its the whole thing in a nutshell
yes its killing my eyes
bump
i dont spend nearly as much time in wspace as you do but i can still see the utility of this supported
align to bookmark would be very handy ive counted many times when i wish i could of done this
yes please
absolutely
yes moar tracking for blasters plzid rather see the brutix getting an armor resist bonus and a slight pg buff
fully agree very well thought outin ye olde days you would not have seen naval ships attempt max damage close range broadside volleys only for the cannon balls to mysteriously curve away from the target or even a musket being able to pick off a guy with a massive sword swinging it at your facein shortmore blaster tracking good work on the doctrines btw spot on
kronos and hyperion suck balls too although thats mostly due to hybrids sucking
supported also heres a hyp fit to try wouldnt fly exactly that but its a good start
blimey much effort went into that read it liked it would question whether the ab bonus should be as high as 20 15 maybe as it would be interesting to see the potential nanothrons that might pop up as a result but yes some very interesting thoughts taking into account the varying roles and philosophies1 thumb
how could anyone who read that post think its a good idea its the embodiment of biased opinion with that gallente would become the destroyer of worlds or something go write up a realistic list of changes and we can talk
you see i do not treat the proposal as a list of things that have to be done i treat it more as a list of problems that we have and a number of solutions that we can offer yes ofcource if all of them are implemented at once it will probably be overkill but that is already for ccp to decide which ones of them come through
i read the thread before it was posted in here and the only thing i feel would be even the slightest overpowered is the armour hp boost per level on the hyperion but with only 6 lowslots i dont think it would be a big issuethe the proposed changes need some extensive testing and perhaps a few tweaks but all in all i think the changes would be for the better
i even volunteer to personally screen  approve the logos on ccps behalf for 1 bil isk per month
i like the idea and im supporting it but it wont happen same reason we were told they wont change the icons for bpcs to be different from bpos apparently it takes massive amounts of effort to change the colour tint on a single icon or something
you assume every player knows what is and isnt a normal game mechanic which they clearly do not spelling out known exploits will increase players ability to recognize and report them and hopefully lower the number of petitions for things that really arnt exploits
yes
what bagehi said also its a loselose situation for ccp there are exploits that probably arent detectable unless a gm witnesses it directly if ccp list those exploits then the expectation from the playerbase is that they would enforce them  which may not be possible if they dont list those exploits then players would wonder why the list isnt completethere are good reasons why no mmo company does this
its not about things that are obviously exploits  everyone knows that macroing hacking the servers item duping all that kind of stuff is obviously an exploit and nobody should need to be told that the classic example of what im pretty sure op is talking about is pos bowling for those of you who dont know what that was basically you park a guy outside a pos bubble warp to that guy at range in a titan or other physically large ship find yourself in the bubble collision detection goes haywire and a bunch of ships stored in that bubble wind up outside for your buddies in pods to jump into for an extended period of time this was considered validif lowbrow gameplay until ccp declared it an exploit a couple years back now thing is i dont think its yet been fixed in the actual game code havent tried it myselfsince i know its banned but imagine some guy who wasnt even playing when it was declared verboten accidentally does it one day decides its really cool and tries to bring back pos bowling he knows its a bit shady but he cant find anywhere it says its not allowed so he doesnt know its considered an exploit and he has no practical way of knowing  whats he going to do read 12 million forum threads to find out what is and isnt allowed whereas if such a list of things that have officially and publicly been declared exploits is put somewhere easily findable then if he has worries he can get a single authoritative answer its not a perfect solution but itd be a great improvement
the problem is in order to adequately explain what the exploit is you have to provide enough information to be able to perform it answer me honestly how many people do you think will read that and go  huh sounds interesting and then trot off to do it
update in the last few weeks trillions of isk have been injected in to the economy by these players who are building ships for no other reason than to destruct them for insurance this is over and above any losses from normal game playthis situation is urgent now
theres also the trash it option
ive been wondering about this for a while actually itd be kindof nice for a little contextual menu option to basically turn slaves items into freed slaves items or maybe turn the slaves in to some sort of agent and get freed slaves in return
yes rp for the win maybe make it a station service in soem matari and gallente stations
there were these nice pos modules for converting slaves to freed slaves or freed slaves to slaves they were on sisi at some point are they still coming in
id like this means i can get rid of the freeloaders p
ive been looking for this for a long time there are many options that this could allow such as educating the slaves to have them become ships crew if and when this is actually presented or selling them for standing at regional outposts in amarr space we could sell the slaves to republic security service stations for minmatar faction standing or sell the freed slaves to amarr stations in minmatar spacethis would be nice but npc corps would also like to participate i think it should become a permanent option for slaves and freed slaves without any module needed id even pay to detox the vitoc poisoning or the cost of the vitoc acclimation
only supported if an option is added that allows one to reprocess the slaves into valuable biomass
give us a blueprint that takes slaves as input and name it republic citizen and we put them on a production process and get minmatar citizen by that how hard can that bethank you
support biomass secondary option as well
i chuck them out the airlockhey theyre technically free at that point right

both idea have a ton of meritrp players should be able to make a difference as wellmike
just trash them and rationalise it as removing their slave status youre just getting them out of your hangar and releasing them into the general population you dont need a new database item to do that
i have personally always thought it a stupid implementation that when you attacked a plex your faction npcs never bothered to come and help defensive plexes would be made much harder if while trying to despawn it with you stabbed atron you had to deal with hostile npcsand i also think there needs to be created a space where alliances can be made to join fw cva and uk would really appreciate it it would allow for corps in the same team to better sync wardecs red and blue lists and the use of staging poses and unfortunately for star fraction no more abusing dec mechanics you dec corp a in the gallente militia you are kos for all the federation navy in highsec and all the corps in the gallente militia the creation of a meta alliance for fw purposes only would sufficealso evanda charbrilliantly put

its impressive how many bugs there are in fw that never got solvedi guess everyone already forgot about the contested status does not show in the topleft corner of the screen bug because its with us ever since fw got released and never got fixed
i was talking about this with some of my corp mates i guess that the eve social site that is in the works will solve some of the information flow problems but being able to build and deploy billboards for example would be better for role playing then having cans floating around with messages on them
support the ticker tape news summary which could surely be automated from the stats that the ingame map  new eve facebook app will collect rentable advertising space sounds good tooi think that these techniques would improve user immersion

and again
cool you might want to check this out if you have missed it
the blame game is all we have at this point until ccp decides to stand up and do something about it all long as corps like pie continue to support this actions by rping around them then yes they are part of the blame we also do know what would have happened if it were not used they never would have captured the systems they got so fast proof is in the pudding in the fact they couldnt do it before this game breaking exploit was used
who can we contact of the dev team so they give a response about this i dont like much the idea of waiting and see what happens because it might just not
youre not supposed to swamp the devs with stuff ive already forwarded as much relevant info to the relevant people as i could if there are details you think they should know you can of course mail it to me
anger tears and frustration is what i hear from the minmatar and is what amarr has been dealing with for well over a yearyou wonder why the amarr vs minmatar front has been stagnant well here it is i have been in the fw for 1 UFFFD years i have seen the good times and the bad times i have seen our systems fall and reclaimedour systems had fallen with speed due to loop holes and crushing numbers from the minmatar for those that remember outbreak rkk dark and despite amarr complaining about fw mechanics we did what needed to be done and worked hard to reclaim themthese loop holes that you talk about are the same loop holes that the minmatar have been using for well over a year the standing bug is in essence the same as a t1 frigate speed tanking all amarr plexes there is no riskyour generals were even paid isk incentives by neutral supporters to plex not asking how the vp were taken not caring if they were taken using loop holes but paid non the lessamarr corporations invested months of time and isk to set up staging areas to assault your systems getting them close to falling only to have your tribals use loop holes to destroy months work in a matter of a day with loop holes to move plexes from uncontested systems to a contested system is a valid tactic but to cap 10 of them using 1 ship using the timer bug in a 20 min period is a loop hole in desperate times during war you did what needed to be done we complained but still went on fightingthe same moral high ground that you ask amarr to take and the majority have is the sword that has stagnated this war while using these loop holes you laughed at our morals and corporations but now you stand there asking once again praising those corporations like 1pg the same ones you laughed atdo not presume to stand the moral high ground on what is happening to your systems when it is your own doing that has caused the harshest response tactics that you have been using that has now turned against youfor the first time in the war you systems are falling and you are now on the back foot just like amarr has been how will you respondas stated by many in the minmatar and neutral supporters you need to do what amarr did and fight and drive off the invaders i do not believe minmatar will just give upi expect this post will not sit well and only inflame your anger but needed to be said and i hope that now that all this is out that some good will now come for fw
supported of course
crushing numbers is not a loop hole nor is it an exploit speed tanking is also not a exploit as you amarr continually whine about it speed tanking dps is in fact one of minmatar ships active tanking systems our shields are not strong like caldris and our armor is not strong like amarr ships we have a mix of both and added ability to negate damage by speed tankingthis is not a exploit just like having a caldri or amarr ship sit there and tank the dps is not an exploit the best part about this is i see amarr doing speed tanking in plexes all the time yet where are you to complain about thatyou are your amarrios are just riding on the coat tails of the caldari and exploiting your way to system capture that you would have never gotten any other way
if the caldari had come in and used vigils to speed tank the plexes with poorly skilled alts instead of standing tanking the plexes would it have been okbecause if it would be possible to speed tank matari plexes so easily the outcome would have been the same however unlike most amarr plexes you cannot speed tank matari plexes with poorly skilled altsthe problem with the plexing mechanic is that the most efficient way to do it is have an alt semiafk capture it timers are stupid being able to capture without fighting is stupid plexing favoring doing it when no hostiles are nearby is stupidthe system is poorly designed period
you greatly overestimate the famed soloplexing vigil  eg it cant really do minors solo takes ages you cant really be afk sometimes it doesnt work etcyou also underestimate the ability of a crusader to solo capture minmatar complexes i have seen them do it it works no i do not claim that its just as easy no i do not claim that its ok as it isneither is comparable to just put your alt there and sit afk you can ab to some of them for 70km and blow them up only to get the first reaction a minute later they arent watching the screen for most part that is why they can plex with around 8 alts at once one has to admire the dedication thoughbesides all it takes are two ships instead of one to tank any plex not that much more difficult why hasnt it been done beforethis whole look even without this bug we would have won now is highly annoying and nothing but trying to avoid the sour taste of this victory you can not have both im afraidhad pervs decided to go to amarr space amarr would have lost just as fast just as much just as unreasonably  not because losing systems is bad but because this game mechanic is borkedthisand thislets stop talking around it
also this thread started before any system in metropolis fell as an attempt to raise all npcrelated issues to the csm including the different power levels of the npcs as you can see in the first postthe power levels are being addressed hopefully the rest is as well
using standing to avoid agro is not exploit either it is working as intended so claiming that caldari exploit is not true caldari has never exploited and will not exploit so i am asking you to stop these false accusationstruth is that minmatar uses same tricks every day in caldari front smaller scale though you should just find out what your own people does before you start to shout about exploiters and such
this was used by caldari on gallete complexes quite often maybe not by alts but by mainsin fact it would be easier to us we have right standing on our mains so no need for altsbut with our standing we cant join gallente side and i am sure there is no one existing gallente corp who would take pervs in their corp and gallente is so full of losers that why would we do it for them amarr has been our supporter on tough momentsand minmatar criminals hoarders all the time in caldari space raping our women and eating our children so we want to stop that now
supported bad game designs need to gopity about the whining and fingerpointing though its not a bug its working as intended so game mechanics need to be improved
yep like all clever uses of game mechanics  they have been used before what makes this different from all the other cases is that you pervs put a lot more dedication and time into it than anyone else has so farwhich brings out all the bad parts of the game design the game mechanics mean that the most effective way to capture systems in fw is to semiafk plexes on a large scale something you do while your player attention is somewhere elsethe simple fact on the amarrminmatar front is that both sides had trouble getting sufficient plexing done and the defensive plexing was barely enough to keep up with single dedicated attempts abc in metropolis arzad in amarr space before either side just gave up because of the silliness of plexingboth sides have had their rationalization for their lack of success minmatar have the well cant keep a system without postdt superiority amarr have the well what do you do against the ubervigilofdoom  both problems real but workable withboth sides get frustrated with the silly mechanics both sides use outright exploits such as bugging timers  it was awesome to close a plex in an empty system while five others around me closed for the enemy so far both sides did this apparently in roughly the same amount as neither side managed to skew it in their favorwhat broke this delicate balance of cant be arsed to do more was a group of people who put in a lot of time and dedication into plexing this was helped by using a silly game mechanic and cant blame them for it which demotivated and demoralized the defenders even moreits sufficiently proven that fw is completely and utterly broken the mechanics encourage a game style that can not be what ccp intended with the game and even those silly game mechanics have so many bugs its not funny anymorenow please stop blaming each other for being bad players its a game lets get the game designer to fix it and not bite each other for playing the game the best way we can
it is an exploit but it was rarely used intentional from either minmatar or amarr side during the war until now fact was that if you were running a timer and forced to jump out of the plex the timer sometimes kept running we tested the issue and found no way to force it to happen maybe some have found a way this bug is ugly and needs to be fixed but i personally never accused the amarr working with it and even now with those mindless caldaridrones exploiting the mechanic i am not sure that they use it intentionally but of cause it might be the case on the other hand the spervs wont need each 6 alts to sit on the buttons if they would so this is an ennoying bug but i dont know anyone that is using it intentionally funny that we found a lot of running timers in amarr space when looking for offensive plexes but i dont turn that against amarr plexers for i know that that ty timers sometimes are keeping running when you have to warp out but has to be fixed urgently how difficult can that be ifnot entity in grid timerstop have i do to have to write the damn code to show how it is fixed
supported
you can not speedtank amarr plexes with poorly skilled characters or vigils either i am the one who originally designed the plexvigil for minmatar and i know the limits of this vessel best you need damn good skills for that you cant do it afk you have to correct your fight path by hand and even then it can happen that you have to warp out the last minutes without ever be able to close that damn thing its something that cant be done afk au contraire mon ami you need a lot of skill as a player and you got to be sharp every second its something that cant be done with 6 alts at a timeits something that can be done in matari plexes with punishers and crusaders too ive seen itso lets drop that what is true is that the npc are bad balanced worst case are the caldari npc which are insane the design is poor but dont blame the vigil for all this the vigil is a good vessel but it has strong weaknesses too and those who use it are not those who know the mechanism of speedtanking best believe me i know them well and i know their damn limits and i dont use the vigil for it is not the reason im out there i use the rifter instead as the amarr prefer the punisher for thati dont think every npc should be the same there should be some racial differences but the npc at the moment are insanely unbalanced i dont think the amarrminmatar are too much but the gallentecaldari are laughable unbalanced but by the way ccp should work on all before you can speedtank an amarr plex you are almost on the level of flying interceptors i tried it as a lowskilled pilot and only achieved it a week before i was ready for ceptors which is a skilltime about  how long five monthsyou can do l4 missions in a ceptor i do when i want to have some fun why should an enemy plex be harder like that no i dont think so and the chaff about speedtanking is just a minor point that has to be fixed the most urgent point is a fast fix of this standing issue and after that an overhaul of the whole fwbecause this breaks the game it breaks the roleplay it makes the whole conflict minmataramarr a farce and i take the exploit of this mechanism personal indeed thats just griefing im not in the age to really enrage myself about this for its a kids way to play a game you dont go and beat up little children that do not know better but i stopped to take them serious for me everybody that is joining this stupid exploid is voiding his position for me to take anything he does or says serious more serious than the talk of a childand this is something i regret i was thinking better of the majority of amarr playerbase than to fall for such cheap tricks and even support these caldari griefers in destroying the whole factional warfare be serious we do it to make ccp listen do you believe thisi dont think you do for even now i have left a rest of respect for your intelligence its just childish play of kids that try to grief nothing more and what we minmatar do at the moment is go and spank their alts where we catch them have some fun doing this and ignore their follies we dont plex i dont plex anymore sasawong doesnt and most of the other some remain in the fight yes and i honour this its just i cant i dont play games on childish behaviour and let me dictacte rules if you would play a game of chess with me and you leave the room for a minute you can be safe that i didnt touched the pieces to win the game because only a unmature child would do this
i did some testing before operation and managed to speedtank amarr major plex with 60k sp alt in executioner i do not say that you can tank all plexes with low sp alt but some of those yes
i can totally believe that  the larger plexes are easier to speedtank than the smaller ones because often they dont spawn smaller ships at all even the missiles from the minmatar npc bs do very little damage if you are moving fastthe idea of spawning frigates in larger plexes has been brought up very early in fw and was put down because according to ccp npcs are only meant to serve as a distraction in case no players show upwhich is quite silly considering the vast differences in npc power levels and ewar strengths amarr tds are pretty bad for pvp btw just not as easy to notice as ecmluckily as z0d pointed out this is being addressed by the csm already see first post lets hope the rest is too
good job guyspervs are getting attention on stupid plex mechanics and others delivering this attention to ccp hopefully we are moving towards a factional warfare upgrade removal of fw missions and lp rewards for plexing fights in plexes heroic fights to death to save planets and stations from being occupied massive front line warfarekeep on it
wouldnt the best all round solution be so that you have to destroy all the npcs to capture a plexalways seemed a bit daft that you are able to capture a beacon whilst there are still god knows how many people npcs protecting it
agreed but knowing ccp theyd do that and leave gallente rats as they are and squids would take them all over again
i support this in general but honestly have grown to not care about how the pervs are achieving what they are achieving the real reason so many of us in the minmatar militia are unhappy about the situation is because at the rate the caldariamarr are tearing through our systems we will not realistically be able to undo the damage because of the far more hateful downtime plex respawn mechanics and their consequences throughout the rest of the daya number of minmatar militia corps recently hatched a plan to take as much amarr territory as possible but when we captured arzad we found that every day after downtime plexes would spawn there and be captured by the amarr in short order no more plexes would spawn until the following downtime most of the minmatar active plexers arent around at that time of day and we cant raise much of a fleet so we were completely unable to prevent the system being slowly but surely recaptured needless to say this broke the morale of many otherwise dedicated plexers whats the point capturing systems when it can be so easily undone with us powerless to prevent it  long ago ccp indicated they wanted to remove gameplay mechanics tied to downtime their apparent failure to address this in fw has now killed a large part of fwnow the caldari take our systems and that same downtime mechanic will prevent us reclaiming those systems when the caldari return home assuming the amarr defend their new systems in their usual mannerby breaking the delicate balance of minmataramarr system occupancy in such dramatic fashion the pervs have rendered that gameplay mechanic null and void i suspect ccp lack the resources to fix the downtime respawn problem so perhaps they could try something elsei personally have no problem with system occupancy meaning nothing but which sides name appears in the top lefthand corner of my eve client when i pass though the system its enough for me to know my team is doing well i dont expect the isk hose to be fired upon me as a reward every time i cap a plexi have always felt that the main point of the system occupancy mechanic in fw should be to encourage fleets to move around a bit and not hang around the same few systems the way things are heading at the moment we might as well only have 2 systems in fw and each side can just spend all day sitting on either side of the connecting gateid like to see it possible for a fleet of say 3040 pilots be able to fully capture a few systems within say a 34 hour period the current system takes far too long and makes it hard for casual fw participants to feel connected to what is going on if you can join a fleet and capture a system within your time served in that fleet youre going to start to care more its a mechanic that works in popular fps style games and with a little imagination it can work in eve toothe current long drawn out morale sapping grind of plexing in fw seems entirely contrary to what i thought ccp were aiming for when they launched fw something fast paced and casual that people can dip into and out of with ease having a good time for whatever amount of time they spent involvedplease take the grind out of fw ccp and if you have to completely remove the isk hose i never liked fw missions anyway to keep the exploiters out then so be itif people want to be bored out of their mind on a daily basis they have 00 to grind in let us have some fun in fw please
ideally you should have to kill all the defending npcs to take the beacon that said i agree this is just one of several poor game mechanics along with the vigil issue and inexperienced altslooking at that though i see another very similar problem that directly parallels this one currently a nonmilitia corp can wardec a militia corp and fire on them without worry of the other militia corps helping the target the reason standings the nontargeted militia corps would take a negative standings hit to defend the militiamate so what we have then is a situation where a ganksquad can cherry pick a couple to targets in a big militia fleet without being exposed to fire this is no different from the current issue of allies not taking a standings hit and drawing fire its just reversedi would support a fix to this issue only if at the same time ccp fixes it so a wardec on a militia corp makes one a target to that corps entire militia its common sense after allarchie
true enough but your experiences are from before the dirt cheap rigs came into being  those damn things changed the small ship game immenselyvigils are hardly used any more though they have been replaced with emtherm rigged extended rifters  ab around with impunity in any and all amarr plexes with added offensive capability funny i have been petitioning people with irrefutable screenshots as evidence even a chat log admitting guilt at one point and the pilots are still at largethen again there are gms that have to ask what a plex is what the bug is and everything in between  unless the statement came from a veteransenior gm or a producerdesigner i would regard it as nonsensethat is why a major overhaul is needed there are so many flaws in the basic mechanics that even ccps emploees cant keep up with the bug reports
they get a nice mail from a gm saying hi you are using exploits this is a warning stop it or you will get harsh consequences  they need to repeat offenses to actually get banned or anythingand the person petitioning always gets the same standard message thanks were looking into it ccp does not tell you what theyre doing

supportednothing new here same exploiters same old stories same ccp deaf ears even in face of overhelming evidence that a thing like this has to come from the players and discussed not acted upon is a sign of how sad things arebut not to worry some guy will write a story making sence of all of this i am sure
cccp in hey thats fuggin unbelievable fail
fully support the idea to require all npc destruction inside the complex been personally advocating that for quite some time nowas far as the taking of systems and complexes goes dias got no intention of stopping our part of the steamrolling
supportedthough i wonder what it says when the developers can come out with two fixes for an expansion patch in a week and this standings embarrassment has been allowed to continue for a year and a halfedit koronakesh and others remember to click the support tick box if you actually do support the thread
tbh ccp mixing pve with pvp is the big issue here it shouldnt have even been put into practice i think ccp should remove the pve side of things and concentrate on more pvp ie the more ships u kill in certain systems gives u the right to take that system it would encourage much more on the pvp front and fill faction war with pvpers i do agree on the mission side as the rewards are good for the faction ships just a thought
i present to you exhibit a a few days after the pervdamar alt army leaves for minmatar space and captures 6 systems in a day the gallente capture a system backyou guys can keep them 
i support this idea certainly the whole idea of plexing without combat is against the spirit of fw itselfby the way the argument of exposing bugs by exploiting them as often as possible sounds a little too close to the argument some people use when they design viruses to infect computers we were only exposing security issues and bugs in the operating systems is not a defence that sits well with the people who suffer from the viruses and it wouldnt work in court if you know it is a problem then highlight the issue like everyone elsei know people on all sides use shady tactics at times but the argument of they do it so i will too just sounds petulant and childish and dont label an entire militia by the actions of one person or a small percentage were all individuals bound into a collective the collective does not make us who we are

im not convinced there is a problem here so far only one mothership has been killed by this new doomsday weapon until there is alot more evidence to back up peoples theories i dont think any action needs to be taken by ccp
thumbs up
totally agree with this
agreed 
i really dont think ccp gives a flying f but ill sign for good measures any howsigned
supporting an optional temporary docking for mss till they are fixed theyre not worth a jot at the moment no reason for anyone to use one and it basically puts these characters out of commission
signed
im not a mom pilot and i dont know any but i agree they should be able to dock their motherships and jump in something cooler until they get unnerfed
my mom pilot is offline but if he was online i would like this
supported because ccp should perform damage control on their ups
i think this is a great ideaas much as i love my nyx its just a waste of a character leaving it in that ship obviously when a super capital pilot purchases a super capital they understand the consequences of buying one but to have a ship that can be killed in 3 hits is such an imbalance anyway i fully support this and would like it if mom pilots had this optioni also noticed no one from ccp has replied i think anyway i would like to hear what they have to say on the matter
signed
signed for temporary dock this is not validating the proposed change announced by ccp nozh that would have lowered the cost or made them dockableedit just give us the original changes damn it they was not taking away from dreads it was fine
after seeing applebabe go berserk recently deleting all posts that linked to the instapopped nyx mail i agree
while some of the deletions were valid    how many times do you want to read free abuthur it did look like a few babies got thrown out with the bathwatermike
sounds like an interesting idea and something that would add a bit more flavor sure supported
sounds good some nice colors on mining ops d
it should takeccp less time to implement then it took me to type up this message
rainbow
heck yesi approve
i totally support this idea as its simple to implement and as doesnt change anything to combat i dont see the pvpers flaming the idea
anything to make mining more interesting
let the miners have their colours so they look nice and pretty when someone violences their boats good and properi support tweaking these so called mining lasers
yes please
sounds cool to me
as a fellow miner i suppot this idea
d3f4ult approves
awesome idea
if amarr lasers can do it mining crystals should it too d
a good albeit obvious idea that cannot be hard nor expensive to implement which would add some character to the professionwholeheartedly supportedab
yes
i run mining ops in all spaces of eve high low and null  when i can sneak in somewhere  and i tell you the latter two are anything but dull from the rats in battle ships to those players that love to gank barges there is always something to keep you on your toes plus mining in low or null sec requires alot of player interaction ie a combat fitted squad for defense haulers to carry ore from the belt to a collection area and then the miners themselves in addtion you need a scout thats cloaked when your mining in 00 in space thats not yours providence is the only acception to this if your a amarr lover so i cant support your idea when all you need to do is get out of empire space and take the risk this is eve risk  reward
i support this ccp claims that mining is a fullfledged profession akin to trade exploration or pvp but everyone in this thread is claiming some variation of i have my alt do it while i watch tv until we turn mining into an engaging activity it will never rise above thatturning mining into a minigame akin to puzzle pirates or something would go along way towards making mining an attractive profession
that would be a good idea if eve were puzzle pirates if you want to play puzzles so much open your in game browser and play bejeweled while you mine the players above and myself would rather just play eveno change necessary
i wholly support a change to the docking games but your solution has a serious flawimagine if you will a noncombatant ship miner trader etc arrives at or tries to leave a station only to find themselves in the middle of a camp of course the station represents safety so they immediately attempt to dockif you are flying to a station you are pretty right you should be able to dock straight awayif however you are leaving the station then you have a 30 second session timer that you must wait out before you can redockwhat do you do during that 30 secondsunder your proposal nothing just do what you can to dock and hope that you survive assuming that you are scrammed and cant just warp away anywaythe problem with your proposal is that you are not permitted to defend yourselfobviously a mining or trading ship or even a smaller combat vessel will not be able to dent you so within 30 seconds it cant kill you before you kill itwhat it can do is simply try to survive this will quite likely include aggressive tactics such as ecm sensor jamming or taking out any drones that you use anything that drops your dps by even a point might just be the difference between surviving the 30 second timer or notwhat you are proposing is that ships that undock are not permitted to defend themselves in anyway other than all out combat  which is not what many ships are designed for you may as well be shooting fish in a barreli support a change to docking tactics as i see it as a huge problem for dominion  you are right on that pointi cannot however support your proposal as is
would be alot easier to add a docking timer that scaled upwards in relation to ship size or ship type think someone else said this toothis firstly changes nothing about the gate games which are fine imofor combat purposes if youve engaged you have not only your docking timer but also the additional agro timer to take into account if you have not engaged you mearly have your docking timer to worry aboutit relates to the fluff of eve as larger ships take more time to manouver and more time to parkplayers undocking only to redock once shot are never really going to stay undocked so with the above rules they would either stay docked or undock and take the risks none of this inoutinout whackamole type gameplaythe only problem i can see initionally is the innocent industrials and the like that get d after warping to a station but then again people would argue if your putting an industrial in that situation then its your own faulti personally feel its better than a purely aggression based timer and keeps if not improves tactical optionsalthough there are bound to be holes galore in there but meh  if you find them fill um
when youre a wormhole and you click the sov link you will see the number of kills in that current system the kills for the constelation and even for the region why do sleepers keep ninja statistics about capsuleers it doesnt make sense from the rp point of view the whs are suposed to be the ultimate ninja environment why would the sleepers offer ninja statisticsi say remove the sov link from the whsor hell if you keep that you might as well add local back
really dang yeah take away the system info  if youre not going to have local you shouldnt have body counts either
yeah definitely get rid of those stats
pretty straight forward  they would of course repair very slowly in line with armor repper is to hull repper as armor maintenance bot is to hull maintenance bot  standard lightmediumheavy sizes  probably the same models at armor bots just a different graphic effect ie very easy to implementjust something ive wanted for awhile doesnt seem too exceptional or game breakingedit by different graphic effect i mean taking the one from the remote hull repper the same way armor bots take their effect from the remote armor repper just wanted to make that clear
sounds cool
lol not really dude im not the one crying because im scared to take my ship out of dry dock what ccp have done makes a great deal of sense when taken in context of game balance in generala mom in a proper alliance fleet while it may get instad by 3 titans will be revenged by the destruction of titans if those titans arnt themselves properly supported by there own fleetsmoms were never meant to be used for minimully supported lowsecnullsec gatecamp invulneramobilesa use for which they have been used and abused for years now its that usage that has really been nerfbatted to hell and back by the mere possibility that they themselves may end up being pwnedmoms used without support were allways vulnerable to dreadcarrier hot drops  so really what has changedmaybe moms should be made insurable if docked up in outposts  is that possible then they can be used by 00 alliances with limited risklow sec players who dont have access to outposts are of course screwedbut then again it was ccps original intent that these ships be used by 00 alliances in cap fleet warfare and not as ultimate gatecamp mobilesi think the cap changes are cool and the cruelness of the eve universe has reached new levelsepic battles lie ahead  and the spoils will go to those alliances that have big enough cohonees to bring moms and titans to the field instead of mere carriers and dreadslet there be no glass ceiling to the risks we can take in this gamemom vulnerability is a good thing  death and destruction on epic scale is what makes eve the best game in the universeif the kitchen is too hot for you these days then hello kitty online is this wayor sell the mom to someone who has the balls to use it and fly carriers instead  problem solved

this issue was brought to my attention by a concerned citizen during the campaign phase of the csm elections and it seemed so obvious that i couldnt do anything but promise that i would bring it up this is a recap from an old thead by that person in order to poll support at this timesince the introduction of tech2 sentry drones there has been a major inconsistency in eves drone lineup they are the only tech2 drones that do not require the racespecific drone specialization skill a few very easy solutions1 make the racial specialization skills affect t2 sentries giving them at best 10 better dps than they have now2 make the racial specialization skill affect t2 sentries but reduce base damage a little so they dont come out much more powerful than they are now3 give the racial specialization skill some sort of other bonus for sentry drones  tracking or range or something leaving base dps the same but improving effective dps versus faraway or moving targets sok
we not need 1 personal csm own votedont want to play god with csm titleand not supported this changes
sentry drone interfacing takes forever to rain and its more than fairdont fix what aint broke
this isnt strictly true neither t2 logistics drones nor t2 mining drones need any racial drone spec skillsi am against this because the different sentry drones work in a different way to regular combat drones normally the choice between different flavours of combat drone gets you a different damage type whereas sentries give markedly different range and tracking profiles thus in some cases you might want to deploy wardens for sniping and then switch to gardes for close in work while its vanishingly unlikely that anyone who can use t2 sentries wont have at least one racial drone skill at iv its harsh to expect drone users to train all of them just to be able to have some kind of tactical flexibility
i am a drone user and i do support thisi however do not think that sentries should get their damage nerfed whyt1 sentries out damage t1 heafvy drones by a tiny margin but they do that is a compensation they get for inability to more t2 sentries currently deal less damage then t2 heavy drones when used by a well skilled pilot imao that needs changing and sentury drones should apply racial skills in exchange for higher training timeit takes just as long as heavy drone operation
pity to see the quick changeabout with this tell the devs not to make changes while intoxicated
it isnt the fact that it uses citadel missiles in the first place that is bad its the fact that it was turned back into a split weapon bonus ship that is the focus of my irecampaign for fixing citadel missiles certainly but please also work to have the naglfar returned to having balanced projectileonly bonuses
the same reason they did the delay  server loadout and traffic generation  less lags
nice idea
at last
supported if t3 probes are added that cannot be filtered in scanner results
supported if you an scan down specific anomolies or clouds to obscure yourself from such t3 probes
supported if they can be scanned by onboard scanner
supported if said anomolies jacked up your ship like whs
do you know how quick and easy it already is to probe someone down
i do thats what i dosometimes i have a need to mask probes in systems with a lot of results on dscan  scanning not only for ships but for wormholes as well hoping noone will notice bassicly orginal proposal makes this impossible thus this will dumb game for me 
absolutely
another logosfski thread another bunch of supports perhaps ccp will do something about itmany workable ways have been suggested the simplest was to keep the warp back in spot the same no matter how many times you log ie you cannot log rapidly 10 times in a row to create a safe spot off the gatethe target will still survive protecting the 98 of cheaters as well as the 2 of genuine disconects but he cannot log back in until the gate camp decides to stop meaning the genuine disconects will log back in and fight and the cheater will have a penalty for cheating no more eve for you tonight timmyits not perfect it still puts the benefit of the doubt in favour of the cheater but at least there is some punishment for cheatingccp are looking at implementing this though they complained it was hard to programme one wonders why they became computer programmers if they didnt want to programmeits also hard to serve customers at walmart for 10 hours a day but thats kind of the job of a shop assistant and what he gets paid forskunk
actually what happened is they logged off after jumping through and before decloaking they decloaked to emergency warp but since you did not aggress them while they were still online they dont get the fifteen minute aggro timer if you had aggressed them while they were still online they would be stuck still support making it impossible for ships to disappear from space once they are pointed
so what happens when i jump in ready to engage someone and my client crashes then i die to a client crash when i would have killed you due to superior fitskillstactics
agreed this is problematic for the exact reasons the op mentioned getting attacked should give an aggro timer regardless of whether or not the person is logged in
ive seen many kills disappear from under my nose cause of this
how about filing a bugreport first and get a response
agree
as a matter of fact it is quite the contrary ccps goal is to make eve unplayable unless you are in a team with other people where everybody fill specific roles that have been predefined by ccp with no overlaps possible as per ship design of course this aim of ccps has nothing to do with emergence or the sandbox which have become marketing bull weasel words ccp cares about revenue and are optimising their product to provide the largest possible base of player accountsso basically those times are over where a couple of well skilled guys can get into their expensive t2 ships and go out roaming or wreaking havoc on some gate in your case the damage dealer role was not filled a hic tackling and a cs commandteam bonus is not enough against a bs  you need moar peopleonly news is that now you dont get to capitalize on a logoffski anymore if the victim had no intention of aggression fair enough tbh as it is lowsec and if we are to take the game background story seriously you are not allowed to kill people there so no reason for a game mechanic that deals with loss of connection and not gate camps to indirectly support the kill relates to the discussion about timers and docking games obviouslyhtfu pirate whiners you must become team builders before you can kill
this so very much
well at least we know who the carebears are and for the contrary low sec pirating is a mechanic to the game otherwise concord would kill you like in high sec just because ccp tailors to the wimpy no balls carebears does not make it a fair game anymore in my opinion it is turning into wow and soon you wont have any loss at all and then maybe your ship can do a little dance too so ccp stop tailoring to the new gay a newbs who dont belong in 00 it took me my first year to get there when i started to get the skills to do something now you can be a day old and do ridiculous things be a little more rewarding to your long time subscription holders than new accts your giving them way too much to start off with and we had to start from nothingif it moves shoot it pansy carebear blobbers
had both a freighter and an orca log off jumping gates and both times the targets were scrambled and aggressedboth times they disappeared and in one case a friendly vaga was popped by gunswas against a red target not random piracy in low sec system that borders 00gms said it was legit mechanichowevernot sure its right that a ship can be popped for aggressing a target that isnt really therebottom lineccp need to fix this so that any ship that is aggressed before it disappears from game through logginggets the 15 minute aggro timer
yo
like goring cheating the hangman
i agree
this
in that case its like its always been its your fault and not ccps and you dont get your ship back if its ccps fault you get it reimbursed
i have a hard time believing ccp doesnt know when ctrlq gets hit  its way too trivial to send a message on ctrlq that would let the server know that it was an intentional quitthe real problem is a faked network failure by disconnecting in other ways killing eve client from task manager pulling network cable switch off router etc that kind of thing cant be distinguished from a real network problemgetting the balance right between punishing those lamers who just log off when in trouble and players with real network issues who would rightfully be annoyedby reconnecting to a clone in station without havhing any chance to do a thing is just not easy
their simply has to be some sort of balance between the two game should not become impossible for people whose isp is a fing bch and gives them unstable connection or has technical problems or maintenance issues every other day sometimes that happens and sometimes you do not have any better isp in the are to switch to because odds are if they had one they already would
i think the difficulty is ccp is trying to fix multiple possible problems with one solution several different experiences ive had regarding this1 recently had three ravens with names like 123y243 jump into a t2 l bubble put dps on one which died meanwhile interceptors put webs and scrams on the other two so they couldnt get back to gate or get out of the bubble shortly after the first raven popped the other two were no where to be seen2 in a big fleet fc gives the order to jump the gate and hold cloak everyone jumps cloak is held when it times out we begin to engage at this point a lot of people in the fleet start saying still have a black screenloading screen so our fleet was smaller than anticipated as well as having a chunk of ships immobile uncloaked and uncontrolled some did actually autowarp out some died without ever seeing the fight i died horribly but not because of connectionloading problems3 camping freighterfrigate combo spotted inbound frigate jumps frigate decloaks and goes boom freighter pulls a jumpctrlq we are furious vow on the blood of unborn children to kill him we see him in local again for a few seconds before disappearing  doing the loginlogoff stepping thing to get a safespot login scan him down but his disappears before anything meaningful can be put on him rinse repeat rinse repeat we take shifts in tacklers at the last logout spot for a few hours just before downtime hes back but we cant get dps on him fast enough before the server shuts down after start up the vigilant finally get him unfortunately it was way too late for me and i had gone to bed after the server shutdown4 enter cva space with a 20 man gang scout jumps to next system into a 100 blood thirsty defense fleet we warp to a planet and send a second scout to the other gate big ugly fleet sitting there as well we log thus avoiding what assuredly would have been a very bad end to a roamthese are the game mechanics for 134 there should have been more blood because of situations like 2 a solution that allows 134 to happen exists the solution sucks in all 4 cases whether it is ops solution previous ccp iterations or the current solution  it sucks
because commenting and talking about kills is one of the biggest things in evelet us instead of getting a single killmail see all the casualties in the entire engagement all damage done even if it did not lead to ship loss eg i was fighting a abaddon in mega i got it to 10 hull that will be visible on the killmailwe should be able to see logistics ships involved separately ewar separately have a comment section underneath where people can emorage we would be able to see not just one weapon used but all the array of weaponry and ewar a bar aided by and disturbed by anyone can come up with better name for ewar and logistics accordingly even if they did not damage kills by npcs will not be included unless stated otherwise in user preferences their should be option to hide the killmail if all parties involved agree to do that their should be corporate alliance and group killboards that are simply produced by filtering from the mail global killboard global corporational and simply group ranking should be possible eg i create a group slaughter all pirates yarr invite 4 friends all from different corps and we have a group killboard that is shown by filtering only killmails related to us combat log should also include engagements that did not lead to fatalities so damage dealt by parties to eachother and recond of who fled the field it would also let us see latest casualties in the region system filter by the area where kills occurred ship type parties involved etc also make it possible to make killboards for a particular campaign say war between two corporations everyone will be able see how it is going sure it is a lot of work but pvp is the most important aspect of eve and having proper records of it is very important and would be rather encouraging if you epic kill of a afk carrier pilot in a noobship can be seen by the entire univerce and you would have the pilot raging out on comment section and carebare tears spilt
i dont think running a killboard should be ccps job
this there are plenty of killboards floating around use one of them
nope not supported
i think logi and ewar ships need killboard loving i think the idea of having a tally of total damage done and total damage soaked would be incredibly nice at the very least it would identify the killboard s who get on 10 kills with a total of 0 damage done in the entire engagement for all to mock it will also serve to provide a thumbs up for logi pilots who keep a primaried ship alive through several minutes of concentrated enemy fire the way killmails are currently designed it promotes glass cannons over all else it would be nice to have something to promoterecognize the use of other shipsmaybe not a ccp killboard but at least some modification to andor addition to the postfight information provided would be nice
ok in such case let ccp rework the way combat log works so it incudeslogistics ships involvedewar ships involved yes when you see a falkon in kilmail you know it probably was ewar fitted but in other cases it can be less obvious istead of heaving 10 killmails for every kill and having only guy recieveing the final blow recieve the killmail everyone that was participating in engagement gets a combat log for all shipos destroyed so even logistics guys get credit record damage dealt by the victim even if it did not lead to other persons death as i have stated abovemake it all accesible though api and let third party killboards use it would you support that
deleted
edit  or this 
id like to see less intel less killmail less scoreboard not more not supported
if there are going to be any kill boards why not have ccp do it they have all the data already and that would mean we could finally stop having to post all the kill mails ccp could have it done automaticallyi totally support a ccp run killboard
this getting intel about fitting is already too easy it shouldnt get easier

yes this should be part of the review of fw npc ewar which in turn should also be part of the general review of fw mechanicscurrently the best way to tank a caldari plex is to do some missions with a caldari corporation and get good standings with the faction then join the minmatar militia then go and sit in a caldari plex and capture it for the gallente the caldari navy wont even bother targetting you  the best eccm there isps dont try tactic this in hisec
completely supported
i agree it is a balance issue it needs to change
sure seems reasonable minor issue but should be easy to do
why not
indeed
much too complicated eitherallow modifications one every 2 hours orcharge half the brokers fee on the entire order value so lots of tiny changes becomes expensive
make the brokers do the hard work they get a fee after alladvanced buy ordersenable entering of maximum price payablequantity requiredcompletion date requiredtick box to leave order up at max price after completion date until order fillsrange as nowthe brokers job is then to modify the price on your buy order  up to maximum specifiedthe brokers aim is to get the quantity required by the completion dateof course technically there would probably need to be a new server that does the work of the brokerbut at least this way the market would be less of a drag to useand suspected market bot users would have zero advantage over players who play the game legitimately
neither of which fix the issue whoever lists their sale last wins in either of those systems if your order is already up then you cant compete with people who list an order after you
make the npc starter and secondary channels joinable by everyone and anyonewould help encourage player interaction
this has probably never been fixed because its probably never mattered but yes a corp should always consider itself 100 standings
who are the standing towards while creating a standings fleet if there towards the fleet boss then all you need to do is set your  the fleet boss  personal standings towards your own corp to blue
personally id rather seedrone interfacing bonus apply to all drones before a smartass says it drones role enh by 20level not damagesentry damage rig should be changed to apply to all combat drones
its not a pointless change but im sure it wont happen the problem with dedicated drone ships is they are the only ships in eve that can lose their fire power due having all their drones killed no other ship class in eve can be stripped of its weapon system before the ship is destroyed drone ships have limited drone bays which means you can only carry so many spares and once you lose them you are a sitting duck have 10 drones doing the same damage as the current 5 would allow you a bit more leeway and make it harder for others to leave you weaponless not to mention as a pirate drone boats are pretty much usless in most gangs due to the fact sentries actively target your dronesone suggestion i had made in the past was to allow your drone bay to be reloaded from the cargo bay this way you could carry extra drones in your cargo bay to reload as you lose them
so first they remove lag and now you want them to bring it back are you stupid or something
yes fleet battles are laggy protip fleet battles use drones too often a lot of drones a big fight can easily feature north of a thousand drones on the field do you really think its a good idea to double that count in the single laggiest situation in eve not supported
no should be 1 drone per ship you want all drone damage on a singe target
there is a considerable confusion concerning the pirate faction ships that are described as being of angel cartel designcurrently there are 2 of each hull for angels dramieldaredevil cynabalvigilant macharielvindicatorobviously the vigilant and vindicator follow the serpentis designation and unless i am mistaken drop from serpentis rats to my knowledge angelsserpentis are not allied factionssome adjustments should be made for the serpentis hulls to indicate that they are indeed serpentis design
like similar weapon systems or ship hulls that look the samedramiel cynabal macharieldaredevil vigilant vindicatorits really not that hard
the angel cartel and the serpentis are allied of coursethe guardian angels are a division of the cartel being responsible of defending serpentis stations
yeah a slight tweak to the descriptions could be useful  no reason the serp ships shouldnt say something like designed by the angels for the protection of serpentis installations i actually got messed up by that the other day was trying to remember which frig was which saw they were both angel ships from the description got slightly confused then read the bonuses a little more clarity on this topic would be good
the special feature is the dual 90 webs its not as impressive as the godly bhaalgorn ew but its better than the rattlesnake gets of course a faction bs being better than a rattlesnake and worse than a bhaalgorn is sort of the default but if i had to pick between nightmaremacharielvindicator for the best of the three i really dont know which id pick i certainly wouldnt say that its obviously worse than the other two
the role of like a rig but much more expensive and a little better seems wellfilled by t2 might be cool but i dont think its actually a good idea
the orca fits the role your asking for yes it is a mining ship and requires skill to get into but its also a very good cargo carrier i use my orca for everything from mining to running ships and mods all over eve i dont need another industrial type ship to train for when the ones that are in game are sufficent idea not supported 
you can fit an orca

hello alli know this idea has been posted during my term and got pretty good player support but was shut down by my fellow delegates for this reason i am reposting it in the hopes that csm 4 is able to bring it to ccpcurrent ships in the game have little you can do to differentiate them from other ships rigs gave us some way we could augment the ship to fit our play style but still leaves a lot to be desiredafter doing a lot of work looking at the throughput required when a ship loads into the screen i believe a simple painting scheme would allow us to make the ships our own without bottlenecking the servers some coding will need to be done to implement this but it should be a relatively easy processthe first step is to give a checkbox in the escape menu to allow people to turn this feature off if they desire as it could weigh down blob warfare even more than it has already then the ship models will have to be split up into two separate sections and a colormap applied to each section as desiredthis colormap will consist of a pallette of colors which allows only 12 bits to cover each of the two sections of a ship and allowing the servers to deliver the information to the respective client interfaces using 4 bits per rgb color each one of these sections could be colored the same or differently depending on the desires of the pilot as listed belowcolor chartgiven the depth this simple change would allow it would give a large amount of individuality to the ships and a simple interface to repaint the ships there could even be a charge in the game for repainting a shipfuture upgrades could allow for multiple color fields andor textures assuming the client lag wouldnt be too tremendous i think this is a good way to implement the color schemes without lagging the user computers too much with the checkbox available on the menu it would give the users the option to turn it off in highload environments such as jita or blob warfare in 00
noplease refer to my post in previous threads for reasons why
with a new csm coming in i was hoping to kindly remind them of the following topics already brought up by previous csm groups remote repair and agression
im probably showing my noobishness here but what does leadership 5 buy you when youre flying as a squad member in a fleet with well trained squad wing and fleet leaders
oh this isnt meant to be some kinda joke thread i was srs about the starcraft stuff and i was thinking make it alot of ranks maybe 30 ranks
why are you all so negative ccp are doing amazing thing there adding more things to the game will get you busy even when there is an op which is far away and much much more excited you guys have been too much flying junk around they will give you new faces too see exotic dancers i am saying thiswe should all backup ccp and tell them go ahead and release it
so since there is a new csm meeting i would like to get your attention to the dual screen issues short ship is spilt in half solution move the focus point of the view leftright this issue stands already so long and sthe solution technically seems very simpleadjust camera center wiki  ah thread  fi thread 1  fi thread 2  fi thread 3there are more threads but i wont bother finding them all fi 3 is my own where i propose the solution a bit more indepth
i read that thread on eve search because the modhammer was dropping way too hard on the main thread but i dont think it archived all that much extra it was only about three pages longer i think whereas from the way people were talking a lot more than 3 pages got deleted people mentioned multiple times that serious wellconsidered posts of theirs got deleted not just free abathur angry little man posts i cant tell you whether they had legit posts got killed intentionally killed accidentally or whether theyre just lying but from the best archiving we have id say that there was a serious problem with mod overreaction on that thread also surprised nobody has put the docking games fix thread on the agenda yet
1 this was already rejected by ccp2 you should be very specific about the fact that heavy moderation creates apathy and starts a war ccp cant win3 already raised
 inappropriate text removed  ccp ildoge its a good thing you think youre so great it probably helps compensate for a lot
you have been playing this game far too long to be expecting ccp to carry through on promises more than half the time have you not yet learned to be a bitter cynical misanthrope

it could actually reduce the load on the database not having to copy hundreds of bookmarks to an object stick in a can and then load on another char
it also would breed consistency in bookmark labels make it easier for lower sp  newer members of a corp to have access to well defined bookmarks without having to go out and make his or her own or have to go through the copying nightmare overall better fleet organization that a centralised bookmark database for each corp would grant as it continues to add new ones finally not needing to worry about preference folder issues and lost bookmarks
we wants the precioussomething needs to be changed with the bookmarks an other solution is to implement a way to convert a bookmark item into plain text and back into a bookmark that way you could easily evemail bookmarks or post them on a corp forum or wherever youd likethis shouldnt be difficult to implement and people can use already existing mechanisms to share bookmarks

wtb best idea in ages
i support this and would say take it one more step and take an idea from wowpaypal im talking about those little account authenticators i have one for my ebaypaypal thing and like the added security think i saw a friends one for wow and looked the same so the company seems to have mmo experiance

i support this as well aa is annoying most games offer the option of either aa or hdr eve should do the same if both cant be accomplished at the same timehowever the shadowsoh dear the shadows these are horrible and under all acceptable levels horribly blocky shadows that tempts me to turn them off
not sure what youre trying to say exactly forgive me for possibly taking this the wrong way but you mean gallente arent supposed to be the highest damage dealers cause i coulda sworn they weresupported all the way gallente are pretty lacking tbh im personally training minmatar cause im so fed up at how underwhelming gallente is for me right now
definately supported gallente ftw
omg so many views and yet so few supports how can anybody not support this
all hybrid platforms need help not just gallente railguns and blasters are both so far to the extremes that they lack a nicheedit i forgot to support this topic
supported with all my heart i miss the days when gallente were the masters of punchyouinthefacewithanirongauntlet now they are just kind of meh and there are a ton of hideous shield tanked variations of gallente ships it just sad to watch this happen please ccp make us worthwhile again

i was flying a dual propulsion taranis recently and this would have helpedalso hangar sorting
i walso was like whaat
rather than coding special ui items an alternate way for ccp to implement freeing slaves would be to add lp store entries to minmatar and maybe gallente corporations that takes slaves perhaps some cash to pay for education insorum etc and returns something  maybe other livestock items or a less tangible item like lpsof course amarrian corporations should have something similar on their side for enslaving humanoids it would just be more problematic as there are far more types of nonslave human cargo items than slaves
i like this idea it builds on an existing mechanic so how difficult could it be to implement as for the second idea the type of passenger offered for enslavement could be related to the lp item gained
yes please

supported as long as we can also put slaves we have to work 1 isk  week per slave toiling for an account
slaves have the unfortunate disadvantage of often being dependent on the antivirus of vitoc 
arrange a few bpos1 x slaves  1 x racial charter  homelessmaybe different racial charters create different groupshomeless  amarr charter  slavesslaves  caldari charter  mercenryetc
although it doesnt seem to appear in the online item database freed slaves is already an ingame item
quoting myself because i hate being right minmatar militia had two systems vulnerable today for 5 hours until the amarr could muster a fleet strong enough to kill the defense fleet and kill the bunkers during those 5 hours around 40ish plexes were capped none spawned in either of the vulnerable systemsif that is not the intended use of the bunker mechanism what is it thenfix fw please silly mechanics are silly
there are some brilliant ideas in this thread that could really draw a lot of people into lowsecccp please
somebody is extracting the michael herean extremely bent and ooc mechanic gets used and we get an isd reporter flagging it as ic news
exactly give us something to rep up like a pos out of reinforced or at least something to do to turn the system back to contested the way things are now having system control in a vulnerable system doesnt help us at all since we have to do stuff in the surrounding systems and then cross our fingers

making the captured teritory pay dividends would be a good idea i thinkrp wise it can be explained as a tax put upon those peoples  people living on planets  not players  living in occupied teritoryevery active player in faction militia that hasa participated in a kill against a faction militia opponent in the last 7 daysandb captured or defended a plex for the militia in the last 7 daysgets an isk reward from the faction they play forthe isk reward would be somewhere around 10000 isk for every system held by the factionthe higher you faction rank the more isk you get
lol not sure if you are aware how long it took for ccp to fix sov mechanics or not years in all honesty the sov mechanics just implemented in 00 are what you have had in fw for the last 6 months except they cost piles of isk and heavy pew pew rather than just some pew pew they added a few things  probably stuff that will filter back to fw later upgrading systems seem a logic thing to port lag was more of a problem for mission running hubs and jita where those lag fixes were focused see how often jita is the benchmarkthat said i support fixes to fw  mostly because i would rather ccp test major changes on you guys then port them to 00 after the major bugs are worked out than the other way around however i think the fw fixes should go handinhand with the vegas concept for low sec add the other factions into the fw mix in some form have system control or whatever the low sec version is of sov cause changesadjustments in the composition of a system instead of a twosided thing like suggested by vegas make it 20sidedcaldariminmataramarrgallentejovian directorate maybemaybe notconcordammatarkhanidintakiguristasangelsblood raidersinterbusorethukkersoethe society probably ditch jove and keep thismordusanshaserpentisand have the benefits follow the standings between the factions and the focus of those factionsthe 4 races would put faction police at gatesstations better enemy spawns in belts improve factionnavy agent levelqualitycountconcord might increase concord guns concord presence improve rat spawns in beltsthe offshoot races  intaki ammatar khanid thukker mordu  would provide benefits that were a cross between the big races and the pirate factionsthe quasicarebeartypes  interbus ore soe society  provide something like a cross between race and concord benefits perhaps a focus on boosting asteroidspirates provide corruption resurrect pirate haven systems rancer etc  but with benefits see vegas
do take a look
only way ill step back into fw is if they address this kind of stuff namely the lag it was simply unbearablesigned
definitely this honestly though because it would cost isk to make an ad isk spammers couldnt hide behind a disconnected trial account as the money trail would lead back to the accounts farming the isk
and use goddamn billboards stick them to stations everywhere
killmails have been a lil dodgy for as long as i can remember but ever since apocrypha they have started to misbehave to extreme ends and i think its time some hamsters are punished for itexamplesno modswrong amount of total damage taken no damage shown at all for tjespecially the total damage taken and damage dealt per opponent are very often wrong there seems to be a rough correlation between the amount of people on the mail and the chance of it being messed up but there are notable exceptions on both ends sometimes the top few people seem to show accurate stats in damage dealt while the rest ends up with very little or even zero time and time it has proven that the mails are wrong by simply comparing them to the ingame damage logsbesides the fact that it is just annoying it also prevents a detailed breakdown of fights and combat analysis at the end of the daythus i would like to urge ccp to reexamine killmails in order to find out why they are being malformed so consistently and take measures to prevent that from happening sokevelopedia article

i support this proposal
our logs does not show any problems
check and make sure its listed in your ingame losses if its not then thats a fake km
probably one of the biggest bugs in the game currently
actually i was just considering this the best idea i could think of was the ability to build yourself a library that compresses all settings and stores it in a small file this way not only could you restore your settings and save the server hamsters but you could also share settings with othersthis would require a bit of coding especially so it doesnt affect the raw game files and only changes the cache the file could be shared on evefiles or saved to a usb drive for portability or simply emailedotherwise i do support this measure
i use a desktop at home and laptop when travellingbookmarks and market quicklinks should be stored server sideoverviews i would suggest that this be optional if you use different machines then its likely that screen sizes are different so overviews would be differentmaybe your main settings are stored but you have the option to use local settings on a secondary machine
do plz
im not involved in fw in the slightest but i dont see why this should not be fixed goes completely against the spirit of that facet of the game

its pretty sad when several thousand members of your game are completely ignored when a loophole this big is being exploited nonstopshame on ccp for letting this happen and not caring shame on the people who exploit it constantly get lives
ccpwe pay you money for a gaming universe that is complex fun and internally consistent being able to capture plexes with unarmed untanked immobile vessels is not explainable this is in an entirely different ballpark than solorunning plexes with vigils or crucifiersa tactic that requires a lot of xp a lot of skill and does not blatantly fly in the face of intended game mechanics this is an exploit as evinced by the fact that a third party has managed to flip more systems over the course of 72 hours than the entire amarr and minmatar militias have been able to do in the past year even if you dont know what you are going to do about this yet please at least let us know if you are even considering it were all dying to know and it is going to make a significant impact on many of our ingame decisions thankskaito
i would love to see a fix on this but i dont see it happening soon ccp is to concerned with getting everyone out of empire and into null sec so maybe this is something on ccps part to get fw to close down and push all militia pilots into null sec

yeah guhnrthis would look great i like the sparkle idea for t2 alizandro goderaski as well o7
i am in im sick of just yelloworange beams with blue for ice i either want colors you can change manually or changing dependant on which crystal you have loaded
an eve price ceiling i define as any refineable item which is available at a fixed price via npc sell order these inhibit competition by constraining the market potentially keeping mineral prices lower than they would bei would like the ccp economics and statistics team to devote some time to systematically identifying these items ascertaining their impact if any and then turning them over to the devs to either make them unrefineable or produceable by players only
what items are you talking about i mean specifically examples
pos and related items come to mind though im not versed in the economic dynamics to know if it is significant enough to be a determining factor in pricing right now you can buy them in unlimited quantities from npcs and refine themshuttles used to be text book example of this but ccp fixed them i just want moar
i cant see supporting asking the people who could be making my game better to take time to hunt for things were not even sure are there you dont know that this has an impact couldnt you ask around a bit first i mean you guys have a limited amount of time to get ccp doing things the community wants wouldnt it make sense not to waste that time on speculated price ceilings ask in the market discussion forum if you come back with data that shows refining of pos or other anchorables or any other npc sold item for that matter has a real effect on mineral price limits then ill support
a feature i would like to see is the ability to fix the start and end point of a journey and have the autopilot optimise all of the other way points in betweenthat way a destination is just that  the destination and adding way points is a point between where you are now and the destinationthis would allow you to guarantee that you visit all the stops you need to and arrive at your destination or even plot a round trip to get back home after going to 3 or 4 stops along the wayat present if your intended destination is closer than a way point you usually get a course plotted to the destination and then to the other way points  which become the new destination
i like being able to plot my entire course especially setting a waypoint just before entering lownullsec so i dont have to sit at my computer traveling through empire that said i dont see why they cant upgrade the autopilot interface to toggle onoff exiting autopilot upon reaching a waypoint
as far as i know theres an option for autopilot to stop autopilot at waypointswouldnt this door am i misunderstanding something
yes dude you are missing somethingsay you are in new caldari and you have 8 pickups to make and want to drop all in jita for salecurrently there is no way to calculate optimal route from new caldari  ending in jita and visiting the 8 stops before you get to jitaprogramatically all the optimise routine has to do is reject any route  while searching for optimal  that does not end in jitaa tick box  keep current destination next to the optimise button should surficewhy this hasnt been a feature of eve for the last 6 years is a mystery because it would be increadably usefulespec for trader types
so long as it takes you to said destination at 12km offsorry but i refuse to encourage lazy afk autopilotingi love it when they lose there ships to a suicide gank because they afk apedeven then im not supporting it
sorry op i tried to explainbut i guess sometimes you just need to draw pictures for some people
oh i understood what you where askingbut autopiloting is always disastrous when people are given more featuresif you wana fix the map to behave then go right on aheadbut i dont even use it in that fashion typically i memorize the route or make waypoints in such a fashion that i make my own optimized routehonestly its not that big of a deal to me
it is one thing to have the autopilot calculate an optimal route and another thing to use it to actually fly that routeand im sure no one will force you to use itthats a good idea especially when you are flying a slower ship or having a long trip
ohgodyesctrl click pls
yes
get rid of it id actually like to see the locus signatures hidden theres way too much easy info available about every unknown system
at present if an autopilot route goes through two or more systems that are immediately adjacent to the system the pilot is currently in then all stargate icons for those systems on the route are highlighted yellow both in space and in the overview not just the stargate leading to the next system in the route this issue only occurs when routes with multiple waypoints are seti propose that a stargate icon should only be highlighted if it leads to the next system in the route stargates that lead to systems that are on the route but are not the next system in the route should not be highlightedi admit that this is a low priority issue its an annoyance that would be nice to be rid of when ccp can spare the time to get around to it after handling more important thingsthank you
never seen this before but sounds like it needs to be fixed
indeed i see it most frequently when im doing courier missions for a particular agent ill set the distant station as the first waypoint and my starting system as the second waypoint while on the outbound route both the system ahead of me and the system behind me are highlighted granted the one that im not supposed to be jumping through next is far more than 15 kilometers away from me so thats not too badanother example and potentially more confusing is if one needs to make an intermediate stop suppose one needed to go from dodixie to amarr but needed to make a stopover in jita to buy something all following the prefer safer route so starting in dodixie set destination for jita is done first followed by add waypoint for amarr upon jumping into the sirppala system both stargateurlen and stargateinaro are highlighted from the overview its not obvious that the urlen system next a different part of the interface is needed to figure that out
try filing a petition this is stupid
its been like that for as long as ive played but shouldt really be an issue if you have your route up
absoinglutely
i strongly disagree with this both for the reasons its asked for and for lore reasons people have been scuttlingselfdestructing choose to properly fit timeline ships for ages to keep people from being able to useloot them theyre included because sometimes you just want to blow up your ship show me an example of any written or film work in which the character said damni sure wish we could make this ridiculously powerful reactor explode by overheating itlooping the powerflowetcoh well guess well just eject and let the pirates have it nothey flip the bird to the attackers blow the thing up and get captured or get the heck out of thereplayers all over eve destroy helpless victims simply out of spite or for killmail no reason on several levels both in and out of character helpless victims shouldnt be able to kill themselves to spite the attackers or take away the kill mail
p4rky with your permission id like to reformulate this into a proosal and bring it up in the next csm meeting
i beat you to it the other day 
not supported unless any changes to the self destruct mechanism include some sort of provision for the losing side to practice resource denial
dammit i need to  forums more
as drake says you cn do this now  its just a lot more cumbersome all this suggestion does is streamline the process
i can imagine the ui being a bit confusing though which character is this skill queued fori would settle for1 make it possible to pause skill training of a character other than the logged on one2 if skill queue runs out and other characters on the same account have skills in queue switch to training one of the others random selection is fine
i agree with this idea i do not think that ccp should try to squeeze this option in the current ui but overhaul it to represent something with a lot more oversight
yup i might actually train up an alt if this is implemented
it makes all the sence in the world
yep so we just have to log on the alt when we need it
einmal bump ja
cool story braugh i agree
all for it but if you get this fixed before the more serious problems on the agenda i will lose what little faith i still have left in the intelligence of ccps game designers
i know and it will be considered a minor issue so be glad not much time will be wasted on it as it is now t2 sentries require no specialisation skill this is true for logistics drones but they are not combat drones and have no racial variation in stats and this could be considered an inconsistency in the drone lineupbesides every serious drone user will have the racial specs to 4 already and if not its only a 3day train from 0
i definitly the skills should buff the drones but i dont think it should be accompanied by a base damage nerf either apply the 2 to damage asis or and id actually prefer this add 2 to tracking
i wouldnt want to suggest something that people could cry omg overpowered at so i did the numbers to keep the dps equal if ccp would like it they can take it wherever though
one of the major cons of sentry drones is they are stationary to offset this they should do more damage than heaviesi am for adding the skill requirement to be race specific at level 5 but they should get the bonus of the damage from that skilli also think the drone rigs should be reworked the only rigmodule in game that directly increases drone damage uses 200 calibration and applies only to sentry drones i feel this calibration is too high 150 seems balancedbesides a navy domi only gets 350 calibration so that ship cant even fit two of those rigsin the end as a drone user for many years i feel the proposed change is not a good onenot supported
supported i like the tracking variant would be a nice differentiation 10 tracking will be a nice little bonus but hardly a game breakerto prevent the inevitable tears you could have it such that t2 sentries only need spec level 1 or 2 to actually be used
if im reading you right you would like it if they were given an edge because of the skill option 3 
i disagree with you as i think the op has got a point i feel however that this change to drones is not the most dire thing that drones needracial drone spec at lvl 4 isnt a hard thing to achieve most people will have the racial dronespecs at 4 so there is no difference in the damage output racial drone specs at 5 will grant the sentries a little extra damage but that is a small percentage for dedicated players which crosses over to heavy drones as well so its not enlarging the relative gap in damage between the drone typesthe advantage of sentries over heavies is that they can do instant damage from long distances heavy drones have the advantage of mobility but i disagree that sentries should get more of a damage bonus because they cant movefurthermore i think about every damage incresing rig ingame has 200 calibration sentry drones do not need a buff in terms of less calibration used 150 would also be too low for calibration as it allows the navy domi to equip 2 rigs increasing damage leaving 50 calibration for another module if and only if navy domis would be supposed to be able to equip 2 sentry dmg rigs the calibration should be modified to 175 i still disagree with this change since you can fit navy domis quite nicely even with 350 calibration and 1 sentry rigin conclusion i agree with op
if you want to get really bizarre you could add option 4 sentry drone spec damagetrackingrange falloff bonusotherwise yes supported
not true you also have the dps tracking and speed variables minmatar drones are fastest gallente do the most dps so you end up with minmatar having the best light drones and gallente having the best heavy drones in almost all circumstancesnooooooonooooooone of the major cons to heavy drones is they dont sit right beside you and snipe things you cant easily switch them out when someonething starts shooting it unlike a sentry to prevent it from dying sentry drones are basically invincible because of this this is why they do less damage than a heavydrones need a lot of work in general almost any suggested change is likely to be an improvement at this point so ill support this
im for t2 sentries requiring the drone spec skills to lvl 4 thus increasing its damage and for reducing the calibration of the sentry damage rigs
not supported as a t2 sentry drone user
not supported in this form
supported rather see the tracking bonus over base damage reduction
it is broken they are too easy to get
fleet command ships are a great concept and they have a lot of potential however as it is now that potential is really only realized at nearblob levels and in the case of information warfare links hardly realized at all because of their dilluted effectsi believe it is high time gangs of under 20 would favor the benefits of a fleet command ship over another ship type more frequently additionally the information warfare links are absurdly underpowered and uninspired they need a role and they need a buffmy proposed solutions1 in lieu of 2 base bonuses with the odd 3 sprinkled in raise the base of all warfare links to 32 make the following changes to info links to give them relevance and a nichesensor integrity apply bonus to scan resolution and targeting range in addition to sensor strengthroll the range bonus of recon operation into the electronic superiority linkchange the bonus of recon operation to apply to scan probe strengthhopefully this will be a step in the right direction and promote the relevance of fleet command ships in smallmedium sized engagements it will also increase the competativness of info links as well as give the eos a niche role in combat probing and worm hole work
its true the eos is incredibly bad and that has nothing to do with not being able to launch 5 heavies
i miss my claymore it now sits unused unwanted unflown why nerfbat strikes skirmish warfare perfectly wrecking any speed boost whatsoever
sounds like a plan
while i would like for the eos to have more functionality and i agree in principal with the ideea i have to disagree with you on the use of fc ships in small fleets  under 20 breakdown  assume maxed skills for gang linksclaymore with skirmish mindlink  15 to agility  3881 to range of scramsdisruptorswebbs 2587 to mwd speed bonus 2587 to signature radiousvulture with siege warfare mindlink  15 to shield hp  2587 to shield resists stacking penalized with invuls 2587 to cap usage by shield transfers  including capital ones 2587 to cycle time of shield transfers  including capital onesdamnation with armored warfare mindlink  15 to armor hp  2587 to armor resists stacking penalized with eanms and anps 2587 to cap usage by remote armor repps  including capital ones 2587 to cycle time of remote armor repps  including capital oneschanging from 2 to 3 means all of the 2587 values will be replaced by 3881 values i dont think making rr even more powerfull than it already is is a smart thing  very nice attempt at a stealth boost if this is what you meant not to mention the increase in velocity that comes with this  this in an eve where missiles already have enough problemspersonally i wouldnt mind if the resist mindlinks would be switched to 3 because they are stacking penalized and you end up with much lower in the end but all of the rest no freaking way also most serious fc users will not go with 3 gang links but with 4 most fc ships can with relative ease fit the 4th  at most 1 mid and 1 low sacrificed

agreedi live in an area between large russian alliances as they seem to be the main culprits i see this on a daily basis when they do it right they become invulnerable and you cant lock them they then simply log in and out a few times and fall in a safe spot off the gate becomes very frustrating when you follow a target more than 3 jumps and he keeps the same  up
this idea is to really make 00 profitable compared to empire for the average alliance grunt even with the new dominion changes i still see lots of complaining about how 00 doesnt compare to empire many compare it directly to lvl4 missions my solution is to give 00 lvl 4s in a specific way using the new hubs structuresyou would do this by adding either a modual or structure that can be added to the hub to give out missions for each mission modual added you would get an agent that would give the next lvl of missions 123 ecthow ever for each addition mission modual attached the reacurring cost for the hub would go upsay for the first 5 million the second 10 million the third 50 million this is just an example the cost could be played around with all agents would have 20 qualitynow unlike normal missions these would be directly related to the alliance that built them and as such directly realated to the standings my thinking is that to do a lvl 1 missions using the alliance agents you would need a least 6 standings with them so as followslvl 1 60lvl 2 70lvl 3 80lvl 4 90 lvl 5 1000now this would allow all people within the alliance access to these agents as well as people the alliance would allow to use them through standing settings lastly unlike normal agents no matter how many missions you run you can not increase your standings standings can only be changed by the alliance
the cold may stop the server from overheating h00r4y
that would amuse me a lot
should be a great thing to have a column with the wreck or corp or alliance name front of the loot we take in loot history

we are not discussing fitting here if you want you can remove modules fitted from the killmail altogether i dont care its not relevant to the topic
as kill mails stand today it is relevant to the topic since the two are part and parcel of the same system
so you dont want a centralized killboard because it will make getting intell on what you fly easier then going to battleclinic and looking at your deaths because it will be on eve website in my personal opinion it will not make much of a difference and is a poor reason for playerbase to suffer so much discomfort if the guy getting intell will have to clinic two more buttons it isnt gonna change much in my opinion

currently the setup with every productive module having its own storage and limited to using only its own storage for production needs to be reexaminedthe tower should be the primary storage area for all pos production structure and corp hangars should only expand that storage harvesting arrays have silos and would not need the towers storagemake pos function just like stations with all productive arrays listed the same way as the station interface arrays with differing values would filter that way showing the production array the bonuses and all available assembly lines generated by having such arrays anchored to the toweroffline modules should be removed from all pos facility listings regardless nothing is more annoying than doing remote production when you have 4 of 5 arrays online only to receive the array offline message or have their production lines grayed out on the selection interface
the dead horse will rise again

i loved this stuff when i first read about it years ago still love it pos are horrible now that theyre no longer tied to sov maybe we can get something more interesting in place
remove floating sticks
i dont care if you make them look like sticks of candy floss but just please make the interface usable running booster production is nothing short of evil at the moment with the large number of mods required to interact together main issues would be the nasty mod linking system and not being able to queue onlininganchoring yeah its great fun sitting at a pos for 34 hours just to set up some mods 
you mean like a csm delegate
agreed just do something
you think 3 or 4 hrs for a reactoins pos is bad try a death star wont see as many as we used to but 8 to 12 hrs over that sucks
isnt that what weekends are for
it should burn fuel to do it or forget all that and allow nanite repair paste to fix drones why they repair modules and ships but not drones is beyond me even if it was only allowed on carriers it would be a step in the right direction
destroyers might as well not exist other than for their ability to tug 4 tractor beams and 4 salvagers along to the person beginning mission running in pvp i see very few t1 hulls being used to sc the likes of me off the bigger ships or scraping oiks off of me when flying something bigger i fully support some panel beating of the destroyer class of hulls
bump cause i know lots of ppl want this 
actually i was talking with another eve player and thought well this would be an excellent role for titans supermassive carriers capable of carrying say a few 35 capital ships like dreadscarriers in dedicated capital ship hangarstheyd have to tweak the load system to let you keep those precious chargesfueldrones in the capital but it actually gives the titan a role other than just another superpeen

i support this it will be useful for far more than just wormhole space for instance setting up bookmarks for jump bridges and stealth bombers i would suggest also having an alliance bookmark position that would allow an alliance member to share the bookmark across the entire alliance useful for jump bridges and such and also a fleet role that allows the same this would mean that only one person would have to set a bookmark for salvaging after the completion of a complex or mission also id suggest having an option to turn off automatically getting these since some people may not want them
i support this
absolutely  pls fix bms local cache so its faster corp and alliance sharing align to create bookmark shortcut full fledged viewsort window sort by date delete old  store folders on server
any additional security that can get in the way of crackers is a good thing i support this id also support a wowesque optional keyfob system
im fine with this as long as im understanding what is being proposed correctly basically that you can set an option to lock the transfer of your character if you do want to transfer your character then you will have to take this option off and then wait for a one week timer to transfer the characterthe only possible issue i see with this is what if someone hacks your account and instead of stealing stuff just goes in and unchecks this option then in a week they can come back and transfer the character and steal everything i highly doubt that anyone is going to check this option every week or change their password once a week so i would propose that when this option is removed that it shows the timer on the ui until the one week timer is up this way a player can tell if their account was hacked and the only indication was the removal of this option
hey hey awesome idea and would be a perfect oficial games scam proof at least more legitimate and the ui actually looks sexy and functional great for corps and great for alliance use a
my thumpits upatleast have ccp explain why domis fit med guns with succes when u would be told stoopid if u did that on any other ing bs
holy  stop whining every race sucks at something just swallow it and learn to play to your advantages if blasters cant melt face from beyond 5k then htfu and dont warp in at 30kcrossposted from heredomi underpowered ahahahahahahalolwut do you even know why people shield tank their ships
huge support for this
this what the hell is wrong with the gallente players here paper thin the ehp is relatively the same your weapons dont take the cap of a mwd to use like lasers they also track harder and can fire 40km with null so quit crying
i gave up flying blaster ships i trained amarr gogo gallente bs v i cant fly gallente as a piratei have to mwd all over the damn place to hit anythingmost of my dps will get killed by gate guns loldroneshyperion while an interesting ship is useless as active tanking sucks anyway its all about plates reallytrained amarr and i dont regret it
nothing to add that i havent said a million times supported
just thought id point out that the only ship that can approach 40km with blasters is the rokh with null which will deal 680 dps at 35km or so with 3 damage mods meanwhile the comparative tier 3 abbadon hits out to 55km with 730 dps on scorch and a higher volley with 3 damage modsits true that hybrids use less cap but they also use ammo and dont have instant reload for switching rangesin any case ill support but id like to see hybrids in general beefed up a bit rails are in a slump at the moment as well
definitely not supported it is horribly unbalanced so horribly i cant even take it seriouslyblasters have tracking issues some of these issue can be mitigated by smart flying no longer can you just click approach release drones turn on your guns and webifier and sit watching the screen while your target dies i think this is one of the biggest changes affecting many gallente players you need to think a lot moreblasters do have tracking issues at extreme close ranges then again any gun has tracking issues at extreme close range if the 500m sig radius hyperion is within 500m of its also 500m sig radius target transversal shouldnt really matter the target is literally as broad as a barn and guns shouldnt have any tracking issuesthe current tohit formula undervalues sig radius at close ranges i dont care how much your transversal is but if you are closer than the sig radius of your target and your sig radius is equal or smaller i believe your shots should hit a lot more
support i just read that massive wall of text that he obviously put quite a bit of effort into and think gallente ships overall need looking at some of the ideas are really good
long overdue
ok and i want explosive and em damage cristals and i want kinetic and thermal damage crystals and i want an eplosive and thermal cristal why not a thermal and kinetic crystal and a 32m lenght frigate that can carry 75m3 of drones hehhahaha where the  are stocked those drones give to the retribution 20m3 bay and bandth now
lol this is a joke post right your having us on you want to take the second best pvp race  after minmatar  and make it even more powerful by what look likes 50 boost across your entire rangeho ho hoif your having problems with tracking then learn to fly your shipsill give you a clue  click approach  web  fire is not what you should be doingthe tracking boosts you request are unwaranted  blaster allready have the best tracking in game or at least equal to autos iircyou complained somewhere about pulses having better tracking at there optimal it may be true  but the point is when your at your optimal you have the better trackingmuch better than pulse at your optimal why on earth do you need 50 more unless you want the game to do everything for youranged rails are not a gall spec they are a cal specyou want best short range boats boosted and you want ranged option erm noif you want ranged rails then fly caldari rail boatspersonally i wouldnt bother there all crapa set of ships incursus  mega that get a 100 boost to afterburner speedloooooolso every other race has to fit mwd with cap hit  sig hit and large cap usage while gal get to zoom about with ultra effective absif you cant see how that would be massivelly overpowered theres really no hope for your game balancing asperationsdrones are age when properly trained not only againt there class size  but also against smaller targets  blaster may require the application of some tactics but hit hard when used properlysome of the best ships in game are gallenteoff the top of my headincursus  vexor  thorax  domi  mega  taranis  ishkur  ishtar  myrm moros  thannygallente have plenty of pvp options for gang  fleet and solo they do not require any kind of boost
no and youre saying amarr is worse than gallente are you daftcaldari are also great gang ships i wouldnt consider them to be worse than gallente atmok so i try to adjust my distance by manually flying away from my target and not just webbing oh  went to far since my optimal is less than 2 km oh  i cant fly back in cause the lag on manual flying is so ing bad that you cant possibly manually fly and keep your ship within 2km but not under 18 km where your guns wont track  its really not as easy as you think especially with how horrible manual flying is i find myself quintuple clicking in space instead of double clicking cause most times the lag doesnt pick up just 2 clicksautos also have the option of fighting in falloff which is significantly larger than blasters and blasters must fight up close we may have the best paper tracking but it just doesnt seem to work when youre 1 km away from your targettbh right now the game does everything for pulse its also really hard to get into that range before youre dead from pulses as mwd no longer work in scram range kinda killing the effectiveness of alot of blaster ships
you just failed massively  understanding tracking mechanics ill give you a quick crash coursewhen things are closer its easier for them to increase transversal which means that in blaster optimal range a very high transversal is exremely easy to achieve even with caldari bsyou see eveo hit and miss mechanics dont understand the fact that things are effectively bigger when theyre close this is what makes blasters useless in todays worldsecondly you cant always warp in close sometimes youre actually forced to close in when youre only doing 100 more dps than a ship that has double your range and that other ship can change ammo for range in the blink of an eye and you cant then you are at a massive disadvantageblasters need more damage to make up for it either that or blaster ships need more speed or you could increase the range of blasters but that would be a bit lame as it would remove the whole close rangeface melting damage flavor of blasters
this tbh
one detail i think the op missedheliosall covops have 3 high slots the helios has 2its a simple ship doing cloak probe cynoso unless there is a small cyno drone im not aware of the helios is at a big disadvantage compared to other covopson the topic i agree the last few patches were all just a little more nerfing galenteof the top of my head for dominiontracking computers now have stacking penalty what race has too much medium slots so they can afford to fit 2 of those

titans can bridge people from a to b using the jump portal generator mod in order for fleet members to be able to jump through after the titan has opened a bridge to a cynogenerator they must be within 2500m of the titan moving and staying within range without bumping the titan all over the place with a gang is a major pain in the arsetherefore i want to propose that ccp increases this bridge range to 5000 or 10000m so that less titan pilots will get kidney stones from being bumped around all the bloody timeevelopedia link sok
yes plz
make sense to methat or turn off the collision detection on the titan during jump portal operation
oh god yes
tell your fleet instead of approach to go to keep at range to about 1500mproblem solved
i havent seen a single titan bridge without atleast 23 bumps be it people mwding towards the titan or using approach instead of keep at range increasing the range should give those idiots a bit more time to stop
i completely agree with this this would remove a lot of headaches of having to wait for 200 people to get close to the titan again because one  couldnt stop from bumping the titan
i agree this would be nice however i suspect its limited by the same code used for stargates and pos jump bridges and as such may be hard to modify one without affecting the othersin any case if its at all possible itd be worth a tweak
because improving comfortable gameplay is nessesary sometimes
how about allowing us to use these slaves as a method to gain faction standing a very very small ammount when they are freed or conversely enslavedadmittedly i have collected very few slaves since the mission rewards changes from useless goods to plain old boring isk so this looks like a decent method of exchanging goods to repair bad standings over timefreeing or enslaving would remove the items so they could not be simply sold back and forth to farm standingsanother exchangable item would be needed for the gallente ofc no such good is needed for the caldari theyre insanely easy to farm already with so very very many agents

fix it1 supporter
the biggest issue of fw is that the most central mechanism is most effectively done by an alt while you do something else with another accountthat can not be the desired way of how fw works
supported
supported
to my mind the issues in fw all derive from one thing about its design it has always been easy to tell what is working as intended in eve and what is a bugexploit because what is allowed is always stuff that obeys ingame logic as being possible and what is not causes that reality to breakfor instance pos bowling was an exploit because there was no reason ramming into the shield would convey momentum to the objects on the other side of it corp theft is not an exploit because there is no ingame reason you wouldnt be able steal stuff you have access tothe fw complexing mechanic has always been exactly that  a visible mechanic not an organic development of ingame reality orbiting a point to conquer a solar system is illogical and all the issues people have with fw spin out from there the ship that orbits best has an advantage the npcs with the best tracking against orbiting ships have an advantage the faction that can orbit without incurring fire has an advantage make us shoot things and were back to a level logical playing field where we know what we can or cant do
i support ccp looking at fw it seems to me fw has to be more than an isk sink there needs to be something that fw pilots can strive for to maintain the ships they fly it seems that right now faction stuff is too costly i think ccp did a good thing by allowing fw pilots to get certain items cheaper i think getting more lp into fw pilots hands is a good idea here are some of my thoughts1 do missions give too much lp well maybe they do in comparison to plexing however the cost of faction ships and mods are out of reach for pvpers so economically speaking something needs to give more lp so i see nothing wrong with letting fw pilots get that isk if for not other reason than to lower the prices 2 i see nothing wrong with giving more lp for plexes also the lp for kills would be good so long as exploits are dealt withkilling your own alt for lpone idea of diminishing returns for kills was already offered also trying to assign a value to the damage done might be good to that would be a bigger undertaking but it would also help them with a different broken mechanic  bounties3 3rd party war decs need to be looked atalicia had some ideas that should be looked at i cant say whether they are good or badi would say i am not so negative toward ccp on fw i mean sure they can do more but the changes they made were good ones and they are heading in the right direction
optimal solution yes but a small fix is better than no fix
can ads  diaflocal spam  diafthis is good
this seems reasonable if the adverts could be cycled every day at dt so the devs didnt have too much work to do for siphoning out the bad stuff it would work there could be limited slots and a backlog to the point where there are 20 slots per station 10 per system 5 per constellation 2 per region and 1 for all of eve each day these numbers are just vague guesses off the top of my headthe cost could be calculated on a number of factors population density number of stations in a given area etc of course with playerowned stations the alliances themselves could set the presentations which would work well with the new dominion expansioni support this measure
i dont support the removal of the timer but i do support lowering the timer usually its a good couple of minutes before i find something else worth posting on and then type up a relevant post anyway a reduction to anywhere between 13 minutes would probably continue to keep out spam posters and stupid comments while also making sure that relevant posts dont run into this issue often
captchas are a major pitajust make it so the delay disappears once you have at least x posts say 100 or so
post log out log back in post no timer can touch you if you follow those simple rules
proof
aaaand one more to prove it wasnt some sort of double post
though this does make me wonder if bypassing the forum timer is ban worthyjust a thought
i think a minute at most would be best to change it if they were going to i dont know of any other forum that has a post limit this high its excessive and if macros are their largest concern you could easily macro the loginlogout and completely bypass their security protocol
if anything the 5 minute wait makes threadnoughts even more insane instead of 23 posts between a q  a you get a page now as was pointed out  it doesnt really stop repeatedly posting
no it keeps stupid posts like yours down i think ccp just made the excuse that it was key loggers when really they wanted to nerf idiotic posts keep the 5min timer doesnt bug me at all
no it does not

i just read the make mining worthy thread up here on front page and i feel this should not fall in the shadows of sillyness like thatthanks all so far for the support
you can put miners on a rokh you cant put guns on a hulk also youre mining with a rokh its got a hold that would make a purse look roomyi dont appreciate the you can mine in a rokh argument the right job requires the right tool to wit theres a type of combat ship for just about any kind of fighting you want to do why should a miner mine in a ship that looks like a souped up christmas tree you dont dig holes with the stock of a gun do youthe mining profession deserves a wellrounded set of tools just as the fighting pilot does which part of the idea of having a specialised zerosec miner is so repulsive to the casual miner that the professional miner must be denied a useful tool while at the same time the soldier clamors for ever more and better weapons delivery vectors all im asking for is a better miner specifically suited for work in zerosec space thats 1 space frame it doesnt even have to be faction specificwhy do i have to be content with mining in a battleship while you could be just as content fighting with the drones of an exhumer also you may be content with chiseling away at rocks im there on business a rokh is no substitute for a hulk
missioning is so much more profitable than mining its not even funny try substantially dropping the lp rewards for l4l5 missions or introducing an x amount of missions every hour condition to each agent and you might see the gap narrow to a more reasonable level currently you can train up 3 accounts in a relatively short space of time run l5s and not only afford to pay for plex for all 3 of your accounts but to make a small fortune on top billions
not supporting epic fail miner whine post who knows nothing about mining
imho you shouldnt be asking for restrictions on who can mine but instead asking for more in game objects to be buildable via mining resourcescase in point the new sov structures tcu sub and upgrade hubsif they were buildable using a good portion of hiend minerals that additional demand should put a bit more profitability back into mininghowever with the new sov mechanics i am hoping the demand for new outpost stations to once worthless systems might see that demand increase as well

i use the autopilot as a route planner and follow the yellow gate roadwhen you trade across multipe systems are buying pos fuel bits at 6 different locations or exit a wh to find yourself 40 jumps from home the auto pilot route planner is invaluableits not just for afk apthe only change i am looking for is to keep the last destination in the list of way points the last one when you hit optimisethere is no other change to the way the route planner works or to how ap works if you want to do it that wayand yes  ap to 12km is imho a good thing  it keeps you awake
a squelch optionits sort of block lite essentially its so you can silence those idiot scammers wo choking your contact list they call it buddies but its typical use is glutted with blocksrclick a person and you get the option to block report or squelch themwhen you squelch a person they are silenced to you so long as you remain in the same system and logged in it does not clog your contact list and is wiped whenever you leave the system or log off and last 24 hours at any rate so you can come and go in a given system wo needing to resquelch everybodyfor permanent squelch you just use the block list but that is problematic because when scammers are recycled or banned their name remains in your contact list

they are uselessthey are outclassed by other drones by speed hp damage range tracking just about everything because they are so useless at the moment i propose we make the special ability of the amarr light drones their size they should take 45 of the bandwidthbay to use in return for their obsolete performance in comparison to other dronesacolyte ii  4mbs 4m3infiltrator ii  8mbs 8m3praetor ii  20mbs 20m3using this method amarr drones would be a very nice substitute for ships that dont have the drone bay for both heavy and light drones for example the armageddon with its large weakness to frigates if it has 5 heavy drones i am confident that more people will begin using amarr drones especially on amarr ships if this change is implementedat the moment 4 ogre iis deal alot more damage than 5 praetor iis253 from the 4 ogre iis and 228 from 5 praetor iis eft damage
shameless self support
while i agree with you that amarr drones are in desperate need of fixing noone ever uses amarr drones ever i cant support your topic because i simply dont think you have the right solution while i do think some more sets of drones with differing sizes and bandwidth costs would be a good idea i dont think these should be the amarr ones i think amarr drones just need their stats tinkered to balance them against the others im not sure exactly which ones i hate number crunching but the solution cant be that hard
why amarr strenght has never been drones
i agree that amarr drones are pretty much the runt of the litter and should be looked at as part of a general review of drones as a wholehowever i cannot support your proposed change as the solution
the other proposal for making amarr drones the one with most tank was much better than this not supported
should the cyclonemaelstrom have a horrible shield tank then i mean the minmatar race doesnt shield tank so who cares if those ships are broken or uselessthats silly i wouldnt make the maelstrom quicker to make its shields bettergreat petition horrible fix proposition

i like the ideamaybe you can have a button on the log in screen to queue the next 24 hours of training across your three altson the ingame queue you get a little message delayed  fred toon training completes in 3h 5m 17s then if you come across a skill book and you want to train it immediately then you could have a button and within the game a train me now button which switches the training to the current toon and bumps the other toon

you really have no idea what youre talking about the more you post the more evident it becomes

leave my drones alone and fix range on scorch insteadbesides i had to live with my drones not attacking structures for god knows how ing longso i think they should actually be easier to get plus shoot way harderoh yeahUFFFD also i think we should be able to use 10 drones with half dmg coz drones die too easy even with bonus
no nerfing the sentry drones leave them alone
im all for this change but not to reduce the dps of these things theyre immobile and in a fight the ship launching them is generally very mobile even a slight change in position makes recovering them a choresomeone said they can be easily scooped when shot at and that is true but it has no impact on their survivability because they dont recover while in the drone bay and can essentially be instalocked when redeployed due to their large sig
uhm drone spec takes 3 days 23 hours to get from 34do you even play eve not everyone remapped memory and perceptionalso sentries have superior range and thus have inferior damage thats how it works see torpedoes cant be cruise missiles and radio cant be multifrequency
we not need  sp sink again for no damage changesbuff the forgotten drones dont nerfnot supported
duno what thread you have been reading but i am looking to make the t2 lineup more consistent and at the same time keep them equal or give them a small buff because of the skill bonuses i do not want to nerf sentries that is utter bsthat is between 3 and 4 days isnt it and really what are 4 days or even a month in the grand scheme of things when it doesnt harm you in any way but could get you some nice bonuses
it is a nerf if you have to train additional skills to make them work the way they currently do  even if they might potentially be better if you take all the spec skills to v thats a nerfim not seeing the need for this change the only real reason thats been put forwards is that it puts t2 sentry drones into the same boxes as other t2 combat drones that doesnt strike me as a compelling reason to do itif there was a proper rebalancing of all drones where their roles and the ways that they are currently used were reevaluated across the board then id support that but this just seems like a change for the sake of changing something
thats why i left  3 open to decide for ccp  i did not want to suggest a plain dps increase because they might feel that to be overpowered
pos guns have superior range to your ships guns guess what they do more damage because they are stationary they also have lower tracking and they cannot close in distance with their target get back to the owner have larger sig radius and cannot speedtank do i need to continue the listrl perspective since they have no engines their is more space for gunscreating a skill that adds 10 more damage is not a nerf 3 more days in training is not much for any serious drone pilot sentries take months to train for and you will want to fly a specializes ship like an ishtar to use them properly 3 days is nothing in comparison to it especially since you need them for t2 heavy drones anyway
not supported as irrelevant in my opinion and sollution 2 is a major nerf for anyone who is not a gallente pilotmake them appear closer to my ishtar insteaddominion screwed that up
pos guns are superpowered because of the cost associated with them not because they are stationary in a fight also they are beyond stationary you cant just bring them to a fight like you can a sentry droneyour argument is equivalent to saying a dreadnought does more damage than a cruiser because it is slower if you want another skill that gives a bonus to sentries it should be for optimal range they are after all the snipers of the drone world sniper weaponsships have range bonuses boost base damage have damage modified by spec skills and switch the sentry skill to boost range they would fit their concept better if a sniper could drop them at 100150km out and use them

as i mentioned balance at large scales could be troublesome 25 but ignore stacking might be a better alternative howeverrr is a force multiplication tactic small gangs can use against several types of bigger gangs at large scales sub capital ship rr becomes impractical due to alpha strikes in fleet fighting while capital to capital rr doesnt suffer from this perse the new changes to titans can override any amount of rr simply by vaporizing any carrier it looks at so perhaps it is a nonissuehappy to talk to ccp about where the balance should be struck
on the topic of ganglink stuff  id like to see ganglink modules be more effective without the need for mindlink implantsgiven that it takes 24 hours to jump clone into a clone with mindlinks and back out again if you want a standard clone  the improptue use of ganklink modules is a bit of a no nonot sure how all the maths works atm  but maybe an extra 5 for the implants rather than the way it works atm where mindlinks seem to be compulsary for effective use of ganglinks

since the changes to speed and propulsion one thing has become resoundingly clear  mid range combat becomes very valuable once more pulse lasers and scorch are proving remarkably valuable in combat  as it should given its always been the mid range gunthe problem is hybrids and projectiles suffer something of a lack in that department the reason for this is because guns get harder to fit and longer range and higher dps and higher volley damage this tends to leave weapons like dual 150 and 250mm railguns somewhat in the cold id like to propose the addition of two new artillery cannons and that the bottom tier railguns get adjusted such that they each come somewhere between the longest ranges of short and long range guns  in terms of dps tracking range and fitting youd end up with a medium range gun that would be a viable alternative to either short or long range options rather than  well hardly anyone seems to fit dual 150s or dual 250s do they
not sure you would destroy diversity for the game
after waiting the grid to load for 15 minutes in el8 today got me quite fed up with this lag could we at least have a mechanism that keeps you invulnerable until you have loaded the grid had some bad lag experiences before dominion hit but even then jumping into a node with 1000 people in local fighting didnt take this longsomething should be done about this situation as fighting in current blobheavy 00 is quite impossible and fights are mostly decided by the lag gods this probably leads to 00 stagnating to gatecamps because no one dares to jump his fleet to the hostiles and get it killed while everyone is waiting to load the grid
we all know eve has a steep learning curve and ccp has tried to ease people in with new tutorials etc but as i and a couple of my friends started playing eve some weeks ago i think that user interface is one of the most glaring issues of eve now that i have learned basics and starting to be more accustomed with eve interface is still my biggest complaintlooking at screenshots from earlier versions of the game interface looks alot like todays interface considering all the graphical etc revamps its odd that interface certainly more important part of any game than graphics hasnt got revampthere is way too much clicking right click menus lists deep menus etc everything from ship control panel and target action window to chat interface and inventory management could use a ton of functionality improvements and streamliningneo com is ok minimized im certain that all current functionality of interface could be done much better if whole thing would be done from scratchin short i think that revamping games interface would greatly benefit new player experience and also old playerstho say if you dont agreemy issues with interface menus are too deep and hard to find too many right click functions and menus combat interface is like playing some desktop application alot of clicking on overview and target action window right clicks for distance chances etc doesnt feel very active or involved drone management is pain collapsaple menus and right clicking chat stuff could be just copied from wow or any other mmoeve security features stuff like easy private messages and messages from many channels on one window etc tactical view maybe you guys have found it useful but i havent atleast yet took me while to notice how to know if im being jammed i guess its fine now that i noticed that bar but these kind of things could be easier to notice comparing items is hard it takes a while to compare for example what turret would be best for my ship icons and colors on overview i have no idea what some of that stuff actually means would be nice if that stuff was more evident without googlingim sure there is alot more complaits and improvements to be made but those are some off the top of my headi like that eve is a deep game but i just think that all of current functionality could be done better be kind to a newb peace 
i think that in some cases u just pointed out things they need to add to tutorials the rest u just have to get used totry using ctrlclciking to lock targets and using the f1f18 for ur guns if u dont alreadylots of annoyances or clicks can be eliminated buy just using the hot keysput some effort in to using them the tactical over lay btw is great when u want to get the big picture and see where everything isalso while its up can mouse a module and a bubble will pop up showing tis range so u can get a better idea of how far it reachesalso works with missiles especially if u dont want to calculate flight time and missile velocityoh and can u elaborate on the comparing is hard i just select the attributes i wanna compare and see whats best afterworlds i can compare that module with prices and easily find the next lower meta lvl to get something cheaper btw b4 apocrypha we didnt have a compare tool so be grateful u didnt have to do byhand comparison via data bases or by showing info on all the modules
thanks for all the tips i didnt even know that there is item comparison tool p i guess that either proves that im a dummie or interface fails since i didint notice it panyway what im suggesting is kinda like website redesing keep all the content and functionality but make it more user friendly more logical to use and give it a facelift for sexyness

this mechanic is absolute crock at the moment as it makes freighters running through low security nearly invincible which by no means should ever occur however i believe that there must be one small addition to your change a message from the client should be sent when the grid is loaded correctly after jumping into a system and only if this message is received from the client should the ship stay in space for some amount of time this means that if someone legitimately crashes when going through systems their ship will disappear in a short amount of time however no more people ctrlqing when they see the camp and thinking oh shiunder current mechanics a freighter running through low sec can only be destroyed on a gate if they quit after jumping by 17 pure gank bs at slightly over 1k dps or 4 dreads in siege mode however half the time you cant even lock the ships once the player logs out and they become virtually invincible secondly the ships still disappear when getting disrupted and even under a bubble or focused warp disruption this means that during the full duration of apocryphas release a freighter pilot pressing two buttons was more useful than a tech iii ships interdiction nullifier subsystem powered by super advanced ancient sleeper technology third if a person logs out multiple times after quitting on the gate they are able to get further away from the gate every time they log out this means they dont even have to appear on the gate after logging back inalso i have heard about this but not tested it supposedly if you log onto an alt character from the same account your ship will disappear immediately even with an aggression timer i have yet to confirm this howeveraccording to ccp last time i checked this is not an exploit however i fail to understand how freighters roaming through low security space freely without escort or worry of destruction is considered normal game mechanics infact every time i see that advertisement of eve with the minnie freighter getting blasted the only thing i can think of is that pilot didnt know how to ctrlqas obviously stated i am in full support of ctrlq not providing freighters immunity from gatecamps in both low and null security space

it was dubbed loggofskis for a reason though to be fair its not just the russians using them these daysits an exploit how about keeping the logged off ship in space for at least 1 minute after everytime you log off regardless and introducing the former aggression mechanics like the op mentions then it becomes much less of an issue if you have good probers
really the easy fix is ditching this whole superwarp after disconnect primarily legit disconnects occur while jumping a gate into a lagtacular event dont put the ship into a system until their client loads the system  keep it in limbo between systems this wayif it is caused by lag they will eventually show up and start their cloak timer once they are actually in control of their shipif it is an actual disconnect during a jump they will get their cloak timer once they log back inthe only other time ive had or seen disconnects is when im sitting in space or a station without moving for a while such as while waiting for orders from an fc  such as when springing a trap in this case a normal warp off and sit for 15 minutes with aggro wouldnt bug me any conceivably someone might be in a battle and lose connection from a storm or isp outage i would think the likelihood is very low so the number of cases where this happens would be small thats what petitions are for not some gamechanging solution
only if said missions spawn a visible beacon in space the way fw missions doclass limit the zone access gates the same way as well lvl 1 up to dessy ect ect
make drones sound like sleigh bells please
i remember when they buffed the caldari to have like 20 more mission agents almost all of them being in high security space we all know what motsus like and there are what 3 l4 agents there of decent quality 18 creating this whole empire mission runners make tons more isk than 00 hard workers and all of the move level 4s to lowsec threads yes we know we knowthe thing is looking at all of the agent spreads only the caldari seem to have a preponderance of lvl4 high quality combat mission agents in high security space amarr have like 4 or so minmatar and gallente somewhere around 7ish and not all of them are high qualityi was bored and just looking at mission corp infos and stumbled across the fact that while caldari have their clustered agents in places like motsu the amarrs cluster is in an 01 a single jump from 00 hophib and that system is pretty much deadmotsu 200 in local with another 1000 spread out across neighboring systemshophib 15 agents 14 4 l4 q20 agents in one station and 1 more in another station for a total of 5 l4 q20 amarr agents in one system which is essentially half of their entire l4 agents and there are like 11 in localjust gotta love how ccp mixes up the factions and makes me understand better how come caldari are farmed and other factions are laughed atno i dont have any suggestions on fixing this because id get bbqd from both sides of the fense
lol talk about ego the take credit party is a joke

is it really fair for caldari to get bonused to four damage types when other races mainly get twosaying the eris gets screwy weapons system doesnt make the fact that it only gets thermal bonus to go away true its only one ship but i hear caldari often have ships that get bonused to all types of missiles not to just kinetic so you already get a better deal than all the other races
destroyers need some serious lovin the most underused ship class in the game and with good reasontbh i dont think ive ever seen a destroyer out in nullsec well besides salvage ships
destroyers needs some love atleast less signature so they can do their role in fleet
i used to adore destroyers until i got my first afmainly because im fairly well specced in amarr and the coercer cant point its target and dictate range at the same time due to lack of midslotsretribution is much more fun to fly
most definitely support this ideawe need more people able to put together clear concise well written ideas such as this maybe then well have a bit more of our ideas implemented ie fix my  fill in btch of the month or i iz quit as a corp prober and bookmarkmaker well soon enough anyway i can see this being a tremendous help not only to pvp corps but also babieerri mean pve industrial and marketmanipulplaying corps

would be a nice addition to the game
if ccp only used the already approved alliance logos and added them to the client data them you would load them locally instead of from the server add in texture sharing between ships and the overall load on the client would be minimal at worst also if it was restricted to only alliance logos for alliances of a certain sizeie no custom logos for one man alliances then getting new ones approved should be a bit easier for ccp to handle plus to completely remove any chance of performance loss there can be a graphics option to turn off the logos much like the effects and other itemssigned as do we all but there are far far far too many of them to include in the client data so you would have to load them from the server which aint gonna happen ever
fix thisplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesso the majority of alliances wouldnt be sporting the we borked eve art then alliance nose art would be a fantastic idea
yes please
a good one
totally agree
nice ideai think control which selects display or not display should be in the graphics options of the client though  not in executor control
for me the main thing is aa on the fontwithout aa the eve font is not only unreadable but painful to focus onthus i run aa settings that leave white lines on the edge of all iconsbuttons but the fonts appear smooth and halfway readablei cant begin to imagine how many people try eve blink a few times try to read the chat and then quit because of the lack of aa
oh noes you forgot the support button o
i have a decent ati card but if i enable aa with the ati control pannel hdri gets screwed on gates and on asteroidsso some sort of fix would be great
i support thishowever i do not think the current graphics engine of trinity ii can be implemented to accommodate the inherent problem which ccp face in regard to directx 9 and deferred shading resulting in a lack of aa there are many games which have this problem hence the need for thirdparty applicationsi would propose whole heartedly that development for trinity iii is based on directx versions that do not have this problem when using a method of shading that results in the eve client not being able to natively support aaccp must also consider that the eve client must work across all of the supported formats mac linux and windows to the same or comparable representation of the eve universe this is a big issuefor now i believe that aa will remain unsupported despite the obvious visual deficiencies that it carries as i believe the time it would take to resolve the problem would make it financially nonviable however as stated i support any discussions on this topic going forwardalleykat
you see  you dont understand your own shipsflying away will not lower you tracking as much as flying parallelso why are you trying to fly away in a blaster  ultra close range  boathere starteth the blaster pvp leason1 use orbit 1km or 500m depending upon ship class2 web and scram opponent3 make sure you have velocity and transversal on your overview4 note opponents velocity when scrammed and webbed5 set your own velocity to be just a little more than your opponents6 if you cant do this then your ship setup is fail7 assuming you can go faster than your opponent then notch up the speed a bit at a time till your nearing your guns max tranversalif all the above is too much for you then use keep at range as this is a close approximation7 for ultimate tracking nullification  bs and cruiser combat   too difficult for frigs imo   look at your opponent  swing the camera around to face the direction he is flying  double click in that direction  select your speed to match his of course this is for solo or small gang work for fleets target calling by the fc is more important as anyone primaried by a pack of blaster boats is gonna go down so fast you wont have a chance to worry about any of the aboveyou need to get to your optimal and optimal tracking speeds  your opponent will try to get to hisuse above methods or invent your owndont ask for 100 afterburners bonues or 50 tracking bonuses so that the game does it all for you if your beings scrammed then your also in scram range if your ships not fast enough try putting less plates and more resists on it next time or fit an ab instead of an mwd and only agress targets that you have scrammed  if you cant get close enough jump your ship out100 ab bonus would make the mega so awesome  all other bs would be obsoletehow can you seriosley even contemplate such a thingab fitted mega has no fitting issues  all other mwdd ships would have fitting issuesmega would never have cap issues  all other bs would have cap issuesmega would always be able to dictate range and tracking  in short mega would allways winand then you want 50 better tracking as well  sighplayers would have no choice but to train up gal bs and blasters
yahrr supports gallente and learned to fly amarrcaldari and now even minmatar because of the reasons named in this topic theres another thing that is not just about gallente but all the drone boats in the game still i think this belongs in this topic since gallente is the mother race to all the drone boatsthe only real benefit dedicated drone boats have is the massive drone bay however in case of drone types like ecmneutdamp the drone damage is exactly equal to all other ships that can field drones while at the same time the normal weapon systems are not as advanced as they are on dedicated turret ships
scrammed and webbed bs generally dont fly faster than 70ms its very easy to null out the tracking if you know what you are doingtracking to your opponent  opponents tracking to youa other gun boat  will have a worse tracking situation than you  lasers  or equally goodbad  other blasters  acs  b missile boats  may manourver to raise tracking and take less damage without affecting there own dps but compensatorilly have no way of increaseing damage on target by lower trackingsig radius is designed for damage reduction due to ship class it has nothing to do with trackingyes you are at a disadvantage from range  laser boats are a disadvatage close upthats the game  getting your ship into a position to poon the opponentblasters are allready the most powerful weapons in game with the best trackinggenerally gallente have second fastest ships in class allreadyegtempest 120mega 105apoc 94raven 94before skills or modsi think you will have a fight on your hands if you want fastest in classmini have the toughest job for mantaining there optimal position as its neither close up or at range but somewhere in the middle
im flying away at first since usually when approaching an enemy its hard to stop approaching your enemy and land in orbit or flying parallel to them perfectly at your optimal range remember flying just 1 km too close means you just effed up your chance at tracking correctlyyes flying like this comes with practice but often you just cannot help it as you cant control the other persons ship so them doing something you arent anticipating can mess up your strategy to get in your optimal and no closeri personally didnt ask for that dont try to push the ops ideas onto me without being sure i support it i happen to not support this part of the opwait fit less buffer so you get ripped apart even faster as you attempt to close range to get into your optimal as the pulse lasers are doing almost as much dps as you could be doing but at a much larger optimal you need the buffer to live long enough to get into range pulses would kill you before you got into range if you fit no bufferif i cant get close enough to scram a target with an afterburner fit what makes you think i can get awaywhoops we covered this
so you understand when a huge ship is right up in your face its really really hard to miss no matter how fast they are going tracking doesnt take into account that when close you effectively have a larger target to shoot at
no he doesntand the idea about mannualy flying to minimize transversal in a 200 meters range it must be a jokethe same with the idea than since blaster cant track so lasers cant he is talking about some virtual 1vs1 engagementsand i agree ab bonus on gallente ships would be bad
some ideas are completly nuts like the afterburner boneswtf do u want people not flying those ships anymore and the taranis is fine u just want to nerf it on that way the only changes that 1 see that needs to be done is all the missile requiements on gallente ships gallente has a primary weapon hybrids or drones so why do i need missile skills on a lachistis serious the deimos could use some more cap or a additional bonus for mwd cap saving do u actualy know what a diemos does upclose it vaporise stuffs faster than u can say fast 3 of those melt a bs in under a minut deimos is fine but the cap or powergrid need to be sorted
for the ignorantthe current tracking formula seems to be based on a point model so whether you are 100kms away or 1m away the guns are trying to hit a tiny aim point however when you are at point blank even though you may miss the aim point you still will have a near certainty of hitting the enemy ship some wheremedium and up blasters should have trouble hitting a fast moving drone or inty but there is pretty much no way they could physically miss anything cruiser sized or larger
totally supported i find it irritating as hell that my friends eagle can out dps my deimos by 100points while tanking three times as much for 5x as long
 yes you did  from your ticked support post or did you not bother reading before offering your support all the way really dude you did support a post that so completelly overpowereds the mega no other bs would be viablei know you wont  but you really need to go think about what the op is saying in his linked post before you withdraw your supportyes dude  i understand that when your close the silohette of the ship takes up a massive proportion of the view from you ship like trying to shoot a freight train from 1 meter awayif game mechanics were realistic then you should get wrecking shots everytime you fireby the same reasoning as missile explode at zero and the size of the target from the missile perspective is huge taking up nearly half the sky your also supporting missiles doing full damage  irrelevant of sig rad eve does not use the apparent size of the target as a parameter in damage calculations  this is the same for all weapon systems  why should blasters be an exception 
lolgo away troll
its not trolling to point out inconsistences in peoples logici am not against apparent target size being a function in damage calculationseve would be more realistic if it were sobut the same damage calculations run for all guns  so if blasters were getting the benefit of large apparent target size  cant miss  all other guns would also get the benefit of large apparent target size  cant miss   even long range weapons would hit for full power at point blankit really doenst leave much room for gameplay  which is probably why its not taken into account
actually i would consider gallente as bottom of the pile right now if i recall correctly the nano nerfs came at about the same time as the blaster tracking nerf megas required both to make frigates afs and ceptors run in fear as i really dont care at all about blasters mostly because i prefer midtolongrange combat im not going to put in the time to dig through the release notes to find exactly when the nerfs hit but they were both around the same timeadd to that the drone tracking and sensor damp nerfs that hit about the same time and you can easily see how gallente went from top dog to bottom dog in the space of a year had to wait until dominion for minmatar to leave the bottom of the pile  because they were way down at the bottomthe hyperion is the gallente version of a raven a nice missioning boat the hyperion raven and maelstrom can be used in pvp but the other two battleship options for each race are better choices for pvp ships the only race with three good pvp battleships is amarr but they get middle dps alpha speed and tank ie none of them have stand out attributes in exchangefrom a balance perspective theres a reason gallente received several consecutive nerfs in rapid succession  gallente were overpowered they do need some back though as they are now sort of underpoweredstop comparing apples and oranges the reason amarr often look so good is because people throw together a mixed fleet and try to have everyone fill the same role this leads to everyone compromising into the middle ground where amarr sitthe complaint about gallente ships is less someone else can pawn me and more the other guys in my gang can shoot and kill things before i get in range this is a real complaint in blobvone however in a blobvblob the blaster boat should be strongas it is when i call targets i usually primary gallente as they almost always glass cannon fit their ships to do silly damage at midrange they also more often than not have a horrible habit of burning directly at long range fleet or are aligningmotionless waiting for a warp in  making them the best targets in an rr fleet most likely to die from alpha in short their faults are 50 stupid pilots 30 good ship in the wrong fleet and 20 need for slight improvement
ok if youre going to be cute by trying to base a large portion of your argument on how mine is wrong because i made a small mistake logical fallacy which truly has nothing to do with the actual argument kinda makes me think youre just attacking me instead of arguing your point and accidentally said i supported the whole thing then i can go change that would that make you happy what would you say to my argument then would you have some real feedback also dont shoot down the whole argument just because one little part seems to be overpowered that can be easily adjustedprobably because blasters are supposed to work close range but are at extreme disadvantage since we cant even track or stay in range of our optimal range something needs to be changedit is completely feasible that a missiles has an explosion radius greater than a target in my opinion now that is very unlikely given the size of missiles compared to the size of the ships but it could happen whats really hard to understand is how a turret cant hit a target right up in your face in my opinion
its not an exponential relationship and if you dig up the thread about blaster tracking youll see that your claims of terrible tracking arent that well founded and blasters have 3x more falloff then optimal so who says they should hit well at their optimalbut yeah blasters need a revision
no youtransversal speed is the component of the speed vector thats perpendicular to the origin vector its independent of r
ok cute stuff tracking doesnt take into account transversal it takes into account radial velocity which oh doesnt directly depend on radius but with a very small radius or distance between objects is easy to get ridiculously high radial speedstransversal speed is the component of the speed vector thats perpendicular to the origin vectorwut

what distance though too short and people will still bumptoo long and youre going to have a titan reaching into a fight and bailing out an entire fleet in 5 seconds just by warping to the titan at 10km and clicking jump a large subcap fleet would be able to jump into a system via a bridge a titan could cloak at a safespot subcap fleet can fight and stuff when it gets hot warp back to the titan at 10km and jump outhonestly it isnt that big of a deal but i support it anyway
i have no reason not to support this topic
i thought it wasnt that big of a deal until i got my titan
anything to hear stop bumping the fking titan less
whats to keep them from using that tactic currently just replace warp to titan at 10km with warp to titan at 2km
when i was in the cap test warping at 0 had the amusing effect of bumping the titan and mom way off each other around 40km the collision detection on a titan is insane because of its masshence the need for the range boostsupported
oh rightthe plex restrictions were introduced to allow younger players have some equal fights and not just always have the old experienced players walk over them this succeeded partly sp still matters of course but you can push a rifter only that far but with the recent boost to faction ships faction frigates and faction cruisers are the undisputed kings of minormedium plexes those are usually not accessible to younger pilots as they require a lot of isk and for the better ships crosstrainingit would be nice if this could be returned to the original design state this would likely require a new category for faction ships besides t1t2 though

actually i was thinking a longer time period would be better ads run a week or a month it would also lead to happier devsgms if there were less local ads and more globalregional ads the bigger the ad the longer the run the higher the cost the higher the cost the fewer the ads the more expensive and fewer the ads are the less likely they would be inappropriate possibly not having 1systemwide ads would be the best idea simply from the basis of how many systems there are in game maybe with the exception of the trade hubsplayers should be able to do the vast majority of the policing of ads the more systems it shows in the broader the audience the broader the audience the more likely for someone to flag inappropriate content really an ad would be less likely to have content that needs to be filtered than local in fact local currently is functioning in the same capacity as this proposal but without limitations
annoying as hell kill it or at least reduce it to a more reasonable time reading a thread and posting a short simple reply like yes i agree or yes i have had that happen to me to or no they didnt implement that in this patch does not take anywhere near 5 minutes and having to sit and wait is just lame one minute should be quite sufficient to throttle someone who does go berzerk and try to spam the forums and it should not be that hard for the mods to spot such activity and quash it anyhow

ive noticed km going missing since dominion nobody in fleet getting them would be nice if everyone on the kill was issued the mail also
ive actually noticed that that you can suicide gank and not take full suicide penalties because of damage from when the victims drones agress you many seconds after their instant death concord does 999 of the work but the hobgoblin autoagress always manages to get the km i like this as it is easily repeatable and you only take aggression sec hits not the much larger ship kill sec hit also no kill rights for the victim i dont mind if it takes them awhile to fix this

i dont like the idea of lets say a pink fleet or yellowblack cruisers or things like that so a definite nogo for paintjobs even artwork would look pretty unrealistic if you think about the size of the ships nogo too logos i would say are a good thing to display a large corporation or an alliance for example if they are subtle enough so a go for that but a absolute nogo for logos on every single players shipsnew eden is a cold an disturbing dark place and i think that should be emphazised by the visuals of the game eve just isnt world of wonderfulrainbowcoloredworld and i think it should be kept like thisso no support for that sorry

show a fit that can tank all four dd types unless you stack resists to over 90 of a specific resist it will be seriously hurting with one shot according to eft an all l5 pilot can stack resists to get an effective 9mil ehp of a single resist but its well under 3m for the other 3 resists you shouldnt have to do this to have a chance at survival and this is without the rest of the support fleet pounding awayso youre saying that being able to inflict an instant 20b loss on someone is a good thing either you have no regard for how much money goes into these things or youve never lost a ship in an instant beforenow granted im not a capital pilot in any respect but being able to be oneshotted by anything is just ed especially when said ship costs so muchsupported
and there lies the crux of the mattermoms were never meant for everyday usethe reason why they along with titans can not dock at npc stations and the reason they can only be built in sovereign null sec is they were intended to be alliance owned super capital ships for deployment in cap fleet warfare between null sec alliancesof course players have found ways around these restrictions with chribbadarknesss escrow ship transfers and parking altsposesyou really cant blame ccp if these ships are now unsuitable for roles for which they were never intended ie minimully supported corporation level nulllow sec gate camp and drop operationsin there intended usage moms should not fit tackle or local repsthey will have fleet tackle with them and enough rr support from other momscarriers to make local rep a waste of a slot that would have been better used for resiststhis leaves low slots  shield tanks  and mid slots  armor tanks  free for cprs and cap rechargersalong with cap fountain transfers back and forth between momscarriers and with cap pumps from logistics ships moms even the tanked variety should have more than enough cap to perma run 2  3 or maybe even 4 capital remote repswith 25 fighters  drones at there disposal and invulnerability to jamming moms are still a formidable force when they are part of a fleet large enough to discourage titan  dread hotdropsa 5xhp buff would be warranted if moms had the cap killer roll where they are expected to go against titans toe to toe but cant effectivlly damage smaller shipsin there current incarnation with sweet damage  they can easilly engage and destroy any sub cap ship with easeits unreasonable for you to expect 99 of the players base  who fly frigcruisebcbs to go up against moms with that kind of damage and have to deliver 5x the current amount of damage to destroy there opponentsmoms are tough enough and invulnerable enough against sub caps allready they dont need to be 5x betterno to solowtfpwnmobilesno to players having there hands held by ccp because they have circumnavigated ship restrictions and now find themselves sitting in ships they cant afford to lose and now actually could losewhat the rest of us have to suffer 5x kill requirement because mom pilots spent 20b on there pride and joys and deserve special treatment i really hope you drop this bs before you waste ccpcsm facetime on a solution to a problem that players have gotten themselves into that would negativelly affect 99 of the players you were elected to representyeah right  woot woot for selfish self interestor come up with a solution that mitigates the titan damage whilst not opping moms versus everything else
just go away k
moms are already good enough to go against sub caps so getting 5x hp buff wouldnt really change things cd other than the fact that it makes it a little more difficult for a titan to kill a 20 billion isk ship with relative easewoot woot for self interest you sayi dont own a mothership i have never flown with a mothership i have never seen a mothership but i support this so its not quite so easy to instapop a 20 billion isk ship
what you should be trying to say is that ms are not supposed to be good at everything claiming they were not meant to be used on a regular basis is perversenope the requirements were only there to curb the amount that could be built  there have always been third parties around willing to secure the deals so claiming they were only to be used by sovholders is dumbwhat are you trying to say here the lowsec ms died with the introduction of the hic and even without them people managed to kill a few see x13 ms have never been capable solo ships apart from ganking the odd bs that jumped into them in lowseccapital energy transfers are extremely inefficient and will only generate minute amounts of cap and i would like to see your setup that can tank multiple dds and can permarun 4 crragain more rubbish 25 fighters requires 5 drone control units and no ms will ever fit that besides you were just talking about fitting 4 crr and now that they are capable of being destroyed in seconds by a titan gank squad they are hardly a formidable force and when the attacker plays it well the support fleet can do nothing but sit by and watchplease elaborate on your reasoning because its making sod all senserr bs can easily tank a ms anything smaller than a bs can easily run away their dps is hardly impressive wow we agree on something too bad your grasp of game mechanics fails tremendouslyonce again you show how ignorant you are of the mechanics and gameplay surrounding super capitalsno in fact you have only encouraged me to push even harder now please go away and asphyxate ingame in space edited for courtesy

because it has an awesome autopilot make its targeting system for comming out of warp more precise so its able to come out approx 910km from a gate or even closer to it thats what the shuttle is for right auto pilotperhaps increase warp speed to 7 au just minor buffs that really makes the ship interesting and actually get a role the king of autopilot
perhaps make it require spaceship command 4
the autopilot is controlled in the podthe shuttle was made i believe to keep you from having to pod from place to place its just a shell not something to enhance ap
no
translation  can i has auto pilot to zerp pls 
go get yourself a pile of bposbpcs and fly in jita for a few hours coming in and out on autopilotif your still alive congrats you convinced me your luckyif you died your a total idiotthat was my subtle way of saying no
you can be subtle since whenopshuttles are meant to do exactly what the name implies  shuttle your pod and a minimum amount of cargo around at a fixed speedthere is no need to modify them they do their job exceptionally well they are not however a replacement for hands on the keyboard flying through known gank spots which is what it really sounds like youre asking for
develdrin i dont think you have much experience with gank spots or ganking in generaltraveling is dull in eve there is simply no reason the autopilot shouldnt get some love other than we want to punish the players with repetive gameplay
comparing 4 days to a month is failure with math the nice bonuses you speak about are a mere 2 in paper dpsid much rather have ccp spend resources in displaying damage notifications for drones than this nonsense your change affects a handful of ships domi ishtar moros the 3 amarr equivalents the 2 pirate ones and to a lesser degree the phoonin any practical situation you wont notice the 2 extra dps on the first 2 if you bothered taring the 4 lvl 5 skills to 5 hello 80 days more training time id rather get into a carrier for that thxlikewise for the moros as these extra dps will mix in with your gunsthe geddon paks heavy drones at least half of the time so the extra 80 days will go unnoticedsee domiishtar for the pirate shipsand lastly the phoon needing more sp why because minmatar racial flavor is that they need to train more stuffyou char dates back to 2006 somehow i get the feeling there is a hidden newguysarehavingittooeasythesedaysandtheyshouldhaveitashardastheoldones agenda involvedthis way of thinking is flawed you wouldt run over your neighbors dog just because yours died yesterday would you
sokratesz your topic about the titan jump portal range was good but this one however is terrible not sportin
people spend billions of isk getting tiny  improvements in all areas of eve why would drones be any different
please ccp look at this and give us a answer you see us and are giving us some attention
it isnt just not listening that leads to clicking the wrong one put two buttons right beside each other and you will get people clicking the wrong one when they are rushed warpalign are often needed in a rush so bad things happen especially now where the threat of alpha strike death is much higher the need to align as soon as you arrive on grid and warp off as soon as you start receiving damage doesnt leave room for erroredit to be clear having something like remove from overview right beside either would also be just as bad if not worse
ill have to respectfully disagree with that opinion i believe mindlinks and the inconveniences inherent with them are the price one pays for specializing i fly fleet command ships almost exclusively and have never really had much issue with mindlinks theyre relatively cheap implants honestly
imo fix insurance as a whole and you should see a reduction in suicide ganks too especially the ones for trivial ammounts of goods say 100200 mil right now i lose like 10 mil at the most suiciding a bs with mostly meta 34 stuffbut keep insurance the same for everybody losing my ship trying to make a profit off other peoples efforts should make me no less entitled to insurance than for example a carebear getting owned by the ninjalooter he should have known not to shooton the other hand if you can afford to haul 1 bil of stuff in a badger around you should just invest some time in training a t2 hauler concord doesnt need to protect you you can do it yourself if you choose not to poof
how about thisin high security space concord impounds any cargo or dropped modules on any ships destroyed by criminal action the goods go to the nearest concord station and you have to pay some calculated fee to get them backalso add my vote to removing insurance from concorddestroyed ships concord and the scc are in the same alliance why does one destroy your ship and then the other pay you for it oo
say hi to hello kitty online
do you play hello kitty online if so im at a disadvantage toward fully appreciating your analogy i havent played it how does that relate to eve and the suggestion of concord impounding wrecks in hisec

scorpion is an excellent boat and the only bs with a pure support role it does however have an extremely limited bonus that needs to be changed imhocaldari battleship skill bonus 15 bonus to ecm target jammer strength per level20 bonus to ecm target jammer optimal and falloff range per level20 bonus to ecm burst range per leveli propose changing this bonus to the following20 bonus to ecm drone jammer strength per levelthis is a much more useful bonus than a burst that could break locks of your own fleet members if used properly overpowered i think not ask any drone boat pilot and they will tell you butbut my dronze can be shooted down not to mention it only has a 75 m3 drone baywho knows you might actually see the ship appear in space more often until it is called primary that is dual box support scorpion in factional warfare
scorp is meant to sit at 100km  doing its job it has no need for ewar drone bonus the burst bonus is needed incase its tackled or you need to try get a freightercarrier out of troubleburst effect on your own fleet is the price you pay to save your freighter or an expensive corp ship
a caldari ship with a drone bonus doesnt really fit and the ecm burst bonus could easily be rolled into the other 2 bonuses for simplicity
this couldnt have said it better only drones of any use in a scorp are sentries drop and forget  and you can only have 3
to enhance the visibility of the roles persons have in an alliancecorp i propose to add graphical rank emblems in the fleet corp and alliance chats not in local or so just for the members that directly interact with you with the ease by which persons go in and out of corps and alliances or when one has been away for a long time its hard to keep track of who has what responisbility function or what the command hierarchie isemblems can be as simple such as a number of stars stripes or a coloroud background in the person list perhaps even having a personal color in which chat is displayed by certain personsfor clarification emblems are only to be shown in the persons list and is best handled by the corp interface where one assigns titlesroles
i have a proposal for triaged carriers that is purely aesthetic similar to the rorqual i think it would be an interesting change to see carriers become vertical monoliths while in triage this change would be very easy to implement purely aesthetic and very pleasing imho and would bring back just a small part of the novelty of owning a carrier if only for a whileby no means let this distract ccp from fixing the horribly broken motherships and the now even more broken naglfar

alright youre saying they should introduce a new gun for mid range fights but they already have them the duals what difference would it make as the duals are viable weapons in themselvesif you dont like people being that close or that far from you use rails and a webber the person is obviously not gonna want to get in web range and your guns can proceed to take them outthere are some uber setups but a midrange one is not it there are counters  use them

if you have ever been near a pos let alone used one they are buggy not just the functional aspect but the graphics aspect as well graphicallyive seen towers sideways ive seen towers bouncing around inside their shields ive seen towers pinwheeling ive seen towers that flip sideways every time a weapon hits itwhether the dead horse proposal which seems to show up once every week or so and get hundreds of support votes before being replaced by another iteration or simply fixing what currently exists something should be done with the modular stuff showcased blatantly in tech 3 ships a modular pos as suggested here would seem the less lagtastic approach

haha i actually got two characters who both can fly black ops redeemer and panther so i guess i should have a pretty high interest in supporting this issue
fo real excellent proposal
i do believe i will be supporting this proposal
yes sounds very good supported
supported
i can understand why it is legal to sell characters we are all clones not really home grown beings so we are more like property come on now when you die you buy another copy of yourselfbut yes a safety measure to prevent people from stealing guessing someones password isnt really hacking someones accounts and then selling it and transferring the money is a good idea i do think however selling characters is now apart of the economy maybe not as well seen as ships and fittings but when you pay someone 8100 bil its going to make a difference someway
this is a no brainerdrake is as always an idiot
signed
i agree with this ideaits not so much an issue of your responsible if you get hacked but its also an issue of comfort the idea that your character is locked out for a full week gives you time in case you are hacked gives peace of mind to the account holder if they areyou may lose your assets in game like people dont get their ships blown up every day but at least youll know that your character will still be there when you get your account backi would suggest that the unlocking of a character would be sent as an email notification and possibly be included in the general api information about a character so that those who dont check email regularly but check their skill progression regularly will notice the change and still be able to take action
hi guysi dont really want to discuss the whole thread here there is a lot of detail and that is why it is in fi discussion what i will say is the tracking boost is contingent on removing all tracking bonuses therefore on the megathron for example 50 boost to base tracking would only be in real terms a 9 boost over existing trackinggabriel

with at the moment 270 stations containing deliveries its a complete pita scrolling back and forth through that insanely long list trying to read the fine print and figure out which system is the next closest on my pickup runand while im in a system every time i dock or undock it closes all opened rows and resets the scroll all the way back to the top of the listthis is simply put broken compared to the simplicity of the personal assets listneeds to be examined in a bad way and should not be that difficult to adjust
increase lp gains for pvp killsmake missions only go to contested systems and have the lp rewards scale with the amount of combat that has recently occured in that system and give capture points for completed missions or give the opposing side capture points for stopping a mission runneror scrap missions all together and have agents send you to a plex in the nearest contested systemgive lp equal to that of a missionfor plexing small plexl1medl2lgl3unrestrictel4 this lp can either be from capping the plex or divided up as bounties on the npc navy ships this will encourage people to actually kill the rats instead of speed tanking and moving on
works for me
i guess the watch list is restricted to 10 due to lag preventioni do however support this idea 
give us also seperate broadcast buttonshistory window back now i am constantly resizing the fleet window since i dont need large window for watching broadcasts but when i want to use fleet finder or see fleet composition for example when flying logistics and i want to add dictor squad to watch list i want a much larger windowedit forgot support check box
pls yesi fly logitstic ships daily and current setup is just too annoying to use try loggin on and try to make a watchlist while a fight is going at for example your home station not gonna happen with current system
it also would be nice to be able to split all that fleet stuff apart having broadcast buttons history fleet composition etc all grouped in one window really cramps my style
supportedalso when trying to lock a target via rightclicking a target x broadcast if the target is eg not in range or you are unable to target it for some other reason like being inside a pos forcefield the object in question is not selected at all this means that broadcasts cannot be used to umabiguously identify targets for everyonefor consistency and ease of use it would seem preferable to make the object selected before trying to lock it so that approach etc can be used even if the locking fails for some reason
why the buttons so small  i am old and fat and ugly and my mouse is made of cheese help me 
this is an old terrible idea remove list of players in the system hidden in a new terrible idea add advertising to the game im bombarded with crass irritating meaningless advertising for hours of every day why should i have to deal with that stupid bull in eve too while were at it for realisms sake why dont we add newtonian physics to eve and remove soundtldr your idea is stupid not supported counterproposal implement a system whereby i can see these ads and postings only if i want to and leave local alone unless you have a real idea

the following is a proposal to improve the readability and avoid friendly fire in remote rep fleet fightsadd the little blue  red  or the purple fleet icon to the image of locked targets just like they show on the character portraits this would make it much easier to determine if the locked target is friend or foe in a split second thus avoiding people shooting on blues by accident

you can actually just do a warp within 0 of the gate and jump that way even though auto pilot does somehow take you out by a sizable distance i just go manually but with the destination still plotted its tedious but faster because you just warp then hit jump when warp is overbut yes it seems a little odd that your navigation computer would take you out 10km especially if you in a freighter
and i doubt you have any experience with coherent thought but i was nice enough not to bring that upif you dont like the warp while you autopilot dont autopilotor read a bookyou can obviously read or is your version of the forums all in pictogramstroglodyte
i dont think you even know what ganking is eitheri would be more than happy to introduce you to the concept meet me at a wormhole and ill be happy to personally introduce you pats shrapnel bomb to gankingill even arrange to have de show up in her huricane you game de
how about intentional game design elementyou are supposed to play the game that means sitting in front of the computer and keeping your eyes and ears if youre one of those freaks that has the sound turned on focused on the gameeve like all mmos is designed to be a timesink about half the time of every game session is spent on traveling to and from somewhere this is intentional there is no reason for ccp to reward afk gaming you want to arrive safely at your destination you fly your ship yourselfnot supported
what is it with you two you almost seem to live in the assembly hallstill i say no to the idea being at the keyboard has its advantages and if you were smart you would either use the browser to troll the eve forums or use a second monitor to watch a movie or a tv series its not that hard and i do it all the timealso confirming i will help with introduction to ganking ill bring the tear jar
i cant live in the assembly hall  they wont let me decorate i have a cute little apartment next dooractually like you i read the forums while i flying to placesor miningor waiting for code to compile at work  cause nothings more boring than watching ant run
i dont live here if i did everyone else would likely run xfor me its busy busy time while waiting for winblows to finish removing viruses at work i fix computers for a livingtoo bad i cant play eve at work but this is close enough o
i think these changes will actually make ganking more profitable you just got to know what your doing
if shuttles cant be locked before they get to the gate and dont instapop they will be functioning like a different ship in game like a af or ceptor why are you flying a shuttle in a situation where you might die anyway thats just silly talk
i never mentioned anything about reinforcing their armor or shield only thing that changes is they come out of warp a little closer to the stargate this thread is not about removing the gank factor then i would have suggested warp to z this is about making an autopilot that is fast an affective but still has risk to it
the closer you end up at the gate the more stupid people will use auto pilot while afk2 words are the only conclusion one can reachhell noif you want minimal risk warp to zerostop being lazy
this is about traveling convenience an improved autopilot that is not riskfree making the shuttle come out of warp a bit closer to gates than average say 910km away more people will definatley use it for afk travelingtransporting more people doing this is only a good thing from a gankerspirate perspectivetldrimproved traveltime on autopilot that will increase your productivity in other areasits not risk free the dedicated ganker will still be able to get you
a while back ccp supposedly set it so that when you decline a mission the agent doesnt turn around and offer you the same mission again not so with driving a wedge where after declining a mission to go kill gallente ships you immediately get the same exact mission except sending you to go kill minmatar ships getting this mission can lock out an agent for 8 hours to someone who is avoiding faction hitsfurthermore im not sure if ccps new agent behavior actually works as after finally declining the second driving a wedge section i got one courier mission before getting a whole new driving a wedge sequence so im bitter right now

this needs to stay on the front page if ccp nozh did not break the mothership he most certainly broke the naglfar to have solid universally accepted changes created basically by the player base promised to be released then roled back 2 weeks before dominion went live is basically a hard wet slap in the face straight from ccp to the playersdominion was not a good patch dominion was and still is an insult to every single player who plays eve regardless of whether the ship changes will ever affect your character the naglfar is even worse than it was before motherships are now huge isk sinks nothing more their combat viability is gone their survivability is gone there is no reason any pilot in their right mind would take out his supercarrier nowthis is fully supported and i would again and again if i could ccp needs to remedy this situation or i expect alot of their player base will begin to dissapearccp our trust in you to continue to produce a quality solid game is gone our faith in you as competent developers is gone our faith in you to understand the basic mechanics of your own game is gone congratulations on alienating the majority of your player base with this patch
meh of all the screwed up button positioning in the game this isnt one of them at least align and warp are related functions while make active and trash are not if you wind up hitting the wrong button its not that big of a deal if you want to warp and hit align by mistake youre still getting yourself setup for warping if you want to align and hit warp by mistake you get the warp drive active notification your speed gauge switches to warping and you can cancel out in plenty of time the only exception is if youre in a frig in which case why are you aligning and not closing on the enemyanyway not supported

why not bring fleet size in as a variable  so smaller fleets like up to 30 ppl could get 3 bonuses and as fleet size increase the bonus goes down to 2 at 100 ppl fleetsthis way small fleets get the boost but larger ones dontalso info warfare is the best for smallmed fleets where ewar matters much more
remove insurance for getting concordokken and for self destruct
while i agree that suicide ganking in hisec is a problem im not sure that harshening consequences is worth it maybe drop insurance to 50 but for gods sake dont remove it it keeps everyone from running around afk in untanked indys full of valueable stuffmake it worth the gankers time to study each victim for instance with the above insurance nerf he has to make sure that he can cover his 50 loss and thus wont kill just every hauler that comes his way but if this is to happen consider nerfing concord a bit each ship equivilant of a toptier sleeper vessel perhaps so that the extremely dedicated might live long enough to finish a victim to prevent abuse each additional offender spawns a new set of vessels and sets keep coming until the gankers isare destroyedother than that mess away but dont give in and let the idiots prosper

oh hey liang d
long overdue
yep pos could be a really cool and fun thing to play with just like ships are now but on a different scale the current setup just makes them a necessary evil that everyone hates
but i thought they fixed everything with dominion wait

enthusiastically supportedim fleet salvager during mission ops and it would be very handy for the missioners to just throw me a bookmarki like scanning mainly im hunting hidden ore but i have corpmates who like different things i can find and who are willing to give me a finders fee it would be so much simpler to throw them a bookmark rather than meeting up to jetcan it or docking to contract itand as a miner i have preset positions for belts in my favorite systems it would save a lot of trouble in group mining ops to assign people bookmarks for their position so that we dont end up on top of each other mining the same rockslots of utility to this idea no matter what aspect of eve appeals to you

oh yeah im so a fan of this
this is core functionality that should be made less clunky than it is todaythough the people who want local bookmarks need to stop and think converting bms to a form outside the server allows for the creation of arbitrary bookmarks by third part tools

bump for gallente
supporting for gallente boost the worst race cuz they really are
i would support a very large tracking buff say 50 more also a bit more damage say 20i think though however i would like to see alot more drones and drone flexibility on all gallente ships all frigs should having a drone or two eve and ships should have space for spares or a set of lights on the mega and other ships this would give gallente flexibility they currently seriously lack
this isnt comparing apples to oranges you cant have an idea of relative balance without comparing the performance of ships i compared the performance of a tier3 turret bs to a tier 3 turret bs its hardly stretching the imagination and i did so specifically to counter a misconception that was brought up about blasters reaching 40kmyou are right about the complaint with gallente ships by the time you swing around and burn towards the primary its usually all ready dead or close to it after a few ships youll also be capped out from whirling around the field with your mwd churning this isnt the fault of bad piloting or target calling though theres nothing you can do when youre out of range of the primary except attempt to close or fire at something elseyour statement about target calling doesnt really help your argument you specifically shoot at gallente ships because you know they usually have to sacrifice tank for dps and speed and they wont be able to shoot back at normal engagement ranges ive seen the same thing done regularly as well granted if the blaster boats get in range they pose a real threat but that rarely happens anymore
supported gallente have been subpar for some time
supported because it will improve corporation logistics
lately in the gallente push we have been getting some nice small fleet and solo fights because the systems are so far away from nourv there are some pirates tooi figured out that there has to be an incentive for people to plex a lot of people cant really stand doing it and i cant blame them for it if there was some sort of lp reward for killing the npcs inside and to capture the plexes more people would be interested in running them and this would attract people who like killing these people increasing the population actively participating in plex fights and capturesi also think that the lp payout for pvp kills has to be increased significantly at least 10x to make any impact what so ever and make it not bugged so everyone gets a share of it not only the person with the killmail
i also think it would be a good idea to have missions where you have to ferry supplies to stations and staging points throughout lowsec in order tog get lp you could choose missions that could be dine in frigates cruisers or in industrials but these would all have to be handed out by special agents so they dont conflict with normal fw missionsi mean it would make sense to use pilots to ferry goodssupplies into enemy territory or into captured friendly lowsec systems from highsec points like blockade running supplies into intaki or running fuelammo into staging points withing enemy territory
fw is just a mess with all the broken mechanics please devote some resources to finish what you started ccp

this change is urgently requiredwould also be very helpful to have some kind of tag column in the watch list even if something as basic as a choice between eg fc scout squad logistics other or even just abcde max of 10 per tag would be just fine tyvm if that is necessary
makes sense i like it might save your ass if youre engaged at close range with an enemy ship while trying to remote rep an ally whos flying the same hull if you fired on your ally and repped your enemy youd never live it down
supported
yup
yes please
1 no insurance period if concord is the one who blows up your ship  regardless if you have it or noti fear i might actually have to explain this change but should be obviousin case it is not id like csm to ask ccp to make this change this would balance out all the folks who have suicide alts who spam suicide players for profit because they platinum insure their ships thus making the having an alt take all the negative security  lose no isk while their main andor friend profit with no risk actually require some real thought ie having to make sure your target is really carrying enough to cover the ship  mods as a whole that you are about to loseinsert suicide gankers crying because no risk isk opportunities would be actually made risky
works for me
i wont vote on this subject because a i have no suicide ganking alts b i havent been suicide ganked everhowever you do realize that removing insurance for concord blown ships dont remove the suicide ganking itself do the math yourself if you dont trust my word
as long as this is accompanied by a similarly small change to concord  evading concord is no longer considered an exploit then fineif you want realistic insurance then i want realistic police in returninsert high sec carebears crying because no risk isk opportunities should only be allowed for people they like
i have no problem with that really you cant escape them because to do so youd have to get out of high sector space and the odds of that happening are next to zero but i find most suicide gankers regardless are failures at pvp and generally unsuccessful at the game as a whole the basic reason theyve resorted to this tactic is an oversight in game mechanics on ccps partthat being said i dont want to stop suicide ganks i just want the practice of it made into a real risk management process such as 00 rating pirating etc as it stands right now you can easily rake in a few quick billion with an alt character you spent 2 weeks training at most with a few friends it should be more profitable to war declare than suicide gankif concord removed your insurance payout because they were the ones who popped you then suicide gankers would have to do more of a costbenefit analysis more reconnaissance etcive only been suicide ganked once in a shuttle with nothing in it the other times ive had it attempted on me freighter once in a drake even no joke theyve all failed and the only reason it was attempted was1 exploit of being able to create and throw away alternative characters very few are professional ones that do ratting to rebuild their status to 22 the exploit of being able to be paid sometimes at a profit even for dying to concord even without getting phat lewtttzzzfolks this isnt rocket science realistically allstate does not come into your jail cell after youve had your car shot up in a shootout with the police and issue you a checkedittldr if you want to suicide gank you will now have to risk your isk because insurance wont pay out so you can still gank the stupid carebears with phat lewtz in unprotectedunescorted ships but now you cant just give it a go on anyone randomly because you wont hardly lose anything this balances this no one should ever be safe in high sec but at the same time risk must be associated with everything
it would also render whole classes of targets economically invulnerable to suicide ganking specifically freighters unless concord was considerably nerfed say back to how it was in 2006it takes about 2550 bs to kill a freighter before concord arrives  thats around 256b therefore the freighter needs to be carrying more than 512b in cargo for it to even begin to be a viable targetgiven that  as you say  youre not against the practice of ganking per se the huge nerf of insurance removal would also need to be accompanied by a roughly similar boost via reduction in concord response times allowing escape from concord reforming wardecs limiting npc corps in some way or whatever else without this balance your proposal is incomplete as presented it is simply yet another huge boost to hisec when hisec already has an overwhelming economic advantage why does hisec need boosting even further
i dont think you get the point of this thread if something takes a few dozen people to gank it before concord comes then yes you should be hitting some 510 billion isk target not just any target because its there and insurance on some ships is a net gain currently
would be interesting to get an official comment on this nowif so then using it will be an exploit until it is fixed

eve established a sad record its the first game im playing without sounds starting todaythe reason is that new sound file they implemented in dominion that makes it unbearable to sit near any jump or warp gates  unless you turn down your world level to a minimumi was close to that measurement a while ago when the active shield hardeners started to sound like a laundry dryer but zooming out a bit fixed that for metherefore my proposal make the ingame sounds more manageable the 5 sliders can stay the way they are but how about a few more checkboxes like quieter turret soundspossible optionsstation environmentgate environmentmodule soundspropulsionthe function would be the same as the checkbox for the turret sounds that is already there that way everyone can enjoy the portion of sound he likes because some of those sound effects in eve really are  well we are not allowed to cuss on the boards are we
i completely agreezooming out only does so much i would especially like to be able to control the ambient sounds while docked at station looks at amarr station owners and shakes finger especially the amarr ones since i can hear the gleefull praise of their clergy in the background it sometimes drones out either my eve jukebox or my own mp3s playing in the background
hello hinata onishitheres a thread for this already called csmccp feedback request how to better use sound in evefor me im thinking about leaving it off until the next bit of related news arrivesby off i mean off off
supported though instead of removing censoring alltogether there should be a forum option to turn it on and off
nice

ill support this basic idea even if reality forces the use of a different implementation method it isnt the smartest thing to do but if you dont want to waste your time and just want to quickly dump all your stuff on the market it should be made possible
i actually had another idea about self destructing reduce the timer to about 10 seconds but change the way it works self destructing should render the ship unusable but leave normal loot this is good for pvpers and allows the player to keep them from stealing the entire ship i would also say in event of self destruct the pod would gain a 5 second targeting invulnerability from the radiation of the blast the pirate is happy because he gets your faction mods and your happy because you got away safly in your pod win win
i fully endorse this productservice
low priority or not these would be insanely easy to implement take the models from the armor bots effect from remote hull reppers add a new item id to the database copy some stats to said id and bam hull maintenance bots
seems simple enough and makes enough sense to have
to all of you new old and future delegatesif you do not wish us the players to voice our opinions in all ways we possibly can here other subforums and using the ingame mail then you should increase your cspa charge or simply tell us to shut up because you dont honestly give a damn about any matters save your own personal issuesif you dont increase or even set your cspa charges to make people mailing you ingame costly then you should not argue when players communicate with you by that avenueyou are the csm youve put yourself forward for the position so dont bitch when people send you ingame mail
oh you must be the guy who forwarded one particular proposal of his to the entire csm by means of a mass mailfyi  i told you not to do that again not because i dont care but because having your inbox spammed silly by people who think they have the greatest idea since sliced bread is bloody annoying i am very open to suggestions but please think your ideas through thoroughly before you post them here as proposals if they live long enough to garner decent support we will notice them eventuallyyou certainly werent the first one to attempt to get some attention by mass mailing the entire csm so i will repeat what i told you ingameplease dont do that for every issue it wont help your case
thats a nice false dichotomy youve got there

why not it does for me very very clear1 what you think its meant for is irrelevant it does the job2 what youre saying is not true seeing as the ingame log disappears after every session change the text file logs located on your hard drive eve folder are those that are meant to be used after the battle

noyour suggestion is still pointless why should 1 ship have a better autopilot than others especially when its one of the fastest ships in the gameyou have not given a sound andor reasonable answer to that question
no shuttles are very useful as they are at this moment theyre not made for autopiloting but to protect your pod from being ganked anywhere  from 00 to highsec this suggestion is thus pointless
reallythe point being ccp didnt want wtz to start with so why would they make anything that boosts ap anytime soon
and make it impossible for me to infiltrate  gank missioners nightmares nty
well for the overview i believe that a way to make it work better would be to change it from the current spreadsheet style to one that is able to display important information in a larger rectangle rather than columns in addition when something was selected in the overview instead of a selected windows the rectangle would expand to include the buttons for the commands that would normally be displayed in the selected windows another addition would be to have a better sort by type option this way instead of relying on multiple tabs to separate data which can sometimes lead to further confusion difficulty instead it would be much more logically for example all ships would always be displayed before station which would come before stargate etc as it is now there is now way to keep all of the ships together and isolated from other overview items without the usage of tabs i would also like for there to be tags on items so when i search for logical terms in the market place ie cpu upgrades anything that is a cpu upgrade appears and not just the nonexistent items that have cpu upgrade in the name browsing the marketplace can also be made a bit simpler for example the search bar should be persistant over the list on the left side and that list should not show every individual item but instead stop at the item type ie cpu upgrade the right side would be split into an upper and lower section the upper section would have rectangular section similarly to the overview changes i proposed which would be the objects that fall under the section selected on the left side the lower section would be the current spreadsheet of prices for the selected item also the lower section would be separated further into tabs eg sell buy graphs etc all people would be able to add labels to items so that when searching for say pvp raven anything that i gave a label of pvp raven would appear so basically give the new mail ui to the markplace
yes yes yes totally supported i wrote about this in another topic ill copy it here since this thread seems more popular we all know eve has a steep learning curve and ccp has tried to ease people in with new tutorials etc but as i and a couple of my friends started playing eve some weeks ago i think that user interface is one of the most glaring issues of eve now that i have learned basics and starting to be more accustomed with eve interface is still my biggest complaintlooking at screenshots from earlier versions of the game interface looks alot like todays interface considering all the graphical etc revamps its odd that interface certainly more important part of any game than graphics hasnt got revampthere is way too much clicking right click menus lists deep menus etc everything from ship control panel and target action window to chat interface and inventory management could use a ton of functionality improvements and streamliningneo com is ok minimized im certain that all current functionality of interface could be done much better if whole thing would be done from scratchin short i think that revamping games interface would greatly benefit new player experience and also old playerstho say if you dont agreemy issues with interface menus are too deep and hard to find too many right click functions and menus combat interface is like playing some desktop application alot of clicking on overview and target action window right clicks for distance chances etc doesnt feel very active or involved drone management is pain collapsaple menus and right clicking chat stuff could be just copied from wow or any other mmoeve security features stuff like easy private messages and messages from many channels on one window etc tactical view maybe you guys have found it useful but i havent atleast yet took me while to notice how to know if im being jammed i guess its fine now that i noticed that bar but these kind of things could be easier to notice comparing items is hard it takes a while to compare for example what turret would be best for my ship icons and colors on overview i have no idea what some of that stuff actually means would be nice if that stuff was more evident without googlingim sure there is alot more complaits and improvements to be made but those are some off the top of my head
i reject your proposal for the following reasons the agent wont give you the same mission twice mechanic is working perfectly and as intended the problem youre encountering is that youve been handed one of a handful of mission chains where rejecting a mission will give you an alternate mission to complete instead this mission is a precursor to the epic mission arcs that are now present in eve and one of the few where you go up against tier 3 npc battleships all in all driving a wedge is a very unique mission chain and should not just be thrown out because a mission farmer doesnt approve of it your goal at least in the first part is to kill the ambassador killing anything else is optional thats 1 faction ship you have to kill 1 ship surely your high and mighty faction standings can take the hit of killing a lone cruiser cant theyso the way to solve your problem is this you accept the first mission warp into the mission area and waste the ambassador the other ships present will all warp off mission complete then you can freely go and turn down the second part as that involves considerably more slaughter and standings loss problem solved
i cannot support this proposal on one main ground theyre both the same mission and you can decline both of them with it only counting as one mission the lockout you were discussing doesnt existi dont run antifaction missions but i dont want them to go away its part of the freedom of choice that is mmos and this mission is exactly like every other antifaction mission once you realize this trick
unless youre in fw there should be no missions against opposing factions only opposing factional subgroups as we now have with gist centi ectthat way you can run these missions without utterly destroying whatever faction standings you may haveif its factional warfare however it should not be changed
bunyip excellent i did not know they counted as a single mission thank you for that and no this wasnt a remove all faction kill missions post my problem was simply with how this mission appearedzak as standings hits are always equal to the highestvalue target you hit the fact that its one ship doesnt matter as all standings hits from killing things are just one ship once you kill a single faction ship you might as well kill everything of equal or lesser value to it within the next 20 minutes in that system as you will not be penalized any more for them and yet even though all these standings hits are all one ship many people keep trashing their standings
nothing obliges me to take every reply seriously and his idea of how a multiplicative bonus works was simply incorrect
not supported t2 sentries are fine and skills for the sake of skills are pointless
simple process make the number of lp one gets from killing enemy militia ships directly proprotional to the percentage of systems the militia owns this way militia members get paid more for owning and defending more systems also maybe the quality of missions are imrpoved by owning more systems

ccp already did a masterminds job by creating modular ships and coughcough balancing them all they need to do in order to keep the poor horse from being endlessly flogged is rinse and repeat right come on give the wizkids at art department another challengeand give us that bloody horse uhm posi dunno if somebody keeps smirking and quietly watching other people crying their lungs out yet doesnt lift a finger  for years wouldnt that show a certain level of sadism no offense though
with the new soverignty structures it seems like ccp is taking a progressive approach to walking into this they have removed soverignty mechanic from poses and done what appears to be a modular setup on those structuresnow its a matter of gradually moving the existing archaic pos code over to the simplified modular formatbut that said we need to keep the pressure on themwhack thwap
i want it
i also have a problem reading it at 1920x1080 on my 42 lcd all the lower non native resolutions have a blurred degraded look to them 1152 is the next best resolution and it still looks horridexcept for the fonts which i can then read ive wondered if i could trick eve into using a different font either change the font file in windows or perhaps somehow inject a different fontsimilar to how people do graphics model changes in other mmos put an uncompressed file in a certain folder etc
yes please
great idea and obviously fully supported and yes this is perhaps a better place to bring it up
a game thats as textdriven as eve should really have far more font options than those currently available choosing between a small list of serif and sansserif fonts and being able to set the text size of individual windows or the game universally would help aloti have trouble reading some of the text and my vision is quite good my father who plays complains quite a bit about having trouble reading things
do want
blasters do seem to be a pretty weak weapon your opponent will always have an easy plan of trying to keep range and if they can you are dead if he sees you took the 10 seconds to load null he can move in and your transversal sucks so you must dedicate resources to closing range but your tank often wont hold when you doi agree the tracking should either be enhanced or the tracking of lasers and autocannons should be nerfed or a bit of both the damage should be boosted a bit too
the double tracking on a eam laser surprised me aloti fail to see any reason for it

yeah forcing people to bump in large quantities is bad especially when bumping mechanics are as silly as they are
this would be far more helpful than the relatively long text that flashes across my screen in combatbeing able to better differentiate between incoming and outgoing incl drone damage would be much appreciated something like having the damage values displayed at different parts of the screen incoming on left outgoing on right for example would make things clearermaking the damage display mobile would help alot too
it would be cool
i support this idea so long as there is also the option to enslave tourists homeless and so on
linkagesupported mainly so i can continue to convince myself that i dont need to see a doctor about feeling guilty when i biomass slaves
these make good sense
i completely support this idea though i agree the drone interface needs a bigger overhaulit seems odd that you can see the damage a drone has sustained while its flying about remotely but once it docks with your ship you no longer have any idea fixing this would help immensely when relaunching t2 drones after spawn wave if youre trying to prevent your severely damaged drone from joining the battle and getting destroyed
supportedalso the other posters in this thread who said it were right drones need a massive looking at in terms of their mechanics
has been asked for 900 times and hopefully it will be done some day
drones need looked at so this would be pretty essential
i never have understood why you need to log out to switch characters in the first place seems like poor designcoding to mesupported
i support the idea of fixing the timer on these forumseither use a captcha code for each post within a timeframe 5 minutes or simply reduce the post time limit to a reasonable time like 1 minute the forums already require a game account to post afik and if you wish to further reduce the possibility of spammers you can limit trial accounts to only a post on a new user forum section
as someone who uses  to mean approximately a loteg 1000 units of mega this is infuriating fully supporting changes to eves awful font
thats a lot of megas1 for this though
i fully support a clearer tilde at small font sizes though this should really be part of the larger font overhaul issue the eve fonti also agree that tilde should be mappable theres really no reason why it shouldnt be
i think this is just one of the many tiny issues thats wrong with the ui that tend to pile on fast and we do need many many ui tweaks
regardless of mechanics a cooldown timer and evemail to executor corp directors
not supported its the wrong solution to the wrong problemthere is no disband alliance button you kick corps until there is noone in the alliance except the executor it should always be possible to lock down rogue corps and kick them from the alliance before they can do damage whats needed is a better way of managing that than the current implementationbear in mind that the potential damage is more than simply role abuse it bleeds over into other areas that cant really be addressed by mechanics  such as trust and misinformation you can strip an individuals roles and kick him 24 hours later because theres not so much damage he can do in that time as a single person with presumably limited access to anything important if you lock down an entire corp in that way however you open yourself to problems with misunderstandings allies not getting the dont trust these guys they are getting kicked messages and a massive potential for drama during whatever prekicking period you have far better from an allianceleaders point of view to simply cut them loose and set them red that way theres much less chance of problems and everyone can see exactly where they standso while i agree that a single individual shouldnt be able to disband an alliance i dont agree with any of the solutions put forwards in this thread

just to emphasize this problem  currently in the metro defense the situation is as followsright after dt a lot of plexes are around you go and capture as many as you can alts help a lot here the further you are from dt the fewer plexes you have availablea concrete example we had a single major complex to capture yesterday in an over four hour period right before dt there were no plexes at all in any of the defensive minmatar systemsdt happens postdt in various systemsmajor 2x medium3x majormajor medium4x majorthe same is true for amarr systems except theyre less heavily foughtover right after dt so you have a few more later in the daythis means the whole war is about who can bring the bigger force right after dt as dt ends usually before the official 1200 most plexes are already captured when dt officialy endsand this is supposed to work sufficiently well according to ccp
this really needs to happen why hasnt this happened yetthe old effect was terrible this one is worse and there is no need for sensor boosters to have an effect anywaysame goes for tracking computers and probably every other static effect on a module which is designed to run indefinitely
sensor booster and eccm make my eyes bleed especially when both usedalso the old railgun and cyno effects were better
the sensor booster effect looks horrible and sadly its not the only one in general the old effects were a lot more realistic and immersive than the fantasystyle magic effects we get nowback in the days when helping out with betatesting the warp effect was a big part of the reason i kept messing about with eve well what else was there to do apart from mining or hauling at that time   the warp effect now is laughable most of the time i barely notice the effect regardless of having shaders bloom hdr etc set to the maxwhat makes eve look bad though is the horrid pixelstairs you find everywhere would be nice to see a smooth line for a change now that the year is almost 2010so anyway supported give us a reason to turn effects back on instead of enhancing the gaming experience they make the game unbearable whenever theres more than a handful of ships on screen
i remember the subtle effect before this ray of light was introduced it was good and subtle even the old one was much better than this what also bothers me is how its possible that many of the effects have a center outside of the ship my suggestion to ccp is just review all effects againi support this post
in all honesty a screen full of sebos going gives me a wonderful headache of epic proportions it does need to be less visually loud
yesthere was a short period during apocrypha 101 or 102 iirc when there was a beautiful and subtle new sebo effect which then got exchanged with the effect used for ecm burst of that time please give us that subtle sebo effect backnot only does it give serious headaches it also has serious performance issues when looking close at 50 ships running sebo
precisely also it only takes 16 or so people in threshers to drop a freighter as well but if that freighter is dumb enough or any ship to carry a lot of isk in their cargohold compared to their escortdefenses  well thats what suicide ganks are fori want suicide ganking to still be a danger especially for all those who carry bpos in shuttles but i also want it to be done like real crime is you stake out targets you hit when no one is looking and you maximize revenue because you are not getting any paycheck from anyone except the loot you grabi dont want suicide ganking to end let me be clear but the risk should match the reward currently you can suicide get nothing and still profit minus the sec status hit due to the platinum insurance thats wrong and this is no high sec vs null sec argumentin fact smart folks operate in both and have resources in both
this is fine as long as concord also gets more realistic powers like the ability to lock gates against people with negative security status  since we cant chuck them in jailsarcasmin all due seriousness insurance needs a long hard review by ccp because at present it unnaturally influences not only certain aspects of pvp to whit suicide ganking but also adds artificial influences on the general marketplacewhile i normally am in the remove insurance for concord and selfdestruction camp any changes to the insurance mechanics are going to have far reaching impacts on other areas of the game and they need to be considered carefully the answer may be this is the best we can do and keep the game balanced and thats fine but i still think the question needs to be askedim not supporting the ops particular proposal but i am adding a thumb for the csm taking up insurance with ccp and getting them to have a look at it
im not sure that is correct could you provide numbers
i can only support this if concord response timeseffects are nerfed to the point where suicide ganking is not adversely affected by the changes yeah you should still die but you should be able to kill a bigger target in a smaller ship if youre going to lose insurance suicide ganking is not a problem but id be fine with the change for reasons of internal consistency as long as gankers arent nerfed in the process
i would say it is roughly as accurate as your numbers take a group of pests and you really dont need 50 bs and there is nothing the freighter pilot can do about it especially since the suicide gankers make isk from the insurance
so numbers
charon has 6000 shield110400 resisted 20000 armor130400 resisted and 106250 hull base thats 827629630106250  144156 ehp with maxed hp skills and no gang boosting thats 180195 ehp assuming concord takes 30 seconds to spawn you need 60065 dps applied to it we can ignore tracking and range presumably so we look at the raw dps and say that the magic number is 67 battleships of course from my knowledge of concord spawn timers 30 seconds is probably long  if its say 15 seconds then you need 1214 if youre comparing destroyers the highest i can pump a destroyer with a suicide gank fitmeta0 gear faction ammo is 266 dps at perfect skills so you can replace one battleship with four catalysts if youre willing to fit it nicerwith the commensurate increase in costs its 5 destroyers replacing 2 battleships in other words youd need 15 t2 fit catalysts for 30 seconds to kill a charon with maxed hp skills
im for removing insurance for suicide gankers and self destructs if measures are taken so that suicide ganking remains viable hi sec should not become safe nerf concord then you can nerf insurance
bumping this to make sure it stays up there to annoy the devs
sounds like a good idea to me
good idea
makes sense and eases another part of corp upkeep
for the love of all that is good please fix fw starting with the proposed changes
supportedfw needs a lot of love from ccp but this would be a good start
anything that is reproduced by the bh is labelled a defect essentially just means the report has been validated and continues up the chain at least that is how i understand the systemif the standings not transferring is unintended game design why have they brushed off all comments about it the past almost 2 yearson a positive note it means they have started working on fixing our worndown home which is a good thing indeed  fingers crossed for a massive revamp of the system and not just patch jobs to shut people up
the usual reply is this is by design if you think it is bad design please post to the features and ideas discussion forum  if its a bug its not by designbecause the bug is not that standings avoid being shot at by npcs but that you can avoid the standing loss for capturing complexes by being in an allied militia very different things i just petitioned someone for using this and got a standard thank you for bringing this to our attention well look into it and take the appropriate action reply  not the this is not an exploit bla bla reply they usually do
arkady can you reply to this thread damar rocarion wants to know if this has been attached to a defect and what the defect number is
done  to repost the relevant part from there to this threadthe definition of an exploit is as followstechnically we all violated the tos because we explained the bug in various threads im afraid we will not see a big news post about this being an exploit only very few bugs whose abuse is considered an exploit get so much attention hence please do petition the abuse of this bug whenever you see it feel free to point to the bug number above
i support this they ed up for ms so they should be able to dock untill they are fixed
no because its not the same you can get a carrier to kill the jfrorqual you dont need a mom to do it and its not an insta death like you say its 13 mins well thats time to jump rring carriers in then and save the jfrorqualnow switch it round and a titan is dding a mom mmmmm theres no defence aganst this theres no way to stop it theres no way you can rr it ie not the same
funny thing a dread can kill a jf even faster than a ms can34x faster if youre a torp fit phoenixi also support this let us dock so i can get my ms pilot into something ing useful
shieldarmorhull warning alerts need to be on a separate channelit should be possible to disable all audio except alerts and evevoice separately to the world soundsedit an actual separate physical channel or soundcard selection for these various types of sounds would also be coolsome may be headphones some maybe external speakers user decides where and why
i completely agreealso an option to disable the sound of miners  pleeeeeeease while not disabling the sound of rats pewing on you
ccp wants you to experience the game to the fullest why do you think they made the sounds louder to begin with regarding the arts department ccp gives a damn about what players want just look at the mega salad edition debacle alliance logos not getting done seizure inducing sebo effects not being fixed mwd trails gone nice cyno effect gone etc etc
this flametards are given way too much slack as it is people usually come to these forums once to ask advice or seek help after theyve been jumped all over and made to feel like idiots for asking anything they usually dont return when i do find the occasional informative post waves to akita t i usually just copypaste to our own forums giving credit of course because its difficult to get folks to come here and wade through the bs the forums are ccps not a godgiven right to carry on in game smacking via internet anonymity butbut nothing if people wouldnt pyramid quote 10 others the threads wouldnt get to xx pages long we could all just read the original posts and not skip to the end again imho the problem lies with the tactics used by posters not the forum rulesnot supported until i see some self control around here kthxbai

yep i agree
tldr add to the tactical overlay a representation of ships speed in the form of speed vectors visible at any level of zoom this feature should be removeable from the esc menu to save on client cputhis should also be mixed with the overview filters to let the user choose which ships show the speed vectorthis proposal was posted on the features board and seems welcomelong version with motivationswhen doing a 1v1 i usually look at my target to see what hes doing and anticipate the reaction time when the numbers grow i switch the look at between the various enemies but it becomes impossible after a little number of targetsresorting to the overview with its lagged and sporadic changes is not enough and also the overview is hard to follow when theres more than a handful of ships in the encountersolution to follow the situation visually have all the ships around you show a vector that points in the direction where theyre going with a length relative to the ships speed a speed vector this permits at a glance to see where everybodys moving to even if zoomed outpossible variants smoke trails the problem is that smoke trails disappear zooming out i want this to be visible at large zoom levels to help small gang warfare the two dont exclude each other also a vector should cause much less performance issuespossible problems lag server side lag none the vector is a client only thing the client builds it based on info it already gets client side lag possible to avoid it completely add an option under graphics in the esc menu to remove the speed vectors crowded overview possible it can be avoided adding options that show and not show the speed vectors based on the friendlyunfriendlyin fleet status of the ships in the overview settings

sounds like a good idea anything that provides more info in combat while being able to be adjusted and toggled off is welcome in my books
they removed some far from all the one im more worried about right now is the insurance price floor which most emphatically has not been removed
this ship class would be meant to be the premier ship to be flown by bonus givers and fcs to cordinate fleets with it would not be the size of a capital ship but larger than a battleship it should have a really nice tank and ability to enhance thier fleet via bonuses like the current fleet command ships but with some added featurescurrently titans have nice bonuses ie erebus 75 bonus to armor amount per level when in fleets but very rarely are actually used for that purpose so the same bonus but a smaller buff like 45 per level would come with this ship along with some others for fitting gang mods and ability for antisupporthere is my idea for say the amarr flagshipship name insert something terrifyingslot layout8  high5  medium7  low4  turret hardpoints0  launcher hardpoints3  upgrade hardpoints400  calibrationamarr flagship skill bonuses5 bonus to gang members capacitor recharge rate and target painter effectivness per level each race flagship would get the painter bonus to put on the primary target3 bonus to effectiveness of armored warfare and combat links see below on description of combat links10 bonus to medium energy turret optimal range and cap usage20 bonus to medium energy turret damage per levelrole bonus99 reduction in cpu need for warfare link modulescan fit 4 warfare link modulesalso the ability to store the spoils of war and some emergency backup ships for the fleetcorporate hanger capacity 2500 m3ship maintenance bay capacity 250000m3on another aspect of bonuses i would like to see the following gang links introduced i tried to think what was the achilles heel for each races primary damage weapon and thought a link that would slightly buff that would be interestingcombat warfare linksturret cap usage  reduces capacitor needed to fire turrettracking enhancing  increases turret tracking speedoptimal range  increases turret optimal rangemissile impact  increase explosion velocity of missilesall the combat warfare links base bonus would be 1 with max skills of the flagship and other leadership skill putting the bonus up to 129375the flagships could only fit medium sized weapons to get the bonuses so it could be helpful for antisupport as far as power grid and cpu it should be able to fit 4 heavy medium weapons 4 gang links 100mn mwd and a pretty good tank cost should be equivilant to say 34 tier 3 battleshipsskills required should be the races bs lvl 5 command ships 5 hac 5 some other large size ship related stuff in order to train for the flagship skill itselfin closing it should not be a solo pwn mobile or even worth flying if a gang is less than 50 people in comparison to the isk to field it it is not jump drive capable can use gates and warp speed should be slightly slower than a bs this is probably over powered but some constructive feedback to make it more realistic would be apreciated
my idea is meet with silence
because it is a bad idea
like every aspect of it
the issue there its that trackingoptimal link are usefull for all turrets cap usage its usefull for hybrids and laser whille explosion velocity its the only one usefull for missile and wortless for turrets if the ship its suposed to be used in fleet let someone else use the ewar and let the flagship use the slot for something more important for its role like tanking for the caldariminmatar variants
you seem to be speccing out fleetcommand battlecruisers with gang links we already have those if you want more fleet command ships give them a genuinely different role than the existing fleet commands have for example a t2 battleship that gives flat titanstyle bonuses to everyone in gang whether theyre a booster or not im not sure how youd balance such a thing but its the sort of idea you would need for them not to be too samey
v
can we get the t1 destroyers fixed ie make them worth flying as anything other than salvaging vessels or easymode l1 mission boats before we start worrying about inventing new t2 versions
yeah this would be very handy supported
very much supportedi would also suggest1 making what is now a very small sliver of green at the top of the module to toggle overload by left clicking much larger 2 make the modules show a different color when its overloaded there seems to be a lag or something and often i find myself squinting at the module tryign to tell whether it is actually overloaded or not just make the mod glow yellow or blue purple or orange whats with the slightly different shades of green to indicate its overloaded
yes which is why a selfcleaning ban list would be good save your real block list for harassment and scammers use the 24h block list for mildly annoying people and for people who are going to disappear soon enough anyways i proposed basically this a few weeks ago but i can support this version too
tldr buff gallente plzpeople have been whining about gallente being subpar for a while now myself included however everyone seems to cite blasters as the root of all problems i have a new proposal involving less changes to hybrids and more to the race shipline as a wholemain different out of the way now lets give gallente flexibility by increasing drone capacity and usage all gallente ships should be able to use drones even if a very minor amount and they should have spares or extra sets blasters are severely limiting and most people seem to think they would be happy if they had a huge damagetracking buffi am less convinced i think we would still complain that the amarr ships are killing the target before we get there that the caldari torps are beating us up before we get to optimal and that the minmatar are moving too fast here are some example stats for the ship sizesall frigates  1015mbit bandwidth 2030m3 dronebay ishkur gets 25mbit 75m3all cruisers  4050mbit bandwidth 80100m3 dronebay vexor gets 75mbit and 225m3 ishtar stays same maybe some buff to allow guns to be used easier phobos gets 25mbit and 50m3 possiblyall bccs  50mbit bandiwdth 150m3 dronebay on the brutixastarte 100mbit and 300m3 on myrmidoneosall battleships  125mbit bandwidth 250m3 dronebay for megahyperionkronos dominix gets same bandwidth but 450m3 dronebayi think these changes alone would get gallente in a much happier place many people have said gallente also need a tracking buff so they can operate at optimal while i agree they need a slight buff so that hybrids are better than projectiles for tracking it would be foolish to buff them too much and allow larger ship classes to engage smaller ones easier one definite change i think would be a capacitor usage reduction on hybrid weapons between 3050 i fly all the races and its always seemed odd that a skilled up geddon uses as much cap to fire as my megathronfinally for railguns i think railguns need a 10 rate of fire buff to increase damage output and either a 20 optimal or tracking buff beams can hit further for more damage and with higher tracking projectiles can hit for huge alpha strikes and use no capacitor railguns are nothing
ccp hates gallentesad but true
i wouldnt say ccp hate gallente  the nerfs that have come our way have been understandable for the most part but as the game has become more midranged combat we have been left behind in our rigid ship design
i think youre approaching this from the wrong angle gallente have issues not as many as some people like to claim but its nonetheless true the solution to those issues is to fix them not to paper over them with more drones make damps good again make blasters actually have the highest dps in practice in exchange for all their other drawbacksrange consuming both cap and ammo etc and leave drones the way they are on every ship save the myrmidon and maybe the eosbut the eos is a whole other kettle of fish
yeah this has always seemed silly either highlight secondary jumps in a different colour or bury it in anh option menu somewhere
this is what should be done it can get a bit confusing when plotting multiwaypoint jumps that include deadend systems or returns along the same path i realize the route display helps but it should simply be clear in the overview
makes me insane support very very much
hi after read a loot a topic about invention and mission i have one proposition1 the first think decrease the loot for the mission runner but increase the bounty a little and make more loot type meta 3 or 4if you decrease this loot you also decrease the reprocessing and the ore come from the mission runner in the same time you increase the loot meta 3 and 4 and the bounty normaly for the mission runner that will be not difference about isk2 for the invention now when you miss your invention you have nothing i propose to give a chance to give somethingexemple  when you miss you have  50  nothing 20  bpc meta 1 15  bpc meta 2 10  bpc meta 3 5  bpc meta 4in this case the meta come from not only the mission runner but also about the inventionwith this proposition you decrease the ore come from mission runner good about miner you increase the possibility for the invention
as the author of the other proposal in question i fully agree with this statement seriously while thatd be a decent shortterm fix if there was a real review of drones coming in the next patch its not a practical longterm solution you want them to be as good as the other drones on their own merits not for them to just be cheaper i cant support this
amarr have the most imbalanced turrets comparable drones would just make them brokenalso since no drone boat gets bonuses to a specific race of drone it makes no odds its just as easy to train two levels of gallente drone spec and get a flight of shiny hammerhead iis as it is to get a flight of infiltrator iis
its not like ships once youve trained for a race youre stuck with it more or less as cross training is longwith drones youre about 3d away at any moment from racial drone spec iv so it makes no real differencei do agree that for pure logical purposes it should be something like this that is from left to right highest dps from right to left highest speed  trackingeithergallente caldari minmatar amarrorgallente caldari amarr minmatarright now amarr has less damage and less speed  tracking than minmatar
it is better to say em drones because a lot of people confuse amarr drones with amarr ships as i can see an it is not a boost for amarrs it is a boost for em dronesbut i cant support this way
support for the more hp and a redoing of drones on the long term
it makes senseperhaps it would be possible to add a comparison to market row so you could see what items would sell for considerably less than market price
if youre dumping that much stuff then the chances are you arent simply selling to buy orders i would expect that most power sellers wouldnt be interested in this because theyd have no control over lowball buy orders on low volume itemsif you have a lot of stuff to sell and you really dont care what price you get for it then it would almost always be better just to melt it and sell the minerals insteadi dont support this proposal but i am in favour of a redesign of the trading system and improvements to the market ui
funny i came up with exactly the same idea when i was trying to sell off a few l4s worth of goods in amarrmy only addition to the proposed sell all window would be to also include a column displaying the percentage of regional average value cant remember exactly what its called in game but it displays a plusorminus percentage in either green or red respectively so you can more easily identify items you may not wish to sell
the tax column should be replaced with a  of market average column but other than that yes
what about having a limited selection of colours for each race to paint your ship it would cost isk and youd get to select a primary and secondary colour from a limited pallete for the faction of the ship dark greens blues for gallente for example some colours would be reserved for only the alternate versions of the ship t2 navy etcthis would prevent crazy rainbow colours as ccp could limit the colour options to those that work well within the faction while still allowing some variation the database strain would be low as it would be no more than a pair of hex value per shipas for ship art i agree its not a feasible idea as it adds undue strain on the database
all i think needs to be done is adding a few options just like when ou create your character and make the profile picture i mean seriously i dont think ccp put pink hair on any of the options in the profile picture or at least i havent seen anyone with pink hair all i want is for them to finally release the different textures they have for all the ships there are dozens of them and then allow you to choose say two or three of those textures that would change the paint job of your ship if you wanted it all one color you would simply choose all one color if you wanted a black and red ship then you would choose black for one color and red for anotherits not a really hard change the textures are done all that you need to do is make the ui to change the paintjob of the ship and setup what parts of the ships are painted for each selection if you want an example of it what it should probably look like just look at the army painter in the game dawn of war basically just release it in the next major release as one of the big new things for eveno pink ships no neon colored ships just colors that are already in eve
the angle slider used to have equal spacing between the selectable angles so that all  even 15  were easy to select  then someone thought itd be a good idea to make the slider proportional to the angle being selected thereby making it extremely fiddly to select he angles that are closer together at one end of the scale1010 for ui designput it back to the way it was before  equal spacing between selectable angles
hmm and how many times have you been rubbing said persons destruction in his face i wonder sorry but this issue is nothing more than what you called it yourself a mere annoyance for killmail addic err enthusiasts nothing more to itif this thread would be about the completely preposterous insurance claims after a self destruction my opinion would be way different but as it is now i cant support your idea
oh god yes pleasei also agree regarding adding align to in place of approach on distant objects for both the shortcut as well as the interface button as well as shortcuts to each overview tabi wouldnt object to key bindings for launching drones either

while i agree that csm members should set their cspa charge to 0 this is by no means required the job of a delegate is both an ambassador a liaison and an idea filter and therefore i think communication with the delegates is essentialthat being said as a democratic process you elect the officials with the attitudes and morals which best align with yours and thus you get what you got here in america that principle is proven every election just as with the csmand to the last poster the csm does indeed have some power but people must see us as commanding the very attention of every ccp employee or something we do filter and we can have say in some limited circumstances as to which options do become available or not a la skill queue but we are only liaisons and filters and thus our power is as limited as any other ambassador here in the rltldr rock the vote and elect those which represent you
that wasnt his point the op was suggesting that any csm delegate who didnt have his cspa charge set to an unreasonable level was implicitly agreeing to be spammed by people who are too special to use any of the normal channels such as this forum the csm public channel etcfurther he suggested that having no cspa charge and not agreeing to be spammed by said special snowflakes clearly means that the delegate in question has no interest in communicating with the rest of the playerbaseit shouldnt be necessary to point out the failure of logic in either of those positions
i dont like the idea of people attempting to raise ideas directly instead of using the assembly forum the csm process needs to be transparent so people can see what is being raised and by which players etc suggesting things directly to avoid putting your name to a proposal makes people suspect that there are shady deals going on behind the scenesthat said at least one of the massmails was to attempt to gain support for an already raised proposal thread and not having access to my ingame mail right this second i cant check who sent that onei would also suggest that this type of thread be put in the jita park speakers forum
it was a friend of the op

it is a great start i am not to sure how much work needs to be done to iron out any wrinkles one thing is for sure pattern you sure put a lot of effort into creating a usable set of ships for the minmatar racei am not sure where i read it but to the people thinking that you should need very expensive implants to make a ship tank decent notice i did not say excellent what are you smoking it should be decent before implants if you can not operate it at a decent level without the implants it is broke i am going to say this and i hate myself for it but get a drake it does not require any billion dollar implants to make it goodthere is not one ship here that would not benefit from the changes it is human instinct to resist any change at all no need to think this will have any major negative effects it will simply free up a slot usable for you to better customize your ship to your style may that be ewar gank or snipe that is not a bad thing at all in fact i like to personalize my fits and wish ccp would get rid of a lot of the bonuses i find too many bonuses do one thing only they make a parameter for that ship that promotes cookie cutter setups i for one would like the opportunity to fly ships that no one really knows what to expect when they get in a fight with it this is one step closer to freedom of choice for minnie pilots
thanks for the sentiments ill be sitting out the next race or two though  i havent gotten close enough to winning to make me feel like im doing good things running id rather let good people with a chance get my votes when i get a better vote base than just forumers ill probably take another shot at it but for now ill be on the sidelines watching

i see a lot of people posting in this thread arguing that blasters are just fine but i dont see any of those same people with very many if any kills using blaster ships or kills of any sort for that matterif you dont have solid experience flying blaster ships and indeed solid experience flying most if not all races ships and ship sizes in pvp you have no business posting in this thread zero nonesince dominion i think that the balance between lasers and projectiles is at a really good point lasers are the benchmark by which all other guns are now judged and projectiles now have some unique features like real working damage selection with high damage ammo and improved falloff and tracking and so on the damage curves actually end up being unique enough that each weapon system has its own advantages and disadvantagesthe goal of improving blastersblasters dont need more range thats not their role short range is fine leave the range alone theyre role is to do massive amounts of damage at extreme short range and be able to hit reliably inside this small envelope of performanceboost blaster tracking to whatever point is needed to guarantee hits within their optimal range and boost blaster damage to the point that its significantly more powerful than the next highest dps weapon at that short range probably lasers by about 3545 yes you heard right 3545blasters need to work as well at point blank range as scorch works at long range in other words no other gun system should even be in the same league as blasters when fighting at extreme close range dont like having your face melted off then dont close to within 4km of a blaster ship problem solvedt2 ammo is another issue but t2 short ranged ammo needs to be addressed as well right now the damage difference between t2 gunsammo and t1 guns and faction ammo is extremely small too small in fact t2 ammo needs to have its penalties removed and its damage increased by a large margin so that the combination is clearly superior to t1 guns and faction ammoas an example void should have the tracking penalty removed the longer optimal and shorter falloff make it unique as does the higher cap use but it should have significantly higher base damage than faction antimatter to make up for the higher cap usesimilar changes need to occur for conflag and hailblasters need a lot more tracking and a lot more damage not range we have lasers and acs for range
hey guythe beam as a good tracking ok but look also the need in capa for that the double of the rail gunone weapons is not only dps and tracking but also how its possible to fit your shipin first time you complaining about blaster and now you are in the railgun its not exactly the same weapons
yes for a well balanced but significant dmg boost no tracking boost for blasters it would ruin life of smaller ships orbiting bigger one rendering them useless again

yes having a bigger watch list would be niceas for the broadcasts ccp first needs to fix the broadcasted target icons so that they actually clear off your overview when the target is dead as a person who uses the broadcasted target option quite a bit its annoying as hell to see your overview littered with those s1 s2 s3 bullseyes stuck to crap like planets gates etc because they dont clear off properlyonce the overview bugs are fixed then implement the broadcast target portion
its been brought up before but now with the new titan hp boost and removed by ccp nozhnothing proposed mom hp buffwe are looking at a sheer imbalance between armor tanked and shield tanked titans already are we at a point where titans real tank is in hp alone and now we bring into the mix the balance between hg slaves and crystalseven if crystals worked on titans we would still be looking at an imbalance i dont want crystals touched believe me otherwise its just more of the same and no diversity rather i would like to see slaves brought inline with crystals and not work on cap ships basically with 0 stacking between slaves trimarks and akemonszet5000 you are far surpassing what crystals could even hope to acheive on a shield tanked titanalso bring up the fact that if your a shield tanked titan and you cyno into a fight you are loosing a huge chunk of ehp due to gang bonuses not being applied to shield instatly as it is with armor the larger these tanks get the more glaring this issue becomesi understand for many cap pilots this may be unwanted because you already have those slave setscapitals but honestly you have to look at it from both sides of the spectrum it needs balancedtldr remove slaves from affecting capitals and bring them inline with crystalswhich already dont work on capitals
supporting my own topic 5min later because ccp is too pants meet head to actually moderate properlyprevent trial accounts from posting and instead thinks 5min is enough time to wait with their awesome forums logging you out every other minute
abso fing lutly the difference is just plain silly and terribly imbalanced

i just want the gang bonuses to be fixed equality to all
supported as long as pilots currently flying supercaps will get the option of destroying their implants and being spawned a new unused set for compensationand the issue of gang bonus hp will be brought up soontm
not supported get em to fix crystalls instead of asking em to nerf
hp tanked shield titans have more ehp than armor tanked ones useing slave setsthat is all
and now show me one of those 60m ehp buffer shield tanked titans you can get those easily with an erebus
they cant post
correctionwhile you may be right in theory the leviathan fitting required to beat an erebus  avatar in ehp is so extremely expensive that it can be pretty much ruled out requires 4x estamel invuls and it is far from pracitcal because it has  for cap and no free slots at all the armour titans on the other hand can reach 40 mil ehp with a very reasonable fitting and have a lot of mids to spare and no general fitting problemsfun fact with all mids overheat the leviathan can reach 140 mil ehp
i dont fly titans so just shush me if im wrongbut dont the shield tanked capitals actively tank beter than armor boost amplifiers working for cap modules and nanopumps not working and in fact all shield ships have better active tank but armor is always better for ehp
not much to be said
just in case you missed it local tanking titans now is far from viable given their raw hitpoints you dont get any decent rep out of capital armor reps to rep enough an erebus with t2 trimarked slave implantsakemons implant and bonuses from a damnation pilot with mindlinks has 64m hp armor even without the t2 trimarks and leaving the implantsdamnation we still have like 37m raw hp armor someone mentioned like what 40minutes to rep up from 28 armor without taking dmg

i received a number of requests to change the direction scanner altogether i wasnt aware of this problem but will certainly add it to the proposal
the directional scanner has always been mehbut this bug needs a hotfix its not a game breakerbut it is annoying how hard can it be to properly align the xy screen axis to the camerathanks for the feedbacksupporteditbest way to replicate is find a couple moons reasonably close together not overlapping and attempt to isolate the individual moon or whatever object to 5 degrees
yeah speaking as another member in the ops alliance whoops that we broke up to get into this oh well nevermind involved in metro i find it rather frustrating when on a couple runthroughs of metropolis at around 0500 no plexes could be found most systems in the region nope sorryi actually shifted my sleep schedule around to get in on one of the post dt fleets  fights over plexes got to be interesting small gang stuff fought hard against people with a clue complexes to take so on but then the next day hey i had to go to work because it wasnt the weekend yes work horror i love this game i play it a lot but as im unable to use it to make my car payments or rent without breaking the eula i unfortunately have to do other things sometimes which means my strategic contribution practically nil unless i completely shift my sleep scheduleso could this please have something done
dt is midnight for me i got up this morning at 0500 local and drove around metropolis all day looking for plexes i heard about 2 major plexes 12 jumps away and rushed there to find that they were mission sitesother than that nothingcan we please have this fixedone option would be to do the sorting at downtime like they do now but have them not spawn until random amount of time has passed somewhere between 1 and 23 hours you might need to increase the number of plexes slightly to allow for not getting to spawn them as often
supported with all other broken fw mechanicseven if we are outnumbering post dt it shouldnt be related to downtime
wrong thread
absolutely not this idea was thrown around last time suicide ganking was due a balance the option was canning insurance or increasing response time increased response time was chosen if this is implemented it might stop the 10 buffoons who cut around jita in smartbombing typhoons but it wont stop those of us who do it for real profit or group lulz 4 destroyers cost 5 mil total  1 dead hulk amiriteif you dont want to become a victim then dont allow yourself to become a victiminsurance does need looking at but thats for another discussion
the bug has a very easy fix add the opposed allied militia to a pilots standings sheet that is as far as i knowunderstand the only reason why there is no standings penalty incurred when capturing for the aligned side  you see the same on a corporate level where the corporate standing the average of employees can be manipulated by making sure the employees have had no contact ie no standings entry with a given npc corp
with respect to your bug reportit appears that the defect is simply that pilots plexing for off factions arent receiving the standings boosts that normally accompany plexing as such they can stay immune to npc aggro indefinitely by hiding behind their high standings towards the plex rats it seems that the likely fix ccp would pursue would be simply to provide the faction bonuses to off factions so you can only cap a couple plexes before the local npcs start shooting you again obviously that addresses the defect but does little to address the issue people here seem to be concerned within the system proposed above in which the only thing stopping high standing characters from plexing with impunity are the eventual standings adjustment there still exists a significant loophole which would still permit the behavior that spawned the initial complaint in short the same folks that are willing to alt grind plexes with high standings characters are also likely to be quite willing to use the same alts to grind the timer down to 1 sec before leaving the plex to start another whilst a standard plexing character comes in to finish the initial plex take the standings hitbonus so really such a change only represents a minor cut in plexing efficiency you could have 4 high standings alt plexers  1 standings mule plus a bit more warping about vs the 5 plexers the same personcorp might run now while still leaving the door open for the same types of abusenaturally many people wouldnt consider it worth the effort clearly there are at least a few pilots who do consider it worthwhile or we wouldnt have this complaint in the first placetldr bug fix for plexing standings boosthit makes the plex grinding that folks are railing against harder not impossible keep pushing for a mechanics change if youre not happy with the current state of plexing

well of course he is he and his legion of alts are all well known for using it and if its a bug and therefore an exploit he will need to do a truly legendary amount of asscovering
just finally received a response to my petitionno using offmilitia members is not an exploitthere ccp said it i had a rather lengthy discussion with the gm nothing to be done customer support the guys answering petitions have no influence on this they need some dev to tell them what is and what is not an exploitpervs enjoy the creative use of game mechanics you found and i mean that in the best possible senseit would be great if this complete mess that is fw could be fixed at some point this is getting from the silly to the grotesque

warning sound when a pull bubble is about to take you out of warp away from your targeted warpout point this would be while in warp something just before coming out of warp to alert you to prepare for combat
i do beleive this would be an improvement
supported on the condition that corp bookmark management be made a grantable role so joe newguy cant  up your collectionben
i propose that all turrets and bays with meta 6 and above benefit from weapon specialization skills keep t2 charges exclusive to t2 weapons but the skills that improve t2 guns would have an equal effect on other weapons with a higher meta level than t2 it may be necessary to tweak current damage values of those weapons if they prove to be overly powerfulas more and more systems in 00 are upgraded there will be an increase in the number of these high meta drops pouring into the market it stands to reason that the increase in supply will have a downward effect on priceincreasing the value of high meta weapons in this way may help them retain at least some of their price by sparking demand beyond what it is presently perhaps even making some of these high end modules more likely to be used in actual pvpps please fix rockets
imho norather fix that t2 launcher get lower dps even with spec skills at 5 then cn faction launchers using the same ammo to get higher dps you need to use ragefury ammo
simple as the title suggests eve players should be able to reserve their player corporation and alliance name in the dust514 console game this is necessary to have congruence in all characters in the eveonline universe being controlled by a single rl individual regardless which interface players use to access new edenthis could be achieved in a number of ways with varying levels of restriction for ccp gamesimmersion breaking for one universe players manually choose to reserve names all eveonline names are reserved for a fixed period of months from creation eveonline names are permanently reserved in the dust514 gamethe inverse of this policy should also be applied names created in the new eden universe on the dust514 console should be reserved from usage in eveonlinethis policy should be further extended to all future games used to access the new eden universe
given ccp said both should basically play in the same universe  i would expect that is the case already no
when they first announced it at the gdc europe i spoke to ccp and they hadnt gone so far in their thinking yet  so it isnt already the case we have an opportunity to make it the case if the issue is raised via the csm
it would be nice to see this although i could see a few issues with the numbers of alts with silly names in eve maybe have an opportunity to register your current name or something
yeah im not sure what the exact policy here should be but something is clearly necessary i expect itll probably happen on its own but its best to make sure
dear ccp please revise the buddy list from the current onecolumn model to a twocolumn designone column on the left would be for usernamed folders and the default all buddies folder a second column on the right would be for folder contentsthis would allow for practical management of buddies the best example would be as followswhen the eve client undergoes a major upgrade such as to apocrypha or from apocrypha to dominon the player generated folders are lost leaving one list of all buddies only recreating folders in the present onecolumn system is very impractical in that once a new folder is created and by the time a player selects a buddy in the list and attempts to drag the buddy to the new folder the buddy is no longer visible by having folders on the left and folder contents on the right this problem of organization would be eliminated organizing could then be done by dragging the buddy from the right column list to the appropriate folder in the left columnthank you
reservededit 20091216this thread has nothing to do yet with the buddy list taking so long to load that players think it to be brokenunderstanding that desktop space is at a premium the buddy list could eventually be removed from the people  places tool and added as a right column tab within the evemail tool first things first though edit 20091218heres a related thread issue people and places interface is terrible add send to folder
also annoying how once you have a certain amount of people in a particular folder it can become impossible to move them as you cant reach the other folder when your list extend well beyond screen heightbeing able to reduce the size of entries would also be nice something around the size of when you put items in list view
quite often while running missions lvl 4 i will have interlopers scan me down and start to salvage my wrecks this is theft pure and simple if i take action against these thieves then concord will and has destroy me this makes no sense because often the salvage is equal to or is more than the worth of the loot pilots are stealing from mission runners without those mission runners having the means to stop the theft or react to it this is a loop hole in the way high sec is intended to work and it needs to be changed now
waaaaaaah it is this late in the week alreadysalvage is not yours the loot is salvage is owned by the guy who salvages first you are late well bad luck get over it its a few hundred thousand isk at most compared to the millions you made in the mission
while i have plenty of opinions on ninjasalvaging the most relevant one is that i think its completely fair game here are some ways that you can prevent or respond to it1 bring a friend to salvage for you2 equip a tractor and salvager on your mission ship3 warp out of the mission and come back later4 shoot the wrecks5 if you can tank the damage just stop killing things and wait until they leave6 if someone steals loot and youre confident in whatever way you can do it blow up hisher shipi have used any of the above tactics and nine of ten times the ninjas leave and dont come back sometimes you get a persistent one but from my experienceeven in dodixiethese arent very commonso while i can sympathize with the frustration i disagree that salvaging others wrecks should be stealing
by that same logic the loot is owned by the person who loots first clearly a moron like your self who doesnt understand that the very basis of his argument contradicts his point has no place in this forumbegone  ant
1 doesnt change the fact that hes not flagged when he steals our salvage and would just get my friend and myself blown up for trying to stop him2 i have both on my paladin i cant salvage everything at once3 so that all my salvage is stolen seriously what kind of advice is that4 thus destroying my salvage so that no one can have it pure genius5 the point is that because its not a criminal offense concord will kill me if i attack him cant tank concord 6 they are not stealing the loot and im quite confident i can blow up their ship they are stealing my salvage and i cant blow him up for that because its not a criminal offense which is the point of this threadthank you for your comments and your poor comprehension skills
oh rofl cute dnow would you be sad when i tell you that ccp stated that ninja salvaging is a wanted mini profession in this game stated multiple times by different gmssadly i always forget to bookmark the thread with the quotebut i am happy you have a nice colorful languagedwhine more please gets popcorn
that time of the month get your tubes tied princess it wont happen this is exactly the arguement presented for can theft mechanics i can guarentee that within an hour of such a change being made and you firing upon an interloper you will have lost your ship and be right back here crying for a rollbackthis is pretty much as is intended salvage is junk its there for everyone devs have stated it etc etc go and google salvage rights or something
i disagree i should be able you wtfpwn ninjasalvagers if they are dumb enough to get into crosshairs of my 8gunned bs with no transversal give ninjasalvager profession some risk
and then i can watch the ninja salvager wtfbbq your leet mission ship with his pvp ship like that absolution which got pwned by the hurricane commandship would beat t1 bc any time no
dont get me wrong i dont like pilots taking salvage from my missions either but in your rush to point out what you perceive as poor comprehension on my part i think you may have missed that my post was not really advice as much as reasons that i use to support my disagreement with your proposalin sum i believe there are ways to try to protect your salvage therefore i disagree that salvaging others wrecks should be a redflagging or criminal action
see here here here and here for recent assembly hall threads that failed like yours is going toits all been gone over a hundred times already unless you have some new argument to bring other than wahhh i wants it all then the devs will not change their stated policy that salvage beings to the person who creates it from the wreck not the person who creates the wreck
thank you malcanis finally the quotes bookmarked d
the problem with flagging them is that then you can blow their ship up but then they can also come back with a pvp ship and blow your ship up also and trust me their 10 million at most salvaging ship is worth far less than your 150 million at least mission shipif you really want to get rid of them just blow up the wrecks as long as they are yourspersonally my proposal would be to add more salvaging skills into the game this would make it so that a better salvager would get more salvage which would in turn mean that mission runners would basically hire salvagers to salvage their missions since both people could get more out of it
yeah many ninja looters think the same thing looks especially funny when one of them gets instapoped and the second one cannot break my tank and dies horribly to drones or warps off in case he is a stabbed  in more serious mood ive killed lootersgankerssalvagers and can flippers and i got killed by them when i made a bad call its solely my choice if i should shoot him more destruction is good nija salvagers should need to protect themselves and not just print isk and its even better if both sides call in teammates yes some idiot died to a hurricane in a commandship because it was mission fitted obviosly such people deserve to die people that nijasalvage in failfit battleshipsbcs also deserve to die survival of the fittestsmartestpeople with the most teammates
well i was hoping for a bigger ship than a bs but yes something new that what already exist or maybe one that is better
there are two ways to kill a ceptor i think this is by design1 neut it so it cant fly fast2 scram it so it cant fly fastthe other ways they die are because of stupid mistakes see flying directly at a ship for more than a few secondsreally dont need a t2 destroyer to fill the role of interceptor killer as other interceptors do the trick as well as simply fitting large neuts plus light drones
odd i could have sworn youd mentioned at one point that you were going to
not supportedhaving these two very different groups of gamers have influance in the same universe is brilliant and great out of the box thinking that other developers should try to emulate i am sure dust will not be the typical 12yo shooter as i think it will be far too deep and complex for most young players to enjoy
its a good idea and deserves closer investigation
cool story bro
its a terrible idea and it deserves to be put in a bag and drowned in a filthy canal
as much as i am biased against console shooters and i am i am forced to agree with malcanis on this onetake the op and dump him in a filthy canal in game of course the only thing i want from dust for eve the ability to drop rocks on planetskinetic bombardment
the importance and value of dust514s slow and careful integration with the eveonline universe should not be underestimated for not only eve players but for the entire gaming industryit will attempt force the intersections between both the console gaming community and the evemmo community in an ambitious and inspiring vision which will enlarge and enrich the new eden internet space games simulation and places the expense of innovation on ccp games which the whole worldwide gaming industry will be watching for example as an eve online player because of this groundbreaking effort you can expect more topcaliber people wanting to join ccp games which means better overall quality and speed of release for eveonline developmentsccp have already stated that they intend to integrate slowly and carefully between the two games so the starting point of dust514s launch will unlikely be integrated and the integration will appear over time ccp are very conscious of the fact that the need for balance and nondisruption of the eveonline universe is paramount in their concerns for realizing the vision
crap i just neural remapped and realized i put too much into charisma next remap available in one yearthat is stretching it a bit i think i can understand the need for an antiabuse system but its too tight to not allow any neural remaps for an entire year especially considering the additional money ccp could be making if they allowed players to either purchase neural remaps for real money or ingame money
check twice check again click onceim against giving wealthy irl or ingame players additional training benefits
not supported reasons see above
you know i wish we could just get a neural remap every 6 monthsi just find that to remap is generally useless due to the 12 month intervalid support changing this to every 6 months or perhaps there being a reset to default option always available
choice  consequencethis is the heart of what makes eve  wowyou make your choices and then you live with the consequences we dont need the option to make the choice more often you need to exercise your ability to make a better choice
this no micro payment stuff in this game please
quoting my self from the last 100 threads about this issueand once again no
as it currently stands interceptors generally cannot catch other interceptors who immediately jump into a system and warp to zero toward another location due to the agility and sig radius of the target shipsthe situation is largely similar with other classes with some cruisers able to catch the slowest cruisers and some bc able to catch the slowest bci believe that scan res should be increased on most ships by 1020 to give the average to above average tackle pilot a reasonable chance to catch hostiles that decloak within 24km of them and attempt to immediately warp
i am inclined to say no given it is a team game  bring a friend
i wouldnt be that sure gank sucks i prefer honorable 1v1 pvp
if youre unhappy with your scan res fit a sensor booster or its low slotrig equivalent all ships can do this not supported
small interface change to the skill training queue to show all skills that can be added still staying in the 24 hours limit without bumping the last skill off the queue this satisfies the strategyintent of the dual skill training proposals it easily enabling players to set a longskill training and then easily insert smallerlength skills to the queue when they are at the computer it is manually achievable today by dropping the long skill from the queue finding skills that fit into the timeframe adding those up to 24 hours then readding the longqueue item
you dont have to drop the long item just start dragging the new skills to the top of the queue until youre happy and mash apply
edit updated the minimum effort the ccp conference is a 12hrday jobi dont agree with the reason for the op however i have to agree the job description should be changed to highlight the benefits of an otherwise task with no other forms of direct compensation the small perks at least if you run in summer should be highlighted to get more interest in the csm total list of perks free flight to reykjavik hotel all inclusive for 3 days for csmccp conference free flight to reykjavik hotel all inclusive for 4 days for eveonline fanfest including exclusive csm fanfest stuff 6 months free game time added to your accountconditions limit to maximum 2 offers per person in their lifetime flights are from your home city anywhere in the world includes all meals alcohol not included except fanfest includes beer ticketsminimum effort required is 116hrs 13 x 6 hour chat sessions plus 36hr ccp conference  2 hours lecture at fanfestminimum effort for chairman and secretary is 168hrs member 13 x 4 meeting minutes and organizationwriting it all up i think it makes a lot of sense for people who live in the southern hemisphere and want to come to europe since the travel routing always requires via a major us or eu city

this post is full of win especcially make damps good again make blasters actually have the highest dps in practice in exchange for all their other drawbacksrange consuming both cap and ammo etc and leave drones the way they are
my whole post was about gallente need flexibility that we lack minmatar are playing with kiting and falloff depending on targets amarr are switching crystals and managing cap throughout the battle caldari are either keep range to prevent tackle or charging to stop frigs from speed tanking gallante just seem to charge in headfirst with no real different tactics either you get to range and put everything on it or you flee plated setups make gallente even more of a bore to play all you guys seem to want is ug me want bigger club stomp on heads of brown ones drones give every gallente pilot something to constantly be micromanagingdamps arent that bad all the specific damp ships need is a bit bigger of a bonus 75 or 10

i would prefer yellow for the next hop and orange for other gates on the same path
autopilot is the lazy mans last resort to get to a destinationhonestly you shouldnt really be traveling that way unless you are using apthat being said i see this duplicated when you set an ajacent system as a next way point even though your destination is in another direction so you get the dual yellow gates if you get that its like coming to a fork in teh road pull up a map and decidenot supported if mainly l2know your destination and not wanting to waste ccp dev hours on something like this
thisa low priority this may be but a small ui improvement is still a ui improvementben
so youre one of the hardcore players who memorize the entire route instead of having the ap highlight it for youi guess youre also reloading your ammo one unit at a time
bright yellow for current destination and darker orange for secondary waypoints would clearly provide better informationthis should be trivial to implement and improve ease of navigation tenfold
i support this
i disagree to both suggestions of your post first the reduceremove meta 0 loot has been suggested many times even once by me to do this you would have to first make mining more interesting so more people would be interested in doing that during my term on the csm we discussed mining indepth and ccp are going to look into it hopefully sooner more than later as its a huge hurdle to the pve side of the game mission running affects and manufacturing is affected by mining when this happens your first suggestion will be valid and even valuable but not until thenthe second suggestion is also lessthandesirable invention is meant to be an allornothing event which is why its sometimes risky and decryptors are needed this makes it less risky and thus throws the whole balance out the windowdont get me wrong im not saying your ideas are worthless but just that they need some work before theyre even considered best of luck to you though
wis is a complete nonstarter for me you need to make isk in this game and i cannot think of any way to legitimately make a million isk per hour sitting at a bar unless it involves gambling it sounds like a massive waste of timethere are a thousand things that need to be worked on before ccp goes off on a wild goose chase that will add nothing of note to the gameplay but if theyre going to waste resources developing it i hope they dedicate a few servers in the cluster to it so those who want to play their little space sims games wont affect the rest of usthe whole concept is pure fail im not being negative im being realistic
i also believe forum censorship should be topic but perhaps broadened into the category poor communication by ccp with player base or simply ccp communicationto censor a post that simply states free abernathy i find disturbing i might understand extreme foul language or threats etc being removed but innocuous protest statements by players being removed i also believe a number of players stated major well considered posts were removed entirelyi think communication should be a primary subject especially for csm representing the player base why because if one party can simply decide what to listen to and not listen to  or even if truthfulness of statements being made by ccp cannot be challenged  then there really is no point at all in having player representation or the csm itself  or even forums where supposed communication between ccp and player base take place communication has to be present and valid it shouldnt be just be some kind of water faucet ccp decides to turn on and off at will there is not much to gain from that type of communication  if thats what ccp wants then they might as well just talk to themselves and forget the player base or csmhere are a few points about ccp communication1 what happened to promised qa between csm  ccp over last months this has been a serious communication breakdown2 statements made in the mother ship dev blog that created such a furor by the player base were outright incorrect such as the use of target painters by cap ships and the assumption of there not being in general close quarter cap ship engagements3 the followup statements by devs in a feedback forum such as the mother ship debacle did not improve communication at all  and in fact because of a bit of flippancy and lack of actually responding to key points brought up by players  made the communication even worse  with more players upset and less information being brought forth4 another aspect i consider poor ccp communication is player expectations i think many players having participated on the test server cap ship testing and providing feedback etc to ccp had some reasonable expectations that dramatic changes wouldnt be done 1 week prior to dominion deployment that sudden changes were made with apparently again not a whole lot of communication such as mother ships suddenly being able to dock at stations etc which shocked many in the player base then suddenly mother ships being pulled completely while all other cap changes were to remain in effect  i think left the players in the state of wtf so here are some recommendations i would make to improve ccp communication1 dev blog statements need to be carefully checked for truthfulness by other parties and more importantly if there is an error in the statements they need to be acknowledged and corrected immediately on a follow up2 1 or 2 followup statements one being flippant toward an outraged player base does not help anyone and just adds fuel to the fire there needs to be more commitment by ccp to respond to issues  maybe an extra staff member just to handle communication if a dev makes a blog post she should be committed to address valid issues being brought up in response to what heshe has posted 3 heavy use of censorship does not help anyone and creates a terrible atmosphere between the player base and ccp whether justified or not there really is not much of a need for it  other than extreme language or death threats type of stuff otw  this is an mmo forum we all know threads can get hairy so what eve online is not a disneyland game and the player base in fact prides itself on being an htfu crowd by using heavy censorship ccp just worsens the sense by the player base that they are getting honest communication4 qa sessions between ccp and csm need to be done and not simply disappear into the void5 better communication in regards to proposed
5 better communication in regards to proposed changes  so player expectations dont get wrecked 1 week before deployment
section 12 of the forum rules stateposts spamming free abernathy etc can be removed under the rules people have agreed to when they login to the forum alternatively they could be classed as trolling and removed under section 7 and some were personal attacks on the dev in question which is against section 6removing spam posts does not count as censorshipit might blur the line sometimes but you cant be outraged about posts being removed that breach the forum rulesi have yet to see evidence of this from eve search or any other mirror taken if this was the case then it needs to be addressed as a matter of priorityi agree that communication needs to be improved and hopefully we can lead by example
hey teadaze thx for response i supported you in the election and glad youre on a seat now gratzin my mind  the problem is not really whether ccp has the right to do what they are doing  ie the rules rules they themselves created in fact throughout history those who have censored or burned books  created rules in order to perform the censorship acts which in the censors mind is usually justified  that imo boils down to controlling the communication of others  for whatever reasonswont get into a philosophical debate over censorship as ive already blogged my position i abhor it  but rules not really problem here its the heavy use of censorship and needless overuse that created a huge negative impact imo on communication and further distrust from the players posting it might blur the line sometimesi think this is the crux of the problem where do you draw the line and who draws it free abernathy  frankly imo i dont see any kind of direct personal attack  only a very common protest statement  and too the point in fact apparently abernathy was taken off the mothership cap development and a new dev or team replaced him and huge changes took place afterward and some gross misstatements were made by the new dev nozh the question by the way of why abernathy was no longer part of the dev team was never addressed players asking that abernathy be put back on the dev team via a common protest slogan free abernathy  is considered a direct attack i think thats a bit of a stretchi was careful in regards to phrasing my statement  other players stated their posts were removed entirely  so you may well be right that this was not the case but this goes to the point  perceived perception of the player base became very negative  as the heavy use of censorship caused much greater distrust and the perception that ccp was not listening and instead of an htfu up attitude was taking a stfu attitude with communicationwe are agreed perhaps as i suggest csm should broaden the question  and instead of limiting the talking point to forum censorship  discuss how to improve communication overall as i pointed out there were a number of communication failures imo that could be improved that will help both ccp and the player base and csm in the long run to make the efforts to improve eve online a goal we all agree upon bettercheers to you teadaze and rest of csm board wish you guys best of luck and glad youre going to bat for the playerso
it is tricky because ccp have the right to do whatever they like on their own site and people have to abide by their rules in practice i see far less moderation here than in other games also posts critical of ccp are frequently left untouched but whilst people have the right to free speech i dont believe ccp have to provide them the service or the audience to do soi agree here i hate censorship and have been actively fighting against censorship software being installed at the local internet providers for a number of years i dont see enforcing the forum rules on one site when you are still free to discuss the issues as you like elsewhere as censorship in the truest sensei dont think it was addressed no but here is where i draw the linepeople just posting the same slogan free abathur and nothing else breaches a couple of the forum rules the no spamming one being the most applicable there were also people wanting nozh fired people being very nasty and generally bordering on real life threats diaf etcthen people started comparing post counts between the official forum and eve search and claiming heavy ccp censorship this was a totally failed argument but some people went with it because they love a dramabombi dont know if abathur was taken off the team or what the reasons were for the changes being backed out but the fact so many people had their expectations neutered was obviously going to end badly and i cant believe ccp did it lightly i hope we will get an answer when we visit ccp if not beforethings have got to the stage where i can claim ccp deleted my post and have people foaming at the mouth over censorship regardless of the actual reasonthis is not a good state and needs looking into i hope to talk with people at ccp about this issue in febthanks for your support
although our priorities were very different i liked seeing a pardon the expression carebear candidate with a good programme and clear goals as a forum  extraordinaire myself i will advise you to be very active participate in the discussions regarding the current csm bring up ideas and help improve the game that way you will be seen by many greatly improving your chances for next time especially over those that just say industry hurr durrr
congrats sok hope you do a great job used all my votes on ya

how bout adding another slot for missels or rockets and please upgrade the pg a little anyway
im not an alliance type dont have the time tbh but i fully support the idea of alliance members being able to get nose art considering the military history of this form of artwork and further considering alliance fees supported
im not sure if thisll ever affect me but i see no reason not to implement it it adds flavor and fits well with the style of the game
this is a long standing problem currently players are unable to simply check the war target tick box and have any and all war targets show up on overview regardless of their other existing standings or status such as bounty or security status etcthe same issue exists with other types of standings you cant have negative standings show up on your overview without also adding neutrals this is a huge problem for a large number of playersplease change the coding so that were able to have a target set that has one of any of a set of attributes instead of requiring all possible attributes to be checked i dont know if im articulating the issue accurately if you need more clarification please askthanks in advance for fixing this problem
yeah super annoying problem forever

get on this alek or i want my 190385183 votes back
this is how i set up my overview to make sure that i know exactly who is red and who is not1 get somewhere safe in space undocked2 open overview settings right click the little triangle at the top of your overview3 select appearance tab4 select colortag tab under appearance5 find and select pilot is at war and click move up at the bottom until is at war is at the very top6 right click on pilot is at war and then toggle blink this makes them show up in local better7 move up and toggle piolot has horrible standings and bad standings to the 2nd and 3rd top spots8 move pilot is in your fleet in your corp in your alliance and high standings to the 4th 5th 6th etc so these will show up above things like outlaw which only matter with neutralsdont forget to save the profile
there are also ways to set up an overview tab that only shows reds andor war targets and not blues or fleet members or a tab that only shows fleet members great for logistics or remote rep ships evemail me if you need to know howfinally when in fleet battles it helps to sort the overview by name and not distance because it makes it much easier to find the primary being called by the fc
its so hard to tolerate stupid people i know how to set up my overview perfectly well its insulting for you to make such a post as it implies that you think i dont know what im doing and that im incompetent only a complete ing idiot would think that i havent thoroughly analysed the situation before making this postclearly you dont fight empire wars or have never come across the issues that all ultra skilled players come across when theyre trying to get precisely what they want out of their overview settings otherwise you wouldnt have made two posts trying to help me with my overview settingsto reiterate the current issue it is impossible to simply check war targets and have the said war targets show up without assigning negative standings to the war targets and then checking war targets and players with horrible standing as an example in order to keep neutrals off of the overview while still keeping war targetsthe issue is compounded when you have players with different types of security status bounties and all sorts of other small differences furthermore the current work arounds are simply unacceptablei dont want anything on my overview other than war targets its disgusting that you thought it would be a good idea to explain to me how to set up my overview twice
i for one support bellum and his right to facepalm noobs with helper syndrome
yay
after having reread your original post i would like to salute kafkan on trying to be helpful to someone who according to your post had no clue how to simply rearrange the icons to make them suit you better your op never mentioned you only wanted wts showing just that you wanted them showing and he put forth his time to help you achieve that goal seriously if all you can say to those who try to help you is foff then dont bother posting here with any more of your problemsi do not support this topic
the op is correctthe helper is correctthe flame is not needed sorting war targets out of the chaff is damn near impossible even with all of the suggestions pointed out in the subsequent postsin empire identifying a war target on a crowded gate without having show all selected is a study in frustration and if you have wts visible youre lagged to sin because youre also having to parse everything else at the gatetarget is at war should be a trump card if selected it supersedes all other filters whether on or off
blah sorry to have caused you such pain little did i know you were such a sage and experienced pilot
each option needs an include and an exclude option rather than a single tick boxmy overview should only show players that qualify under any inclusion filter and dont qualify for any exclusion filtersinclude excludex   wartargetsx   global criminal  x gang members    neutrals standing like so
this would be wonderful its a real hassle to isolate and display only one kind of target with the current system
not bad

i have heard people get ganked in jita because there are jitaloads of neuts in space on the overview and it can be difficult to quickly see if anything might be at war with you furthermore i have heard there are corps in jita who war dec random alliances in hopes of ganking haulers who dont see them amongst the jitaload of ships sitting at the gate or outside station just what ive heardso it would be nice to have an overview setting to clear out everyone else except the war targets when hauling in say jita
there are dozens of things they could do to the corporate asset and marketing interface that would improve thingsadditional corporate hangars would be a huge helptransparent storage containers that asset usage and fittings system can draw from automatically with appropriate rights to the hangarcontainerconsolidation of pos facilities into a station interface rather than the dozens of individual facilities that need to be micromanaged on a jobbyjob basissorting of corporate deliveries and other assets is such a logical and simple function it should have been implemented at the same time personal assets received its sorting functions
without wanting to spam the poor csm folks but i was just slogging through a few dozen stations with junk ive purchased and i noticed a few things that are just plain brokennotably the group wth is a group size column and the volume column as the items were not modules i could not tell if the slot column workedtrying to figure out whats closest to pick up next just makes you want to weep scrolling up and down that stupid asset list
good ideea sok
agreedr space a repsbest reps
yes to whatever it isconviction i haz it
hell yeah
oh yessss
great idea good work sok
this needs to happen
needs to be at least 5km if not 10km would be just great
i support this initiative make it bigger
much needed change
signed only because sok gave me bum sex
because bumping the titan is teh only thing that keeps superblobs down now if titans woudnt be bumped as much goons would just hop their entire army to the other end of the galaxy in no time and conquer all eve

ok which nubbin spammed it in alliance chat itll be discussed in the sunday meeting
killmails are like isk to a pvper i want to see the implants i kill
makes sense to me
do it
must be that time of the month againweve had the make salvage  criminal flag and implants on killmails plz threads i think all were missing is the nerf suicide ganking thread and well be caught up for this month
not needed not supported
no reason not too i support it
would also mean that the logs would show something when you wind up losing a full set of implants to a desync not that thats happened to me in a while but would have been nice when it did
out of interest what is your argument to support your opinion that they are not neededi think it should be done in order to assist working out isk damage kill  loss ratios in battles
i do think adding the implants to the killmail is a really good idea gives those pvpers out there a few more bragging rightsbut i would go one step further how about adding a new skill under the science section that allows you to harvest the implants from the corpes
supported
agreed ive wondered why this option was here years ago as of now i have to send damaged drones to a damaged group which is really irritating but considering im cheap and hate losing t2 drones yeah
supported
frankly im not sure how this was overlooked in the first place supported
who says it was overlookedit was sacrificed on the altar of efficency probably even before it was fully conceived
also when you scoop and launch a flight of drones and there are more drones available stop launching the damaged onesso if you have 10 drones in a single group or in your unsorted drone bay and one is damaged that drone so long as it is the same type should be pushed to the bottom of the launch quenothing annoys me more than scooping a drone under attack and then not knowing which of my 15 other warrior iis is the damaged one if i just say launch drones that ioneb damaged drone will be the one launched the only way to prevent that happening is to scoop it to my cargo hold which  useless until i can dock  repair
just throwing my support behind this suggestion as well quite annoyingas another suggestion related to drones how about saving the expanded views of the drone window its more than a bit annoying having to expand my drone categories each time i undock and then again when i launch drones so i can see their damage levels
supported
the little message that pops up every single time you place a buysell order thats x value above or below the market average needs to have a method to turn it off just like almost every other annoyance popup warning in the gameplease look into and let us the players decide if were concerned about it
id like to see an option to set thresholds for each buy and sell to displayso i could for example set the sell threshold to 20 and only sell orders that will sell for more more than 20 below market average will produce the warning
yes i find this just as annoyingif i want to place a buy order thats 15000 above market average then i should darn well be able to suppress that message permanentlyafter all people shooting neutrals can turn off the concord warning why cant i turn off a stupid market warning
i see what you did there
just as you might use sugar instead of  when talking with your grandparents or business partners why not substitute  for  for an easy lifestyle alternative
1000 times ive tried to use tilde in game as shorthand and failed
oh yeah
so is ccp going to do this
would love to see this resolved
bump
agreed
more evidence of ccp not fully thinking through the ramifications of the titandd changes they made if it isnt mother ships being the new ultimate dd target it is a change in the way titans are properly tanked sorta thought they spent a bunch of time finetuning everything so it was properly balanced when released obviously not
this problem has been long ignored by ccp it doesnt seem like it should be that difficult to fix here are two possible solutions1 instead of having each plex object set to be of a specific faction and therefore being unusable if it respawns in the wrong system simply have each plex take on the faction that occupies the system it spawns in all plexes will be valid and no postdt reshuffling would be neededor2 when a plex is respawned in the wrong system dont set it to be invalid simply mulligan the respawn immediately keep doing it until it worksfrankly i think option 1 is by far the better yes it does mean that theres a statistical possibility that all plexes will be aligned to one faction at once but this would only last until the plex was run by the other side or died of old age option 2 which is basically the current mechanics but not tied to dt leads to fw being unstable as the plexes for the winning side become more thinly distributed and the losing side become more concentrated
the postdt spawning issue is a unrealisticb leads to many european people with day jobs who would like to be involved in system capture being unable to do so when my partner was in fw he could never find any plexes left by the time he finished work and now i am in it myself i find i spend roughly 3 hours probing for every hour plexing and fightingso yes i would very much like to see a mechanic where plexes respawn throughout the day so we can all have a go
supported but only as part of a major revamp of fw in total as just fixing this one thing for now would then be unbalanced and other fixes need to come in first like the standings reactions of npcsi can at least see the game design sense in ccp making only a limited number of complexes a day spawn for any given area ideally it was to stop a rapid take over from one side who could buckle down and grind for a day which i agree is as badso they should keep the kinds of limits they had in mind but reduce it from a daily pot to smaller and more manageable time periods of say three hours for example where less complexes spawn in that time and they refresh 24 hours laterok that might be hard to follow so back to examples just in casepost dt 12pm gmt to 3pm gmt say 15 plexes are active if they are all run then fine they are gone until 3pm gmt to 6pm gmt where another 15 are activated now say only 4 of them are run by 6pm the other 11 remain and another 15 spawn at 6pm to 9pm so we now have 26 on the field however those 11 left from 3pm to 6pm will continue to persist on the field until 3pm to 6pm the next day when they are autorefreshed and replaced with a new batch of 15 note not at downtime
ya good ideal makes thing easier
dev comment would be nice but ultimately we all know this forum section is here to direct comment to the csm repsso first i would like to see what one of them has to say by calling them out for comment do any of you intend to readdress this with ccp to seek a fix and declare the current use of this flawed design an exploit until the fix graces tq
puts tin foil hat onits almost as if ccp want both fw fronts ruined so they can wait for enough ppl to leave in disgust and quietly close it due to lack of player participation
dont quit arkady i petitioned yesterday as well for a public announcement of this issue the gm said there was nothing to be done as well he couldnt confirm or deny the existence of bug 88013 as its forbidden to disclose internal communications and they cant make a public announcement as this would lead to widespread abuse of the bug  i pointed out the existence of several threads and these 2 assembly hall petitions as the bug being in the public domain he said nothing he could do hes only customer servicesescalated to a senior gm awaiting further developments
not supported keep this feature in the game to generate new and exciting strategic outcomes
what ever happened about this
heres what i dont get you took all the time to write this post but no time to understand the op or the issue it relates to ms eventually killing an untankable unarmable noncombat ship which would die to a gank bs probably given enough time is a little bit different to being alphad by a titan in the one ship that realistically should stand a chance against oneedit  my grandma 
dds cant be used in lowsec anymore so keep your mss in lowsec and go hotdroppingat least thats what im doing
attached to that separate sound channel im thinking of a soundactivated seizureinducing red strobe light above the kitchen sink
kitchen sink remote eve alerts would be greatno more rushing when making coffee dalways thought it should have a flashing red something onaroundover the cap dial areahowever its not easy ui to design with all the other info being displayed thereat the very least a selectable sound channel with separate enabledisable is just a must have
if i turn the sound on its a complete crapshoot what ill heari generally only hear station environment or ship sounds i never hear weapon sounds if i happen to hear other environment sounds gate fire npc chatter they tend to be ear bleedingly loud even with my world and master volume almost on mute  and no my system sound is and has been for years set on 30for 6 years running the eve sound engine has been to put it bluntly hopelessly broken i dont see them fixing it any time soon
thisi enter combat and with my hardeners going will only hear combat sounds intermittently followed by long periods of relative silence the hardeners sounds in dominion are better ie less loud and deep than in apocrypha but still seem to overwhelm the sound channelsas others have mentioned the ambient sounds at jump gates and in stations especially amarr are far too loudoptions to reduce mining lasers separate from combat turrets would help as would volume sliders for ambient sounds overall it seems like the sound engine needs and overhaul though
at least warp drive is no longer as deafening i actually have the sound on again after almost 4 years of playing with it off it is significantly better but still needs work gate fires are probably going to lead to audio getting turned off again in the near future though
uhm wrong page up you go
what is this doing on page threebump for great justice i say
good ideal would be very helpful
the tanking mechanics greatly favor passive shield tanks passive shields especially when combined with a resist bonus become so powerful that they can easily outtank most other ships while still dealing decent dps something an armor tanker cannot even hope for and no this is not balanced by the fact that in pvp the medslots are needed for ew modulesthe cause of the problem is that shield extenders not only increase the shield hp buffer but also increase the hp that are effectivly recharged with each secondother kinds of tanks can be countered rr with ecm armor repairershield boosters with energy neutralizersbut a passive tank can only be nullified by outdpsing the recharge rate which has become very hard on some shipsshield and armor should not be same but as it stands now the mechanic drastically favors the passive shieldso my proposal is to make a change to shield extenders so that their hp bonus does not count to the auto regeneration of shield hp passive shield setups would still be useful and able to soak up lots of damage but not on the ridiculous level they are now
for cruisers1 medium injector  2 medium armour reps will equal most passive shield tanksthats 3 slotsfor the recharge portion of passive shields 4 sprs  2 extenders  and 2  3 purger rigsare what are requiredso a 3 slot armor tank is comparable to a 8 slot shield tankor to put it another way gtfo
sorry but i have to say that you are totally wrong dual reps do not come even close to the numbers of passive shield setups or to put the another way get a clue or gtfo
and where will the cap to power the reps come from please dont forget that passive shield tanks work only on very few ships and it is impossible to utilise it with any sort of cap consuming module
not supported and heres whypassive tank ships pay a significant penalty in outgoing dps to acheive their numbers if you reduced that defensive number then there would need to be some compensating factor on the outgoing end to keep the ships balancedi mean yes i will freely acknowledge that my drake tanks as well as my maelstrombut it also only does 13 of the maelstroms outgoing dps
negative
the drake is a battlecruiser a maelstrom is a battleship also a drake does dps that are comparable to other tier 2 bc while having a battleship type tank that does not even need cap to sustainalso drakes are not the problem but it is becoming a problem when a ship like the myrmidon is often more efficient when passive shield tanked instead of using the active repair bonus other ships with shield resist bonuses have a definitive advantage as well take a look at the t3 cruisers and say again that everything is fine the shield tanked ones are massivly outperforming the armor tanked ones
qq less roll caldari
my rattlesnake utilizing the best possible empire faction stuff capstabledps 611  tank 1980 omninavy domi using 6 dual 250mm t2 and an injector otherwise it wouldnt workdps 577  716  tank 1027 omnitradeoff 100 dps less antimatter range not like the 200km for cruise and 953 tank on the plus side if you go for a decent range there is no dps bonus at all above 40km the domi does lessthats why i fly the snake  same as mentioned when you compare bc against bc and not against bsand it was mentioned that it should be balanced and not nerfed to oblivion the problem in my option are the high stack levels the last 23 steps in passive shield tank stacking really boost the tank through the roof that is why you lose so much tank when you try to increase the dps on such a ship as the drake oder rattlesnake if i remove 3 from 14 modules needed for the mentioned tank to add for example 3 bcs then my dps will go up by like 100 and the tank down by 700so a redesign would be great in my opion to prevent rediculus tank values and bring the dps in line with ships that use an active tank
someone else recently brought up the point that any corp member in your fleet could in theory wander up to your carrier and pop out a ship while this is quite useful it would be nice if we had a bit of added security built into our carrier smasfor example a ship maintenance array at a pos can be set to require certain roles to be able to access it this makes it a bit more secure than an afk carrier especially considering almost anyone in your corporation can join your fleet with a simple link or even with the fleet finder now daysnow im not sure how easyhard this would be to add but a simple popup to the carrier pilot would be great name wants to launch a shiptype named shipname from your sma is this ok and you can click ok or deny the option to turn this on or off could be added under the configure ship optionto take this a step further it would be nice but not required if you were able to allow fleet members to launch certain ship types and deny or ask you about others group them into ship types such as frigates destroyers cruisers battlecruisers battleships assault frigates covert ops interdictors heavy assault ships etc etc etcanyway a little added security to the carrier and by extension mothership smas could go a long way
supporting this because well i can
id like to bring spare ships for my alt as well as corp frigates the lack of security on a carrier sma prevents me from doing this
should have been implemented a long time ago
ok
excellent idea also having a check box to allow alliance members to grab certain ship types from your sma would be useful as well
sounds like a fairly simple but very effective and useful change
i support this idea
thumbs up
i support this product andor service
i certainly like the concept
there are too many goons in this thread but i support this as well
wow there are a lot of goons in this threaddoes not necessarily mean its a bad idea though would be helpful for my orca toosupport
stupid gunes
i see no reason why not
even goons can say something valid now and then whod have thoughtin all seriousness though its about time somethings done about it id rather have a setup window than a bunch of windows spamming
considering goons like scamming and metagaming stuff this problem is probably rampant in goonswarm theres probably a pile of goons on the lookout at any given time to nab ships out of corpalliancemates carriers so this topic is likely a bigger deal for them than anyone else that said it makes sense
needs more options and customability indeed
supporting this good idea and or service
agreed this is a great idea
no there are more important things to be fixedimplemented first musical instruments in ambulation music instruments ambulation
good point
not sure you read the proposal i am suggesting that all high meta weapons turrets  bays benefit from the specialization skills be it storyline faction or officer this has nothing to do with fixing any particular modulea person with larger blaster specialization v will get 10 added to damage of his tuvans officer blasters this adds value to the module it also factors into the decision to use it in combatmore high meta modules in actual pvp and on killmails is good for the game and good for business its also a boost to 00 its only matter of time before you start seeing the price of high meta  officer loot start drooping as 00 systems are upgraded and more complexes are exploited at least this way you slow the dilution of their value and perhaps increase demand
supporting this although id go further and suggest that all meta 6 weapons be made able to use t2 ammo as well
only if you raise the skill requirements for said weapons above those for their t2 counterpart
and is their any logical reason to do so because i do not think so i would suggest letting all guns use t2 ammo since it has its own skill requirements and making the specialization affect all guns whole bunch of problems solved rp reasonit says blaster specialization meaning it should affect all blasters not advanced blaster specialization which would mean that it should affect only advanced t2 guns same goes for all weapon types
thats how it should be
agreedall dust players shall make use of the letter 4 in their names along with prefixes and suffixes of xxxx and xxxx besides i dont want anyone running around planetside doing stupid stuff under the name of wheatgrass
surely if both eve and dust players are expected to use new eden spacebook ccp have thought of thisme gives thumbs up
i endorse this service
there can only be one treelox
pretty good idea supported
surely by definition a pod pilot isnt a dust merc so wouldnt reserving character names break immersionreserved corpalliance names is fine although i suggest that only the names of corpalliances with at least 1 subscribed member be reserved
for the sake of protecting reputations
this is a good point im a little torn on this issue on one side i dont want to see a dust character with the name ive used for all these years on the other side i cant see any pod pilot actually putting boots on the ground in a fight
it should be reserved for a short amount of time i think
yup
bump this feature seems easily done and quite a no brainer it would be a pity if it didnt get seen by the empowered ones and get lost without a chance of being at least discussed just support it plox
1this would encourage me to finally learn how to use that vector data
mass 5000kginertia modifier 1000that gives it a base agility of 5000000 lets go easy and knock the zeros offthe base agility of a vengeance is 495 punisher is 44 and vigil is 322a shuttle is 16do you seriously seriously expect us to use this thing if it has the same align time as a vanilla stabber 54no wonder sleepers wont target it theyre too busy laughing their asses off at its slow ass turnsdelete it gimme snowballslaunchers please
hmm its a solar sailer ship might not be as fast or agile as a ship with actual engines shocking
1 let me put you in a sailboat ill get in a powerboatwhich one of us do you think will turn fasteraccelerate quicker2 take a look at the solar sail tech of nasa yes its not science fiction any morethe ship takes years of constant microaccelleration to achieve an acceptable velocity the agility should have a couple more zeros on itps dont need launchers got launchers need snow
are you tired of using your scroll wheel or simulated scroll wheel to zoom out to 75km every time you undock me tooim not sure whats more of a nuisance zooming out every time after undocking always having to expand the drone ui window folders or the read mission details window popping up from a minimized state without my involvement someone else will please create solution proposals for the other issuesso how about it ccp may we please have an undock zoom range preference setting please ill promise to zoom in at least once a week to appreciate all of the apocrypha graphics polish so long as im a subscriber all of 14 days remaining nowthank you
reservededit 20091228although not changing the original intent of this threed id like to note that such a preference would also be appropriate when canceling the viewing ie reset camera of an object in spaceas an example i used the look at button of the selected item window to view an object i then clicked on the same button to cancel the view ie reset camera what should have been the interior of my ship is what i saw next this resulting view was not at all convenient at a time when large numbers of npcs were trying to kill my ass as usual about seven spins of the mouse scroll wheel gave a more appropriate view of the raging battle
god yes supportedid simply be happy if it remembered my settings from the last time i was in space same for exiting a jump gate as i often find i end up on the other side of the gate with different zoom levels than i entered the gate withthough it deserves a topic of its own i also agree on expanding the drone window this should also keep my settings from the last time i was in space
as pretty as the ship models are i would rather not undockjump and find my ship filling most of the screen when im about to enter combat zooming back out to see what is going on is rather annoying
yes also a right click context menu item to assign buddies to folders in the same way that you can move drones into groups would be awesome additionallyor a drop down in the add to address book dialogue that lets you sort them to a group immediately

anything that makes highsec missioning safer i do not support accept the risk or get more players with you quit whining
you dont even have one support yet and i wont change that
when people steal your salvage they are flagged although why you would put your salvage in a jet can in the first place is a mystery
pah halfmeasures
no
someone should make a wiki or a sticky about the salvaging issue in mission and complexes sub forum i cant even tell u how many half arsed salvage whining post i have seen past 3 months
salvage is not owned by you it is owned by whoever salvages it firstthis has been explained many many times by ccp if it annoys you so put insurance on your ship and 1shot the ers but this issue has been beaten to death and you will not winnot signed countered in fact
and i say yes we can i say no to absolutely secure and effortless and skill less profession of ninja salvaging hell miners have more risk then ninja salvagers and they need to spend alot of time training to make anywhere near the amount ninja salvager makes
what about a compromise remove salvage from hisec rats problem is then completely resolved forever also gives a real reason to go to 00everyone winsor how about my longstanding plan bmake mission spaces losec then missioners can freely shoot naughty salvagers before they can steal so much a single charred micro cicuit
lol
ships via your gunsmissiles loot you created this you own itwrecks via the salvagers salvage tackle salvage if it wasnt your salvage tackle you dont own itoffensive weapons do not create salvage salvage tackle does ownership confers accordingly
this is horrible logic what you kill is yours no matter what ie if i kill a deer that deer is mine you cant come in with a knife and say im skinning and cooking the deer thus its mine look it is what it is its theft so what i agree with the point that stealing salvage is allowed because it offers a mini profession thats it it is stealing but it is an intended game mechanic
wow how did i miss that little gem the first time around p
if you dont have salvage gear on your ship but the other guy does then he gets the salvage cause he made it sure you made the wreak and the loot inside and that is why he will get flagged if he takes the loot but he made the salvage which is why its in his ship salvage is never stolen from an npc wreak get over it and move on
no matter what  really so i explode a persons house and all thats salvageable from their house is mine no matter what  you may not like the argument i used but its currently the argument ccp uses comparing rl to eve fails hard as you have just demonstratedtbh i dont know why ppl bother the only valid arguments about savage so far are really about balance ppl should just stick with that
complete the following sentencehisec mission rewards need to be boosted because
 i save money for my mothership p
i do not yet own one of every ship in the game
my opinion is this 1 why arent ammunition and missiles free i had to paymanufacture them to create the wrecks that are free to everyone where is my compensation for that2 i had to pay for game time to train the skills and earn the isk to be able to complete the missions where is my free game time for creating wrecks and salvage that are free to everyone
if were going to have a truesec mechanic then it should be fixed tldrfix true sec
for those of us who have no clue what youre talking about could you perhaps expand on your original post just a smidgewhat is broken with true sec and how would you define fixed
theres a region delve i believe where all systems have the benefits of the lowest truesec possible regardless of their stated true sec valuesfix would be to bring these benefits inline to the stated true sec value for each systemalternately you could trash it entirely and make all nullsec systems npc benefits as high as what the lowest truesec systems now have
i agree that the stated trusec of a system should be its actual truesec the presence of some npc sovereign systems in the middle of conquerable 00 should have zero effect on the truesec status of the entire region this would result in all npc 00 following this rule as well
agreedand for crying out loud op state your proposals clearly and post with your maini seriously doubt an care bear would have the slightest idea over 00 subjects such as that
i would vote in favour of the true sec status being shown for all systems  rather than the rounded down ones and 00 for all minus
agreedwe have 10 and 0x all the way down to 00 where the numbers just stopit should continue to 0xhonestly empire should start at 10 and count downward with or without the decimal points lowsec would then be 499 down to 00 and nullsec would just count from 001 to 10that just makes things sooooo much more clear
it alt spotted
i have read that selfdestructing your t3 cruiser will prevent you losing sp
they changed it so it doesnt anymore if the ship gets killed just after you ejected you still lose sp
no not for ejecting for selfdestructing
me trains reading comprehension lvl 2yes i agree that self destructing a t3 ship when aggrod should incur an sp loss
my fault i just edited the subject i did put eject in place of selfdestruct in the subject originally anyway now were all on the same page glad you agree

mentioned in this thread positive feedback there encouraged me to repost here
implementing this proposal would involve a traveling salesman problem calculating the shortest route between points without a fixed end is a different process and far less intensive in fact calculating such an optimized path is one of a set of problems npcomplete where no perfectly reliable fast method of reaching a solution for highcomplexity situations is knowntldr  theyre vastly different and even if implemented with much effort this can only be guaranteed within a certain level of complexity and then youll probably have people whining at ccp without understanding why its limited youre normally far better at this intuitively than any algorithm basically and thats part of the skill of being a trader or traveller in your caseedit clarity
actually nothe tsp stipulates that you visit each location exactly once where as the shortest path problem has no such limitation in eve the shortest path from a to b via a set of other locations would still be the shortest path problem  hence not npcomplete and solvable in polynomial time
your objection to the npcompleteness is the tsps stipulation of visiting a location exactly once and the shortest path problem not doing so however optimizing multiple waypoint travel means that you are visiting every waypoint exactly once there are no negative edges and all edges between star systems are equal cost revisiting a location is always suboptimal no because the solution to the shortest path problem from a to b would output the absolute shortest distance regardless of the intermediary set of locations restricting it to visiting that entire set of locations is precisely what makes it npcomplete and do note that the waypoints are not the only available vertices to reach your destination so a shortest path solution need not include any of the waypointsit still makes me happy that i can have a discussion like this in eve as opposed to some games shudder

saw no rational arguments againstreason its important the newbie might use his neural remaps as he figures out what he wants to do first he reconds perception has to win then he prolly reconsiders and makes it intelligencethen as some things changes he might need 1 last remap to get his favourate character going but its going to cost this timeyou could even limit the amount of remaps you could buy within certain timeframesthe important thing is the customer feels happy about his character and that the option to rebuy an attribute remap is fully explored a happy customer is a happy ccp which in turn is more happy customers lets get some thorough thought on this its a beneficial matter for both ccp but also the guy who feels he need another remap here and now
the newbie already has 2 remaps in the first year
thats not an argument against the ability to purchase a 3rd one 
and a 4th and a 5th and a 6thno eve is about decisions and living with the consequences
your going to make remaps so cheap a newbie can pay for them why not just simply make the option to change you attributes every time you wanna change you skill queuein short sry but no if you screwed up your remap then buy some implants to soften the blow and stay out of lownull sec so ya dont lose them
if it should cost ingame money people are smart enough to figure out to buy a plex and sell it for isk if they really feel they need the remap good attributes can save you alot of time down the road so dishing out additional money should seem reasonable for the guy who recognizes this and wants his attributes changed here and nowso my suggestion is either if ccp deems there is a need for more isk sinky make the remap cost x amount of ingame isk or x amount of irl money up front for 1 additional neural remapthen perhaps limit these kinds of remaps within a timeframe of 6 months to maintain some sort of balance element but really i dont really see a reason why he who wishes to spend that extra cash on neural remaps every month shouldnt be allowed toeve is not a skill race if you believe this then you have lost already its about archiving your goals at your desired speed if the remap will help you and you are willing to dish out cash for it then i dont see any reason you should not be allowed to
then why dont you dish cash out for a char instead like every other smart player out thereoh you didnt think of thatcase closed moving onps theres an isk sink already its called dominion
and thus far you havent presented a rational argument for it aside from oops i didnt mean thatmy isk sink are all the faction ships i dont own yetsighs
xxxak is absolutely clueless about pvp anyone who supports him is a fool
i too say no you already have the option to boost sensor and you also have the ability to bring friends
that i agree with sensor booster is the answer the sensor resolutions where carefully balanced to get what we have now
this idea is sound but that still wont prevent cloakers from getting far too close to each other in a mixed battlefield because while they might see the in position icon they cant see the other half dozen cloaked ships accompanying themcloakers in the same fleet being able to see each other would be a much more useful function
staking my claim to his idea from back when linkage
consider the current situation with corporate hangars weve got 10 now but with the increased player numbers larger corporations can easily exhaust the limits of suchperhaps a proposal similar to the overview tab could be implemented for new corporate hangarslimit to 5 master corporate assets tabs mcat and 10 corporate divisional hangars per tabthis would make it more feasable to allow blanket access to a single tab to a title for example corp pilots and within that tab it can be further broken down to ten additional rights rookies squad commanders captains ect rights to grant access to divisional tabs would be an option that could be granted to people with rights to that mcat and would lessen the need for a director to micromanage every pilots access rightsthen that same corp could have a manufacturing mcat or market mcat ect ect and each of those could be sorted more specifically to the jobs that they perform
im not a surgeoni shouldnt need to have mouse control over what seems like a 1x1 pixel button
i keep forgetting to try that reporting feature the squelch idea seems interestingperhaps a splattered egg could appear on the display of the offender as well rendering the effected portion of the screen unusable the local chat ui tool could be dragged to another screen location yet if enough eggs are thrown the squelched players only recourse would be to leave the system via a jump gate the harmonics of which would clear the field of viewunfortunately the eggs on screen would indicate to the offender that their efforts were having an effect
true indeed just takes longer to find things that fit since there is already a convenient show skills that fit in the queue option this is an extension of that useful feature
actually id rather have a dont show skills that are already at lv5 in my skill queue cause i cant train them even if i wanted too option but thats just me
true indeed and of course that is the minimum effort required  the reality is at least 2 x that however it does make me wonder why more candidates dont try from south america there were only 2 this timeack good point i think that promoting the csm is an important however it should be based on making eve better not getting a jolly i think there are good people who throw their hat in if they understood that there was some direct compensation for the effort
two issues that have been going on for a long time now are rockets and assault frigates dierdra kindly raised these topics and ccp came up with a half arsed ab boost that never made it to tranquilitygiven that ccp have responded to these issues then put them on the back burner they clearly see there is a problem bereis there a person amongst the new csm who can take these issues on and make sure they get the same sort of attention that they have been given by the player base
as they have been raised already well get a status update from ccp during the meetings in febrest assured i have both issues on my radar and want to make sure they are still in progress if not already implemented by then

poor horse csm  ccp please put the horse out of its tormentby horse i mean players who are a bit hoarse from all this ranting
cant support this as i do not like the idea of modular poss with limited attachment points poss with highmedlow slots no thanks
fitting slots would be no different then the current pgcpu limits we have it would be comparable to how it is today as to what you could fit on and couldnt the main reason for fitting slots per say was to make modular management easier then it currently is though that can be put on debate in the thread itself if you like please bring it up  also keep in mind this thread is to support the basic ideas in the op post not everything anyone else posts after that though some of it should be considered by ccp
do it do it do it
watch some of the trinity testing videos afic there is an iteron rotating around with red alliances logo on its nose whilst i remember someone from ccp doing the too complex too hard routine they said that about fixing poss so this get my support as well
signedwould love it for corp logos too though since those are produced by the game engine and not outside programs so theyre probably easier
i support this in this day and age its pathetic that you cant atleast choose between aa or hdr
any chance we can keep to one thread for this other corp bookmark thread
supportedbut we cannot allow people to manually edit the parameters as that would mean people could easily make deep safe spots and do any number of weird things 000 anyone should probably just remove the parameters in the first place
nicely done
orplace a check in the boxes you wish to see on your overview unchecked boxes will not be visiblex wartargets  global criminal  gang members  neutrals  etcalso i read the op and understood exactly what he was asking for and it was not what was suggested
the use the the brackets to visually describe the issue is a good one ill try to explain furtherthe current situationif you need to have a war target on your overview you need to do as followsxwar targetxpilot has horrible standingxpilot has bad standingxpilot has bountyetc etcif a pilot belongs to any of those particular groups you must check every group he belongs to in order for the pilot to show upwhat i want is the ability to check which attributes i want to associate with my viewable targets so that if a player has multiple attributes i can ask for any one of those attributes to display that target on my overviewexamplexwar target displays only war targets everything else is off the overview regardless of what their other attributes arewhat is even worse than the war target situation is that if youre only dealing with players with negative standing you cant have 10 targets on your overview without neutrals on the same overview this is an issue of youre using neutral alts to scout and simply want to display only targets that have negative standing set and nothing elsedoes the above help explain the issue further
supported this is very long overdue
x wartargetsx global criminal  gang members  neutrals  etcthe problem with an inclusive list as requested in the above example  is if any of my gang members get themselves gccs they will now appear on my overview and there is no way to exclude them without also excluding all other gcc players around me  which i dont wanti want to see wartarget  i want to see gccs  i do not want to see gang members  whether or not they have gcc include  excludex  wartargetx  gcc x gang membersupported in original reply

it makes sense to have more details on a podkill than just a pod it would make knowing you did the target some financial harm a lot easierfor killboard programmers it would also enable them to properly value a podwhat needs to be shown should be pilot skillpoints to determine clone level costs as well as implants
pointless gloating tool no one shoudl have to share how they set up their implants or their total skill points
implants like fitting and cargo are a valuable asset and therefore noteworthy upon destruction i fully support them being shown on killmails but as soon as that extends to them dropping it becomes a big nono
how about just reveal which clone grade was used when the pod squishedas well as implants ofcits not pointless certainly if i can get a killmail for popping a nuubship or a shuttle i should get a detailed invoice of the goods destroyed when i flashfreeze someone
yes yes pls i like podding people and it is often harder to do than just killing the ship i think its worth showing it on the killmails including the value of the clone upgrade old players need to pay 20m per clone upgrade i think this is a very good idea

since there is probably no easy fix for the whole fw mess i would at least suggest to completly stop all mechanics that influence occupancy until all the loopholes are fixedif the mechanics stay as they are it will just drive more and more people into using one of this loopholes in order to fight against the ones that are using them against themso keep plexes around for personal vp and standing gains by capping them but stop occupancy vp gains and assign a damn team and not just a single person to reevaluate and fixupgrade fwand just stop this loophole competition asap
you may have heard about eg the jc bnd el8 battles in the north latelyit appears that our usual definition of lag has grown to something like not being able to do anything for up to 90 minutesessentially what happened in the past big dominion fleet battles wasforce a was on grid of the incoming gate with roughly 300sometimes even 100 sufficepeople waiting for their enemy force b to jump throughwhat happens next is that force b foolishly pun intended jumped into force awhile most of you would think that the whole system will start to lag and the grid wont load for either side you are wrongwhat happens is that force a is able to happily shoot and kill force b while the latter is rendered helpless without a grid or the possibility to reactwhile this clearly justifies calling it a bug at least some if not all eveonline gms call this a feature that results from the increased amount of players participating in large fleet battles i for one have had a long but useless discussion with gm gruber about this issue while he continually repeated almost the same sentences over and over again i was trying to explain to him why this indeed should be called a bughe was not cooperative my bug report is still open but it seems that ccp is not going to allocate more nodesservers for 00 space or publicly address that they are working on a resolution for this issueplease csm address this issue in an emergency meeting since this will affect all current 00 warfare and politics severely we cannot wait 24 hours for a node to be reinforced this is simply impossible if trying to defend your territory this is an utmost urgent issue we as customers are not able to address this in any matter on our own i have tried diplomatically but all i got in response was there is no verifiable bug like this while others may received slightly different answers we were not able to proceed with our request any further and thus the assistance of the csm is of utmost importance nowkind regards kythrenappendixtoday we had about 400 atlasfriends in y8r taking down a wi stationihub we jumped in with 800 peoplein groups of 300 on a 100au spot after 20 minutes solar bombers found our bridgein spot and bombed us at that time we didnt even load grid

so this is a longstanding issue it needs to be dealt withat fanfest ccp kept harping on about how the api was important to them and they hate taking it offline i even remember vague promises of them not taking the api offline all that much anymoresince dominion we have seen the api taken offline over and over again sure it might be due to an underlying issue and them having to preserve resourcesbut in that case the problem comes down to the api being poorly implemented and rightfully so the api only offers xml if it was done right wed be able to get a json version too without many extra lines of codelets make it simple ccp needs to get the message that the api needs to be looked at we need a new api that we can rely on we cant with the current one the current bouncy ball of an api is an insult to the thirdparty developers together with the limitations that are put onto for instance the mail apiwe want to know what their plans are to keep the api up to the exact same uptime as tq tq is just as important as the api the api is just as important at tq theres no difference its the same thingheres to hoping that the csm will take this to iceland and explain to ccp the importance of a stable api

one step in the right direction but in reality plexing in fw needs to be completely redone because while this would remove the ability to use this for offensive plexing it is still possible for defensive plexing and not only that but also easier since then the npcs actually attack the other side
i miss the days of being able to quickly change between ship view 85 zoom tactical view 50 zoom and grid view 15 zoom this was taken away from us during revelations ii  when it changed to ship view system map and galaxy map and then removed outright some time laterit would be an easy thing to bring back the original implementation and i cant see any reason not to for some of us the current method of zooming in and out is cumbersome and clumsy especially those on laptopsso whaddaya say
no setting for killrighted pilots on overviewthe user just can use the bookmark for killright but thats i think not enough when anyone go to hunt them to high sec because too mutch activity there and when the target jumping trough the gate cant realise too fast which one target is from 50 ships at gatemaybe a plus overview setting should help another background for them or somethingthats not too good if someone just use for them  standing to 30 days when to mutch pilot in killright log
supported of course
makes sense just bundle the killright flag into the criminal flagging systemuntil you decide to exercise your killright the target will always be aggro to you while theyre in a ship
set those pilots 10 in your standing list
when u have 250 killrighted pilots you will set all to 10 and you set all to addressbook and when the 30 days gone you will search 1 to 1 set back to neutral no better if you have an overview settings for killrightsupported
add 1 cap req for missile launchers and drones to shoot while the cap is drained from shipslap a neut on a passive ship and it cant fire anymore now you have a countter problem solved and no more qq
1 rs is pirate faction bs  nid is navy faction bspirate factions ships are supposed to be better than navy factionyour example is like comparing t2 with t12 do you have propulsion mods  tackle mods  cap injector to run prop and tackle mods on your example setups lets see your setups so we can have a laugh  er i mean examine if there really is a issue
i am still waiting for a reply on how 2 medium repairers and a cap injector are as good as your passive tankalso both are faction bs so if you wish you can give me your tank setup for a vindicator just for some lulz face the fact that passive shield tanks are overpowered that is also a fact that it is beginning to influence fw since a powerful passive shield tank takes much less training time then training an armor tank that is not nearly as durable it would also be smarter to agree to a slight nerf since things with the passive tanks are staying the way they are then one day a very heavy nerf will be incomingremember stacking nerfs on damage mods and rather heavy changes to all speed mods the ecm nerf or that sensor dampeners where nerfed to oblivion that is what might happen to passive shield tanks one day
well a passive tank without tanking rigs is  and so is the active armor tank without rigs
no dude  your the one living in cloud cuckoo land where you think shield tanks are currently better then armor tankslets see some realistic setups from you  as you are the one proposing changeif you dont even understand the difference between pirate faction and navy faction then you need to go back to square one and start again
passive shield tanks are only good in level 23 missions youll excuse me if that doesnt scream out for a nerfbat to my mind not supported
i assume that this means that shield extenders will now add the same number of hp as similar sized armour platesif so supported with gustoplease confirm in order to receive your support

yeah better security would be nice divisionalize smas if nothing else that said a tip anchor a spare sma leave it offline with your ship inside when you want to use it online take ship out put ship back when done offline that way you limit it to people who have onlineoffline rolesfuel tech or starbase manager whichever you prefer instead of just anyone
supporting my own proposal
i dont think the spec skills should apply but i do think that the guns should be balanced around the fact that they dont im pretty sure that the faction gun stats were mostly set before t2 guns even existed so theres certainly room for improvement not supporting this proposal but i do agree with your broader point
based on the back story pod pilots have incredible amounts of power so i dont think its a stretch to say that we could make it so no one else would have our name dirt side

correct me if im wrong i thought higher inertia mod was better my machariel for example has an inertia mod of something like 0015 while my rifter is 3 or higher a shuttle 1and the tiny signature radius isnt  its got the same sig as a shuttle or small drone which are laughably easy to probe down the sig should be reduced by a factor of ten
seriouslythe sailboat in both examples you dont sail much do younasa science facts vs 20000 yrs advanced science fictionyoure wrong good sir a shuttle is far more agile than a rifter btwa ships agility is the product of its listed mass and inertia modifier and will always be in the millionsfrigates have much worse inertia modifiers than battleships thats because they have lower massinertia modifier  mass  agilitybs agility  12 millionfrig agility  3as an examplezephyr  5000kg  1000 inertia modifier  agility rating 5 millionshuttle  1600000  1  16vigil  1080000  322  348vengeance af  496worst bit vanilla stabber is almost as agile as the zephyr and a fleet stabber is more agile stabber  114mill kg  48 inertia  5472fleet v  981mill kg  445  4365why give us a gift this slow and hokey do you enjoy seeing the whines of all the morons about to get suicided snowball launchers please
hah wow i didnt realize that they would suck quite so muchim sure that what were seeing in the current show info is going to probably change just before they hotpatch them on the 18thhopefully theyll make them smaller in sig radius than a shuttle and as nimble as a pod otherwise theyll get probed in 6 seconds flat and unless they have a sizable sleeper escort theyll die in 2 seconds to a helios one droneas for the probe launcher will it be identical to a standard probe launcher im seeing that rof and scan duration is identical no boost to probe strbeing able to scout a sleeper site unmolested is a small saving grace but as easy as it is to probe not enough of one imonow give them immunity to aoe as well as targeted warp disruption effects and theyd be more than worth their weight even with a mere 10m3 cargo
id love to see a sailboat that accelerates faster than a ski boat  would be great fun
am i the only one who is a little confused about how a free ship can possibly be underpoweredlook it could have been worse they could have given us all luxury yachtsbut yes snowball launchers rule
the align time is understandable the only thing im upset with is its sig radius i was expecting maybe half or less
interesting  you are complaining about a ship you will get for free if you dont like it just contract it to me after 18th december
i wont be happy unless i can fit a dd on itseriously though might be nice to have some bonuses on the probe launcher im curious why no one else is jumping up and down pointing at the mass you could fly that ship through a wormhole a million times without destabilizing the wormhole is it seriously only 5000 kg where do you see the specs on this thing

also when you jump through gates the number of times ill have my camera inside my iteron is starting to actually get kind of disturbing nobody wants to see clipping planes
look im the universes biggest carebear and im not supporting this now if youd said that stealing in a mission gave a 30 second warp disable effect id be all for it no i have no idea why suddenly the russians seem to be fascinated by stealing cap boosters but apparently they are
so if you destroy a players ship you have loot rights on that wreck rightoh wai
it would drive malcanis right around the bend i have to disagree with the op becauseccp has covered salvaging in detail if you had looked you would have known thisdont mission in hubs when i missioned i was never ninjad because i stayed away from busy systemsop sounds whiney enough reason to disagree right there
i am surprised that  with those cheap rig prices  people still salvage wrecks
that compensation is usually called bounty mission reward loot and if youre doing more than 2 dps also mission bonus rewardin those same wrecks go fit a salvager like the rest of usi may not like the fact everyone can steal my salvage intended game mechanics or not i shot the rat i took the risk i should get the rewards not someone with 3 days training for a destroyer and salvager if i hadnt shot the npc there wouldnt be a wreck to salvage hence the feeling it is mine but not everyone agrees with me on that p as the salvage is a rather large part of the reward but ive seen too many threads about ccps endorsement to pipe up palso why does everyone mission in the same system this whole problem would go away if youd just visit eveagentscom and find a better system to mission in
that salvage and loot wasnt on the screen before i shot the rats and created it it is additional compensation for my game time im simply saying that why isnt ccp compensating me to create these wrecks since they are generous enough to give them to everyone are their efforts more important than mine that it is given away is their money better than mine since i developed my toons to create iti dont want to fit a salvager to my ship i want to be able to decide for myself if i let everyone have it by turning in my mission as the mechanics should work in the current system it is free to everyone because ccp says that it is i want compensation from ccp for the real life money and time that i spent getting to the point where i can create it i could also use compensation for the modules and ship that i use in additional to the ammunition and missiles i am basing this compensation on their generosity of virtual wealth and ability when i complete a mission and return to the site with salvage ships and everything is gone and there are four to six players all red cleaning out the next room i have a major issue with that i created this and should be compensated for what ccp allows other to take to every man according to his needs from everyman according to this talents carl marx founding father of the cccp
no stealing salvage keeps the salvaging profession alive so you will have to deal with it yourself instead of whining for it
i agree with this if you shoot a rat you should be rewarded in some way perhaps ccp should look at giving an ingame reward for shooting rats perhaps in the form of isk perhaps these ingame rewards should be displayed when you click on a rat so that you can see how much each ship is worth before you shoot itanother good idea would be to have some kind of quest system where an npc asks you to kill a particular set of rats and would reward you with isk and loyalty points if you were successful  perhaps you could even get an additional amount of isk if you do his space quest within a certain amount of timeas it stands we have brave and noble souls like cletus deadman shooting rats for absolutely no rewards at all purely out of a selfless devotion to keeping the spacelanes free of danger for the rest of us sir i salute you eve needs more like you
you can absolutely be compensated come back in a pvp fit and blow up their ships then you can loot probably half of what theyve taken in addition to whatever their ship dropshell then you can even salvage their ship
please tell me how is letting mission rrunners pewpew stupid people boosting missions i have heard this argument numerous times and i have never understood how more bloodshed is a boost to mission runing i would love to do that but most ninja salvagers are in noobcorps and dont have the guts to take loot
you can absolutely be compensated come back in a pvp fit and blow up their ships then you can loot probably half of what theyve taken in addition to whatever their ship dropshell then you can even salvage their shipagain my point isnt that i can take back what is mine my point is that the redistribution of wealth my wealth deserves compensation for my real money since it is generously provided to all by ccp if a player exploits it is called a violation of the rules and the punishment can result in banning what is it called when the exploit is policy by the game designershow is providing to all what cost me a viable policy
as usual i vote noif the mission runners are so adamant and protective about their wrecks then theyll stop whining and take things into their own hands by bringing a salvager in a high slot instead of an extra gun or make a salvage alteveryone gets to salvage wrecks get it through your heads already
op  baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawtake a hint  go whine somewhere else or travel to lowsec
i see your point and i think the root of the disagreement is in determining what is rightfully yours and what isnt within the game worldwith respect the only thing that our real money monthly fee gets us is the right to log into eve and control our characters what we do with that ie the isk we earn the salvage loot and ships we acquire and the prestige we gain as we make a name for ourselvesnone of that is deserved its taken in competition with all the other players out thereso if someone tries to take salvage from your mission then either you have to come up with a way to stop them or get it first or well its gone
yeswe are communicating on my exact point there are two types of people and two types of policies in this world and in eve there are providers and consumers there are progressive and repressive policies like in life consumers are always provided by progressive policies while providers are hindered by repressive policies eve encouraging the salvaging profession is a progressive policy towards consumers the people that salvage and loot from others from my prospective eve has made me a provider by a repressive policy since my prosperity is allowed to be taken by others and this was not by my choice to this point exactly nothing is deserved i used my play time to progress through training and isk for ships etc and my reward for it a repressive policy that consumes my prosperity to give it to others we care more we work harder the ccp staff wwwccpgamescom
i asked about kill rights on salvage during the dev meet and greet in vegas this past may the answer i got was salvage doesnt belong to anyone person so anyone can take it meaning there will be no kill rights on salvage ever and has already been brought up by previous csms

and what would happen with a fleet command or a t3 
ohhh shussh up and remember that we fremen have a saying god created arrakis to train the faithful one cannot go against the word of godsorry couldnt resist
command shipsthese even say fleet commandif youre worried about their tank you should try killing one sometime they can be fit to have 90 resists in a fleet with reps that is as close as you can come to invinciblethe bigger version is the carrier you can fit a command link bigger still would be the mother ship that no one would be caught dead in get it i made a pun right now do to the new dd bigger still is the titan though rarely used in that capacity it would also be conceivable for an fc to fly a rorqual or orca both can fit 3 links and both could grab loot for distribution after the fight not the best choice though
supported not having an easy way to guage whats going to spawn in your neck of the woods is a pain sec level should display minuses
yes fix delve getting officers in 030 sov sec space is redicules
its time for some lovinmore lvl 4 missionssleeper ai theres only about ten trillion ideas been proposed so far these are my fav 2bottom line though is lvl 4s need some attention
the one thing i would change about l4s is i would like to see a randomizer build into the mechanics sleeper ai  so that the npc forces will adjust to the number of opponents randomly selecting targetschanging targets at random intervals andor focus on closest opponent this will eliminate the first one in draws aggro tactic and put the focus on more fleet tactics this would only mean no more free rides for your corp buddies and it may also draw a ninja salvager or two into the battle this would make for a more realistic engagement and perhaps remove some of the monotony
as a ninja salvager i support this ideai  when mission rats target me over the runner and i can kite them 150km away
example 1 make so that you can open a can inside all the pos modules dragging into a ship just to open it can be tedious and troublesome 2 fix the overview so that you can choose what you want shown and be able to save that without having to worry about brackets that dont always work3 after this latest patch my ships actually look plastic yes i have updated my 9800 vid card drivers4once you set your destination be able to rt click the next system on the screen and warp to 0 without having to rt click space scroll down to gates then scroll to the gate and then scroll to the warp to 0its the little things that needs to be fixed
omigodyespleasefixed that for youi have a 9800 series card and this is not a problem for me  all my stuff looks greatyou can use your overview i travel this way all the timesupporting number 1 and a good hard look at the issues of the overview which will in turn make 4 not so much of an issue

as it takes a measly 5 days to repair the lost sp for level 5 many i would figure stop at level 4 which is less than 36 hours to regain i dont see what the problem isfly it till it pops self destruct should have the same repercussions as a combat lossand has something changed recently the last time a target self destructed on me i got plenty of his loot just no killmail
actually the status quo sort of makes sense sd is basically the best possible loss  you lose the ship but you do it in a planned way instead of just getting bbqd by an enemy fleet it seems to make perfect sense that an uncontrolled explosion of your ship will damage your brain somehow whereas a timed scuttling wont and from a gameplay point of view i find it to be an interesting mechanic that doesnt harm very much
i dont agree i dont go by how it would happen in rl thoughtprocesses personally as theres so may rl things that dont add up in eve wormholes for example would all have a black hole at the mouth so the black hole in the system being an anomoly seems wrong somehow to memaybe ive got teh science wrong who knowsbut you can add sounds in space and flying through planets to the list as well point is from a balance pov it just adds too much incentive to selfdestruct imo if you are in your t3 cruiser and in a fight against a ship which is slowly but surely killing you then not only can you deprive them of loot and killmail you also would not lose any skillpoints to boot what possible reason would there be to not sd and if your answer is that you remove the chance of you paying a ransom to survivehow many of you would trust that ransom to be honoured
to state it simply ships with split weapon systems suffer when fitting them with damage mods my proposal is to either condense all damage mods to one universal mod that covers all guns and missiles or simply add an equivalent missile bonus to gyros magstabs and heat sinksdont know if its been said already but there you have it thank you
proposal 1 ship maintenance array has ability to repair shipsreason the ability to repair ships seems like a fairly resonable feature to expect from a mobile base platform and especially from a ship maintenance structure idea all ships stored in ship maint array repair over time eg few hours alternatively putting in a repair bay into these arrays that repairs ships placed into it would workconditionsa ship array is online b would or not  repair fittings  eg overheated modulesc if repair bay concept is used then it still counts the volume as part of the sma hanger total thus preventing it being used as an extra storage baythe option to run to stations to repair for cash still applies and for short term repairs within the pos the use of repair modules works for on demand repairs proposal 2 ship maintenance array has ability to repair drones reason again the ability to repair ships seems like a fairly resonable feature to expect from a mobile base platform and especially from a ship maintenance structure additionally drones cannot be repaired inside a pos and having to run outside to use a remote repair module on each drone is a clunky approachidea seperate bay within the sma that only takes fighters  drones  sentries these are repaired over time eg hours alternatively repair bay from proposal 1 works for drones conditionsa ship array is online once again the option to run to stations to repair for cash still applies and for short term repairs within the pos the use of repair modules works for on demand repairs proposal 3 allow pos the ability to repackage itemsreason going through hundreds of items is extremely irritating and prone to delays in large amounts it makes sorting difficult and makes for a horrible storage interface repackaging and thus being able to stack these items like a station would be very helpfulnone of these proposals are particularily revolutionary or new concepts and i dont see anything wrong with their implementation
i could see a repair facility even if it is incorporated with the sma but i dont think isk would work maybe having the repairs cost raw materials minerals would fit the idea of the pos better such as in a separate hangar or in the ship hangar of the ship being repaired also the repairs should take time and should not be automaticthe idea of repackaging inside a cha is reasonable and shouldve been implemented already it would make things a lot easier on posessupported especially the third issue
supported
all 3 proposal sound no more than reasonable and would make life in posses less troublesome
supportedalthough i would mention that you can repair any ship if you have the ability to change the fitting and have an armor repper and hull repper on hand you should be able to repackage items
12 perhaps some kind of nanite repair paste for smas should be added to let you repair things while docked at it for an actual cost preferably playermade somehow not just npc seeded like at present 3 yeah makes sense
supported id also support the above suggestion that some type of material isk nanites need also be expended to repair a shipdrones

since no one reads the suggestions forumi was thinking why not give bonuses for fitting faction to your factionie if you fit imperial navy modules to your imperial navy shipa small bonus mind you but something measurable lets say just as an example a 3 bonus for fitting a faction module to its matching hull true sansha medium pulse to your succubus for example for each 1015 of the fitting you match you get another 1 bonus to all of the modulesso if you fully faction fit a faction ship with its matching modules you get something like 10 extrajust a thought would make it truly worthwhile to spec out a ship in such way currently its just better to put t2 on a faction ship rather than its comparable faction usually but not always
its been brought up beforein different iterations eg bonus for faction item on faction ship or for race of pilot or for sets something like implant sets for shipsi like the premise of that
the bonus from fitting faction gear to faction ships should be based on the fact that its the best gear you can fit for that ship for example when you go to fit a bhaalgorn you should generally look at the gear available and lust after the dark blood stuff the most db neuts db webs db mega pulse maybe some corpus hardeners not all of those are actually the ones you want to go for but in theory they should be explicit bonuses seem like exactly the wrong way to do things

hi guysive just recently discovered that the new mailing system no longer keeps a backlog of mails for player owned mailboxes which has basically ruined a couple of mailboxes that i keep ingame for all players to join called classic chats my mailbox was designed to keep funny convos weve had in eve for everyone to read again it relied upon the backlog as when new players joined the mailbox the mails that were already there were automatically downloaded to their mailbox so they could read what others had already postedsince the new mailbox was introduced this is no longer possible and after petitioning it i was told by the gm to make a post on here to maybe get some support from you guys to have this option reinstated as an optional setting within the mailbox settingsi have made a post in the devs section of the forum which can be found here
backlogs are properly the role of a forum not a mailing list when ccp rolls out spacebook i think some form of forums will be included failing that wwwbloggercom has something to say to you annoying for you ill agree but this is the right way to do it
having already had this as a forum when it died and was upgraded so did all of the mails that were posted the old eve mailing system made this easier and cheaper and like i explained in the post that was linked when this was out of game as a forum noone bothered to post as often so blogging isnt really an option
as cool as that sounds right now it is relatively easy to get decent attributes in 00 you only need 2 implants for a given skill and 3s were around 10m last time i checked assuming you dont get podded multiple times a day for days on end this seems reasonablehowever it might be nice to give nonnpc 00 space a way to generate implants though maybe make rats occasionally drop 1  3s or seed bpos for 1  3s they would take about as much in minerals as what they are worth now
actually i do have to agree with youif you pick two points in eve then the shortest path between them can be solved in polynomial timechoose several locations and look for the shortest path to visit all of them is npcomplete it differs from the tsp in that you can visit one place several times rather than exactly once but it does not reduce the complexityso yep  you are rightthat said the existing ap optimisation routine would already be npcomplete  hence the warning if you optimise a path with more than 8 way points the only difference between my request and the existing is to stipulate the end point of the path which neither increases nor decreases the complexity of the problem
god im thick past the 22nd hour without sleep studying for finals my logic just isnt quite all there now that ive got some sleep yes of course the existing optimization would have to be the identical problem actually from a programming standpoint implementing your idea would only require reducing the upper index of whatever searching algorithm they use well that plus scripting the extra check box for lock destination compliments for sticking to your guns when challenged
along with this thread anything that makes corporate logistics easier is a must have especially with the massive corporations that are in eve nowbeing able to set a master destination and then optimize my pickup routes ending in that master destination would be invaluable
npcompleteness is kind of irrelevant to this discussion even if its a factorial process like the naive algorithm would make it ccp is sitting on a gargantuan supercomputer and on is still a quick operation when n6 if youre worried about your algorithm going to crap when people input too many waypoints just code in a no u message when someone tries to optimize more than say 100 waypoints besides arguments over whether or not it can be done are really irrelevant  its already in game and has been for several years its just that we want to constrain the possibilities somewhat which would actually make the operation shorter

disagree with purchased remappings for the reasons others have mentionedthis id support everyone could do it once per remap cycle but once done youre stuck with it until your remap cycles normallyitd allow you to get out of a focused mapping but youd be stuck with a mapping thats not particularly great for anything

i propose to discuss security issues about account hacking and how to prevent themthe idea is something like wow offers eg key authentication via rsa key pairs privatepublic perhaps even using hardware generated keysthere are many 3rd party apps for eve its becoming increasingly difficult to identify malicious software key loggers are a very obvious threat amongst many
proposal allow salvager modules the ability to loot the contents of a wreck as well as salvage via an option to do so thus ninjas can still salvage without getting flagged if they turn the loot side of it off but the looting process is streamlined in general for other salvagers rather than having to open each can look in etc
alternatively while the salvager is doing its work  double click the wreck icon in the overview

currently you need to be docked in the station that your locator agent resides in order to access the agents locator abilities i suggest that the agents locator services be available to the player while the player is docked at any station accessible through the players agents listif this seems too easy and overpowered then i could concede to a higher cost in isk the further the player is from the agent while accessing the locator services i think that this would also prove to be a great isk sink further improving the gamethanks in advance for your support

defender missiles are horribly skewwed if there is any hope for them to be useful for anybody their basic mechanic of use must be changed1 defenders should activate automatically when your ship detects an enemy missile launch this is the biggest change that needs to be implimented players have too much to worry about then needing to worry about keeping an eye out for missiles and activating defendersthis will probably face opposition from missile users but defenders should also be able to target all enemy missiles directed at your fleet not just those attacking you
1 your first suggestion is pointless and if it had any effect it would nerf defenders by not allowing the user even a base level of control if you want a defender missile launcher to mindlessly launch at whatever it can whenever it can you just need to click the module once and it will keep firing2 your second suggestion instantly makes defenders overpowered as they can be launched from highrof rocket launchers and against grouped missiles one defender takes out more than one cruise missileyou need massive balancing changes in order to fix defenders in addition to having a good reason for doing so as missiles are hardly imbalanced in pvp fights there is no point to nerfing them just because you have a thing for defenders
you should be allowed to man pos guns on any pos within your alliance not just limited to your corpalso if you have roles to pos gun you should get a mail for any pos in the alliance that is attacked as well
yes very much please
the roles for this could be kind of ugly but i could accept making it an option on the pos to allow alliance members to gun it if they have gunner roles in their corp supported
why stop thereallow for ownership of a pos to be handed over to an alliance thus enabling alliance gunnerscould serve as deterrent to would be aggressors as well since a tower owned by alliance equals guaranteed gunnersroles be damned they need to be reworked anyway  no time like the present
really alliance and corp roles for poses need to be relooked at as a whole but yeah this will do until then
god yes even though pos spamming is on the decline thanks to dominion ive always felt that this was a muchneeded feature
likewise though im in no alliancethe rights however are what makes doing this problematic alliance rights pertain to corporations within itself not individual members of corporations so releasing rights to control guns will be difficultand people will whine when an unknown member of a 2k man alliance runs around unloading their guns prior to an attack because the asset logging will not be therealso starbase defense should allow more control than just 5 modules 
anyone happen to know when the next csm meeting is slated for anywaywould be nice to know which topics are currently slated to be brought to the table like this one and a few other marketing and logistics changes that are much needed as well as fixing some of the glaring issues that have exploded in our faces with dominion
ive never even been near a titan and this makes sense to me
no we need no buffs to jump bridges whether its attached to a pos or titan we dont need this deal with the frustration of jbs
yes
agree to go even further  give us surgey skill that gives us up to 25  chance of recover of implant from corpses
yeah ill throw my support for this
ffs noyou cant even remove them from your own head successfully in a station with a medical facility  but you want a chance to remove them after the body has been subjected to being exploded and then flash frozen
honestly i say why not to both ideas implant harvesting and clone value also would be nice to be able to take implants out my reason implants are super expensive i would like to see a drop in the cost of high end implants to make them cost effective fitting options on cheaper ships my hawk would totally benefit from a full set of crystal but there is no way i would take that clone out in anything less than a cnr or cns

supportnullsec was better before all this and ive lost 500mil from this stupid bug
my proposition is simple and probably will be heavily flamed at the moment the local is not simply a channel used for chat by pilots who are in the same system instead it is the best tool for gathering intel you can check for bad guys good guys the number of all pilots you can even spot somebody coming before he load the systemi want to propose a change to the local channel for 00 and low sec so its not anymore the greatest ever tool for intel the idea is to be changed to a delayed mode or a mode similar to the way it works in wspace so you can see somebody only if he talks or you can only see the number of the pilots but not their details unless they speakthe change will introduce a brand new warfare tactics will bring back the skill intensive and highly unused black ops and will make the game more complex and interestingi already feel a great disturbance in the force as if millions of ratters and ninja miners suddenly cried out in terror and jumped on the flame buttonsask yourselves what will make the game better not what will hurt or help your game style and give me your support if feel so
currently local is a one stop intel shop the second anyone enters system you know their name corp and alliance without having to do anythingthe halfway option of local retaining just the count possibly delayed would be a good compromise should full wspace behaviour be seen as too muchedit i suggest this change for 00 only and not empire lowsec could also have it later on depending on how it works out in 00
flamejust go live in whs where that is already the case
i very much liked the delayed local in wspace seeing a pilot total would be nice to allow spikes to be observed but i think you should have to actually scout around a system to gather intel about whos there rather than just clicking on show info from the comfort of a safe therefore supported
recon  two in local nothing on grid drake on scanhas a whole different meaning to it if you cant find out which corpalliance the drake belongs to and if he can only determine your presence by use of dscan or watching the local count like a hawk1
this has been discussed ad nauseam and while i fully support it i believe the devs have stated they didnt want to change local until they have a good alternative source for intel this is sortof one of those topics that has been discussed most people agree on but no one has come up with a decent alternative yet the current probing system is drastically better than the old one but imo still a bit more active proactive than ideal
supportedwish we can have the current magic local channel here on earth though we could instantly check for those pesky little green dudes with flying saucers laugh on their corp history or photos and smacktalk them till they undock
yes plz however all anoms need to be as profitable as level 4 missions or need to be completable in a ship capable of fighting back in pvp
i dont think that complete removal of local without any alternatives is a good idea but supporting this thread because local change is an old overdue
i fully support a change to localpersonally id like the delayed mode or just showing the numberhowever i seem to remember the same as seth that the devs didnt want to change it till they have an appropriate intel tool to replace itanyways 1
2 to 00 local showing total number of pilots but not each specific pilot
ccp indicated at fanfest they would like some replacement tools so this is a good place to suggest anyeg you could have a system upgrade to enable local in sov space possibly with a delay that can be further reduced with more levels
dont be a fool all your will ever do is reinstate local in a slicker form that resembles a scanning function then comes a point when people are asking to chat in this new scan function and the cycle comes full circle back to what we have now

a format change is unnecessary any number of proxies or message brokers should be able to handle the transparent change of data format for you or you could roll your own with a little effort part of a current goon project is to do exactly that abstract the api data into a different format and abstracing multiple api calls to return a single unified set of data but i digresswhat is needed are some baselevel technical changes to make the api more reliable and generally better standards compliant ive brought some of these up in the past error responses should not produce a 200

ok since you only want to compare a pirate faction bs to a pirate faction bs i will give you a comparisonlets take an armor tanked vindicator as an examplefirst a setup wit 8 turrets and a passive tank if you want to use rr take the navy megahigh 8x neutron blaster cannon ll factionammed 100mn mwd ll stasis webifier ll warp scrambler ll sensor booster ll named heavy cap injectorlow 2x 1600mm rolled tungsten plates damage control ll 2x eanm ll 2x mag field stabs llrigs trimark armor pump ll 2x trimark armor pump5 ogre llthis is a somewhat realistic setup no repair capabilities of its own 1267dps 154000 effective hpnow a theoretical setup with an active tank and dual reps8x ion blaster cannon ll factionammed 100mn mwd ll named warp disrupter named stasis webifier sensor booster ll named cap injectorlow 2x amarr large armor repairer damage control ll 2x eanm ll 2x mag field stabs llrigs auxilliary nano pump ll 2x nanobot accelerator5 ogre ll1208 dps 789 dps tank with a uniform damage distribution at least as long as it has cap booster charges and has effective hp of 84kif the setup sacrifices its dps in favor of an armor tank by removing the mag field stabs and one eanm and instead uses a thermal kinetic and explosive hardener tech 2 it gets 975k effective hp and 923 dpsone should also note that blasters have range and tracking issues and are practically never able to cause the theoretical amount of dps one a side note even the first high dps setup will not be able to break a tengus passive tank especially not when it starts to overheat the modulesa rattlesnake is a completely different thing also pirate faction bs but it is unusual for having the drones as its main weapon now and trampling over the navy domi nice balancing thanks ccp pdamage mods are not really needed by the ship since its main weapons are the drones and with a passive shield someone else has to tackle but that is not that much of a problem when in a fleethigh 4x siege launcher ll 2x highslot for whatever heavy nos perhaps to support the cap or a drone nav computermed 100 mn mwd ll 3x large shield extender ll 2x invul field ll 1x photon scattering field lllow 6 shield power relay ll no kiddingrigs 3x core defence field purger ll5 ogre ll750 dps 139k effective hp and a tank of 1791 dps good luck chewing threw this kind of tank yes it has less dps and it needs someone else to tackle with mwd off the cap still lasts for 14minutes which should be more then enough in most situationsnow its your turn dav show me where the numbers are balanced
snake fail fit with a few bcs you can easily break 1200 dps and chew through things who needs tank when you got dpsand who doesnt fit deadspace gear on a vindi ought to be shot in the facemore realistic vindicator fitsalso your snake fit is using what  12 slots and the 3 rigs just for tankinghow do you expect a 5 slots3 rigs tank to compare to that equally
your so forgetting to factor what happens to active shield hardeners whn the ship is neuted your also forgetting that passive shield tank dosent benefit from boosters and dosent have a set of implants like slave or crystal oh and then there is the fact that it gets little benefit from 2 out of the 3 warfare links shield tanking uses my theritical golum using implants boosters and faction fit pushes 3814 sustaiend and 5270 boosted overheting pushes that to 5069 and 8231 respectivly and this is not boosted by a command shipi could also get that tank fully sustained by fitting dule cap boosters look passive shield tank is good but to get a good pssive shield tank requires the sacrifice of alot of dps if your ed about the new rattlesnake fit remember that its twice as much as the navy domi and takes twice as long to train
so many posts yet no support lol everyone posting in here is some loser caldari pilot that doesnt want their precious passive shield tank nerfed mal exceptedpassive shield tanking is similar to the speed issue we used to have before it was fixed the knock on effects of rigs and the various other modules have made passive shield tanks far too overpowered when compared to other options for tanking in the game particularly with battlecruiser class shipsshield extenders and shield extender rigs need to reduce shield recharge slightly for each module fit so that the original peak tank is maintainednote i fly a max skilled drake and broadsword so id actually be reducing my ship performance with this change

you have done exactly what i predicted in my original post only translatted to piratebs hulls instead of cruiser hullsyou have compared a pure tank  rs  setup every slot dedicated to tank  except mwd to a solo capable balanced pvp fit with tackle  vindi   not the same thing at allsecond i never asked you to compare pirate facton to pirate faction  i pointed out that you were not comparing like with like comparing the rs  tank bonused pirate hull  to a vindi  tackle bonused pirate hull  is not a logical comparison  in fact by choosing rs you have selected a ship class which has no peer equivilent  there are no armor tanking bonused pirate bs hulls the closest you can probably get is a abaddon with it 5 per level armor resists but of course thats a t1 hulla more resonable assesment of shield extender passive recharge would compare 2 similar pvp ship setupsfor example compare a dual mar ishtar to a passive shield tanked cerbremember to fit tackle and propulsion mods to both shipsthis would be a better comparison because  both ships are damage at range hacs neither of which iirc receive tanking bonusesproblems with the setups you have looked at include1 rs will run out of cap simply warping around  so wont be able to keep up with a fleet for more than about 12 jumps2 rs has no tackle  compared in your example to a tackle fitted vindi3 rs has no injector  wont be able to run its own hardeners without maintaining nos range to a hostile  has no web and no scram so it cant maintain range and can run its mwd for maximum 30 seconds before its capped outif you want to compare a rs to a vindi for pure bait tank setups then you should be looking at a tri repped dual injecting setup on the vindi and you need to fit tackle and injector to the rsa tri repped vindi probably reps around 15k sustained for around 3 or 4 minutes and can still fit tacklenot as impressive as the rs but then the rs gets a tanking hull bonus whereas the vindi gets a tackle bonuspassive shield tankers get a passive recharge elementarmor resist setups start with higher base resists and can fit larger ehp extendersif you want to take out the passive recharge elements of extenders then you would need toa boost resists on shield hulls by 10 on one resist and provide xl extenders 4200hp to compete with 16000 plates and also provide a pirate implant set to compete with slaves
how about comparing 1600 vs lsedamn my previous poster beat me on itedit damn
youre right theres absolutely no drakes in motsudixie running level 4s
oh no people use l4 drakes all the time theyre crap though people use them because theyre cheap and take less skill than a real mission ship but theyre not actually good similarly while people may do l5s in passive nighthawks i refuse to refer to any means of running l5 missions as good though to be fair other forms of pve equal in difficulty to l23 missionsc2 wormholes 410 plexes etc theyre also good at
you really need to look at the whole ship when considering these things anyone can say x tank is better thats not really the pointfirst you need to distinguish pve vs pvp i think it is clear that missile ships notably drake and raven easily reign supreme in this area in pvp they may not be best but are not exactly bad eitherconsider that a passive drake is immune to cap warfare neuts immune to tracking disruption and partially immune to ecm can fof in a pinch which while not great at least it can still shoot now compare that to say a harbinger harbinger is ruined by neuts ruined by tracking disruption cannot shoot at all if jammedcan a harby theoretically fit a better tank o rout dps a drake sure it is also has numerous achilles heels which can be exploited that balance it outadd in that ccp seems to have a jones for neuts in l5 missions and with sleeperstaken all together the drake is a stellar ship yes you can get more dps in some other ships and better tanks in other ships but there is a reason the drakeraven are far and away among the most popular ships in eve and it is not because they actually suck and no one has noticed
problemcurrently if you are selling buying or trading you often can end up with several interfaces all at once stacking on top of each other or having to be on screen at the same timethe idea is to introduce a new market interface which makes it easier to customize trade check items and use the market interface in generalsuggestionthis suggestion states adding several functions and combining several windows into one i will handle it step by step and the numbers for the suggestion have numbers corresponding to a mockup i have madeclick for graphical example evefiles linklegenda1  the central point adding a second window which can be hidden and shown and shows either orders items or ships at all times2  a set of buttons to switch from from orders to items or ships3  the transactions tab which when activated comes in place instead of the market details windows still showing the split view if its active4  a new settings which allows you to hide certain tabs in the market details interface and orders interface to save room for more wanted information5  an added search box working like the transactions search does now to easily jump to new items in the market details interface saving clicks6  very simple making sure you can export from this interface as well7  not shown on the picture a drop down addition to items which states check transactions to more easily access thesetldrimprove the market interfaceall comments ideas and suggestion are welcome
id like to propose a feature available through the escmenu spawn slave windowit opens an entirely separate window that you can drag to another monitor you can then drag things such as chat market or other windows to while leaving your overview hud and more critical components on your main windowwere now in a world of multiple monitors i have 5 eve should be enabled to support them other than just expanding the interface across all monitors and making an utter hash of it
the issues that i had working the pp interface today prompted me to bump this up again
supported if ccp comes to thier senses and releases a pc port of the game i will not game on a console i simply cant my thumbs are ed

proposal  black ops ships can employ a communication jammer module that shuts down all chat and chat countersie local count in game for a specific range say maybe a whole constellation this would be a 00 only module skill training for the module would not affect its range but would allow finer selection of duration of effectsee cloaking ramifications below at level 1 the module activates for x minutes at level 2 its x minutes  some additional time at level 3 you can addsubtract even more time this time being user selectable to the nearest second within the range allowed and so on there would be a notification somewhere on the ui that you were in a commjammed system perhaps a motd type notice in local itself or something else but you would need to see this notice if you jumped into a commjammed system or logged on into a commjammed system the benefit of this is that it would allow you to move larger numbers of conventional shipsie noncloaky into hostile space without the defenders knowing the fleet composition and route immediately via ingame chat intel channels the jammer effect would linger for some seconds after module deactivation to allow the black ops jammer ship to deactivate its module and warp to the gate to jump to the next system then safe spot upyou are working with a covops running ahead right and reactivate the module before the effect from the previous activation dissipates this allows the black ops to move and maintain the blackout even though it cannot move when the module is active duration of the linger period would have to be balanced with warp time align time jump time so that the black ops can move from system to sytem but it should not be so long as to allow the black ops to deactivate the module and be able to do things in an unhurried casual manner with no worriesanother option  perhaps this module only puts local in delayed mode instead of disabling all comms if this is the way it works my suggestion would be that there is no notification that the system is comm jammed it will be obvious to people watching local if all characters disappear simultaneously i really prefer the first mode of operation however as this makes it more difficult to get intel out of the jammed constellation and encourages people to use voice comms which is a better way to play eve anyway if you are pvping and this is definitely geared toward the pvp crowd eve voice comms would not be affected obviously 3rd party voice comms are not affected nonvoice comm users can do what they do today safespot up and cloak or warp back to the pos or log and try back later but the nice thing is that they cannot warn in allianceregion intel text chat channels in game what is going onthe module can be activated while the blackops is cloaked however if the ship is cloaked when the module is active the ship is no longer invisible but has a small sig radius so it can be scanned down the radius would still be small like a frigate so you would need a good scanner to find it quickly need to determine proper sig radius so to balance duration of the module with scan time i do not know the details on what that should be as i dont do this type of stuffscanning for ships often but im sure other people dothe module has a duration time of some minutes plus or minus a user selectable additional time depending on skill level during which the ship cannot move in space
additional alternative for roaming gangs module has a frigate sized version that that can jam only a single system with a relatively short duration the idea being that after the main gang warps into system and gets established at a safe spot or whatever this module can be activated to maintain the blackout in the current system only while the blackops jumps to the next system and establishes the next blackoutthis is particularly needed if the next system is in a different constellation thus covering the fleets movements and not exposing their count when he disables his module to jump ahead to the next system the use of this module would not be absolutely required if the black ops version implements the linger mode discussed above this module would be limited to being fitted on electronic attack ships only and could not be activated while cloaked there is no t2 version of either module the same skill allows both but in the frigate sized version the skill affects cap usage or something like that thus higher skill allows you to run the module longer while at a low skill level you may only get a few iterations before you need to cap boost or remote energy transfer or something like that cap usage should be high enough that this module cannot be used for many many minutes of operation under typical conditions i suppose if you want to have someone feeding you cap boosters forever or multiple remote energy transfers going thats ok but im not sure there is a lot of benefit in doing this its really just designed to cover you during cross constellation jumps and to give the eas ships something else to do so maybe somebody will buy one could be used by small gangs as well to create more chaos maybe this one is allowed in 00 and lowsecthoughtsmodificationsfun or not fun thanks for your consideration
good ideas but theres one major problemafk jammingits bad enough we covert ops pilots have to take  from the general population not supporting this due to that reasonid rather support delayed localno local in favor of sov holders and those who show up in system instant local only then would i support your idea so long as the opposition had there abilities to use on a alliance scale
out of game communication could also be a problem
love it
thats a bit like saying a fat man accelerates faster than a ferrari because he reaches his top speed faster
12ft laser under ideal conditions goes 15knots12 ft whaler under ideal conditions goes 1530knots depending on motor size
and both a ferrrari and my honda civic will go 60 miles per hour that doesnt mean my honda accelerates faster
hydrodynamics  aerodynamicsideal conditions again a laser will accelerate faster than a whaleri know theres other sailors in game itd be nice if they would speak up and acknowledge or refute my statements since zephyrs been released and this troll hasnt been all that successfulits a matter of hull shapeweight and water conditions the hull of a laser along with wind conditions and the general science of sailing will allow it to perform a 180 turn practically on a dime and reach full speed a hell of a lot faster than a boston whaler which has a hull made for planinghull of a whaler at full speed has to come off the plane plow into the water turn around and rework itself out of the water and back up on plane id say itd take 50100 longer to do so
dont go power boating much do youyou can do a thing in a power boat called a power turn the following assumes you are going fast already1 spin the wheel fast to the stops or push the engine over to the stops if hand steered motor2 pull throttle to zero 3 hang on tight you can seriously send people flying out of the boat like thisessentially the boat starts its turn then loses all power the water being dragged behind it is going faster and slams into the back of the boat which is now pointed right or left of center this pushes the stern around rightquick your 180 turn is accomplished in about 23 seconds hit throttle and accelerate in the other directionive done it it works careful trying this as again you can be thrown from the boat if not preparedno sailboat can achieve thateta can see it done in this video
nice vids heres a laser pulling a roll tack as you see he didnt even lose speed
yes and its scary as  in a sunfish you can learn pretty quick why they call that pole the boom simply put sail boats have less mass of course on a dead day you wont be going 10kts but a common misconception for nonsailors is that you need a lot of wind of course all this debate between power boats and sail boats is rather offtopic for a ship i spent zero isk on i guess i really cant complain it will not however be leaving my hangar as it simply doesnt accomplish anything useful and from a game design perspective its pretty crap that a rare ship assuming this is a onetime only thing like the apotheosis has the same signature radius as a shuttle but the align time of a cruiser its just begging to be popped
to be fair that laser weighs in at around 130 pounds the mastercraft in the second video weighs in around 2600 pounds i have driven and been water skiing behind one of those and they are powerful boats it can go from 030 in a touch over 5 seconds and it has gobs of power so it maintains very near that acceleration despite other loads such as pulling a skier this is very intentional as it is built to pull skiers better than any other boatso 30 miles per hour to zero with 180 turn and back to 30 miles per hour in eight seconds looking at your video at the 1 minute mark looks like the laser takes 5 seconds to complete the maneuver but it very much looks like it is not doing a 180 maybe 120all things considered ill leave my money on a power boat unless it goes very far afield eg a 10 ton yacht versus a laseri will say the power turn is a lot scarier from inside the boat from the shore it does not look too bad
dear opyou received a free novelty ship which has a purpose beyond being just a fancy little shuttle please accept the gift say thank you and move alongid hate to see how you treat other people who give you presentsjacques
i agree re the laser in the vid its the best video i could find that demonstrates the turning ability of the laser its not even going full speed and as its going around the boat taping it it doesnt complete a 180 turnas for the person above me you missed the part where this whole thread was a trollyhbt hand
the idea is great and the model of the zephyr is amazing but frankly there are a few flaws in the design one thing missing from this ship is any sort of adequet defence from roaming players in the wormholes give the zeypher one more high slot and the atribute is allowed to fit covert opps cloaking devices at the moment not being targeted by sleepers is usless if a player warps in on you as it is now the ship has no defences and is basically a scanning shuttle with a large bullseye on it give it covert ops cloaking and everyone will be happy fixing the aligning and speed issues as mentioned earlier would help thanks for the early beta release of the ship ccp we hope to see corrected bps soon 
also let it equip two bomb launchers at once and fighters it should be able to control 20 fighters maybe also give you a 10x training bonus while sitting in one and every time you open the cargohold it should always fill the remaining space with exotic dancers
last time they gave out a free ship it was a shuttle take what you can can get
thisit is a gift trash it or reprocess it if you dont like it
having just read a now locked thread about problems with gms ive dealt with some great gms and some who were complete idiots escalation is not always possible or really appropriatehow about an option to pass off a petition from the gm currently handling it to anotherescalation is for matters that simply cannot be resolved at the lowest level and has little to do with particular gms sometimes you just cant communicate with the one youve gotten stuck with or theyre just boneheads who refuse to listen but escalating only makes you the issuer look like a whiney tardso sliding the petition sideways is more appropriate the petition is returned to the que and the initial gm is blocked from accessing it all previous communication remains howeveralso the option to escalate a closed petition should be available ive dealt with gms who simply close a petition with a canned response without ever giving you any say in the matter nor making any attempt to resolve the issue
hiim a pirate like my friends in my corporationwe attack player owened ships camping gates fighting in faction warand some times we do lv5 missionsi know crime is not prefered in eve but allowed and without the probleme below working finethe problem ive found during a mission lv5 system security level 02 is the nexti was in a logistic ship  scimitar  to support my matesmy security status have been loweredand i got global criminal flag for this action we wereare below 90sec statcant understand how is it possibleive tryed something else too in the next mission ive put a tracking link on my ship and i got global criminal flag and security status loss againthe same happened with the use of remote sensor boosterif its possible please fix thisbest regardshyjack
did anyone in your fleet attack any players or was it just the npcs that caused you to be flagged
any support rendered to those with security status below 50 will result in a global criminal flag wether or not those criminals were actively engaged in an act that earned them a global criminal flagsoyou can loose sec status while using any remote assistance module on them and they regain sec status by killing the rats or you if youre 5 or below will earn yourself criminal flagging and security loss for repping your own dronesyeah the mechanic is hopelessly broken heh
supporting a fix to this system
ok so a drone faction ship which drops from bpcs in drone regions and suchthe idea behind the ship is that it is essentially designed to either bonus your own fleets drones or interruptcontrol your enemys dronesso imagine you warp in to a 100v100 fleet battle theres lots of drones all over the damn place you hit the drone warfare mod and suddenly all your enemys drones on the grid stop workingor you could warp in drone boost mod your teammates drones bonusing them for more speeddmghpradness
im sorry but this should be in the ideas forum youve obviously not put much thought into fleshing out the idea out had discussions on it etc
you said it better than i did thank you thats what id like to see also not the fractured insides of my ship
i found the following steps to work for grouping peoplehold down the control key while selecting a couple dozen buddies click and hold one of the selected buddies in the group pulling them off to the side a window appears with the selected buddies within itusing the down arrow key numerous times will reveal the playercreated folders but dont let go of the left mouse button yetonce those folders are in view the group of selected buddies can be dropped onto the folder of choiceits not a pleasant experience and could definitly be improved by implementing the two column idea
apparently mr gruber is not doing his job and i need help from another gm please private me in game thanks
ask for your petition to be escalatedyou will get nothing from the forums
how can you get it escalated when the guy reading them is closing them the second i make them gm gruber ftmfl
then try filing a petition under rules  policies  game masters  isd
i experienced the same issues with said gm thanks god i am not alone
this is not up for discussion on the forums guys handle issues with ccp personnel with petitions onlyinb4 lock
sokratesz is completely correct if you need to contact a gm it must be done through the petition system if you feel your petition is not being handled correctly you may request an escalationthread is now locked
still an issue
here
should potentially be only one line of code which needs to be changed   instead of  
ummmm maybe my overview is bugged please show me where the salvage shows up on the screen after you shoot the ship salvage does not exist before a salvage mod is used on the wreckyour compensated by bounty when you make the wreck salvage is what is created by use of a salvage modi cant tell if your an ingame troll or playing an ingame word for intellectually challenged person either through poor education or geneticsdemanding compensation beyond the bounty for shooting the rat is just greedy didnt exist before a salvage mod was used on it so it belongs to whoever used the salvage mod
you know that is a good point the wreck wasnt there until he blew up the rat so the wreck should belong to him and anyone who salvages it should be flagged similarly ive logged in after downtime or a server crash and often ive been the first one to enter a system which causes a traffic delay as the node hasnt been loaded ergo i created the system i should be compensated for that too no the system did not exist until i willed it into existence by attempting to activate a gate so wheres my compensation should not the miners in that system be flagged to me every time they mine an asteroid that i made its just not fair i tell you
no sorry cant support anything a troll proposes

in the time they spend salvaging i will have made 10 times its value from the loot i dont begrudge the poor the crumbs from my table 
your perspective is moronicbounty  whoever places the most damage on the target not yoursmission reward  yourstime bonus  yoursloot  whoever picks it up first not yourswrecks  nobodysalvage  whoever runs a salvage module successfully on the wreck firststanding  anyone who aggresses the npcnothing in this game is riskless stop trying to make lvl4s a risk free isk machineyou have to take the chance to make the money thats all there is to it stop whining
how about scamming with a disposable altmost risk free carebear system in any game tbh
dayum was i that transparent just trying triple the price with exclusivity to it cant blame a guy for tryingthought i had yall for a minute there oh well
except ninja salvaging in a high sec system from an npc corp alti am not saying its wrong just saying it is risk free as long as youre smart enough not to take the loot too
so people losing salvaging ships to npcs  riskthe real money in ninja salvaging is both the salvage and the loot for those doing nothing but salvaging and making money off nothing but salvage id say the risk is about equal to an npc corp lvl 4 runner who ignores anyone in his mission flashing red
its definitely not risk free ive had several ninjas get popped in my missionsthe best one was when i started a l4 killed one or two ships then warped out to afk for some coffee i come back in ten minutes later and theres a t2 frigate wreck complete with a set of sisters combat probes and a cov ops cloaking device not ironically i salvaged his wreck for a 12mil piece of t2 salvagevery generous ninja if i say so myself
perhaps i am confusedhow exactly does one manage to get asploded in a mission space when youre not even running the actual mission
1 sitting in a perma tanked ship in recon 33 giggles2 warping out and letting the other guy get aggro i did warping in and out with a guy for 10minutes he was quite persistent in coming back so i went to do a quick hauling job for a friend before finishing the mission3 triggering a respawn a typical ninja salvager ship doesnt react too friendly to a respawn in blockade lvl4 
did i not say i was wanting something more in the op introduce more bonuses last i checked all those capital ships you said are not very good and going thru gates on roams and what notstop trying to troll and actually contribute there is way too many people who only read things and instead of making constructive criticism all they can think about is how to spin things to troll the op
is this not the role of the command ship 
he did give constructive criticism if he disagrees with you that doesnt make him a troll some ideas are just bad and cant be salvaged this is one of them let it go and move on
i suppose this is true too much at once time to rethink this idea and come back laterme goes back to the drawing board
would be helpful instead of using outdated 3rd party tools
would be nice to see
when these came out 2 3 years ago they were hyped just like fw as a source for all sorts of new stuff notably the racial encryption booksthen they were farmed to death re fw missions and ccp chose to increase the encryption drop books considerably and introduced both invention and improved exploration contentafter nerfing the farming of cosmos into uselessness they have done absolutely nothing further with it theyve even nerfed the meta 6 blueprints  items picked up by those missions to less than meta 4 usefulness adding in hideously complex build requirements on them essentially turning them into the new minesand now theyre talking about introducing cosmos as the new player social interface spacebook which only causes confusion with the old forgotten cosmos they released so long agocsms bring this issue up at one of your meetings what do they plan on ever doing with this content throw it out make it worthwhile again or what
yeah this has always kind of puzzled me cosmos looks cool but im still not entirely sure what it actually is or what one is supposed to do with it as for spacebook names yeah those confuse me greatly i can see why they dont call it spacebook officially but do you have to give it two different names both of which are already used to refer to things in game
uh okay l4s are relatively easy money and yeah they could do with some buffingbut for the love of jove dont let them use the cheattastic sleeper ai getting webbed scrammed and neuted from 100km is not fun when they can lob a light missile 250 km for 200 damage a hit on an 80 omnitank is just plain brokenmake sleepers and all other npcs adhere to the same dynamics we players do and then implement advanced ai for them
i agree with allowing the sleeper ai being implanted into normal npcs but not the exact power of the sleepers however id say that all lvl 4s need a slight boost in difficulty to make it more for multiplayer not soloers this will balance risk vs reward if done right
even a dumbed down sleeper ai would work it would add variety and unpredictability and having fleetmultiplayer mission options in empire space is a definite win
i agree that l4s need some attention but sleeper ai for everybody im alright with named characters zor etc getting the advanced ai but if every character got it it would eliminate a complete weapon system from being used drones thats like saying all missile launchers against npcs can fire 5 times before theyre destroyednot fundrones and ai are already pooched dumb it down a bit so drones can still be used and apply it only to named characters and youve got a good combo going
while i would tend to agree with this what about those domis eh
implementing sleeper ai doesnt mean they need to copy paste it they can make some changes to the ai used in missions same for everything else related to npcs
probably we need a 45 level of difficulty for missionsfor new players the passage from level 3 to level 4 barring a heavily tanked drake is fairly difficult for experienced and well skilledequipped players level 4 are very easyso the best option would be to have a higher tier of empire low and high sec missions that arent based on the current level 5 missionsabout current level 5 i feel they have been badly developed i have done a few and the add more neutralizing towers to make it more difficult approach penalize active tanking and cap using weapons while keeping it easy for passive tanks and non cap using weapons a version of the sleeper ai with ships that conform more to the way player ships work will make missions more interesting keep the general flavour of the different npc factions guristas still mostly lobby missiles and use ecm serpentis mostly use blaster and sensor dampers and so on while giving a bit more variance in damage kind and resists serp mega using the missiles slots to fire torpedoes even switching them to a different kind with a delay if the target resiste well guristas switching missiles with a reload delay and damage reduction if they arent kinetics ecc and the new missions will be harder and a bit more challenging maybe give those capabilities only to the higher grades of npc ie the grunt gusrista still stick to kinetic missiles only while the elite switch them and the missions will still be balanced in difficulty so that the player generally win but they will require more effort and be more variable and yes some level or rr between npc ships maybe that is the reason why those guy stay 50 km away not firing on you they are rr the frontline ships and they have no cap to spare
another change i think would be fun is if the npc rat logistic cruisers actually did some rr in missionsas for making lvl4s more difficult to force multiplay thats what lvl 5s are fori think they need some sort of lvl 45 with slight sleeper aisomething harder than a 4 to force multiplay yet not nearly as profitable as a 5 and can be done in high sec zomgsomething you would actually do for fun not profit
things that need to appear lets call it lvl 45 missions for now1 fewer ships thats right even though it looks epic when a single assault frig wipes out 20 bttleships with no tracking and 20 dps each it is unrealistic stupid makes salvaging harder and does not make sence instead give us twothree battleships with same tank and dps and loot and bountly drops as all those 20 battleships they replace taken together so now you will need some reasonable firepower to destroy an npc battleship it will have 4 times the tank and 4 times the dps drop 4 times more lootsalvage be 4 times smarter and have 4 times the bounty dont make them quite as tough as sleepers but tougher then they are now 2 give them some brains they still should not shoot drones but shooting that papertanked salvaging destroyer instead of ubertanked battleship might sound as an idea it might be interesting to let some ai warp off lol where is my bounty 3 having less ai but having them tougher reduces server load makes salvaging and looting easier less werecks as well4 a little randomness  15 in the amount and toughness of ai meaning two different mission runners running same mission in same system could have slightly different amount of enemies just adds a little differentiation 5have a choice agent offers several missions and you can pick say 3 an easy mission a mediocre mission and a tough one where you take on solo the entire amarr navy that way players can pick whats appropriate to their skill level ofcource rewards scale the same way
add to that a rebalance of destroyers to make them viable as combat ships rather than sub par salvage ships
i agree with that too
oh im hardly claiming eve is realistic space does not have the viscosity of motor oil for one but i still find it useful to think through whether something is at least broadly sensible in many cases gameplay  realism but realism is still at least a little bit valuable as for the actual game mechanics youre complaining that it creates too much of an incentive for people to blow up their own rather valuable ships but remember what were talking about here were talking about people sacrificing fights entirely and still having to be able to hold on for two minutesa very long time in most combat in order for it to make any difference and at the end you still lose your ship i have no gameplay objection to that having some advantages and no sp loss seems among the reasonable ones i mean after all its not like its really an especially broken tactic  fleets of selfdestruct t3 cruisers are not exactly going to be the next fotm as for ransoms it makes me very sad to see pirates who dishonour them im a believer that you always honor ransoms because if you dont then you wont get one again simple profitseeking had an incident the other day where we accidentally blew up a guys hulk after ransoming itthere were some very illtimed communication troubles we refunded his 100 mil plus gave him another 50 of our own money for his annoyance the latter was kind of silly but the former is what i would expect of every selfrespecting pirate so yeah there are some id pay some i wouldnt sadly cp searches tend to take a little too long but the principle stands
for how longand i didnt noticed it in the patch notes you have a linkput this way it seem that if you eject from a t3 ship for whatever reason and you go around in a pod or another ship you will still lose sp if the t3 ship is destroyed at least until you do a session change
well it depends i suppose in the case of a ransom i guess its the fault of the pirate if hes not payed attention and not noticed the selfdestructin the case of t3 cruisers that have a passive tank and being slowly eaten away by say a pilgrim it would have plenty of time to sd as it fights then just switch it off if the fight turned in its favoureven an active tank setup would most likely have plenty of time as the pilgrims ability to kill off the ship relies on first removing its capas for honouring ransoms your argument is a good onei have a pirate char as is probably clear by now  and ive always honoured my ransoms however my method of pirating was to stick in the same lowsec region ransoming missioners and therefore sure you want to maintain reputationbut theres other scenarios what if someone didnt care about reputation suppose they had tricked a high sec missioner into flagging themselvessaid mission runner would never trust them again anyway so maintaining their reputation may not be as big an issue or theres those that just dont care take the ransom kill them maximise profit then move on everyone be damnedthe last two are certainly not how i preferred to do business but lets face it not everyones the same and ive seen known both those types of players in my timeanyway i figure that losing a t3 ship should incur a sp loss regardless of how  why  when thats the added price of flying this new technology and thats part of what adds the new exciting element to it i admit your point about this happening everywhere is valid its not going to happen in every fight not even most fights probably so maybe i was a little exaggerated in my op lolstill it seems that by denying loot killmail and saving yourself the sp loss whilst retaining the ability to save your ship should the tide turn in your favour during battleseems unbalanced somehow to me as ive been typing this i cant help but think that the selfdestruct warning could be clearer as well during a ransom scenario its not always easy to keep an eye on the log window and a clear timer in the top left of the screen would be very handy
maybe if theyd un break split weapon systems and eithera allow pilots to decide on a primary weapon system ie on a typhoon 8 guns  8 launcher slotsb decide what primary weapon system is supposed to be used and toss the secondary out the window 6 guns 2 launchers for the typhoonthings would then work a heck of a lot better
while i appreciate the effort to unpenalize ships with split weapon system i do not support your proposal because it would give ccp one more reason not to get rid of split weapon systems
love my typhoonhate your proposalnot supported
bumping want to see this topic and the related t1 balance issues addressed with thrasher being the only ship capable of filling its stated role frig killer the entire hull size needs to be seriusly looked at imo t1 destroyer should be able to eat t1 frigs and a match for a t2 assault frig but no real challange to a good crusier pilot t2 dssy should be able to eat assault frigs kill a t1 crusier but not be a serious match for a t2 crusier this is of course refering to attack type ships and not ships ment to performe a certain trick like the curse or rook
one viewthough yes it would be neat to be able to set up a roomsuitehalletc and decorate and such with things both found and playermade a la second life or even eq2 where things in place for sl style it could set up a whole additional economy
so now youre in the csm and my predictions kind of materialized alreadyi wonder what are you going to do and whenhow will ccp react 
hey teadaze i gave you my 2 votes at the elections only because i liked your idea for change of the local channelyou gave up on this now
nope it is still something i will support
well somebody must bring this up no
indeed they mustas i repeatedly stated during my campaign it is the job of the csm to take ideas raised by the players to the next available meeting argue the case to the rest of the csm and finally submit the supported ideas to ccp for development or rejection so far ive been asked about local changes by two other people and have told them to submit their proposal to the assembly hall then evemail me the link for review thus far nobody has stepped upi believe strongly in the process being followed correctly and if no player wants to raise this issue then i will be forced to support other issues from players who have
so be it if you are not allowed to do that ill bite the bullet myselfjust made the proposal ready to dodge laser fire now i somehow left with the wrong impression that this is the main idea in your campaign
it isnt so much that were not allowed more i dont feel it is appropriate for csm to support their own ideas over those raised by other players  supported the proposal and will assuming some people support it submit it for the first meeting next year the main ideas in my campaign were ensuring csm follow procedure and to try and improve communication instead of attempting to push my vision for any specific changes

i think this should have been a priority over lets say nice moon graphics or audio damage warnings or new ship skins so right you aresupportedi really hate all these new grafic gimmicks while lots of very serious issues for gameplay and balance still dont workhere is where the work has to be done
supported give us show war targets only
massively incorrect if there are no missiles currently in space and targeted at the pilot the launcher will stop cycling it will not launch if missiles are detected after it has been activated once it has cycled down the pilot has to manually reactivate itthe only way it will keep cycling is when theres a lot of missile spam with grouped missiles these days it can be far longer than the defenders launcher cycle time before another flight is detecteddefender missiles would be a viable fleet screening tool and should be enabled to do so missiles always hit for the same damage and as such can logically be given a counter drones can be popped by anyone in the fleet guns range  tracking jammed by anyone in the fleet missiles should be able to be shot down but not under the current mechanic by anyone in the fleet sacrificing a launcher slot for the purpose lowering their ability to dish out damageits not a nerf to missiles its just repairing an existing but hopelessly broken mechanic defenders cant even be used within 2040km due to their flight mechanic and incoming missile velocity
what he said
better idea remove them from the game altogether also remove fofs they suck too and have no purpose cept to get you dead in high sec or shoot your corpmates in null sec
emphasized a couple lines for flat lies missiles never hit for face damage they have an inbuilt counter in the fact that they are highly vulnerable to speed or signature tanking which cannot be negated by handy modules like tracking computers or enhancers the only things that positively affect missile damage are target painters and webs which are hardly missile specific boostsany if youre trying to pass off that boosting defender missiles isnt a nerf to missile boats youre out of your mind it still blows my mind that this keeps coming up despite repeated lack of support missiles are at a pretty sweet spot of balance right now relatively few complaints about being either overpowered or underpowered by most experienced players they have a nice niche for gang combat i would agree with removing defenders more than anything
asset logging is another area that is seriously lacking in corporation and alliance management it will be there one day maybe for eves 20th anniversary well see an expansion to add modest asset logging we could even call the expansion eve online the logs show somethingyes and no maybe a tier 2 starbase defense skill could exist to allow you to control more than just 5 modules but 5 is actually a pretty decent number the fact you only need two or three pos gunners to hopefully fend off a fleet of 50 seems reasonable to me honestly
not supportedmake the idea a bit more complex and i would support it something like reverse engineering of a corpse to salvage some implants
lol  all these people assuming its all about epeen  bragging rights when determining any campaigns success on a killboard how is it doneisk destroyed vs isk losswithout adding in potential billions of loss in implants the results are not validsimple as that
but it would require 2 kill mails then which kinda seems like clogging the lines 1 for the ship for the first kill then a second for the pod people dont die when their ships explodelord knows its annoying enough when people link 1 killmail let alone start linking 2
making capturing impossible untill all local defensive npc ships are destroyedmake local defensive npc ships stay within an xkm radius of bunker and recalculate available targets force the fw faction pilots to enter combat range instead of kitingrebalance npc defensive ship loadouts so that each race uses an even mix of both long and shortrange weapon systems also give ships with closerange weapons the effect of an ab so they are better able to close to an effective rangesort out ew properly ecm is the most powerful ew system ingame tdsd and tp fail epically in comparison
to be honest fw is what got me back into eve 1st on the caldari front and now in the amarr front it is a great system where you dont ever have to go very far to get a fight and thats what most of us love but the system is both flawed and brokento make my points and carry on the views of others lp rewards for both plexing and ship kills must be addressed after 359 minmatar kills over a weeks span earned me a total of 2000 lp when i saw it i thought it was just sad at that rate it would take me months to afford enough lps for a navy omenanother if the actual reward of claiming sov in a fw system make it mean something no one gives a damn about shooting a bunker unless your opposing fw group is there trying to defend it allow it to rebuke opposite factions ability to dock there think about it its a station controlled by your enemy dont you think you would be shot on sight the second you got out of ur poda third issue is the fw missions now i do agree that they have been farmed pretty bad but the current change makes the even worse the inability to find some way to decide what kind of mission and where it was located was a good thing for fw where the risk v reward of fw missions is tilted 1000 times more of the risk side you should at least give us something to find some way of making iskies while staying on the front lines like those before me we have stated many changes that should be addressed and thanks go for the csm that is fighting for us if you want to help make faction warfare useful listen to our advice were the ones playing your game least you can do is read and respond to our constructive comments

do not turn this into a caod style crapfest this is a problem affecting all players and we all must stick together as eve players and not smacktards to get this fixed who cares if its atlas or wi or razor or goons or it or aaa this thread is for the good of the game not for people to abuse each other full support start listening to your players ccp and actually have the balls to admit something is wrong you will get alot more respect then burying your head in the sand and pretending like nothing is wrong
return fleet warfare to something even remotely resembling pre dominion go back to module lag whatevergive us acknowledgement that there is an unacceptable issue and that you are working on it with regular progress updateswe all know lag as part of eve part of all mmos but its only acceptable when both sides are affected the same the situation we have now is that in most fleets greater than 100 approx those on grid experience minimal lag whilst those to hit grid last never get past the black screen this occurs on reinforced and unreinforced systemsjust to close im not saying you have to fix this here and now i understand the significant technical difficulty in large numbers of concurrent transactions to a single node all im asking is that you open a clear dialogue with those suffering that does include the lines our logs showed nothing

supportedfor the carebears that are ready to spam this thread with tears if you dont know if there is a pirate in system then the pirate probably doesnt know that you are in system it works both ways and is nerf and a buff to the attacker and the defender depending on how you use itif i see a raven on scan and i see a 50 sec in local chat then its party time if i see a raven in scan and cant find out who he is until i land on the same grid then i will probably leave it alone to avoid a horrible death as this raven can be another pirate as well think about itsupported supported supported
dscan  probes  and for example local tool that only show total amout of pilots in system would be sufficientsupported 
supportedshowing count just not the characters etc sounds like a good solution personally but any change being looked at would be welcomei dont actually believe the current intel tools would be all that insufficient without local  since it would affect both sides eg to take the piracy example its just as difficult for the pirate to find his target as it is for the target to find the pirate however this could be an opportunity to add benefit to developed sov systems by enabling new intel functions there since thats probably the main area where removal of local will be felt negatively
yet you forgot to check the support this topic check box when you posted
strongly supported this change years overdue
this proposal has my full support
ive said it before and ill say it again i will only support removal of local when a real intel system is created to replace it naked removal is a bad idea
not supportedcloaks already act as an intel diffusing tool you know there is a red there but you have no clue if he is even at his keyboard or what type of shipamend your proposal to seriously nerf the invulnerability cloaks give and i will sign upedit combat probes were created for gathering intel but they fail in the face of cloaks
supportedif somebody is cloaked somewhere in space there is a reason for you to not be able to see his dossier street address and his ten generation family tree chart
that isnt the point you know who is in local which corpalliance and you can add them to your address book to ensure when they leave local that theyve not simply logged off this is far too much power for what is supposed to be a communications toolif i enter a system in a covert ops ship i dont think anyone other than people within visible range of the gate should know im therecovert ops ships should be covert that is what the covert in the description means if you think that noncovert ops cloaks need to be nerfed then make a proposal
supportedproposal how to get rid of localprobably should have just put comments here instead of starting a new thread
i have a feeling changing local will make eve more about blobs as you will be less keen to engage someone when you cant see how many friends he has in local and in local of nearby systemssure you can see them on scan but idkunless a decent mechanic is designed to replace local im not supporting the out right removal of local
if it hasnt been looked at yet and discussed i would be surprised05 and up as is concorrod is running the show04  01 space delayed concorrod dont like sending techs down there so the equipment is down graded00 no local like wh space basic services to the people  there isnt even gate guns to people that look at it its a no brainer to those with a different reason really be honest and say why it should stay i didnt hear people in wh cry about the lack of there intel toolthere is still gate sound activation cloaked alt with sound turned upthere is an onboard scannerthere is still the use of your alliancecorp intel channelthere is still the use of a good old scout
to be honest the largest issue which sadly no one has said is the fact that fw missions face a much larger risk v reward than your avg lvl 4 mission runner the largest being is getting killed heading to or while even in the mission itself the current nerf to missions is just sad because of this were forced to accept a mission without even knowing if we could even get there to try to complete it so what happens if we fail the mission and cant complete it within the 12 hour time span well than were pretty much screwed allowing us to choose the missions to complete and what systems to do them in was one of the few fair ways of maintaining our isk flow which if u are really involved in fw pvp you need because constant combat means lots of lost ships these missions were originally put in place as a way for us to make money while still being in the war zone and not have to fly back to our mission hub for a few days to get 500mil or a bil to replace fleet losses just my opinion
supportedi didnt know about cva but the first thing that came to mind when i read the title was bob it should be a timer and a vote at least

fine nerf shield recharge time with the same patch i get xl shield extenders  considerably lowered fitting requ on shield transfers
not supported the game needs less nerfs to satisy people not willing to deal with things as they are or who wont figure out and implement creative solutions
what creative solution is there to beat a drake beyond fly up and pound the snot out of it before it does the same to you or gets awayas mentioned with most other ships you have various options to mess them up and make them ineffective andor kill them which is goodships have strong points and weak points drake your only choice is to pound away cant jam well you can but fof gives it some ability to fight anywayturret ships are totally defanged cant neut you can but what good will that do to a passive drake cant tracking disrupt not even sure if sensor dampers stop fof what else is there beyond bashing it
the passive tanked drake will not have mwd point or web if it does then it will not run them for long and will loose more than half its tank if its using invul fields for the omni tank in pvp a neut will easily turn them off as unless the thing had just undocked it will be low on cap constantly takes over half hour for it to rechargea passive tanked drake is a horrible ship for pvp for anything bar possibly surviving 2 cruisers even then those 2 cruisers will probably quickly kill itit also does  poor dps without any bcssand no i dont use a passive tanked ship anymore active tanked tengu for missioning for me and shield buffer drake for pvp
not supported the passive tank scenerio is a small niche that works well on very few ships for pve circumstances if you passive tank a pvp ship you will either be useless for anything but a tank no mwd point web dps or you will get kicked from any self respecting pvp corp for being such a noob
it is hardly a niche there are a lot more examples then just drakes passive shield tanked hics are only one of the things that spring to my mind there are also passive tanked myrmidons since even with a bonus on active armor repairers a passive shield tank is more useful in pve and those myrmidons are not that rare in pvp passive shield tanks are already very common in that ship class and that is not only because of the shield recharge but also because a passive shield tank is able to auto regenerate and has not the many drawbacks of active tanksso much for your small niche
youve mentioned hics oynx and the myrmthe last time i engaged a fully passive tanked myrm i had him to the absolute breaking point of the shield tank by myself in another bc if i had have remembered to bring the fury em missiles just had to be the one time i forgot i would have killed him easily he spent the entire time slowboating his useless self trying to get in blaster range as his drones were already dead when a hostile gang warped in i simply leftwith nothing to tackle other than a single point he was left dead in the water to any sized ship a battle ship with an ab could kite him absolutely useless other than possibly for baiting one or two ships and the back up had better come quick anything can get outta point range of it easilythe onyx is possibly a viable use for it problem is much like everyother ship that it caps itself out too quickbasicly if youre frightened of passive shield tanked ships in pvp youre doing something wrong
something must be done the large roaming gangs of passivetanked drakes are destroying everyone who comes against them we are all doomedsarcasmits a niche role for a few ships that has barely any effect on pvp outside of a few cases even then its usually better to just bring a different ship
considering my lolcaldari alt is getting ready to jump into a drake unsupported

how often can you make a new corp and join corps you are opening just to avoid a wardec is it ok to do this endless its sort of corp spamming if you just want to avoid war you could join a noob corp so in my opinion this should be reglementedi know someone who has stolen isk and ships and is wardeced every 2 days inside a different corp he opened just to avoid the wardec i cant believe that its ok for ccp that he is doing this endlesslyi see that there are some behaviour which is not allowed because its an exploit how about corp hopping then 
if he continually makes and closes corps to avoid declarations it is an exploitif he moves from corp to corp to corp to avoid war declarations it is not an exploitccp is too terrified of offending a few frightened crybabies to make war declaration flags persistent on a percharacter basis to prevent this continual exploit
so he stole your money and your shipsand he laughed at you then he hops corps to avoid your wardecand he laughs at you sounds like hes having fun and youre not stop chasing him and go have fun keep your eye open for opportunities in the future to ruin his day but dont let your enjoyment of the game be destroyed by a useless chase that you cant winwhat hes doing is not an exploit hes following the rules of the game in the same manner as the people who are wardecing him endlessly he pays the fees to open the corps the same as you pay your fees to wardec him
obv

not supported  the zephyr is fine as isas its a solar sail boat im guessing its engine is actually the large bright spherical mass found at the centre of all solar systems  not an inert mass of technology inside its hullall the comparisons made in this thread are based on failed assumptionszephyr is a spaceship in the same way an apple is a fruitshuttle is a spaceship in the same way an orange is a fruitan apple is not the same as an orange
the zephyr is a prototype gallente exploration ship a class of its ownthis could be the start of a new class of ships i have a feeling there will be more and better
i once made a wish on a spacegenie that this would happen to me every time i opened my ravens cargohold unfortunately the third time i did it the dancers mutineered and took control of the ship they refused to give it back until i agreed to fly them to jita buy them all drinks at 44 until they were nicely drunk and swore a solemn oath to respect working women for the rest of my eternally recloned lifeluckily one of them took a liking to me and decided to stay with me as my girlfriend sadly i lost her recently in a tragic accident involving a rogue drone a shipment of whipped cream and a faulty amarrian torture device
i am asking for a a passive defensive system that will give an otherwise defenseless ship that by the way is irreplaceable as of yet the ability to survive in a wormhole with other players as i said before not being targeted by sleepers is usless if anyone with a scanner can come in and instapop you the ability to fit cloaking devices is a entirly reasionable request also because of the nature of the zephyr there have also been reports of high sec suiciding simply because it is defenseless you are the one who is making the unreasionable request of dual bomb launchers not me
sweet jesus its this years snowballs and snowball launcher its a trinket a curiosity be happy it has any use other than hangar spinning it was free ffs
oh for crying out loud stfu  htfu it was free it is a ship that you pull out once in a while its a freaking nice gift from ccp cool effects and an interesting ship design nothing else the fact that you can fly with sleepers on its own makes the ship worth it want a cloak get a covert ops ship good grief
i dunno there were some serious balance issues with the snowball launcher given the disparities in base thermal resistance
i had an idea to improve cap stability and allow a greater fine tuning of shield and armor systems i propose the ability to set a auto repeat timer i am not proposing changing cycle times or module effetiveness but what i propose is the ability to st in seconds how often the autorepeat will trigger a cycle i have found it hard to manually babysit a xlarge sb while focusing on rats and scrambling frigs a delay timer will allow you to effectivly calculate the ammount of time needed regenerate your capacitor and effectivly make any fitting cap stable at the cost of fewer activations and reduced effectivness allowing you to focus on other things such as targeting and raping things
handling exactly that differs good from bad pilots bad pilots just switch the module on good pilots manage their cap
alliances need to be relooked at and changed so that an alliance is more like a super large corp rather than a bunch of corps that share a name 1 there needs to be a greater definition of alliance property versus corporation property outpostsystems are a prime example an outpost should be long to the alliance and not a corporation the alliance leadership should then be able to give roles to anyone in the alliance regardless of whether there in the executor corp or not to say make changes to a station or ihub or system and maybe even make it possible to restrict what systems a player has roles over 2 alliance organization this may kinda runoff the roles bit but regardless of what corp people are in in the alliance members should be able to join special organizations that help to further organize the alliance ie there can be a industrial group military group etc that exist in an alliance and its members are all part of different corpoartion so some members from corp a and corp b both join group a without having to leave thier respective corps3 alliance wallets this further runs off the above two suggestions the alliance leadership which can be a group of members from all different corporations in the alliance can choose to levy a tax or whatever they decide donations could be another option that goes into an alliance wallet it doesnt belong to any one corporation or player but belongs to the alliance so even if the person who manages the account leave the alliance or the corporation leaves the wallet will remain a property under the alliance the alliance can then choose to allocate fundings to different parts of the alliance system upkeep funding the different organizations ship replacement programs salaries etcwhat im saying is that currently an alliance seems more like a group of corporation under a single flag than its own intity given how 00 alliance work they act more like a single nation rather than a coalition of corporation so im saying the alliances should be given the tools to give it more options so that it can act like a nation

this is a great idea and as soon as you use its ability the ship takes control of you and starts firing at anybody involved in your fleet or just wipes your clone from the system and sends you back to a new character sarcasmim sorry but as much as id like my infested dominix to fly around even if its only a normal dominix with a different graphic ccp has made it clear that they will not be releasing rogue dronebased ships in a very rational and logical manner rp wise rogue drones dont befriend us messy pod pilotsdown with the fleshy scum they make a mess out of the holes they have and when you try to add more holes they make even more of a mess  drone commander 011101011

lol eves wiki has all the bureaucracy of wikipedia with none of the link forwarding while its admirable to put your role of representative before your own pet projects i think its a safe assumption that you were voted in because a significant majority of voters agreed with the issues you mentioned in your campaign if we wanted the csm to be a tabula rasa style representation wed just ask ccp to hire a thirdparty consulting company but thats just my opinion
but are you guys planning to demand a statement for rr aggressiondocking games etc i think that ccp have never actually commentedacknowledged that issue
in a way ccp have hired consultants just unpaid and drawn from the playerbase i never stated i would be pushing specific changes to the game in fact i was very very clear that proposals would have to be raised by the players themselves i always said my reasons for running were to ensure small gang pvp was represented in any discussions going on to increase communication to the players and maybe improve the image of the csm by specifically not using it as a platform to push my own vision instead accurate representation of the player raised issues again i tried to be very clear about this during the campaignif anyone wants to take me up on a particular issue raised during the campaign then they are free to post a proposal and pass me the link i will then take it forward to the csm on their behalf
this has been on my mind ever since before i was a csm candidate or the csm even existed ive put a lot of thought into the process and have come up with what i consider a very eloquent solution although its just the framework you can view the work ive put into it at the following linkdepots not all of the ideas are mine heck even the picture on the first page isnt mine however i did put a lot of thought into it so it should hopefully work out well
hell yeah
here is a picture that id done for my csm page but not completed i removed it from my agenda due to time contraints i hope it is useful in some way as it covers some of the ideas you have postedplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesalliances and corporations get a book mark library by default with 7 divisions that require roles to access which would come up in your bookmark menu this is to save database storage as bookmarks wouldnt be needed as items to give to people only members with certain roles could add edit modify view each division included would be a creator subtopic so you could see who actually made thempeople could also make personal libraries to share with friendlies or whoever link for those with images disabled in their forum settingstamber

its about time to fix this
mineral basket price has been climbingthe market will adjust itself
interesting how people dont realize what the main issue is here cheap minerals allowing insurance fraud to happen
ill agree insurance needs to be looked at again the specifics however are still unclearregardless posting to support the idea of an overhaul of the insurance system
this really really needs looking into total removal i dont think is the key but no insurance or half insurance for concord related death and for self destructing this might just have the added affect of making those annoying people who try and deny you a km by blowing themselves up from doing so in shortreduce insurance in total down to 95 of average traded mineral valuereduce payout by at least 40 for destruction by concord reduce payout by at least 50 for selfdestructed shipstaking into account my own ideas on this i fully support reform of the insurance system we should not be able to make isk off it
for every pod kill thats like saying killing teh support ships in a battle shouldnt be added as it clogs up the killboard if there is isk loss it should be reported to maintain accuracy of campaigns successes  failureshardly a success if you do 1 billion isk damage to the enemies ships but then lose one single pod that costs also billion to replacemeans youve broke evenat the moment killboards dont reflect this
be careful what you ask for guys someone came up with the bright idea that sovereignty needed overhauling and now its horrible once ccp starts changing things they dont always change them for the better
well i support but i really dont think ccp gives a  about anything in lowsecor that they ever will do anything even thou allmost 14 off the player are playing facwar and most off em think its needs fixingno not all off us wanna go blob in 00 it simply is not for everyone and if you make a game you should give them a choice and work for that they also have a good experience dont just say go to 00 if you wanna play and have things working
supporting this too though i cant help but think that ccp are either keeping fw so badly produced to drive people through into 00 or are simply incapable of programming a solution to their own problems
thats all i can do when i think about this issue and it getting fixed

yes this needs fixing as soon as possibleeven with rf nodes current 00 battles are just about who gets his fleet into the target system first wins pure and simple nonrf node can handle maybe 100 people rf node cant handle 250 fleet jumping into 250 fleetbeen in battles with 1000 in local predominion and the lag wasnt as bad as its now and at least everyone lagged the same then now if you are in system when hostiles jump in you get to enjoy shooting what are basically pilotless ships and the only question is how many you can kill before they ewarp to random safes and wont still be loading gridmaybe the current 00 population should simply move to mission hubs and camp the gates with drones out and occasionally shoot themselves so that empire mission runners get to experience the joy of waiting a hour to load the grid

i belive your wrong  no local in wormhole space is the best thing ccp has ever createdit makes everything possiblegaming expirience is just on a diffrent level and i have yet to see a blob warfare in there 
it is the point the local intel tool is 100 fair everyone gets the same amount of information there is no bias there the point about the cloaks is that they make people unprobable now as it is meaning that people have to rely on intel to even know of their existence there is no other tool to use to find out that they are there everything everything in this game is designed to have a counter without local what counter is there to cloaks both covert and normal i am not trying to make a proposal here i am saying that your change is an unbalancing change and it doesnt look at the whole picture
having spent some time in w space i dont believe that the removal of local  cloaks produce an unbalanced game infact i actually prefer the situation in w spacein w space you have to actually have to work for your protection etc i would suggest that the d scanner and the probing system does provide an adequate intel toolyou actually have to work for intel  good if you need intel and dont want to get it yourself then pay someone to get itw space isnt unbalanced  introducing the same in 00 wont make the game unbalanceddefinetly supported
not supported  ccp will break it if they try to fix it
theres a reason some ppl are and some are not in wspace if i enter a wormhole i know i wont have local so i keep an eye out for probes with the number of ppl going to wspace i dont have to be too worried though00 otoh is a busy place with lots of choke points everyone can warp to immediately gates and belts come to mind and ppl jump system all the time if you dont know cannot know who is on the other side youre only buffing the roaming pvperfor the one claiming removing local would favor both attacker and defender id say youre wrong all the attacker has to do is a simple directional scan towards the belts warp to them and kill the hulk ratter whatever if that same ratterminer would have to press his scan button every other second just to have a small chance of survival what do you think hed do pack his things and leave for highsecface it how much you want eve to be about cooperation gathering personal isk or brining up ones sec status is mostly done individually and personally i dont think you should want to change that it is after all a game you cannot force ppl to cooperate down to the lowest level on every mouseclick they do it will drastically change the game and they will leave either the game entirely or the parts that make them do things they dont wantpersonally i dont really need to be able to rightclick show info on everyone in local but only because our koslist is actively maintained if all the neutrals in our space would have to worry about all the other neutrals as they cant rightclick and feed them to the koschecker anymore it would depopulate providenceas it stands local is the only thing that makes 00 viable for a lot of ppl if i were to lose a freighter every week due to lack of intel id stop playing very very soon at least in 00i can fully see why nbsi entities and roaming pirates want to see local removed the first one will want some sort of intel on number of blue neut and reds though the last will only rejoice because of the free iwinbutton but currently imo it would destroy nrds
local as it currently stands gives you the information of who is in the system but not what someone is flying where this person is going or what this persons intentions are these 3 other facts can be derived from observing the system layout and the directional scanner therefore the only purpose of local is is telling you who is in the system with younow removing local itself a bad idea pveers lose their only intelligence tool pvpers sneaking up on ratters get a huge benefit especially when using recons this is just one example but other include 50 man gangs hiding cloaked near a gate promotion of usage of directional scanner bots etc in the end there needs to be some sort of intelligence tool the reason why this works in wormholes is due to the low amount of travelling players and the risk of attacking players is big due to the fact that the ambusher might not make it out alive as welldelaying local is something which might just work but the question is how long the delay should be if the delay cant be extended too long due to giving some parties the upper hand then the use of having a delay at all becomes a point of discussionas primary a pvper i actually like local in its current form as when used wisely it can also be used against your opponent sure it tells your potential victim that you are there but these people need to pay attention to this channel to avoid getting killed this means their safety isnt a guarantee and is determined by their own actionshowever if anyone ever comes up with an idea which could revamp the intelligence tools then id happily support this as long as it gives both sides the same information one idea i liked for example was one where blues reds and neutrals were displayed in numbers this removed the aspect of knowing who is the system but still knowing if this person is your enemy or notso as to this proposal im going to have to say no
bumping this because its that important

supportedand increase iq cpu for stupid ishtarone ship in eve which every fly with empty high slot
so true
the two main drone boats domi and ishtar both get a 20 drone bonus per level dont they id say a 100 damage at level 5 is a fair trade off for no rigs
only 10 damage bonus per level and the ships have so gimped fitting attributes that the drones are basically their only dps
thats not the case as has been stated above mebut even if it was the case there are plenty of boats with damage bonuses to weapons nightmare 100 along with the rigimplant damage bonuses why should drones be any differentid also love if the drone rigs negative affect was something besides cpu but whatever
why not
i feel naked without the api to tell me i am still breathing
while i havent been playing enough to worry about pos fuels or corp assets the api is useful for newer players like myself to plan our training and ship fittings as we improve without the api any changes we manually make to our characters in eft to determine what we need for stability dps etc have to manually be reset rather than simply reloading also because of api being down any changes to evemon plans fail to sync up with the game and give accurate indications of any skills ending during downtimemost problems with the api missing may seem minor but because of the amount of different ways that its used by so many players it is as integral to eve as docking and undocking and any issues should have been identified and corrected prior to release not stumbled over without explanation for a week afterward
signedthe api really adds to the richness and helps to alleviate some of the sheer tedium due to limitations of the userinterface it is realistic too as you should have various data tools and software at your disposal and options for 3rd party data management appsthis really needs considered a 247 mission critical resource like the market if the solution is hiring a few more very expensive expert adminsdata architects so get that coverage then thats money well spent

buddy list buddy  friend so why are the majority of buddy lists filled with war targetsas far back as i can remember adding known war targets to your buddy list has been standard practice knowing which targets are online is a great advantage however trying to keep all your own corp members updated on new or changed targets is a nightmare also adding all 5000odd members of goonswarm to your buddy list just isnt righti am suggesting an addition to the wars tab in the corp interface known targets or something similar this would be a similar style and usability to the buddy list except it would be available to view and be added to by any corp member in addition you might be able to add known pos locations or systemsstations where targets are known to operatethis would form a collective intelligence pool avalable to all members of the corp

to be honest i dont need the opinions of players because they can be as different as the both abovei dont whine about the fact that this player was stealing this is normal behavior in our eve universumbut opening corp after corp just to avoid a wardec shouldnt be possiblebut its part of the game until ccp is changing this which i would like to support or ask for herei have read very often that making new corps again and again is an exploit is that true and yes i would like to kick his ass in a normal legal way and really best would be if i could wardec a person  at the end i dont think that its much fun to open a new corp every 2nd day even if he is laughing at mebut wardec and corp making is quite cheap so this will be sort of an annoying endless game
this is not an opinion it has been stated by ccpclosing a corp and creating another corp is not an exploit he can make a new corp every day if he wants it is allowed
ok do you remember where this statement has been made  or who wrote it  because i can also read that it is an exploit
the original response can be found hereit reads in part
thank you for the link very interestingccp really should work on the mechanic to make it clear and not provide exploit listsstill i cant say that its really clear if you do corp spamming endlessly that cant be the way how it is meant to be imho
posting in a thread
heyi understand this has been brought up most likely tons of times yet im going to bring it up as well ccp has put a war function into the game which allows corporationsalliances to rage war upon whom ever they feel as long as they pay the feei find a problem with this how ever more then anything entire corporations will completely disband and go join either an alternate corporation they created or stay in npc corporations until the war is dropped and then they go back and resume there daily lifei can understand being war decked is not the funnest thing in the world especially when you are not a pvpcombat pilot yet at the same time the people doing this are doing it to make isk as well so here is what i proposei really do hope people will support my proposal or maybe come up with another idea to help prevent people from evading wars as it makes the game unfair to people who choose to do this i know you can get pvp by going to low sec or 00 but for some people that isnt what they want everyone has there personal preferences and mine happens to be empire warsthanks for your timerecoil iv
supporting my topici wanted to add to my original post above that what is the purpose of declaring war on a corporationalliance if they can disbandevade the war then recreate after its over it defeats the purpose of the entire war declaration function in the game
war declarations are so hopelessly broken that nothing less than a complete revision of the mechanic will suffice to fix their issueshalf measures like this one will just make parts of the problem worse
1 this is horribly broken no way in hell are you getting much support2 learn to line break more
i will never support wall of text no matter how good it can be
i love this idea id like to see it expanded even further into a true tactical displayin tactical mode youd get the velocity vectors but youd also have no models load every ship would be represented by an icon for its type color according to standing with the appropriate velocity vector
anything that npcs sell and that can be refined is a potential price ceiling and insurance provides te floor on the other endthis is inhibiting to the free market spirit of eve and can definitely use some attention
so put some time into it and come up with an actual proposal rather than this extremely weak effort
thiswhat items are you claiming are imposing a price cap what is that cap
ok as our csm delegates cant be bothered i took 3 minutes in game and did a little research on this im not wealthy enough to look at the really big items like the actual pos modules so i only looked at a pair of the guns1 the small beam laser battery costs 450000 isk on the npc market it perfectly reprocesses to 3406 isogen this would cap isogen at 13212 isk2 the medium pulse laser battery costs 1800000 isk on the npc market it perfectly reprocesses to 7812 isogen this would cap isogen at 24041 isk3 isogen in the region i happened to be topped out at 6689 isk per unit in the last 365 days its currently trading for about 50 isk per uniti dont think 1975 of the last years high price is a comfortable level the eve economy is just way too crazy for such a close cap was that so hard i still cant support this topic and i still think the csm is wasting its time talking about this a little research and thought would have led to a much more effective proposal remove the npc market and seed the bpo maybe
not supported fix the game killer issues like grid lag and balance issues first atleast the last would be a statistics tasking imo
if you could start by first identifying which ceilings are in place that are actually being capped then you might have a case but as it stands youre asking others to do the work for youyou go and find some caps crunch the numbers and then come back to us with actual data about what youre talking about having any change on the market as it stands
thank for the effortit is possible to log on sisi the test server and try all the stuff there as everything cost 100 isk on the test serverprobably ccp could do a database query and check this stuff much more precisely than us then there is the problem hos you calculate the price ceiling for items using multiple minerals if this can be done with very few hours of work and a database query i am in favor of the check so tentatively supported
great strawman bro a mastercraft is going to be 20ft  lets see a 12ft powerboat pull 1500 lbs out of the water in 5 seconds against its own wake or lets start comparing the mastercraft to an 18ft skiff or a tornado and see which is more agile protip not the mastercraft
thats why i compared the laser to the whaler roughly the same length and same speed depending entirely on size of the whalers outboard
walking in stations just isnt appealing to me kiosks  bars with the occasional back room deal or gambling sounds novel at best personally i think its a waste of time id much rather see the integration of a first person shooter implemented into the factional war zones ahs

makes sense to me i like it
on the subject of the drone repair thingyi think the repair function should be automatic and it should be based on the amount of damage a drone has sustained in a fight there should also be a command to have drones rtb for repairs and cycle out accordingly for examplea fighter is out and is taking heavy armor damage the carrier pilot sees the damage building and commands the fighter to come back for repairs it lands and immediately undergoes repairs since it has only taken shield and armor damage it only needs some repair paste and a quick shield recharge after a few minutes it hits the launch tubes and goes back out into the fightalso it would be kinda interesting if we could have fighterdrone production facilities on supercarriers similar to pegasus on bsg supercarriers could providing they have the necessary resources to do so produce drones and fighters to replenish ones lost by other pilots i dont know if this would break the game or anything but it would enhance endurance of fleets im not a capital pilot yet so ill let the cap pilots debate this
come on i know there are ore ppl out there that want this
great will they also make it so you can assign and accept contracts to yourself right now i need 3 contracts contract the ship to an alt have the alt set up the courier move ship complete courier contract ship back from alt to selfalso support for the op

you can control the fov with the ctrlzoom function the problem is that the max fov has been reduced take a look at this image it is taken with the new fov limits it is a 12801024 image superimposed over a 38401024 image both taken on a dominion clientnote i have stretched the 12801024 image to illustrate the loss of vertical fov but the aspect ratio of both images remains unchanged
supportedi would merely suggest tying the payout to be 80 at max payout of the 20 day moving average at the time of payout this would prevent people from spiking the price for just a day to attempt to manipulate the market they would need to do it for days on end to shift it up

an irony about this issue is that rl capitalism dictates that ccp needs to keep some level of socialist regulation in the game to ensure players can still play a game they enjoy and hence keep paying their subscription feesyou could look at it as a balance between pvpers who will only put up with so much grind to pay for their ships and industrialists who will often have multiple accounts an indicator of this balance is shown in the plex markettheres a lot of capitalist chest beating in this thread but sticking dogmatically to any ideology will run you into problems eventually a truly free market economy is likely to go through periods of boom and bust and you should be asking what affect that would have on subscription ratesno support from me though there was a very sensible suggestion about replacing rat loot drops with bpcs thus removing a mineral fountain from the gameeditthe insurance system isnt great and id support an overhaul but dont think that the implications of removing the last mineral price floor has been thought through in this thread
wow just wow
yet more irony 
lending support insurance values are currently arbitrary and need at least some kind of update
remove insurance in its current npc incarnationimplement a new form of contract that enables monthly premiums to be paid and payouts to be granted on ship destruction opening up the insurance market to players and player corporations we need more sandboxedit this would allow pvp alliances and corporations to handle the logistics of their ship reimbursement programs much easier as well

signed i have an idea but idk how well it will work
i agree there are many issues that need to be fixed with faction warfare there are some things that can be done that are be debating if they are exploit or not but there are things that are already deemed as a exploit by ccp and are still being used by players example the login exploit which has been around since the start of faction warfare is still being used this should be a easy fix but ccp has yet to fix it if someone is in enemy territory and logs in the navy should announce them as entering system and attack them which they currently do not and never have i have seen this done numerous times and also have been victim of it as well i also feel that if a person is in the militia regardless of which side they are on if they enter enemy territory they should be attacked by the faction navy regardless of there standings i have seen numerous players roam through high sec without the navy attacking them they are a enemy and should be attacked they should also not be able to dock at npc stations belonging to their enemy within enemy territory specifically high sec stations and those stations should attack them regardless of standings if someone is in enemy territory and logs in the navy should announce them as entering system and attack them which they currently do not and never have

you may make comparisons with wh space as soon as low sec00 gates randomly change location and to which system they connect need to be probed out remove the mapap and get a mass limit until you do that it just means the attacker gets easy kills since he knows exactly where the carebears are which is why it doesnt become anything harder for the attacker but the pveers have basicly no way of knowing where the attacker is and no it shouldnt be needed to have alts at every gate so the end result is just that you need to go to high sec lvl 4 missions to make decent income and the end result for the pveers who want to adapt and stay in 00 they can be smashing the dir scan button every 10 seconds that would be about as terrible game design as advanced learning skills or not including dedicated servers for a pc shooterhighly unused blackops please inform aaa of that while now without us being able to cynojam every system they probably might start using titan bridges more i see their blackops often enough used to hotdrop everything that is movingi fully agree that local shouldnt be an intel source but a chat channel however untill there is suitable replacement which does not force you to smash a button every 10 seconds and some people will actually call that skill it is just a terrible idea to remove local that only is the complete opposite of the goal of dominion and barely anyone will profit from it on the long run sure in the beginning the gankers get alot of easy kills they happy their victims do high sec missions everyone sad and while it would be nice when you can for example ambush another fleet since they didnt know you were there it also promotes blobbing and metagaming and i think we have enough of both in eve easiest way to find out what your opponent has is just asking the spies
you have no idea what you taking aboutit much easier to get a fight without local  fight that is not one side bloband no lonely hulk or lonely ratter arent suppose to be safe in 00 
it is also much easier to blob someone since it is trivial to hide 100 people with no local and current mechanics so you think income in 00 is too high and should be nerfed for 90 of the normal players solo rattinganomaliesexplorationwhatever is how they make their isk but apparently they should be ratting in groups
1 thus i proposed local actually givin number of pilots in system but not their namescoprorationsfavorite food and names of their dog2 go back to npc corp if you wanna solo3 income is broken for 00 becuase of lvl4 but its a diffrent story and has nothing to do with local4 singel ratterhulk in 00 is not suppose to be safe
1 number of neutrals is only sufficient if you shoot every neutral if youre nrds you have to either know who the neutral is or expose the entire kos list  maintain a difflist together with the other entities in your part of the galaxy sure it can be done but for instance cva already reaches the limits of the standings slots maintaining those standings will be mission impossible for the smaller entities due to lack of manpower2 ah you really do want to depopulate 00 either that or youre playing a whole other game than furb killer and me are3 whether or not income in 00 should be compared to lvl4 i will leave out point is income is always in important factor the ones who are eager to remove local are the ones wanting to kill ratters and miners if youre only after pvp fleets why do those get shot so often and the ones who are vehemently against it are the ones who need to not lose a ship every 5 minutes to every random passerby without a realistic and spamming the directional scanner isnt means of getting out if i wanted to grind lvl4 missions i would do so youre trying to force me to do missions as youd break 00 even more4 there is a huge difference between not safe and sitting duck hulk and ratter already arent safe they have to constantly be on the lookout for hostiles to have a moderate chance
supported the only reason i ever use local is for pvp intel and to that extent its overpowered i can be plexing in a lowsec system for hours without having to watch my back but suddenly when someone pops up on local i know to start hitting the dscan for probesget rid of it imo its redundant as a comms channel anyway
actually scratch that make it like wspace but you can talk in local anonymously if you choose instead of names and avatars others would see a signature identifier like you do when probingfor example531abc anonymous whos out theregallenteguy12345 i am my name is gallenteguy12345 and you can see my bio by clicking on my name531abc anonymous thanks for the info
this thread is about boosting piracy some more because what we need is more ways to empty lo sec and 00 quickerand then we can whine and ask why is everyone in hi sec space
no and then the next rallying call will be to move all level 4s to lowsec then all level 3s and so forth pirates these days are lazyok so i have thought about this some more and there really needs to be a system of acquiring intel thats better than smashing scan every 5 secs perhaps a probe you launch that constantly checks for pings from other probesidk but basically all other things being equal no party should have an inordinate amount of load placed upon themthat means that someone in system should not have to spam scan every 5 secs to counteract what a pirate does in local which is launch one probe system scanner probe press scan and find out if something is thereit has to go both ways not just one
right because noone moved from hisec in to wspace which is now completely deserted
something i do a lot of is to divide up the refined loot from an op amongst the participants what i find tiresome after a long session is the maths usually resorting to desk calculator to split the stack equallysimplest proposal would be the addition of a very simple divide by calculator to cut the stack in half say it would have to be within the dialog and only require the typing of the divide by factor a sighly more comprehensive solution would be to be able to split the stack into the number of piles you specify rather than just dividing it oncewould make the looters job much more pelasant i reckon
certainly that would be a nice feature  the ability to do that in one go would be great  its a small thing perhaps but one that would be most useful for me certainly has my support

walk everybody through the process the same way the guy did with the moon exploit and theyll be forced to react to it quicklyotherwise while they know about it theyll do nothing just as they did nothing for years when fully aware of the issue with moon materials
i like the idea about changing the trajectory of a warpin to go around planets or moons even better yet set it up so that you drop out of warp at a very high speed and have to perform some type of braking maneuver around the planetmoon to allow your ship to slow down enough to dock at a station i think that would be kinda cool as far as worrying about gankability it would be impossible because you would be traveling way too fast for anyone to target you and every ship having different masses based on their fitting would require different speeds and trajectories to accomplish the same thing therefore eliminating the possibility of engagement once out of warpthe only time this would apply would be when warping to something in low orbit of a celestial body or when a celestial body is directly in the way
maybe at once we could also solve the warpthrough problem with having a ship go around the sayd planet at lest clientside we anyway dont have ships stopping in midwarp

i think it would be a good idea to have skill sets and addon for crews in the larger ships example you have a raven and it requires crew members to load torps well you could be able to purchase specialized crews or crews could gain experience though combat making them more effectiveanother idea would be purely ascetic first person view out of your ship including a little bridge image or something alsowhat about salvage drops from structures or at least rigs for them and crews for them as wellgood or bad
i agree that the war dec system needs to be over hauled
interesting proposal however i spot a loophole if im understand your proposal correctlyif the wardecced corporations has to pay back the money when a certain number of people leave then they could easily put all money into the ceos account and drop out a few members having to pay nothing and being clear of a wardecmy own suggestion to ccp is to make it so that every member who leaves the corporation gets a continuous killright on his head till the time the corporation is wardecced making corp hoping a thing of the past
i like the concept but not the implementation i would say limit the kill rights on the exiting members to 7 days or the duration of the wardec whichever is shorter it still gives the agressing time to kill the exiting toons and while it wont completely remove corp hopping it will make it far less usefulthe problem of course is this requires ccp to revise the war dec mechanic so that it applies to individual people rather than just corporations or alliances though that could be interesting since hiding inside npc corps could be the next thing that goes on the chopping block
i cannot support a buff to wardecs when its obviously an easily exploited system to begin withit is way to easy to wardec and even more so too easy to grief with ithonestly i refuse to support changes that do not solve that problem
this sadlyjunk the whole illogical byzantine ludicrious system and start again from scratch
thisthanks for saving me typing
though i agree that its a broken mechanic as i see it the wardec system is not root of this complaint its the fact that rational minds will avoid conflict when they see it as a lost cause players avoiding your wardec is a natural behavior and constraining them by an arbitrary system will not change thatno matter how clever you are no matter the rules that the game has in place if people dont want to fight you they wont they will just find new ways to evade

hi everyoneas a pve and light pvp player it came too my attention that in fights you can often loose your drones as a result of combat fatigue when you need too replace those drones it always revolves about docking and shipping them into the dronebay thru the fitting screenwouldnt it be a great idea too jettison the drones and scooping them up in a dronebay when in spacei like not too see the drones being able too be shifted from the cargobay directly too the dronebaycoz i think there must be always a certain risk in this game and also for this movethe potential for pve and pvp is there and if there can be a discussion thread about it we can evaluate the pros and cons at the endremember only through this forum will this issue ever be layed on the table of the devsccpregards freelancer117

fully support destroyer lovelower sig more tank another tank slot
destroyers should have a minimum of 2 medlow slots coercer and cormorant get boned well no just coercer gets boned cormy can fit abpointweb coercer can fit
support on principle debatable as to specifics dropping the rof penalty may or may not stick them in the overpowered category sig radius and grid improvements are desirableteadaze youre in agony  the ones with the excellent dessie woflpacks class  would be interesting to see your input here
thrasher is amazing leave it alone catalyst could use some extra cpu and something other than the falloff bonus cormorant could use a bit extra pg or a new low slot coercer could use a med but its pretty good as it is too these are alpha ships tho 25 rof penalty is fine
ok lets all take a step back and look at the problem itself  repackaging a rigged ship there is no need to make an entire new class of ship to fix this ccp wont devote the isk literally and manpower for a convenience issue it would just cost them too much and only fixes a niche market problemi think a better solution would be allow rigged ships to be repackaged problem solved and there is no addition of a super high sec carrier that needs bpos manufacturing balancing rebalancing skill books training etci do agree that something should be done but an entire empire super carrier with 20km3 of cargo is a little over the top not trying to troll here just a different perspective in it
i agree with the above poster the effect that a ship like this would have on markets is also immense and to be honest 20 fully fitted battleships is simply too high as it stands a proper midsized freighter not the orca but more like a jf a little larger with jf like agility is still lacking in the industrial department
if you repackage a rigged dominix then what is it a dominix to be sold on the market etcas far as i understood the database structure from a previous bpobpcthread a repackaged item has zero attributes other than owner and location once you unpack it the item gets the additional properties assigned damage me pe max runs rigs etc in a separate table this is also why it is impossible to show bpobpc in the assets listso im not entirely sure what would be the easy fix a new ship or a complete database overhaul
yes

problem summary inactive unpaid accounts continue to accumulate agent rewards ie datacores this had a similar issue ghost training which was resolved a few years backproblem impact done on a large scale a person could have numerous accounts loaded with 3 characters each that produce datacores to the tune of 350 million per month in passive income in itself this is not a problem the problem is that the person could stop paying for the account and still continue to receive the passive income typically these accounts are dormant for around 6 months to a year at which time the owner reactivates them and cashes in the datacores earning billions of isk for the cost of a single gtcthis drastically deflates the cost of datacores for those of us that produce them on paid active accounts and make a living through invention production or t2 industry furthermore ccp loses out on revenue by allowing this to continue the solution freeze agent rewards for inactive accounts in the same way skill training is frozen

i agree this issue is way more important than moon graphics hands down currently overview tuning is extremely inflexible it makes it so difficult to be able to enjoy pvp in high sec where there are so many neutrals this issue certainly needs to be addressed by ccp programmers pvp players do get improvements in this area here and there last patch gave us some nice additions to fleet management very nice little things that make life of pvpers so much easier dont let me stop you there give us more 
this isnt just about what to fix about faction warfare its about when not soontm not three years from nowi was watching the fanfest videos a day or so ago and in watching the one talking about dominion although its already out i heard something interesting the reason that ccp decided to roll with the sovereignty overhaul was because the coming of dust 514 and the interaction with eve made it necessarygranted not even ccp knows how or if dust will affect faction war yet  but lets presume that theres a high likelihood they will so my argument is that the same principle ought to apply to fw as did to 00 sovereigntyapocrypha 11 brought in some changes that were an attempt to address some of the issues but also brought in unintended consequences that have been considered detrimental to the fw environment but perhaps the biggest problem in my mind is the timing the patch should have been done for empyrian age 1x not apocrypha almost a year later even if they were smaller incremental changes they would have combated the nagging worry that ccp had abandoned fw that existed before the patch and because the shape of the battlefield can change in a week or a day ccp needs to be watching fw closely and be responsive to changes it took at least a couple weeks before the storyline team noticed intaki had fallen to the caldari and longer for them to move ahead with the storyline appropriatelytldr be more attentive to the state of fw and make sure the players know its getting attention push more numerous more frequent and if need be smaller incremental updates to handle issues that can be handled in this manner prioritize items players consider to be exploity and push those out in the current patch cycle dominion 1x commit to the release of a larger fw overhaul before the dust 514 release preferably within a yearthe priorities in my opinion for said overhaul are these however you dont have to agree with them to vote up the proposal a complete revamp of the plexing mechanic so that it is more fun interactive and cant be gamed by single speed tank interceptors and the like the addition of gameplay consequences for captured systems pvp kills have a reward and affect the outcome of system occupancythe specifics are best left to other proposals of coursedisclaimer im back on a 5 day promotion pass too poor to subscribe so i may not be around to update this much ive jumped back to fw for the duration and it was good to see the current action but it doesnt change my evaluation of the flaws
wholeheartedly agree communication is key if any kind of satisfaction is to be felt by customersplayersapproaching two years and the only changes made so far have been ccp fixing bugsflaws that they themselves created by accident  fw is in serious need of worki posted my vision of how i would like fw to be keeping in mind the current bottlenecks flaws and loop holes while of the points can be used separately it is thought out as a packagedealdoesnt take much to make combat intense cheap fun and educational  let the sun rise once more please the darkness consumes us
not much else to say that the op hasnt already covered sosupported
moar please
i think the insurance system as is should be removed and replaced with a player driven system
hello csm and fellow eve playersupdated opanother solution would be a global training cue being able to add modify and delete skills from the global cue enabling you to be more flexible instead of logging out and in and better utilizing your accounts alts
on the one hand as a single account player i would like to have thison the other hand i realize this would cut into ccps bottom line marketing even endorses the use of multiaccount alts with the recurring power of 2 promotionso not voting up because i think it has a snowballs chance in hell however if some mechanic could be introduced to make multiple accounts still attractive this might gain more traction top of my head ideas include training alt characters at half speed or some purchasable token that enables singleaccount alt training
1 lowsp alts are still highly useful2 if you need sp on an alt you can train them at any time you wish3 i support the idea of the skillqueue being for the account not for the character to make training across alts easier but absolutely not multiple alts training simultaneously
only way i could see this being agreed to would be if the training time was split between the various charactersfor exampletrain 1 character  normal timetrain 2 characters at once  double time for bothtrain 3 characters at once  triple time for all 3if your proposal is for all the characters to be able to train at the same time at the normal speed then i seriously doubt youre going to get much support much as i as a single account player would love this itd unbalance the game as it currently stands too much to supportor you could just train your main to be able to do the alt tasks you want to be able to perform it doesnt take that long to train a combat pilot to be able to fly a hauler when he needs to for example
wow is that way not supporting
youre wrong drake everyone knows thats the way to hello kitty online wow is the other wayalso not supporting one of the things that sets eve apart from all the other mmos is the training system dont you dare break it
i disagree with this in every way being able to train two profilestoons at once will not cut into or make two account less attractive look at most people that run two accounts they use them both at the same time to either have more help in pvp or be able to pull in more while mining or do both at the same time pvp and mine also for the people who dont have a tone of money or time to play and pay for it plex it makes the game much less attractive cuz you are really stuck doing one thing cuz it takes to long to train multiple professions on one toon i know many people in our gaming guild that tried eve and liked it but because you pay so much just for training one toon in one direction they left for mmos that gave them options to train multiple professionsclasses on one account which makes the game more fun rather than being stuck doing one thing i really think the council should really weigh this matter again and think how many more people my stay playing if you gave them more options in toon direction from the start i also dont want to hear you can change direction at any time i know you can but it will take you years of training to be able to do two professions well on one toon and you know it
grumbles dyslexia sucksand to further des point the biggest problem we have right now is people pushing for faster training and the rampant rmt going on with charswhile i dont mind the fact i could train more than one alt without having the temptation for paying for additional accounts i dont see this as a desperate need nor a rational one
how would it unbalance the game using multiple accounts does because you can be online at the same time having dual characters on one account means you can only use one at a time the only thing it would significantly change is the fact that ccp receives less income from altaccounts but only marginal because dedicated alt users will prefer using a second mainanother solution would be a global training cue being able to add in that particular toon modify in any toon and delete in any toon skill from the cue enabling you to be more flexible instead of logging out and ingive me a good argument against my first proposition other than money wise
lolnot supported
thats another thing for so long people have been complaining about rmt  people selling toons lets just fix that problem by removing it and letting people train more than one toon at a time the whole reason why that even came about was because people could not train more than one toon at a time so people started to buy them its a sick cycle and it needs to endhow can people say that eve is so different and take such pride in it when it comes to training and such when you can just buy everything even toons stop limiting people and give them options and you will find these work arounds like buying toons will be less of an issue im sorry for being kinda a jerk with the way im wording this but just rather sick of the entire thing and wish people would stop supporting the very thing that people exploit such as toon trading ive met people on here that have 5 accounts and sell 3 toons every 3 to 4 months for billions of isk which allows them to make isk and pay for all their accounts in iskplex and ccp supports this rather than let people train more than one toon epic fail in my opinioni find it lol when people yell about afk miners that ccp dont support but toon miners as i like to call it yields a much higher profit and ccp does support it
i support the discussion but not the original ideai would love to have the ability to start training on character a then at a later date start training on character b without having to log off log in as character a pause training then log off log in as character b and finally start training on character ba perfect solution would be to allow skills for multiple characters to be queued up from the training queue interface a nearperfect solution would be to have training automatically start on the nextlongest training queue any time one training queue is finished
i could back this idea  managing all three characters training from one queue but as mara says not multiple characters training at one time on one account
i agree to both the original proposal and  think of it as mind shock there should be some risk involved brain thermodynamics if you will the body in the end has limits if you push those limits via greed or boredom there should be some risk involved love the idea but it would need a nerf out of the gate
this
i support this for my limited play time i struggle between making isk pveing and pvping in fountain its a real pain to time them
i support the idea
support both the op and the first post both solutions seem good
while id very much enjoy the reduced time i think jump clones are a powerful utility to begin with simply having the ability to jump makes a massive difference in gameplayi think the 24 hour timer is sensible as it restricts abuse of the system but isnt overbearing it does force the player to choose wisely and plan aheadand it can definitely be a frustration but i dont think dropping it by an hour here or there will make that big of a difference in the mechanic the order of magnitude ie one day vs half a day vs six hours is such that someone is still going to miss action somewhere because they jumped the night before theyll feel slighted because they cant jump back and then were back here arguing whether it should be reduced to 12 hoursby planning ahead ive been able to minimize the frustrations of the wait time so im going to withhold support for now good idea in concept i just dont think its necessary
jumping twice in 48 hours just means youll have a 1000 strong fleet of goons on your door then when theyre done beating you up for three hours theyll be on someone elses door across the other side of the galaxyextend the jump clone timer to 40 hours

supported because it is not in our best interests to not bring as many pilots as possible to a fight such battles will only ever get bigger these issues of grids not loading after an hour of sitting there will become more and more common and paying customers will leaveone question i have though can predictive grid loading be implement so that the moment you initiate warp the destination grid starts to load the server knows the destination grid because it has to calculate the flight ending point it knows if bubbles are present etc it should follow then that it should know the location type vector standings etc of all entities on that grid and be able to updated the client enroute its a bit more difficult when dealing with jump bridges gates and titan portals but that could still be overcome by loading the destination grid once you arrive on the starting grid so if you were in ul4ks at say the gate from di9hj and you warped to the k25xd gate the instant you initiate warp the server starts feeding you destination grid information upon arriving on the grid with the gate to k25xd it starts loading the gate grid in k25xd at the ul4ks gate because you may make the jump if you then warp off to a different location the client dumps the now unnecessary datayes this would increase cpu and memory load on the client and the server tooand could translate into a diminished but not catastrophic playability from time to time because you could have 2 different grids loaded into memory at a time that said if it allows for a smoother transition and eliminates this poor performance weve been seeing im all for it
hell ill throw in my support because i love the why iz evry1 in h1ghsec11 threads lets keep asking for stupid mechanics that make it even more difficult for anyone other than pirates in low00 sec without replacing it by something that could even remotely even the playing fieldthere ya go i support this thread lets make it happen
supported eve is supposed to be harsh there is nothing harsh about seeing every potential threat and knowing tones about him
a extra 2 centsif you own the space and have sov  beacon  a security upgradeyou get a warning of a neutral or enemy entrying your space in local sen you paying the gate feesso if someone red to your alliance entrys then a red icon comes up in local window no name ect just the red icon make a neutral grey friendly goes blue so no count of number of people no name list just the icon if you got the upgrades
supported but i think it should be kept in lowsec and it should be available as a strategic upgrade for sov holders in nullsec
im a bit of a nub so this might not workbutit seems to me that most agree local makes no sense at all and is not the ideal way to handle intelligence gathering one of the primary issues in wormhole space however is that you can get extremely good intel if you mindlessly spam the directional scanner which is boring bad for the servers and honestly equally stupidthe second most pressing issue imo is that the attacker has an unfair advantage without local as he knows when to start spamming the directional scanner and the defender must do it constantlyi propose the following1 kill local id prefer it not even give you a pilot count2 put a cooldown on the directional scanner somewhere between 10seconds and a minute id prefer a minute3 and this is the important one if your ship is identified by the directional scanner your warned that youve just been scanned its an active scan and as such ought be detectable this adds a cost to the directional scanner if you find someone theyll know
perhaps a compromise would be to add a drop down box when you ask for a mission which allows you to choose which system the mission will be in to balance it however if you choose a specific system then you cannot refuse that mission that is offered without a standings penalty ie you dont get the standard free refusal once every 4 hours when using this optionalso not sure if the standings penalty is still in place if you fail a mission by running out of time if it is then that part should be removed while keeping the penalty if you deliberately quit
yes and before you guys come in about server lag  the computations for this feature could exist solely on the client sideif all you are doing is reallocating assets using the information that you already see and would do manually even if someone hacked the client to change the automatic allocation so what its only your assets that got restacked a little
perhaps something as simple as typing in 15 instead of 1500 in the divide stack window and the client is smart enough to know you want a part of it and do the calculation for yousigned
good idea supported
i am all for it may also want to think about having it more customizable so not only do you split up loot but can also use it for other things as well
great suggestion would save a lot of timesupport
indeed this makes all sorts of senseyou should have a couple of options when you shiftdrag default is just quantity but there should be a button that changes the quantity field to a stacks field you input the number of stacks and voila its equally divided into that number of equal stackshaving a second option separate x would be handy but i dont think would be as intuative so youre wanting to give your hauler a 30 cut and everyone else 12 youd divide the stack twice
this the whole bob thing was before my time however it was still ridiculous to read about now with a cva hack on top things need to be done
yeah why didnt anybody think of this before
im not asking for a complete change in shieldarmor tanking mechanics im asking for the pirate implants to be balanced one way or anotheralso with the upcoming mom boostdominion 11 this will now also be the same issue with mothershipsalso remember those eft values are with gang bonuses instantly applied to armor while shield bonues have to slowly recharger over a very long period of timealso i dont have any titansuper cap pilots nor do i have any desire to train for them that being said its still a glaring imbalance and why i brought it forward
leaving them with a full rack of high slots for any support or capacitor warfare and a fully unused power gridthere are ups and downs to drones and a damage rigimplant will just make them overpowered removing the downsides to certain modules is a silly idea id like my lasers to not use capacitor like your drones if were changing things
drone damage needs buff
which do no damagebut do take up power grid not to mention plates and abmwdlike the limited number of drones one can carry and the limited durability of said dronesno it will just make them poweredi cant overheat my drones and i can only carry a limited amount and if i decide to lose my high rack of weapons for rrneuts then all it takes is for a couple of smartbombs to completely wipe out my total dpsid sure love an untargeted aoe mod that could wipe out your rack of lasersthis doesnt even make any sense so i cant respond to itall in all dying to a domi with no blasters is like being killed with a spoon1015 damage rigs 135 dmg implant to all and 135 dmg implant to lightmed and heavysentries will not overpower drones2 t1 drone damage rigs along with a 5 dmg implant all and 5 dmg implant heavysentry would give a flight of ogre iis a base dps of 15368 up from 1152 base again base dmg not taking any trainingdrone boat bonuses into accountwould you care to compare that flights dps against the base plus rigsimplants damage from a full rack of your t2 pulses

currently the wardec mechanic in eve is very simplistic someone wants to declare war on a corporation they declare war and the fighting starts until they decide it should stop people try to avoid wardecs by corphopping people use neutral alts to aid them in fights capitalizing on flawed aggression mechanics wardecs as they currently stand are a onesizefit all attempt at enforcing pvp which lacks the subtly or options to make it a truly useful option i would propose a number of refinements andor improvements for the wardec mechanic to give it a complexity of goals purposes and tacticspolitical refinementsfirst political entities in eve range from the player to the corporation to the alliance from smallest to largest any of these entities should be targetable in a war participation in the war does not automatically confer to any higher political organizations in which you are a member allowing for wardecs against individual players allows for spies or corp thieves to be punished and add further flexibility to escalating wars more to follow it also allows for pilots to be targeted during a war and expand the war to effect them one example would be neutral rr alts these pilots can now be wardecced individually no matter if they are in another corp or an npc corp making them actually have to participate in the war instead of exploiting neutral rr mechanics this system would also allow for corps to prosecute their own wardecs separately from the entire alliance if needed for example if pilot joe steals from my corp i can dec him his alts and his mother if i so choose but my alliance does not necessarily have to join in the waradditionally this mechanism allows for a way to handle corphopping if corp a and b are at war and pilot z leaves one of the corps the game automatically generates an individual wardec against that pilot for the remainder of that pay period for the war whether it be 6 days left or just 6 hours this works no matter which side the leaving pilot is on aggressor or defender the same mechanic also handles corps leaving alliances during a war at the end of the pay period the opponent has the option of paying for the war to continue against that entity at normal price or not pay and finally let the pilotcorp withdraw from the war while you continue to pursue the individual target or you could stop the original wardec and continue to pursue those that deserted it gives you options in how to handle the warthe declaring entity should be able to chose exactly who they want to declare war on regardless of the targets political affiliations a corporation could chose to declare war on individual x without declaring war on that players corporation or its alliance however once the war is declared the target side has the opportunity to use political means to expand the war when a player is declared his corporation is given the option to assume the war on his behalf the corp may decide to back up their member or let him face the consequences of his actions by himself once a corporation is declared its alliance has the opportunity to assume that war however they can also choose not to assume the war if the targets side chooses to escalate the war the declaring side is also given the option to escalate to a higher political level a war can start as a corp vs player grudge match which escalates to player corp vs corp corp vs alliance or alliance vs alliance leading thousands of individuals into battle it also could remain as a corp vs player battle with players seeking each other out and doing battle regardless of other events and political maneuverings the players themselves and their political connections to their corporation and alliance determine the shape and scope of the waredit 2 more sections to follow this 5 minute timer isnt fun
mercenary and allied entity refinementsmercenary entities also have the opportunity to participate in the war players corporations or alliances that choose to follow the mercenary are available to be hired via contract or the future treaty system to participate in any existing wardec for example corp a decides to declare war on corp b a small industrial corp corp b uses its economic power to hire a merc corp of 50 pvp pilots once the terms of the contract are negotiated the merc corp is automatically enrolled with 24 hour warning into the existing war dec as opposed to corp a the merc corp does not have to file their own war declaration once the original declaration between corps a and b expires the merc corp is automatically removed from a state of war small corps could choose to be mercenaries hiring themselves out as actors in small wars or it could be a medium sized corp or a 1000 person alliance of various corps all sized political entities are capable of participating this also allows corps to enlist corps friendly to their cause in war allowing the battlefield to expand in scope and more realistically model the political aspects of eve gameplay while avoiding the escalating cost for utilizing those polticial alliances a corp could declare war on their local miners only to discover that the miners have a significant bankroll to hire mercenaries or are friendly with an experienced pvp corp that chooses to enter the war on their behalf target selection and intelligence will begin to play a much bigger roleeconomic refinementsas it currently stands economic power has very little direct application to the war dec mechanic i would propose that economic warfare become a valid possibility with significantly steep prices there are several possible solutions1 deny free docking rights this would make it possible to bribe npc corps to deny docking rights to your opponent during a war this is done on a perstation not percorp or perfaction basis with a rising fee per station bribed during that war hqs and offices are exempt the fee is based upon the amount of npc stations bribed along with the targets standings toward that corp player corp or alliance depending on type and size of war the fee sharply escalates with each additional station making area denial for 23 stations possible but costprohibitive beyond small areas this allows mining corps to effectively deny docking in a pocket of systems if they are willing to pay the price to bribe all of the station owners in the vicinity this mechanic is subject to a 24 hour warning period before docking rights are withdrawn and for counterbribes more to follow to take place 2 deny station services this would allow corps to bribe npc corps to deny station services such as repair or medical clones to their opponents the bribery mechanic waiting period and counter bribing is similar to the previous proposal3  counter bribing of course the possibility does exist for it to turn into a bribery war back and forth between sides to either remove or regain docking or trading rights restore station services or bribe tax collectors however it is a blind war where you have to put up a bid and hope it is enough to outbid your opponent if you have enough isk you win if not you lose the isk and have to try again a successful bribe reverses the action and starts a new 24 hour timer for your opponent to counterbribe the timer gives both sides enough time to avoid explotation and escalate the economic battlefield as needed1 more section to follow
needless to say this mechanic needs to have a strong scaling factor to make it more of a tactical tool each additional denied station dockservice will severely escalate the price and npc standings both of the bribing and the target corp need to come into play the price should make it almost impossible to bribe more than a handful of npc stations in a given war but it allows corps to strategically select npc stations to deny specific key stations according to the geography of their areafee changeswar decs are amazingly cheap right now but scale to ridiculous levels after a few war declarations i would propose a system in which wardec fees are based upon the respective sizes of the two entities a ratio is done of larger entitysmaller and that is used as a basis for a cost multiplier this would keep wars between similar sized and hopefully similar strength entities you still have the option to take your 200 person corp against that 5 person corp but you now pay for the privilege id also like to see the scaling costs for additional wardecs lowered somewhat so that each additional wardec does scale it does not do so at near the current rate while scaling costs do have their strengths the current multiplier is too high using the size comparison along with a smaller multiplier would be a better approach if wars are made to be more meaningful and with a range of player options and types of warfare a corp shouldnt need to have multiple wars going at once to have a full pvp experience but the possibility should exist if corps wish to try it i would expect the base costs before size comparison factors and additional wardec factors to be roughly 10m for a pilot 20m for a corp and 50m for an alliance additional wardec escalating fees would be based on the type of wardec so a corp could have 1 dec vs a pilot 1 vs a corp and 1 vs an alliance without any additional dec fees however 3 decs vs pilots would involve those feesthis system would allow for a corp of 200 to dec an individual pilot but at a substantial cost it is up to the corp to decide if the declaration is worth the weekly price or maybe the insult wasnt severe enough to justify the dec the size comparison combined with some sort of escalating fee per type of wardec pilot corp or alliance will also help prevent widespread griefplay as most corps could not maintain the price to dec more than a few of each category at once
yes to politicalscaling refinementsno to economic ones why becuase you are giving griefers a whole load of new toys with that if it delays docking sure but denying will just be abused
not to demean all the work you put into this but wouldnt it be simpler to just remove concord i mean if everyone down to their last drone should be viable war dec targets then why even bother to have police

resurrection bump for more diversity in ship and module choices in response to previous poster the efficiency of the items is what makes them used or not like a fast firing gun that is weaker than a slow firing gun but bith do similar dps when compared dps being the measure of efficiency i am talking about t2 level additions for the most part so not junk items the new items need not be new niches but more ways to fill old niches a new gun or ab or ecm variant may have many new uses and have its effect multiplied
this if it doesnt fill a vacant role in the game your new items will eithera never be used because an existing item does the task better orb replace an existing item because it performs betterwhat youre failing to take into account in your moar is gooder speech is that gamers are at heart minmaxers we want the best performance for a given task at the least amount of costthere are some niches that probably need to be filled  a specialist gas mining ship comes to mind theres probably room for a dedicated combat scanning ship with bonuses specific to combat scan probesthough i argue thats what the covert ops frigates should have been in the first placebut tossing in say another type of missile launcher doesnt really make much sense since we already have long range  low damage and short range  high damamge varities even if you came up with one that tweaked the stats a little youd end up bumping out one of the other existing typesits like having a bowl of fruit and then replacing all the apples with pears you dont end up with more variety just a different selection
i can throw cruise missiles over 200km without special launcher rigs i can only throw torpedoes about 20km there is room for medium range weapons which give me eg 80km range on the same ship with a damage potential somewhere between a cruise missile and a torpedosimply for missionrunning id much prefer a medium range missile system over the existing choices id even trade some damage for missile velocity since in the present system my cruise missiles dont make it to the target before my friends have blown the target upit gets worse for capital ship fights where for a long time the phoenix didnt have a long range weapon system now it has a long range weapon system with a flight duration that is measured in multiples of target life expectancysome pilots would be happy to sacrifice onpaper dps simply for the sake of appearing on the killmail with a damage score higher than the triage carrierto use your bowl of fruit analogy  id like to add oranges to the collection of apples and pears
id prefer tagging rather than send to folder same outcome though
and how we should treat the wardeccer that avoid the wara friend corp has been wardecced for almost 3 months by a one man corpafter the first week and a few losses on his part the guy has been hiding in distant part of the universe of off lien but keeping the war alive so how should we consider that kind of behaviour
let him keep paying a couple million isk to not fight sounds like hes already punishing himself
paying for a wardec and then not fighting last i heard griefing and petitionable
id like to hear some ccp logic on that if its truereally though wardeks are griefing how else could you possibly explain them
absolutly not supported bad enough i gotta deal with war decs when all i wanna do is mission run and mine but now i have no real option to avoid the jagbags who have 3 toons actually in corp and 15 neutral remote repper alts yeahgreat friggan idea how many noobs are gonna keep paying for a game they cant even play for weeks at a time the corp drop dec dodge is one of the few things a group of players can use when the griefer corp comes calling and dnt give me any ofthat crap abou getting out and experiancing the real game of eve i usally hear that from some jackoff in a gloum with his 15 logistics alts station humping any force bigger than 5 you want people who dnt run from war decs go ito low sec and null sec and start poping poses leave the low sp corps out of it
2 tools you need to usespell checkerand proper grammarme eyes bleedgo to null sec or join an alliance it worked for us null sec did anywayand im against nerfing wardecs entirely they are needed but i dont like how easy it is to abuse them either
not to nitpick but aside from a mutual war dec which happens how often how and when are they needed
corp a likes to mine in system 1corp b moves in and starts miningcorp a wardecs corp b until they movethats how war decs are supposed to worktheyre also necessary to catch wartargets from null sec wars in high secthe problem isnt that we have war decs the problem is that currently theyre so open to abuse that theyre more a tool of griefers than anything else
i have long thought that instead of a rather trivial fee that the war deccing party should have to put up a fairly substantial bond of some sort which would be forfeited if they surrender ie fail to renewlikewise someone creating a corp should have to put up a similar bond  refundable on dissolution  to concord against being wardecced which they would forfeit on surrenderso decd corps would have a real incentive to fight corp churning to evade wardecs would rapidly become expensive and corps who make their living by extortion would be taking some real risk if they bit of more than they can chewbasically a war should be for higher stakes than just pure lulzof course this is in the context of the whole of hisec pvp needing a thorough rework the bounty system is in even worse shape than wardecs and i believe that the whole suicide gank  piracy  killrights  bounty  wardec spectrum needs to be looked at and unified in to a single spectrum of legal hisec combat optionseve needs to change empire pvp from arbitrary and undocumented complexity to coherent and transparently complexin fact thinking about it this could easily merit its own expansion
wardecced personnel should be unable to leave their wardecced corpperiod
i think in the example of corps a and b using the war dec mechanic defeats the entire purpose of having high sec at all if were going to have space wherein the magic police respond to unprovoked hostile activity then its silly to have a mechanic by which players can circumvent it if corp a wants to defend a mining system then they can go pick one in null sec where its actually worth defending in the first place and even if they do manage to drive off corp b from system 1 corps c d e and f are still free to come in and mine away at their leisure seems like theyre going to have a hard time claiming ownership when they have to go through a mechanic like the war dec system to defend their turfwhich isnt really their turf anyway because the sovereignty indicator probably says it belongs to the amarras for catching war targets from null sec conflictsif they want to mutually declare war then it makes sense otherwise if someone is hiding themselves up in high sec then arent they out of the conflict by virtue of the fact that theyre not in 00 that brings up the question why is there a need to catch null sec opposition in high secraise the cost add deposits on both sides keep people from leaving corpwhatever i dont think a nonmutual war dec system can exist without being abused as it is war decs are essentially just bribes to make concord look the other way
was that part actually under debate
i suppose not i just kind of got going and didnt stoppardon the text blob in retrospect i shouldve preceded that last part with opine and postscripted it with endrant
only if the wardeccing alliance has the same constraintsbut this system would be ripe for abuse  infiltrate an enemy corp declare war on them with your puppet corp suddenly you have perfect intel on a prey who cannot get out of a fight they dont want to be in even if they realise youre a spy they cant kick you out
had this idea earlyer blac opps ships suck right now and are not worth the isk you spend on them so my idea give blac opps another trick that makes them usefull a modual that work along the line of a command modual everyone in the gang affected by the booster mechanic will not show up in local unless they chat similar to the way it works in wholes this would make black opps a extreamly useful ship in both high and low sec and make its billion isk price tag a little more worth it
supportedprobably the best idea for boosting blackops ive seen
no
nothe only thing bo need are to have the stats buffed inline with other t2 ships
i do not support thisthere is only one character ie me you etc heshe is a pod pilot not a ground pounder that is at the same time flying a ship on the pchowever reserving corp and alliance names is a great idea as there is only one ishukone corp that can be everywhere they want to be ccp will have to decide how much integration they want to give between the two platforms and make the call

picking a name in eve can be hard already with the hundreds of thousands of taken names to eliminate these names from availability to dust players will suck for theminstead of blocking all names ccp should make a feature in eve where an eve player can reserve his name against use in 514 thus famous players in eve can reserve their name but others who dont care wonti think this reservation should be available for free to all players through account management this service should also be available to 514 players who create original namesnot supported as op proposes
i wonder if anyone has considered whiteout
you could reverse it in a fashion this comes from a practical bug standpoint bugs crop up and cause problems for folks at times this suggestion of yours is decent thus my support for it but a bug someone could get locked out of a station  until a gm responds which has been known to take days with some issuesinstead of locking them out youd lock them in for the duration of the aggression timer  up to 15 solid minutes locked inside or locked from a gates use they cannot undock or use that gate again until the timer expiresso if they want to run you have to hunt them in a gate situation at a base you have up to 15 minutes until they can undock to do anything you feel like in that system  including flying off to another system to get repairs because they cannot leave that station extended ship undock timerthe information would be stored at the stationgate dock with an aggression timer  thats recorded at the station undock and redock before that first timer is expired  with a refreshed timer  and you are stuck there until that timer is completely gone you know how long theyll be stuck because itll be 1 minute shorter than your timerimo from a something bugged out perspective itd be better to be locked in a station than locked out of one you can do things in a station but what happens if you cannot get back into a station to get another ship get parts etc once you undock youre stuck in space the reverse and youd be stuck in the station  not good but at least you can access jump clones buy stuff sell stuff fiddly fart around with your ships etc vs being stuck in space  potentially in a pod
1 pure common sense solution to docking games and easy to code too
how about giving black ops a trick mod it would work along the lines of comand links everyone who is affected by the booster dosent show up in local or even limitit to ships equiped with a cov opps cloak it would make a black opps battleship worth the billion isk it costs i will post that idea and see ift flys
double posted oops
great idea the kind of thing that will make more money for ccp win and give folks an isk outloet to become more attached to their characters win or trade a toon they are tired of win
i am all for anything that improves the combat ui this sounds greati also want the tactical overlay to instead of display vertical lines only to display curved lines that are part of a circle to indicate actual distance but thats another issueedit forgot thumbs up
while a good idea in theory unsupportedthink about a large battleship just constantly jetting and scooping more sets of heavy drones or drools an ishkur constantly popping sets of lights it could carry 6 more full sets of light dronesin pve losing drones is an annoyance and generally due to not paying attention to your spawns in pvp its a strategic move by your enemy
cough drones coughfake edit and since i saw how the sentry drones vote went yesterday you could just add the above to the whole complete drone review as opposed to voting on it at the next meetingbut id rather this be discussed in particular 
wait there wasnt a ccp rep are we going to get any answers from them about their take on the issues i know in the past even if an issue has passed a csm vote its not necessarily implemented by ccp
another possible solution for this problem would be to have ccp leave bridging range as it is but to instead add 2000m option to the keep at range range drop down menu the keep at range command is pretty good about slowing down a ship soon enough so it actually doesnt bump an object unless your mwd is oni prefer the 5km range i just offer this idea up if ccp says that to change the bridges range is too difficult my suggestion might be a fix that is easier for them to implement
thank you teai have a question about methodology how come a vote with 72 passes while another with 72 or even 81 fails
when a vote passes it is shown foragainst people againstwhen a vote fails it is shown againstfor people fori did this to show the important information first actual result and count of support for that result then the people with the opposing view next that count  ie failed 72 person 1 person 2if it is too confusing i can change it for the next meeting  failed 27 person 1 person 2  but to me this looks odd having two names next to a seveni dont want to put all the names on each vote because it will make it more cluttered remember this is supposed to be a tldr and the full minutes are available if there are any questions of who voted for whattrust me that if it says passed or failed that was the actual result of the vote 
i mentioned this as shown in the minutes but was told that with 150 people round a titan keep at range causes issues anywayive only titan bridged a handful of times but have seen bumping caused by people warping to 0 when told repeatedly to warp to 10 then hit keep at range having been told to set the default to 2000 the 5km activation range change isnt going to help there though swearing on vent might

i think the complete shiphull is wrong drones are not the right type for the job swapping the sin hull for a megathron would be better the black op bonus should be a turret falloff bonus so its inline with the other black opsgallente battleship skill bonus 5 bonus to large hybrid turret damage and 10 bonus to drone hit points and damage per skill levelblack ops skill bonus 10 bonus to large hybrid turret falloff per level and multiplies the cloaked velocity by 125 per levelthe black op bonus gives the pilot the option for more range and reduced damage or more damage and shorter range however this all should be balanced out i totaly agree on these thingsimproved jumprangereduced massrecon resistscovert cynos in highseclower bridging costspanther and sin lovinjumprange needs some serious love mass reduction makes them usable in wormholes black ops are kinda recons so recon resists are welcome i would limit the covert op cyno to stealth bombers black ops and recons or ships with cov op module trading can be affected by allowing blockade runners to use covert op cynos the costs for bridging are way to high in a 1000m3 sin fuel bay gos 6666 oxygen isotopes how about changing the use of fuel the covert jump portal generator will only use fuel when u put the bridge up lets say it uses 1000 oxygen isotopes for each activation that should be enough to solve the fule issue
the database issue would be a very simple fix simply add a link to the rig table so that when it gets reassembled the rigs will be auto installed the item itself doesnt need attributes based on speculation and knowledge from an sql class in college editremove the sell on market flag so it must be contracted if the rigs are in the ship market problem solved
basically youre suggesting fixes that would have the server iterate over every single asset to see if it is a ship and whether it has rigs if it is if it were this simple we would already be able to distinguish bpos from bpcsthe assets listitem table way used way too often to just slap on extra stuff at least that what i gathered from previous discussions
ever considered to be happy with the option of just putting your rigged ships into a courier contract works very well for me
ever considered there maybe possibly just might be ways to improve stuff if be happy with what you have was a valid argument there would be no need for the assembly hall  ideas and featuresalso ever consideren everyone already does this even though you first have to give your stuff to an alt as you cant courier for yourself as there simply is no other way we are however looking for means to move more than just 1 battleship at a time as youre better off flying it yourself in that case more agile better tank can shoot back if needed
id be happy with just being able to fit a hulk and a battlecruiser in an orcas ship bay at the same time or at least 1 battleship on its own alter tableadd isbpcflag bit nullgo just kiddingi dont think we need another ship for this they already exist in carriersorcajust need them to get a little more space orca cant hold a hulk  an industrial at the same time which seems weird considering its role nor a single battleshipcarrier needs to be able to hold a little moremy real suggestion would probly be someting in the realm of specialised modular bays similar to rigs or tech 3 stuff allowing you have to make a choice of what u want to fit your ship with but it takes away from other areas drops the cargo space for more ship maintenace space or 20 more ore space for 10 cargo ect and its gonna cost u
ok guys ive been monitoring this thread and think we need to revisit the situation i was the one who started the discussion that ended in the ship carrier and im going modify our idea a bit and explain some stuff dude youre not understanding the idea and you obviously havent read the thread pull your head out of your fourth point of contact and think about what you said the courier contract idea works with bcs and smaller and with high skills which only dedicated haulers will have you can only fit one or two rigged bb1s or bb2s and no matter what you do you can only fit one rigged bb3 in a courier contract herein lies our problemheres the updated idea incorporating input from a few other peopleproblem many players have arsenals of multiple rigged bbs bcs and their t2 variants bb3s are especially large and take up so much space that you can only fit 1 assembled in a freighter so for those players and corporations who want to rapidly mobilize an arsenal of alreadyrigged ships they either have to take multiple trips especially when transporting abbys rokhs hyperions and maelstroms have each player fly their own ships which could take a very long time depending on how many ships each player needs moved and take pilots away from defense or other needed tasks within a corp or alliance or destroy all the rigs and repackage the ships wasting the time money and resources used in getting and making the rigs see the problemsolutions a new ship dedicated only to carrying rigged ships it could be based off the orca or a completely new design i personally think it would look really cool to be able to see the ships being carried but i think that would slow down too many computers3 new ships with the same idea as the 1ship idea one for ff and dd class ships one for ca cg and bc class ships and one for bb class ships they could be nonracial making them accessible to everyone and the t2 versions could be jumpcapablexercodos original ideaheres the big thing for all these ships they would only be able to transport ships they cannot jettison them or launch them the only possible way to offload them would be into a ship maintenance array or a station hangar the other problem we have discussed is how do we go about dealing with ships popping out of the ships when they pop like a balloon there were a couple ideas on this destroy the ships inside the ship carrier when it pops or have all ships put in a can when loaded into the ship carrier so only the cans appear when the ship popsthe bottom line with this idea is that it will make things much easier for larger corps and alliances or even just rich players to move large numbers of rigged ships at once or in the minimum amount of trips possible
dj reonic welcome to dominion where the limit got increased to 981000 mUFFFD and i was happily hauling my assembled nightmare in a courier contract
i like the carcarrier idea myself but heres my idea make the ship in 3 sizes small med large with a fixed amount of cargo spacethe hold for ships can only hold assembled ships and must not be able to jettison them  only be able to offloadonload in stations or ship maintenance bays and the largest size will not be able to carry titans freighters capital or no more then 3 battleshipsi am a new player and have only been playing for under a year but i have had multiple ships and dont think there is really any need to transport any more then 510 ships at a time

i agree that the insurance systems needs an overhaul when insurance fraud is committed on a wide scale there is something wrong with the systemi support removing insurance payouts from being concorded as well as from self destructing outside of wh space continuing to allow payouts from selfdestructing in wh space seems fine
not supported
thanks any reason why
i may be wrong but i still dont understand how the market cant sort this out or what the advantages would be in drastically reducing insurance payouts apparently the only way to game the system for huge profits requires a massive production capability youre talking a 2mil deficit on a tier 3 bs right wouldnt the solution require a 2 mil adjustment rather than 30 as you proposeeliminating some insurance payouts under certain criteria i could possibly support but an overall reduction in payout hits me in the wallet due to my chars pvp losses and thus personally i dont like the idea and my guess is that the average little guy feels the samemy question would be how would a reduction in insurance payouts actually benefit me
ship build cost is irrelevant to the buyer of the ship since its almost never sold for anything close to what the ship costs so basing insurance on ship build price is an injustice to the buyer who unfortunate enough to not a get a fair deal on the ship in question overpricing happens constantly i agree in that a better system is needed for one thing me buying a ship and only getting payed for the hull cost and not the items i put into the ship seems a little crooked to me if i decided to spend money on good items and it goes up in flamesat the very least as a temporary measure id propose the payout be equal to whatever it was bought for if it was purchased for 2 isk then you get 2 isk the alternative is that if it does go up in smoke instead of money you pay the insurance and they have the exact same ship hull waiting for you back at the station you insured it at perhaps sans the fittings but really id pay a little extra to get the exact same ship back if it were an optionthis would remove the monetary incentive to exploit the insurance and still give a fair alternative to be underpaid by the insurance for replacement this happens all the time in real life
im for the multicharacter queuesthat plus injection without reqs and no 24h cap would make it perfect but tripling my effective training speed is just crazy talk

unlike most others it seems i did read the topic and im in favor pause queue relog start queue is a needlessly convoluted way to do it allowing to select which character to train a particular queue on would make it much simplerthis will not speed up training well not significantly you keep training instead of having oh teh horror 5 seconds without add a minute delay at each character switch if this is for some reason really important it will not introduce new functionality as you can do it manually already it will just remove a minor inconvenience

yes npcs also make most good fights impossible  single hostile cruiser defending a major cant bring something that can take on a cruiser you need a useful blob at least one frigate for aggro so you can kill the cruiser before the npcs do too much damage even though that allows for very nice single malediction defends plex against overwhelming enemies situations respect vaarun npcs are bad in general for pvpmy preferred solution would be to get rid of npcs alltogether but add some kind of minigame to plexing so it takes a while to capture it to avoid excessive afk alt usageif you want a minimum size for plexes you need a bc in fleet to capture a major make it so that only that size can actually do the minigamecomplexes should be pvp challenges someone saying hah here i am throw me out  not something you do ideally unnoticed by the enemy

making a hack which should not be allowed into a core element of war strategy is a bad ideato be honest you shouldnt be able to see if someone is online or offline unless they approve of themselves being in your buddy list the same goes for any other substitute that would tell you whether someone is online or not
ccp has said otherwise  theyve promised that spacebook contact lists will keep the feature of being able to see if someone is online without their consent it seems intentional to me but yes op this seems like a good idea i dont want to autoaccept conversations from targets i just want to know when i can shoot them
thisseriously i actually read your whole proposal and hugo is right if anyone is wardeccable for the right buck why not ditch concord and just let the entire galaxy dissolve into endless warfare
im hoping you can see the difference between a system where pvp attentions are announced ahead of time wardecs in highsec both parties have ample time to prepare and combat is limited to announced combatants as opposed to a system of freeforall no concord
if your proposal was passed and thats a big if then theres no bloody reason to have concordthus your proposal as well written as it is is a totally unacceptablenot supportinggood try but your making alot of assumptions and those assumptions will not carry wellpretty damn good try tho so i tip my hat at you for the well written proposal
i would suggest that once someone reaches a certain sp limit they get transfered out of a noob school corp into one of the other npc corps at which point they are able to recieve personal wardecs if they want protection they should join a player corpalso a nuet aidingrr a wardecd individule should flag them as targetable to the other paryeverything else can remain the same as they are currentlyif u want to target someone personally u should be willing to have their friendscorpalliance back them up if theyre scammerscorp thiefs speak to their diplo maybe theyll hand him overkick him
again not trying to sound like a broken record but why not just remove concordthe systems youve put forward would add immense complexity to the way combat works youve got all the hundreds of thousands of war decs going back and forth you have to track every neutral who interferes on one side and another and now were automatically transferring characters in and out of npc corpsremoving concord gives you the same thing except without all the hoops triggers and arbitrary rules
apologies i missed your reply here beforei can certainly see the difference a system where pvp intentions are announce is very much like the system that wow has built for its battlegrounds players on either side know they are going in to fight and can prepare for it ahead of timehowever if one party doesnt want to be involved ie doesnt want to be attacked then the war dec is simply a loophole in the design and purpose of high security systems extending it to the level of the individual just makes the whole thing pointless
you cant remove concord because it would spur endless griefing of 1day old noobs by failatpvp ers in megathrons that usually just park outside tradehubs with cans thus likely griefing them out of the game before theyve even upgraded their account leading to lack of new players and the subsequent death of eve when all the current vets die from pizzacolestrol induced heart attacks or fires in their moms basement with no new blood to take their placeas for moving people into a differnt npc corp its as simple as a daily update job on the database at downtime  update char set corpid  random124256 where skillpoints  1800000 and corpid in 1234 agro from rr is something that should have always been there in the first place and i actually always thought it was the case since its already tracked if u rep a globaly flagged criminal u become flagged too so i see a little copy and paste of code with a slight change here and thereleaing us with being able to personally wardec and individule well a extra field on the wardec screen for a char name a little validation to see if hes vulnerable to such and same logic copied and pasted from if he was a corpthe mechanics are already there since eve tracks if an individule has joined the fleet of someone in a wardec so i dont see this as being more than a days work from a coding perspective  6months for qaso whats complex
first thanks for the reply and excellent argumentsimplementation of a new mechanic is only limited by the creativity of the programmers and project managers and what youve put forward sounds like it would work in theoryhowever the point i was making wasnt in regards to implementation but rather the effects that it would have on the way combat actually happens in high sec the proposed reforms of the war dec mechanic would raise the complexity of player experience by adding the need to be aware of any number of war decs against friends corp mates fleets and of course yourself i just think removing concord would would be a relatively simpler solution to achieve the desired ends the ability to attack specific people without concord interference that is what is desired am i wrongsure removing concord would impact new player experience but id wager it would be no better than the same griefers targeting new and low sp players with war decs so do we add new rules then trial accounts cant be war dec targets until an arbitrary sp level until they leave the newbie corp can new players war dec on their own do we maintain the rules regarding the costs of war decs and limitationsplease understand i do not want concord removedaltered in several ways maybe but thats another discussion anyway i think that if the proposal is to allow targeted unavoidable pvpenabling war decs against anyone and everyone then i its simpler relative to the additions to the war dec system to remove concordlets take your coding example except in reverse just find this in there somewhereonaggressionactionaggressor target  ifisflaggedforaggressionaggressor targetfalse  systemsec5  activateconcordtargetaggressor select delete donelet the mayhem begin

because every other minmatar capital is essentially shieldbased now the nid should go back to how it was originally  6 mids 5 lows and base cpu increased to 775 halfway between caldari and gallente this would allow it to more effectively fill its role of a logistics carrier while enabling better survivability on the front linesand not be a laughingstock of a capitaladditionally it would be helpful if the logistics bonuses were raised to 75 per level to balance out its comparatively weaker damage output vs the thanatos and weaker tanking abilities compared to the archon and chimera
okay first off the switch of tank type wouldnt be a nid boost at all itd be a chimera boost  the nid would if anything be made worse by it carriers tank with the rr of their friends forcing gangs to split apart rr types instead of focusing on armor does not help the nid when it was getting the benefit of focused armorrr support before secondly i dont fly them myself but ive never seen any reason to believe that nid is underpowered again carriers live in a ball of rr providing better rr is a good thing in such circumstances im not against the 75 buff but it doesnt seem obviously necessary to me if you want to buff it jack up the sensor strength scan res and cap to let it do its job better dont mess with the tank

the science and industry interface could use some updates especially at the corp level im not going to touch sharing of pos inventioncopyingmanufacturing slots that ones been beaten to death enough time by otherswhat i am going to suggest is some stuff that would reduce the amount of repetition involved in jobs that people do on a regular basis such as invention copying and manufacturingfirst proposal create a skill that would allow a player to specify that a job they are currently installing should autorepeat the skill would allow one repetition at level 1 5 at level 2 10 at 3 and so on in order for a job to automatically repeat tho there must be an open slot available at the installation in question when the job would restart in addition all the required materials must be present when the job repeats otherwise the job just ends as normal for a bpo based job such as copying the only things that would need to be there are any materials the copying job needs for bpc jobs there must be another bpc with the exact same stats as the bpc that started the original job the mepetype and number of licensed runs must be exactly the samethis option would mainly benefit pos owners as the required slots would probably not be open immediately after a job is completed making autorepeat an option only at a completely unused station or a possecond proposal allow for mass installation of any given set of prints so long as there are enough free slots at the given installation and the quantity of all the items to be installed is the samefor example say i want 50 each of a microwarpdrive a couple different types of guns and 50 runs of one or two ammos using this i would be able to select all of the prints at once up to the number of jobs i can install enter the quantity 50 and with one go i would install many different jobsthe quote screen would have to show the total amount of minerals for all the jobs and would have to show the average print waste it would also have to show a total for install and usage costs and finally it woould need to show the earliest and latest delivery time of the jobs in question since pe levels and base build times are different for different types of build able itemsthird and finally allow multiple item selection and manipulation from the science and industry blueprint interface this would make it much easier for someone to separate out a group of blueprint copies that have somehow gotten mixed up with a group of blueprint originals rather than having to show info on each print over and over allow personal prints to be delivered to the cargo bay of the active player ship or an assembled container in the players hangar
the addition of a rightclick context menu option of strip ship for the hangar ships window would be usefulsuch a feature would appeal to players who know that a needed module is fitted to a certain shipthe current method as i understand it and have experienced it of retrieving a needed module from another ship and fitting it to the current ship follows the following five steps1 make ship containing the needed module active2 remove the needed module from the active ship3 wait for the session timer to run outa say a bad word while waiting for the session timer to run outb say another bad word4 return to the previous ship by making it active5 fit the freed module to the active shipwith the proposed strip ship rightclick context menu option the procedure would be as follows1 choose the rightclick strip ship menu option after rightclicking on the ship which contains the desired module2 fit the freed up module to the active shipa bless ccp for making the game so much easierbenefits of implementing the strip ship option ie pros1 the number of steps to obtain the desired module is reduced2 the session timer count down is avoided3 the requirement of making another ship active is eliminated4 reprocessing of a ship to obtain a module is avoided5 the new player experience and old is improvedcons1 im not sure how rigs would be effecteda warning about removing the rig or rigs could be displayed to prevent loss after all other modules have been stripped

recent idea that is gaining fairly quick support along with considerable discussion fairly heavy stuff could be a squeeze to fit it in but worth a look
have you guys discussed overhauling destroyers yet  and if not please do
everything discussed so far can be found in the minutesfirstly i have to admit i love the destroyer class but it is clear the thrasher is the best all round the catalyst is great once in range the cormies main claim to fame is being able to tickle stuff at 110km and the coercer is a nightmare to fiti have looked at some of the destroyer change threads the last proposal i saw needs a rethink imotrying to balance optimal and falloff bonuses between class and specific ship coupled with the flexibility offered by destroyers wont work it would in some ways make more sense to split the ships and have close range and snipe dessy variants  however i dislike that idea for a number of reasons i think it would be more interesting if they could have a special class bonus such that rails arties and beams get optimal range while blasters autocannon and pulse get falloff instead then the question is what to do with the current bonuses on the cormie and catalyst im sure swapping their 10 per level optimalfalloff for damage would be popular though 5 on the catalyst is too muchif that case the coercer becomes the only one without a damage bonus but without the cap reduction it will suffer in a long fight some people have trouble keeping a dessy alive longer than a couple of seconds so i guess it wont matter  as it can fit 3 damage mods it would also be op with 5 per level damage bonus so that would need to be balanced carefullyonto the 25 rate of fire reduction even with this penalty it is possible for a thrasher with autocannons two gyros to get around 400dps rigged but without implants without the rate of fire penalty you would be in the 530ish dps rangelets compare them all with 2 damage mods no implants no rigs no overloading and the best close range gunsautocannon thrasher 330 dpsblaster catalyst 350 dps blaster cormie lolwut 250dps only one damage mod thanks to single lowslotpulse coercer 300dps 330 with 3 heatsinksyou can see the cormie is lacking but that if the catalyst got a damage bonus it would be pretty overpoweredgoing to bigger guns the thrasher is unmatched on alpha but due to long cycle times on arties compared to the others the dps is still pretty even other than the cormie the catalyst is very hard to fit even with awu 5 which leads on topowergrid i agree they should be able to fit a full rack of artiesbeamsrails without fitting mods so that needs looking at it is even more important now that small rigs are so cheap because the drawback on gun rigs is higher pg use edit i know ive not addressed ewar or tanking they could certainly handle a bit of a hp boost without going op on ewar i see these as dps support ships backed up by a frigate gang so rather than try to be a one size fits all solution it is better to play to their strengths though a bit more cpu would give the option of fitting unbonused ewar to improve them running with a light gang it would be nice to change the 3ausec warp speed to 6ausec in line with frigates or at the least split the difference and go to 45ausecfeel free to pull my post apart now

pc version of dust  hackers  cheaters this is the main reason why i support a console only dust514 i wouldnt waist my time or money on another pc fps period
i may try faction war someday and hope it gets as much attention as the rest of eve
i just started fw after being in eve for 9 months i want to stay in fw but it is difficult to stay motivated i hope ccp does fix fwveshta yoshidas post on what needs fixing is spot on well except for the trolls and thier idiotic replysccp take notedeath to the slavers
you could read through the thread to find out if you buy anything made from minerals then the current insurance system is costing you isk because insurance artificially inflates the cost of minerals it is basically an npc buy order thats why the market cant sort this out  players cant compete with npcs with infinite funds who dont care about valueas for the massive production capability plenty of people have that capability read the thread linked to in the op the biggest time sink was actually destructing the shipsthe problem that this causes is that its a vast isk fountain with no comparable isk sink its scalable and that it keeps ship and module prices artificially high it also means that suicide ganking is op because you can buy and t1fit a ship for free whilst i do believe that suicide ganking is absolutely necessary at the moment it should cost something to lose even a t1 ship pegging insurance at around 8595 of ship mineral value means that it will always cost at least a few mil to lose even an unfitted shiphowever the bonus side of that is that t1 ships will almost certainly become quite a bit cheaper
insurance doesnt need to be reviewed just removed
i follow this topic with interest and have my own theories on how to best solve the problemjust as barnacles are exposed by a receding tide and real estate fraud schemes are exposed by falling housing prices  the flaws in the current insurance system are laid bare by falling mineral priceson common carebear cries to remove insurance for concord kills and self destruction watching people post this is by far my biggest pet peeve as it shows that most people have very little understanding of how economic systems workit sounds good on the surface at least to the bears  in much in the same way as calls for raising the minimum wage sounds appealing but it inevitably leads to more unemployment for the lowest paid workersedit supportedactual resultsremoving insurance for self destruction will accomplish precisely nothing as there are tons of other ways to artificially kill battleships rapidly and collect the insuranceremoving insurance from concord kills ie suicide gank nerf actually aggravates the problem by making carebears mineral producers even safer and more numerous it reduces combat and legitimate ship destruction further and leaves insurance in place  so those ships would invariably end up being artificially destroyed outside a manufacturing center merely for the insurance payoutinsurance is simplistic and flawed yes if fixing the insurance system is too difficult however those flaws become safely hidden if we improve the game by driving up the value of minerals through encouraging a marginal increase in ganking and less mindless resource gathering oh and im glad there are people like malcanis out there whose posts show that they have a strong understanding of the principles we are dealing with and how to fix them its really a relief while reading these threads so much simplistic and flawed thinking out there
nerfing the affordibility of pvp gets no support from mei usually fly tech2 ships anyways but still
i did read most of the crap and im still not convinced from an economic standpoint that the price of ships incl insurance payout or lack thereof would be cheaper if your proposal succeedsso not supported
cron let me clue you inif insurance was removed or modified as op proposal suggests the prices of t1 ships would drop rapidlyand t2 ships would drop slightly as t1 ships are a component of their t2 variantthis is not being debated here it is simply fact diluting the thread and wasting our time by stating that you are not convinced with no supporting evidence  is much like saying you arent convinced that gravity exists because you cant see itthere may be other ways to fix the problem  or other ways of tinkering with insurance that arent the opsbut denying that a mineral price floor exists thats like
the point of insurance reformremoval shouldnt be to make anything cheapereasier everything is already cheap and easyeve needs to be harder and more difficult particularly when it comes to loss as right now the majority of players seem to be fat with isk and a bs loss means literally nothing due to 110 insurance payouteveryone whines about less pvp but most of the players that i know fly t2 in 00 which doesnt benefit from insurance in the first place so thats an empty argumentid say 90 of the posts out there regarding insurance are selfish they want more protection from suicide ganks or they want less expensive ships for pvp because theyre a bunch of losers and cant hack pvp without the free ride of insurance fail more
really man  its like that upton sinclair quoteit is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding itthe ignorance in these posts suggests that most of the naysayers are just clueless though i suspect a certain number do get it but are simply selfserving
thanks for the confirmation that the existing system provides less expensive t1 pvp ships and your goal is to hurt pvp by making it more expensive youve essentially made my point with this postas such still not supportedhonestly let the market sort out a 2m difference in tier3 bs and stop your pathetic whining and attention whoring otherwise make it worth my while as a ship consumer do i like fully insurable cheap t1 battleships yes do i care that some hardcore industrialist has a fulltime job managing multiple alts to make a measily 2m profit off a tier3 battleship manufacturing job no i think the perpetuators of this insurance fraud should go right ahead with their exploits and keep putting the word out for everyone to follow when profits drop to 1mbs then down to 5mbs they can decide whether its a career path they wish to stick withmy conclusion is that the insurance system is working perfectly because the insurable return of a t1 battleship should be roughly manufacturing cost  a small margin also known as replacement cost
wondering why half of the folks in here cant be arsed motivating their choices
before i get starts i would like to say this is not let the players fully customize the skins and draw unwanted content on their shipsmy idea is this add a system that allows players to customize their ships looks instead of just what goes in the ship like weapons ammo armor or shield tanking and so on the systems i think would work are listed below1 if you take the time to look at most eve ships they are broken into two colors for example the hulk is grey and red my suggestion for the paint job is make these two differnt colored areas recolorable so i could take my hulk and repaint the grey area blue and the red area gold as an example to change the color a number of ways can be put in place1a 3 sliders rbg the ammount in each color blended togeather makes a custom color for each section1b have a pallet of preset colors for each colorable area1c importing players set values for redbluegreen as well as saturationhuedarkness2 have preset colorings that a player can pick from this works best for navyfraction ships who have camo instead of plain paint where players can pick differnt camo styles instead of colors3 add a 4th special rig spot kind of like the t3 cruiser sub system a player can put a rig in this spot and when it does it makes the ship become a differnt color this is kind of like the preset idea but this can also give ships small bonuses too like black stealth would reduce signature radius of the ship like real stealth black paint would on planes for exampleof course all the ideas would requier players to makepay for services as they do when they repair a ship buy insurance or a rig to put on their ship the price i feel should be dependant on the ship sizeclass a frigate would cost 10000 for a paintjob while a titan would cost 100000000 for examplenow for all of those who are worried about lag or my computer cant handle this very very simple we have options in the graphics section of our settings that list things like turrent effects drone models and so on just have one like this custom paintjobs when activated it shows the custom paintjobs on every ones ship when disactivated all ships revert to defualt colorings that we see daily in eve its the easiest solution i can think of i know people are worried about server side lag and the only thing i can say to them and ccp about this is test it p if it does time for more serversupgrades or discard my idea but it probably will come back up sometimenow i just want to point out some games in history who have uses systems simular to what i have discribedcall of duty 4  modern warfare where you can put differnt camo textures on your gunsmech assult where you can color the mech and glow affectsarmored core games you can color each piece left arm right arm left leg right leg head differntly you can also add emblumssymbolsmetal gear solid 3 and 4 i think where you can change the main characters armorcamohalo where you can customize the armor and color along with emblums symbolssupreme commander  command and conquer games you can pick the coloring of your armydawn of war 12 you can pick colors of your armyrainbow 6 you can pick from preset camo colorstransportation tycoon delux edition and locomotion you can change the color of indivual colors on trainscarsboats and planesworld of warcraft you can change your skin colorracearmor and each one looks differnt though the armor and weapons themselfs arent customizableand here is a photoshop example i made of idea number onemega photoshop funim sorry if this idea has allready been posted i scanned over the 3 lists and didnt see it or something simular so thats why im posting thank you for taking the time to read and support if you do my idea to improve eve
i ran out of space to put this in the first post im sorry pupdate first update and post of the new year i think p its 11110 and i got bored while mining in my industrial thanks to hulkaggedon  and took the time and used some photoshop magic to produce thispaintshop windowbehold a demopreview menu window for selecting your ships coloring this example would be used for normal ships not ones with camo the ships with camo would only have the presets avalable for use i have also added the option metallic to make the ship appear as it normaly does but i know how some people like flat colors with little to no reflectivity so when this option is turned off your ship will not reflect as much in the area which you have selected it so yes you can have half of it flat and the other half not if you so like this menu in theory would pop up like your manufactoring medical insurance repair window would at a station with the offered service and allows you to edit the coloring of your ship at any time the price you pay is based off two things the size of the ship and if your coloring only one section or both for example 1 section on a frigate is 100000 isk both sectinos is 200000 isk on a battleship though it would be more like 1m isk per section just for example also on a side note i have removed the decal idea from the post cause there was no support for it but i still want to keep the paintshop idea aliveif any one has an idea they would like to add i will move their idea up to this post and quote them so readers can find all the suggestions posted in this post easily once again i would like to thank you for taking the time to read and support me if you do fly safe or unsafe if you likeoh and while your here make sure to cheak out my other posts new sovernty structure idea
now we think of the common 200v200 or 300v300 fleet fights where it already takes multiple seconds to load the grid properly we add the extra informations for the useless colors i am sure goonies would have a policy that noone is allowed to use the same color and the grid load lag would be even worse for no real benefitthat said  not supported
im sorry to sound so rude but if you would take the time to fully read my post you would see the part and i quote myselfwe have options in the graphics section of our settings that list things like turrent effects drone models and so on just have one like this custom paintjobs when activated it shows the custom paintjobs on every ones ship when disactivated all ships revert to defualt colorings that we see daily in evethe servers lag bad enough when these fleet fights happen and i can understand your problem with it but i specialy put that part in my post for people like you who do not want it you can just leave it off or while prepairing for a large fleet battle turn it and some other graphics options offdown to make loading quicker and easier for you
ive said it before ill say it againits a waste of ccps time to even consider this if they do all cudos for them but id rather they released new ships and much less lag then deal with pointless visuals like custom paintjobs its not needed very few mmos bother with it most of what you listed are fpses that dont have to deal with lots of lag andor an evolving game so lets just leave it aloneenough
i agree they could spend a bit of time making it less laggy but the biggest problem is they support eve with one maybe two servers buying 2 or 3 more servers would cure most of the server side lag if its computer side lag you just need to update or quit ing cause the game is only going to demand more power some how from your computer as it advancesas far as new ships go i can only think of 2 or 3 ships they can put into the game unless their mega godly ships with 20 gunsa frieghtercarrier that carrys other ships around in high seca low sec only hulk with more then 3 lasersa t2 dreadnaught with more then 3 weapons which fits between dreadnaught and titanmore t3 ships which i feel are pritty uselesssure they could continue to add these navyfreaction ships that give differnt bonuses or have a differnt paint job but its still the same model they havent released a new ship model sence t3s came out when t3s came out the first thing i noticed is each subsystem changed the design of the ship so honestly if you support having more t3s with more subsystems like that just remember that demands more from the server then recoloring would cause of the differnt models and differnt textures for each model  the color ontop of it for each modeltextureoh and one last thing i forgot if it keeps coming back and people keep posting simular things it might not be needed but its wanted imagine if ever car on earth was the same color its not a useful thing it can be expensive too but if we want it we should get it cause its such a simple thing
individual colored ships would help the gameplay in no wayi dont support this there is so much more important to dothis could be done if with priority z

without knowing the actual source code i would assume that ccp added a failsafe which should stop grid laggs for all people and since dominion you get stuck in that failsafe however a first step would be that ccp acknowledges this bug i would so like to post some parts of my conversation with gm gruber though it all boils down to him being in denialfyi we had a dev watching at least one of our fights in geminateon a heavily reinforced node sadly i wasnt there thus i can not tell you anything about that
support
signed lets kick this lag and get back to business
ccp please fix id like to enjoy playing the game
probably just for the start ships should be invulnerable until grid is loaded to the client of its pilot
supportboth force a and force b should load grid at the same time not force a sitting on a gate and force b waiting to find out if they are dead or not
support i have lost many ships since the last patch all i which i did not have the opportunity to even see what was on the other side of the gate i have been playing this game for many years but am now contimplating cancelling all my subscriptions if this lag issues are not resolved
not supportedunless cloaked ships can be probed downand scanner provides intel on corp or proximity sensorsprobes are made availibleand for anyone claiming that local will make it harder for macro ratters youre wrong its easier a macro can hit scan on a scanner every second and warp to a safespot as soon as something pops upa real player is too busy chatting to his corp mates buying  on the market or having a  to click a button over and overnow also for those that hunt said macro ratter if he cloakes up youd never know hes thereedit oh and local is also a social tooljump into a system looking for targets read peoples bios make comments in local about haha thats a good one start chatting end up creating a new alliance
i agree that you should not appear in local unless you talk  break radio silence this has always been a historical tactic in favor of the clandestine spy or overwatch in remaining silent and hidden local is a spoiler in that it lets everyone know too much about somebody without actually putting forth the effort to approach and identify the ship that just entered the area
before proposing a change to local you need to suggest something else that will 1 let a hunter find prey in good time and 2 let the prey see the hunter coming in good time the more interactive and entertaining this process is the bettersimply removing local and changing nothing else would only increase reliance on the directional scanner which i dont want to see because the dscanner is horrible when checking for probes i dont want to have to sift through ten moons five pos towers twenty small railgun batteries forty rat wrecks and a partridge in a pear tree vigilance is something you should need if you want to operate in dangerous space but a tolerance for boredom shouldnt be
but you could still use probes theyd function as they always have the directional scanner would cut both ways though yes it would let prey know a predator was after them if they were to use it to simply finding them prey would also be constantly broadcasting their position to predator if they spammed it indiscriminatelythe directional scanner is currently a detriment to any fix to local as no one and rightly so wants to click it every 5 seconds
suggestion for using probes without dscanning is a joke
notification it needs to be made more obvious much more obviousi was warp scrambled for 10 minutes doing a mission and i had no idea until i wanted to warp out when my tank was failingno surprise my tank failed and i died i wouldve killed whatever was scrambling me right when i was notified but nope i never knew i couldnt even figure out what had me scrambled when i suddenly realized i wasthere is something i know that is suppose to do this and i have still not found it not even searching meticulously through the knowledge base and evelopediawhat the hell is up with that
and the proposal is 
you get a big message in the middle of the screen telling you  started started warp scrambling youand you have the nice icon in your overview something you always look at to lock more targetsand you managed to miss both
i confess its happened to me  the notifications are there but if its hectic or overview isnt set up right its possible to miss it when the stuff hits the fanas a proposal though needs work more constructive suggestions less whine for example i discovered the new audio alerts today while i died embarrassingly to a very expertly fit rifter pilot thats an area something like this could be expanded to bigger icons that are easier to see placed above your ship controls for example would be another
well it is clear but not veryon the right had side of your hud theres an indicator of any ew being used against you unfortunately it does not have its own little column space so if there is any text there at all you cant see anythingi vote for having an remote effects ecm or repair ect in their own column thats clear of other clutter so you can actually see who is doing what to you
thisdont fix something that isnt broken
hmmmm it does show an icon on the overview who has u scrammed though its noteasily visiable without checking the line carefullypaying attention helps that being said since there is usually a timer bar above your shieldarmorhull hud which indicates if youre being jammeddamped ect why not show a big flashy easy to spot sign about being scrammed or make the speed indicator flash redps notifications are too numerious your light potato gun did x amount of damage every second kinda make it tedious to pay attention to it
when you have roughly 15 small rats shooting at you 5 bigger ones and youre launching your own volleys trying to maintain optimal range while controlling drones 1 little and yes very little message is going to disappear into the mounting notifications of misses hits and damage takenin fact i couldnt even figure out why i wasnt warping until i mashed my warp to button as fast as possible until i could get the you cant warp messageif there is something in the overview that is suppose to notify me im being scambled i sure as hell dont know where it is so yes it is very reasonable id miss ittheres no tutorial on warp scambling not even a page in evelopedia or the knowledge baseccp has a lot a lot of broken features stop spending time making our ships look even more futury and just fix some of these nuisances if i havent been clear enough in my proposal1 knowledge base and evelopedia need to be rehauled not just with an article on warp scrambling they are missing whole bunches of info2 there needs to be an ingame tutorial on warp scambling in fact warp scrambling should be part of the very beginning tutorial for new players3 there needs to be a history of sorts like a log where you can readily look back on notifications hits misses damage ewar that has been flashed at you in the past 2 seconds that you didnt see because youre being gang spammed4 messages automated on local by the game need to be shown somewhere else i dont know a soul who actually keeps local in their screen theyre either in corpprivate chat or have that window closed althogether to save space
im still trying to figure out where the your are unable to warp because you are warp scrambled audio notification went i must have a corrupted install or something surely ccp wouldnt remove that gem
some time ago you had much better acoustic and visual effects to see yourself being warpscrambledwe have nice marvelous new grafic on planets which is pretty useless gimmicks for real gameplay i dont understand why the grafical effect on such important issue is now nearly unvisible you can even hear nothing this was different in the pastthere is just a little icon to see yourself being in troublethere is need to fix that soon it would help a lot if you hear a loud sound and at least the old visual effect clearly i support this
whenever a ship has any kind of targeted ewar including warp scrams and disruptors on you you get an icon on the far right of your overview next to that ship showing you what effect is active on you its about as clear as it can be unless youre somehow running missions with your overview minimisedapart from this page you meanyour failure to pay attention to your overview is not really a broken feature
not supportedmost of the removals in question seem to have been done because of rule violations or fruits thereof not to mention the flaming the whining and the total lack of restraint or nonconstructive behaviourwill some perfectly okay posts get deleted in the process when theres a mass removal yes it happens those who feel strongly about it and that there posts were unjustly removed should simply post againabove all else its ccps forums and they can do whatever they like people who dont want to follow the rules can move to the unofficial boards and sites that are outside of ccps purviewand yes i have had posts removed in the past some that made sense and others that didnt but its no reason to get in a tizzy about it now when every single negative comment on these boards mysteriously disappears then you can start worrying
censorship is necessary but control of censorship is more soive seen far too much lately ccp always seem unwilling to take criticism or accept that something went wrong this is nothing new but  tinfoilhat on  it seems like theyve now got active word filtering that flashes lights and sounds alarms as soon as something is posted on the forum they dont like and the nerfbat swings down hardas many have said before it puts people off using the forum when they see swathes of moderation and then people complaining about the moderation also get moderated its almost comical and looks very unprofessionalinstead of moderating the devs need to look at the complaint and answer as best they can instead of deleting postsccp  only 1 c away from communism the way theyre acting grow a set ccp accept that not everything is peachy with the game fix the problems and speak to the people who pay your wages
being somewhat of a military history buff i look to real world strategy and tactics often to give me an edge in the game and i have an answer for replacing local as an intel source which would be both fair and add some realism to the gamethe answer is found in ship signatures encode into the game a passive full time scanner that will pick up local traffic based on its emission signature it will give you the following info range to target based on signature strength type of vessel a corp or alliance readout iff ident friendfoe with appropriate colorit would not reveal any pilot info unless the pilot breaks silence in local like in corp or alliance chathigh signature ships will be visible at great distances where low signature ships will only appear when much closer the readout will appear on the overviewany suggestions support stones
though lasers in real life are created by the laser itself and not the lens crystal the laser is shined though i love the idea it would make mining much more interesting to watch cause in fleets it would look like a laser light show pthough a suggestion for t1 lasers have an option or ammo you can load that has no affect on mining yield but still changes the color
sure
the quick way to get rid the pop up is hit enter rather than click on it still it would be nice to have the option to completely disable it
make all popups optionallet the players decide whats worth their continued daily annoyance and not
with the change in 2008 leaving it so there is no ghost training to be had the developers gave the response that it was for the benefit of the players who actively play but this is not the case infact nothing has changed for the players who actively play from that change in my opinion there needs to be a training bonus for those who are out and actively using their skills and playing it is not fair that playing does nothing extra vs being offline and training i think this would bring players to the game more actively and give them incentive to play for more than 5 minutes just to change over skill queues
no skills grinding in eve not supported ever
ghost training was removed because it gave an unfair advantage as in you get the same benefits as people who actually paid for their subscription kudos for the attempt to try and twist it as a show of support for your skill grinding plan thoughplaying actively benefits you a great deal but it just doesnt help you train faster directly even on the sp front it does allow for better implants and buying a character with higher sp having high sp count with no money or actual game experience just results in lol killmails so there is no need to give any special training bonuses to people actively playing if you just want to train skills faster ask for it instead of trying to bring additional grinds to the gameas a personal oppinion any skill grinding is a horrible idea and i will never support it in any form
in fact after bringing in the techiii cruisers you are able to loose skills when loosing your shipso it will be just fair if you are able to gain faster skills while playing activlyi support thisyou may limit this on the skills which you can loose just for the new tech iii skills
dominion dom brought with it a much needed improvement to projectile weapons especially the improved ammoprior to dom there was a relatively fine balance in regards to offensivedefensive capabilities of minmatar ships with projectile bonuses due to generally poor gun performancethe fitting requirements of acs allows thrashers rifters and ruptures in particular to be capable of fitting oversized buffer modules on top of full combat fittings with correct sizenumber of gunsno other race is able to fit appropriate sizenumber of weapons on top of a huge buffer but have to sacrifice either speed mwd  ab or damagerange downgrading weaponsthe dom changes made acs as good if not better than most other weapon options due to hightracking high damage good range and near perfect damage types combined with the full oversize buffer ability the ac fitting have become too good  something has to giveexamplesthorax has to use small weapons to use a 1600 platemaller has to use small weapons to use a 1600 platecaracal has to use light missile launchers to use lsesetcsolutionincrease ac grid fitting requirement by 1520 across the board still allows for buffering but introduces the same kind of sacrifices that all other ships have to make thus bringing the minmatar ships back inline with the rest of evenote a change in grid requirement will have minimal impact on bc and bs class ships in regards to fitting buffer modules but excessive buffering will require sacrifices as it does for all othersviable fits at any rate gimmick fits do not count as they are not used
this is just one big proposal of grief in my opinion i dont see any kind of balance here at all a matter of fact i dont see any need for concord here at all either
i support it really hate this corp hopping if i have a reason to wardec someone i want kick his assif someone scammed you stole ships and isk from corp you have a reason and thats not griefplaycorphopping and opening new corporations for avoiding war should be an exploitpersonal wardec one pilot and his alts if you know them should be possible
id like to see this change mainly id like to specify my own orbiting distance instead of the preset ones that the game gives you i dont know if thats exactly what you proposed but id like to see this happenperhaps a drop down menu with the option to type in meters how far away you wish to orbit
pleasealso maybe beat whoever came up with the inane babblebackground jibberish it almost sounds like wind seriously wind in spacei want to hear pew and maybe some pew thats really about itdont need no wind in space no chanting no babbling dont want to be deafened by my hardeners to be fair the hardener one seems to be fixed if we could keep it that way it would be greattldrat least an option to turn off the wind in space sound
signedto hear wind in space sounds totally stupidsound and visual grafic and physics have to be fixed in many waysoh yes some of the new planets look great did i mentioned that already  but a lot of effects are just unlogic unrealistic and very stupid it was better in most ways long time agothis has to be fixed
the idea here is that the more often a market order is changed in a given period 6 hours or 24 hours the longer it takes for that order to propagate through to the marketif you make adjustments every 5 minutes just to beat the other guy by 001 isk youll very quickly find that your order is simply not showing up on the market for 5 or 10 minutes because youve glutted the system with rapid changes to your orders it has to clear the old que and reinitiate your adjustmentso lets say that yes you can adjust your order every 5 minutes but each such adjustment increases the amount of time it takes for the order to be returned to the market queso add 3060 seconds per adjustment after the first couple made in lets say 1 hour this would add up quickly 10 rapidfire adjustments in an hour would result in a 510 minute propagation lag for that order if this counter is persistant for 6 hours or 24 hours the lag time could be upwards of an hour which in its delay brings the counter down or more for each adjusted order to reappear on the market queas time passes this counter drops back down just as rapidly as it goes upthis will advantage people who make a couple of adjustments a day not one every five minutes just to whore for position or keep undercutting everybody in existence
as shown below the tooltip popups are more often than not in the way of what youre trying to read i would like to suggest that we have the option of turning them off possibly a toggle in the esc menu though the tooltip contains the same info as the line item it represents it is more distracting than usefulplease visit your user settings to reenable images
i suppose i should support my own recommendation
i may be mining and have large amounts of diverse ore types i drop in station or mission salvage whatever it is its quite ponderous having to sell each stack of items line by line id like to be able to select multiple item types and sell them all at once when i am docked in a station that has buyers for it if there are no buyers for some items i have highlighted ccp could simply give you a message like thisx items had no buyers all other items sold successfulythere are many times and reasons for wanting it namely convenience of saving time and getting isk in your hand right now versus when or if the contract goes through you lose 10k isk for every contract whether its successful or not i have talked to a few about this they like and agree with the idea
i have to agree with you not fully on all your topics but with out miners in eve the ammount of ships and moduals would slowly began to die off with no one to produce materials in mass number for these things to be made and we get the short stick when it comes to profits in real life miners are paid tons of money to do their job cause they are the foundation of all things in life i found a number of sites where it showed miner wages vs other profeshions and on adverage miners earned 20000 more a year 3333 more then other profeshions i am not saying put mining on the top of the chart for profit but balance it a bit expecialy with the dropping mineral prices cause of dominion and new null sec mineral avalibility
what he saidalso those guys bumping hulks are actually checking to see if youre a macro or not ask them if they bored in local and theyll probly move on ignore them and theyll come back in an insured geddon and suicide gank u00 mining earns well over 30mil an hour solo even more in a gang with bonuses and dedicated haulers more than belt ratting or l4 missionshighsec mining does need to be buffed a bit i can see anyone not running a macro making any decent amount of isk in a humanly bearable amount of time to be worth the skill investment then again plenty of 00 corpsalliances are ing about the amount of miners they need now to keep their industry indexes up upgrades so maybe all those highsec hulk pilots need to move down to nullsec and leave 10 to the noobs in ospreys so they can make a buck or 2 on veldspar
good idea especially for the structures that can be destroyed
good idea
huh
instead you should fix that it takes less time to to fly a tech three command ship which is better then any command ship out there tech 3 command ship did i miss something what is a tech 3 command shipim not quiet sure that wasting 17 days of training is realy going to make a new player catch up with a 6 year old player it is annoying if you have trained for something that is then changed to a lesser requirment though i do agree but it isnt the end of the world and most of the skills will still give you an edge over the people who didnt max them out to v with a couple of exceptions of coursei did like this though made me laugh  thats 17 days i could of used on gay guns to tech ii since there not like missles are too get tech iis those gay guns would of rocked lol

yeah the hull progression path for the cormy is just not rightif you follow how races progress from frigate to bs it should be a logical progressionrifter  thrasher  stabber  hurricane  typhoon since the minmatar focus more heavily on projectiles the progression is pretty simplepunisher  coercer  omen  harbinger  armageddon like the matari the amarr have a singular weapon focus but the khanid ships break this when it comes to t2 the punisher hull has 2 variants so the beams dont throw off the hull progression until you get to the heretic which goes from a beam based hull to a sadly anemic rocket based hull the heretic should be beams keeping with its t1 hullmerlin  cormorant  moa  ferox  rokh again a break when you advance to the t2 hulls but with two variants the merlin sets up a t2 hull progression for missiles unfortunately the cormorant goes from hybrids to anemic again missiles either make the cormorant a missile hull or introduce a second hull the swan that uses rocketslight missiles and make the flycatcher a t2 version of that or give the flycatcher hybridsincursus  catalyst  thorax  brutix  megathron unfortunately the eris gets a split weapon system that cant make up its mind one way or the other it should be a pure hybrid platform or a missile platform with drones 75 m3 drone bay 25 bandwidth 5 bandwidthlevel since its dps would be laughable with rockets the addition drones no damage bonus would bring it into parity with the sabre somewhat lacking a damage bonus on drones it would not eclipse the ishkuranother idea is an addition to the certificate system that gives a hull progression tree allowing new pilots to focus along a specific line if they want to specialize in certain hull types
to make a missile based cormie would mean either a split weapon bonus ask any minmatar pilot how bad these are or lose the optimal bonus on rails thus making it unable to be a long range sniper making a new hull is out of the question unless you want to wait years also remember the role of these ships is anti frigate hence the tracking bonuses missiles dont have instant dps and even with a rangespeed bonus will have issues killing ceptors that thrashers can instapopwe can discuss it is you really want make a proposal
that makes pretty good sense i could only think that a slight modification may be more clearpassed 62 those againstfailed 62 those for
i like that idea and will add something similar for the next meeting
they promised to be there to elaborate on the mothership hp issue but didnt show up  a day later we get a dev blog about it without any warninggj on the minuted td very clear
muppet 
lets flog this motherer
i am a relatively new player and i enjoy eve a lot however one issue is bothering me a loti play eve in 1920 x 1200 resolution and the fonts in the game are absolutely tiny and i really have to strain my eyes to read them i did find the way to increase the fonts in the chat and also chose the expanded font width but the fonts that are not in the chat or context menu are still very small and hard to readi tried to find a way to increase the fonts in wikieveonlinecom and found this csm issue
im slowly think we privateers took the wrong way proposing something like this hereim pretty sure if we made the empire carebears whine about us using this bull we would already have this changebecause of poor ccp lose preciouse former wow customers
1 for many of the reasons mentioned blasters are simply a joke railguns arent much better as a group hybrid turrets need some serious attention given to them the same as projectiles just receivedalso as much as i hate to swing the nerf bat lasers
want it need it willing to buy it wont complain if it can only carry 23 bssized hulls minimal cargo capacity 5000 m3 max for modules etc in a corp hangar similar to the orca preferred hideously expensive to train for and buy  im ok with that t2  vastly unequal insurance payoutcost ratio  no problem we need this that badly
also repackaging ships will void any insurance you have on the ship
you dont need to repackage ships to put them into a courier contract to put them into a freighter
the reason why repackaging is hard to managewhen you repackage a ship it becomes another item that is essentially generic everything that was on the ship is no more they would need to create variables for what is equipped on the ship but if they did that and someone put the ship on the market the buyer wouldnt know what is currently equipped neither would the seller no option on repackaged items to view fittings on the interface the solution to that new issue would be to add a flag to the repackaged item to prevent selling on market and add an interface action to view the fittings but theres also another problem now what if you have more than one ship with different modules if you stacked the repackaged ships together one would become a copy of the other of course now you could have a script each time you attempt to stack to verify the ships are equipped with the same things so that makes another issue now lets say you repackaged 4 ships with different fittings in separate stacks how do i tell which is which easilyso yeah it carries on like that way too much stuff to think over so that solution is probably not the best a new ship or repackaging methods could maybe work
agreed they got rid of ghost training ghost rd should go to
issueif you join a fleet with armour bonuses they are applied instantly adding xx  to your armourif you join a fleet with shield bonuses they are not applied instantly instead your total shield is increased but the amount is shown as damage requiring you to wait for a long time for it to passively recharge or to boost it  have it boosted to max before you can enjoy the full bonuseven worse this happens every time you change sessions undock jump system jump cyno etcproposalmake shield bonuses apply instantly like armour if you have already taken damage its easy to not make it exploitable by making new shield   old shield  or one of many other waysthe proposal has been brought up a first time and it was deemed incomplete i would like to reraise it with the following additionto prevent passive shield tankers depending on recharge to gain benefits from this bonus it should increase shield recharge time by the same  that it does shield hpthis should count for both normal gang bonuses and titan fleet bonuses so that the siege warfare skill would readincreases gang member shield hp and recharge time by 2 per leveland the leviathan description would readincrease gang members shield hp and recharge time by 75 per levelthis makes sure that the recharge rate per second stays the same when compared to nonbonused thus negating any advantage the ship main gain from recharge  sokevelopedia link
shield fleet bonus increase total shields and so they increase regeneration rate something that armor bonuses dont do if ccp find a way to remove that added bonus ok if it stay no
what venkul mul said above youre still getting a bonus from the moment they start to applynot supported as its clear you havent thought this through
you say that on a lot of thingswhat is the bonus a very small increase in recharge rate hardly impressive except maybe on drakes and nighthawkson battleships it can take up to 10 minutes for the shields to passively recharge and thus effectively be the full bonus on capitals it can take hours
i support this fully mainly as it annoys me when i have a lil red blip on my hud 
supported and to the people that say the recharge rate bonus is good enough it really is stupidly tinythe real bonus you need is that bit extra ehp to keep your fleet going for longer
this makes perfect sense i dont understand you guys shooting it downhave you ever been in a fleet with bonuses onsupported
if i say that on a lot of things its probably because there are a lot of badly thought out ideas floatedlet me explain how shield tanking works as you apparently dont knowshields regen naturally over time each ship has a shield amount and a recharge time the recharge time to full is constant regardless of the actual size of the shields so if you boost your shield amount then you are also increasing the amount recharged per second thats not a trivial bonus on any ship that shield tanksarmour by contrast doesnt regen naturally which is why the bonus amount from gang bonuses is applied immediately  otherwise it would be useless to any ship that didnt have an armour repper fitted and all ships would have to waste some cap repairing themselves to full every time the session changed
signed
fully supported as i am well skilled commandship pilot it is really annoying
you get the recharge bonus and the ehp buff youre still getting the bonus to your max shields regardless seriously do you guys even play the game
supportedalternatively i guess you could make armor gang bonuses require 40 seconds to take effect
now now get off your high horsei know my share about shield tanks thank you very much and to 99 of pvp fits recharge is an unimportant factor and the bonus in that area does nothing to aid them basically armour ships are 375 better off right off the bat unless the shield ships have the ability to regen it which takes ages or rep it up which takes loads of capyes it very much is trivial
hm  not sure it is possible code wise  but how about the shield amount bonus also increases the shield recharge time by a few percent then you dont boost passive shield tanks too much and still get your instant buffer
this was fun to think through i think its an excellent point for discussion and i nearly gave it a full support however after looking at the functions i think its actually a good mechanic as istldr i think the current function is fair as shield tanks can reap the benefits quickly by repping either passive or active while for armor tanks it doesnt really matteras a shield tank ive always rapidly filled the bonus hp either by one quick shot from a booster on an active tank or from the sheer rapid recharge on a passive tankfor my fleet mates who armortank the bonus does take an exceptionally long time to fill which severely negates its usefulness at first glance this seems unfair as i immediately reap the benefits of an added armorhp increase while they get almost nothing from the shieldhp increasehowever since all of my defenses are focused into shields when i hit armor my tank is broken and im on the way out an armor bonus is marginal and has never determined the outcome of a battle likewise my fleet mates dont gain significant benefit from the added shield hpeven if someone remote reps it to full when they come under fire the shields are gone within seconds and theyve started armorreppingthus i think the way it functions currently is fair shield tanks are able to reap the benefits despite that the mechanic adds the hp unfilled and armor tanks dont need it imo hull tanks well theyre having other issues
no they cant unless given a lot of time to recharge shieldsthat would be a very fair compromise
as i said in my previous post in my experience as a shield tank subcapital ive always been able to fill bonus hp quickly on an active tank it only takes one activation of a booster on a passive tank ie the drake the recharge rate is still fast enough near 100 capacity to quickly fill the hphas your experience proven different
its hit me that im looking at this from primarily a mission runners perspectiveso im always tanked to selfrepair a buffered shield tank fit for pvp with no active recharge and no reduction on recharge rate would have to wait it out as you sayi can see how that severely hampers the effectiveness of the buff especially since its reapplied every time you jump systems looking at it that way id support having it autofill the hp
shield buffered hacs and bs will usually not have a shieldbooster so they rely on passive recharge only on capitals the shield amount boosted is negligeble compared to the total hp so that it doesnt work for them either
however buffer tanks by definiton do better from the enhanced regen rate as thats the core of their defence also buffer tanks and very high ehp ships like capitals are the least likely to need that instant 1015 shield bonus as they are very unlikely to be alphad the longer they tank for the less important that shield bonus becomes and the more important the regen bonus is by contrast the fast recharging shield tankers who rely on recharge rate and have a small enough shield buffer that a bonus is the difference between being alphad and surviving long enough to escape or get repped will regen that bonus very fast and profit from it almost immediatelyso again its an unnecessary change
shield regen rate is basically a nonissue in pvp people tend to stay a long time in in session in pve i dont see what the problem is shields and armour are already balanced with respect to passive regen  that 15 bonus gives me a lot more extra hitpoints from a 1600mm rt than it does from an lse iithis especially applies to capital ships the armour tankers get a big boost from gang bonuses the shield tankers effectively get nothing
no a buffer tank works by having lots of ehp to start with the regen rate is irrelevant a passive tank which is a very different thing works on regen rate
thats borderline trolling
only if you dont understand the argumentedit herschel and i just had a long conversation in csm public i guess ive not been too clear on how ive put my objections forwards so let me clear it upthe problem that needs fixing is really persistence of bonuses over different sessions not so much the instant application as that has repercussions at the other end of the scale on passive tanks and smaller stuff so if the discussion is about keeping the bonus persistent across sessions so that shild tanking cap pilots arent disadvantaged in hotdrops etc then fine i can get behind that
hmm well you didnt make much effort to make the argument clear originally id be quite happy for the bonuses to be persistent across sessions youre correct in that this is the core of the problem
supportedi dont know and care much about big fleets i just fly mostly in a 2 men fleet and my squad leader is a siege warfare specialist with mindlink that gives quite a big boost on my shieldsit takes me 2 cycles with a xlarge shield booster to fill up the shield if i dont do that the boost is pretty uselessand of course its depleting my cap significantly to fill up the shieldsthe annoying thing is you have to do this every time you jump or dockso i sign this
in my defence im pretty sick at the moment this means im both less clear and more crotchety than usual apologies to all if ive given offencethe session persistence is the major issue that i see i wouldnt like to see the original proposal implemented as i believe that would be a big boost to some types of shield tank such as passive tanks that dont really need it however i do think that the problem for large buffer tanks needs to be solvedin my opinion this is an engineering issue for ccp to solve the csm should be pointing out the desired outcome bonuses persisting across sessions and not trying to engineer it themselves
that would not be a solution because bonuses are applied only when the person giving them is in local with you which when changing sessions is never the case even if it were recharging from 72 to 100 takes about 5 hours on titans and motherships and 1 hour on carriers and dreads so the disparity would largely remainbut as promised some numberstypical rokh fit 10625 shields recharge time 1875srecharges 0053 of its shield hp per secondmaximum gang bonus of 375 shield hp would increase that to 0073 per second and it would take approximately 16 minutes to passively recharge from 72 to 100typical chimera fit 156250 shields recharge time 15000srecharges 00067 of its shield hp per secondmaximum gang bonus of 375 shield hp would increase that to 00092 per secondand it would take approximately 125 minutes to passively recharge from 72 to 100typical leviathan fit 2808000 shields recharge time 36000srecharges 00027 of its shield hp per secondmaximum gang bonus of 375 shield hp would increase that to 000382 per secondand it would take approximately 300  minutes to passively recharge from 72 to 100the shield recharge times are approximations but should not be far offthis shows how ridiculously long it takes for the passive recharge to become a full bonus unlike the armour hp which works instantly

certainly static insurance rates and payouts is inherently simplistic and flawed though the problem can be solved in multiple ways really insurance is a variablerate isk faucet and in theory can also act as a sinkthink about it  if everybody insured their ships  and none of the ships died before policy expiry  we actually have isk being removed from the system in reality insured ships tend to die in combat but some of them survive and the policy expires when mineralsships are expensive the ship is worth more alive than dead under these conditions insurance is an isk faucet but its not out of control at this pointright now we have a perverse situation due to carebear overproduction and lack of demand except for insurance fraud demand  minerals are extremely cheap and t1 ships are actually profitable to selfdestruct because of the static insurance rates what does it mean insurance fraudthe  of policies redeemed vs expiry is approaching 100 furthermore the number of policies created is skyrocketing both of these conditions lead to massive injections of isk into the economy the isk faucet is now a firehose supporting a huge population of resource gathererers which then continue to overproduce mineralsthis problem can be solved by either reducingremoving insurance across the board or driving up mineral prices one or the other needs to happen though i prefer the latter but as far as im concerned  doing nothing would be a disaster
offering my support both sides of the issue have valid points but most important to get this into the csm for discussion and let them find a middle ground that the majority can live with
not supported sometimes i wish the queue would be little longer say a week and not only a daybut i can live with that

you dont understand his point try reading and comprehending before replying whether you are displaying the custom colours or not the server still has to send that info to you for every ship on the grid turning the option off might reduce the amount of work your graphics card does but it doesnt do anything at all to reduce the network overheadsyoull note that none of the games you listed as examples are mmos there are mmos that have systems like this but they dont routinely have 900 players in the same place

aye i was goin to buy myself a 2nd char but after all thesesupport this 100
i agree to this
even though ive been massively lucky in the past i still think that doing something about this would be the right way to go for ccp and would better protect the player base as a whole
let me start off by saying that i fully agree that security needs to be improved i believe its too easy for someone who has gained access to an account to strip it not only of ingame assets which is bad enough but also of the most valuable thing it has which is training time invested in charactershaving said that removing the legitimate trade in characters will simply drive it underground where ccp will have no control over it at all i believe that to be a bad thing just like gtcs having a sanctioned and theoretically secure channel to trade characters lessens the influence of shady rmt companies and provides another option for making money ingame for many playersregarding account security there is only so much that ccp can do to protect you from yourself yes i understand that many players are not security conscious and that people do dumb things like put their passwords into random webforms sent by email short of producing account dongles like blizzard has for wow though im struggling to see how ccp can do more than the end user can to make the account secure this isnt just ccps problem to solve so much revolves around online interactions these days that internet literacy including security basics should be just as much a requirement for modern life as the ability to read and write in other words people need to be educated and to educate themselves and that isnt entirely ccps responsibilitytldr yes to improved account security  confirmation mails when personal details change on the account page or when character transfers are requested etc no to removing the character trade entirely users are responsible for their own security and they need to educate themselves rather than relying on others to fix the mess afterwards
going to support this not because i was told to but because i have always believed there is too much metagaming in eve  onlineive grown accustomed to it over the years have come to accept the need for alts especially in my line of work but i have trained my own alts with my own money and my own timeive always thought character sellingtrading was right on the borderline of what should be allowed for metagaming people should at the very least pay for and train their own alts not purchase them from other people in some barely secure web forumfurthermore with the recent increase in account hacking and the subsequent selling of the characters hacked i think its high time ccp looks into this issue and shuts down this method for the isk farmers to make incomealso without the character bazaar ccps job of administering the ejustice becomes a lot easier not just for isk sellers but for people trying to dodge a banhammer for other reasons as well for all the reasons mentioned above and also for all the reasons verone mentioned i support this motion 100oh and id just like to make something clear to those that dont get ityou can have your account hacked and your character sold without ever having clicked a keylogger link on the eveo forums there are many ways of getting keyloggers installed on your system and not even running the most paranoid of firewallsantivirusmalware software will save you it is far too easy to compromise a system and get this information ive taken college courses on the subject and know how this is done its actually quite a simple task to compromise your average system so dont go thinking im immune because im not ed its just stupid talk take matters into your own hands players of eve support this motion get ccp to realize that this is a huge issue that needs to be dealt with and the first step is what is suggested abovefor everyone elsechange your passwords today how long has it been since you last changed em can you type your password from memory its probably been too long then run a system scan or three just to be suregood luck and merry christmas to ccp  the players a giant lump of flaming dog poo for the dirty isk farmers

in support of this thread
i couldnt agree more i fully support this thread 100
would reduce the scope of such trades greatly anyway i do believe that forbidding character trade would be for good after all although its sort of a mixed case really dont belive csm would be able to do anything about this even if all delegates wanted to its not even ingame issue or anything its the rules which are set by ccp
hear hear
completely supported
i support this idea
i agree its getting a bit sillywill this drive the market underground most assuredly however there will be much less people willing to get involved with this and it will increase the time significantly in regards to actually getting the character sold this gives the real account owner much more time to notice that his account has been hacked and for ccp to do something about itbasically they hack an account sell the characters and then sell the isk for real cash before ccp comes along and resets the account and the isk in the end the people who really lose here are the people that bought the ill gotten isk as itll get reset to the original owner once ccp takes action the problem is the real culprit still gets away with the real cash as long as we can stop them before the cash transaction takes place they wont have an incentive to do this sort of crap

if ppl started using their bains rather then being mindlless morons that click on every link they find it wouldnt be a issue at alli see no reason to support this why punish everyone for the stupidity of the few
going to have to say i agree
i can certainly see where you are coming from being a highprofile player verone but is abolishing character trading as a whole really necessary to achieve what you are trying to do enhance account security with randomized keys similar to what banks are doing add a highly visible entry in employment history with the day of trade email verification several days prior to trade add same type of verification if registered email is changed through website etcremoving character trades completely when there are plenty of ways to avoidminimize id theft still out there makes little sense to me
i dont consider myself a high profile player at all i like to think ive done my part in assisting making eve a little more enjoyable for the player base with all the evetv and tournament stuff and the guides and articles in eon but in the end its the people leading major power holding alliances that are the ones whore high profileremove the incentive and you remove the problemgranted the situation will never be completely resolved but those who choose to trade characters do so at their own risk if ccp make the stand to remove character trading youll find that 999 of people wont bother due to the risk of losing years of work on character developmentcoupled with this it removes the incentive for people to have their accounts ripped off to sell their characters because theres no buyers sat there with tens of billions in easy money that rmt companies can sell on quickly for real life profit before ccp cotton on to to whats happened
voicing my support haviong had my account hacked before id have hated if mella was sold
this is my belief too
i dont agree with selling and buying chars but i totally agree that the login procedure and the security of an account should be more safeits way to easy to hack somones login and its impossible to make a windows system safe to prevent this so ccp here has something to do to make the account safer they are ways to do thatyou can use sort of an asymmetric keypair like pgp is doing that which can make this login procedure pretty good private and even if a keylogger is logging the password the account cannot be completly hacked
insurance is broken  you should not be able to purchase a bs fit it with smartbombs buy platinum insurance go gank a hulk and cost someone well over 100 million isk and make a profit in the bargain when your ship gets destroyed as a result of your action wheres the riskvsreward in that im not against ganking by all means gank every macror you find  if a target has the potential to pay for replacing your losses then hit it and kill it i simply want to make ganking have more risk for the aggressor than it currently doesanything else such as what we have now is badly broken as a carebear i realize that if i make a mistake and get concorded in a mission i will also lose my insurance payout im fine with that  its riskvsreward if i get ganked and a faction module drops well the ganker took a chance and it worked in hisher favor no problems therebut fix this thricecursed current system
on common carebear cries to remove insurance for concord kills and self destruction watching people post this is by far my biggest pet peeve as it shows that most people have very little understanding of how economic systems workit sounds good on the surface at least to the bears  in much in the same way as calls for raising the minimum wage sounds appealing but it inevitably leads to more unemployment for the lowest paid workersactual resultsremoving insurance for self destruction will accomplish precisely nothing as there are tons of other ways to artificially kill battleships rapidly and collect the insuranceremoving insurance from concord kills ie suicide gank nerf actually aggravates the problem by making carebear mineral producers even safer and more numerous it reduces combat and legitimate ship destruction further and leaves insurance in place  so those ships would invariably end up being artificially destroyed outside a manufacturing center merely for the insurance payoutinsurance is simplistic and flawed yes if fixing the insurance system is too difficult however those flaws become safely hidden if we improve the game by driving up the value of minerals through encouraging a marginal increase in ganking and less mindless resource gatheringnot supported
i support this ive said it in several threads on the topic now and im surprised that i havent seen other posts noting it could be my fault for reading through too quicklyanyway i think the problem is internal logic its absurd for concord to blow up my ship and then have its ally the scc pay me for the loss they are in the same bloody allianceyes suicide ganking would be impacted by the change but i think suicide ganking is tangential to the issue not a direct factor
you got to level 4 missions and didnt know that you can be warp scrambled ebayed account or just naive
this also a i would love to have notification to friendlys as to what are your fleet members doing as far as ew to enemies who is jamming painting who if he has cycle or not would make coordination of ew for fc much easier
all you need to do is to drag your overview window wide enough or make the columns narrow enough that theres a small bit of blank space down the right hand side et voila no more visibility problems
seriously its not an issuesure it could be made more apparent but i never had a problem with it
last time i checked the call for shooting things in lvl 4s was points and ewar and then dps then everything elseso why on earth you werent looking for the ships pointing you is beyond menot a problem adapt or die well you already did die but still you get my point
erm reread the op its not about letting newbies directly on the forums  just allowing access to the api backend many of us create new chars as cyno alts and whatnot  having the ability to load them into evemon directly and plan their training most efficiently seems like a smart thing no
totally agree
it would make our corp look even more like a pink floyd concert great
awsome idea ccp make it happen please
canUFFFDt be hard to realize and doesnUFFFDt inbalance anything so why not supported
in no way am i implying that we scrap what is already there i just think that you should train faster for actively using skills and going out and playing
we know what you were suggesting and its still ing terrible because it introduces skill grinding into eve
this not supported
qft
grinding in my eve wow that wayrunescape that way 
this post makes me want an oppose option for this forum sooo bad
a if someone scammed you it was an alt and they arent going to leave jita 44 so youd be wasting your isk anyway b if someone stole ships and isk from your corp they probably had another corp lined up to take them or they are selling the character and so you wont actually be wardeccing them just the poor sod who they sold the character toin summary short of busting into the persons house holding a gun to his head and forcing him to undock and fight you you wont get your revenge unless hes a complete idiot no matter the system you introduce in which case congratulations you were outwitted by an idiot
first im not being snarky  just cant tell if your serious or not back in 2004 eve was just like thateve topped out at roughly 30k subs and 10k online at once often times as few as 5 to 8k concurrent usersthere is a devblog somewhere i cant remember where that showedexplainedstated that eve became financially viable at 50k subsccp has been limiting segregating controlling and directing pvp for the last 5 years instituting hilow0 sec space concord wardecs nerf lofty nerf etc etc in an effort to increase subs have they gone too far vov i dont know however if they did take concord out i would probably set some cap skills training and just wait it outremoving concord would result in a metric kraptonne of people not undocking setting long skills training and checking the forums for when the rollback would take place if they even bothered keeping their subscription active
sorry to disappoint you but its already been addressed
yeah were definitely not advocating the removal of concord that would basically be chaos and i agree with your estimations of the impact ie people never undocking it just seems like the proposed everyonecanbeawardectarget idea creates an environment that isnt too far off from that
up from page 5 to support my own idea
err you really couldnt read the release notesjust in case you cant find it right click on the white triangle next to your speed display  show zoom buttonsnothing to support here lets move to the next thing
besides what previous poster said how is it cumbersome and clumsy for laptop users i basicly always play on laptop usually without using a mouse and never had any issues with zooming just press both mouse button and move a bit arround on touchpad
hmmm i didnt notice that however the functionality doesnt seem to work as it once did instead of zooming in and out to general preset distances it just moves the camera one small increment in or out this is hardly practicalanswered your own question
as a trader and industrialist who still only makes a few adjustments a day i dont understand the purpose of this proposal other than to reduce competitiveness in the marketplacewhat problem do you want to solve here
penalize those who just sit on market orders and adjust them down by 001 isk ten seconds after youve put up an orderit would advantage those who put up orders and actually let them run for a little while and go off to do other things beside try to hold the botspot on every item in existance
i can only support this its way to easy to hack someones computer and get his accountsand there is no real chance to avoid this because even if you are a computer nerd windows is open to every attackwith the right tools you have a good chance to keylog any computer you really want to
my petition has been concluded and nothing will be done by ccp to help in anywaylet this be a warning to anyone who might get thier account compromised you will lose everything and from my experience nothing will be done to help youthey might as well endorse hackers with open arms
easiest way to balance shieldarmor tanks is to remove all low slot shield modulesthat or bring some mid slot armor mods into the game
only if the mid slot shield mods get a massive boost oh and lets remember that the low slot shield mods only help in passive tanking unless of course your refering to the dcu wich is more for a buffer tank ship than anything else honestly stop trying to nerf somthing that dosent need nerfing
facepalmdid you read the thread
dear all i would like to raise awareness of problems with sov structures during the past few weeks my alliance recently encountered the difference in online time and actual description of the sov blocker unit and a petition to ccp was opened when our tcu became vulnerable within the 6 hour described time before the 103 patchproblems have arisen with the petition and i feel this should be made public as to get other peoples opinions when dealing with these problemsthe initial post to ccp read it took 4 days for a response after posting another request for feedbackafter this post i got a response they asked for teh system name which was given and then no more replys for about 45 days gm correspondence removed as per the forum rulessteviesgremember this was before the 103 patch which changed the description we had no idea that the actual time was 3 hours instead of the described 6 capitals were used as i felt annoyed by this statement it was possibly unfair to use this tone however we wanted compensation we didnt want a refund of our deathstar pos nor the ships we lost in the defense of it it was a game mechanic advertised wrongly thus we felt we should get a refund of monies lost buying our tcugm correspondence removed as per the forum rulessteviesgreally now so i dug up the patch notes to send back apologies for the wall of text but i think this should be a matter disclosed for public discussion as this affects more than one player during this time have their been any other corps who have been blighted by this ninja game mecahnic change and the stubbornness of gms not addressing the issue i would like to raise this with the council for public discussion we just want the tcu refunded not the countless millions we lost in defense of it or the po
nvm
ah well yes it might look a little cluttered right now this is because i run on a 1600x900 resolution and wanted to make sure it could be viewable by all so i decreased it to almost half having to scale down the tabs since they cant be deactivated making it all look clutteredhowever since most peoples screens are wider than taller imo it would be better to expand it to the sides also if all these functions were implemented you would only need one screen which could cover your entire screen or most of it
i agree totallyas a mission runner im regularly selling lots of random stuff and would make it a lot easier to be able to just accept the default price of many items all at oncei support this
having just got a replacement credit card i went to update my details on the eve website first bad thing is it told me i was going to be paying another 15 euros for the privelige the main problem tho is that when i pressed ok to finish it all off an error screen came up saying it had failed and i had to press the back button and try againassuming i had made a mistake i then did this tried it on both accounts i have a few timesafter doing it 4 times in total i noticed that it had in fact actually changed the details the first time and that id just paid for an extra 2 month of play on both accounts fine to know ive got over 75 days of paid time on both accounts but didnt want to pay for it all in one gothis could well be a big issue as ive got to pay for my car tax this week and im also going away for a short holiday half way through january so effectively being conned out of nearly UFFFD60 is a potential disasterplease fix this problem with the website
i had my credit card compromised and new one issued i went to update my credit card info so that the next payment would be processed on the active card and found the same thing of being charged the full subscription amount which in my case is 6 monthsupdating billing information shouldnt initiate a full charge of your regular subscription length
cause then more people will use it and maybe lessbuggy
they bought the technology for it
well its now very clear to me because i petitioned it and here is the answer i goti am gm cryobunny i am here to assist you with your petition thank you for contacting customer support according to our policy such actions are not considered as exploit every player is free to leave any corporation any time they want 
not supportedyou can mine all day without any risk read a book or watch videos wipe out belt after beltyou cant do that with level iv missions at all you need to active play itif you are smart and rich one player can mine with multiple accounts having an orca and multiple hulksyou cant do that with level iv missions at all
not sure if serious pic
no the realtime training whether you play or not is a huge draw of eve and touted as one of the features that makes it truly unique i absolutely do not agree to essentially changing this to an eqwowstyle xp grindfest your benefit for actively playing is isk
the benefit for actively playing is fun if you arent getting that benefit then perhaps you should gtfo
thanks for the list el but could you please add links to the appropriate discussions some of these im not quite familiar with and would like to read about
heres the proposal thenmake interdictors true reflections of their t1 hulls to maintain the consistency that pretty much all other ships followheretic  lasersflycatcher  hybridseris  single weapon platform hybrids or drone platformdestroyers were not well thought out when they were released leaving 1 very capable one still a paper tiger but capable and three sub par they need a lot more help than just this minor change to be sure
okay i thought i mustve missed something since no one else responded to the post but i have been under the impression ccp reps are supposed to be there to discuss the issues as well in any case ill second the gj on the minuted td 
seth ccp only come to the official ccpcsm meetings during the csm term theres 3 of those 1 in iceland and 2 in game
ah okay thanks
ill only support this if it applies only to outside of alliancecorp logisticsthose in the same alliancecorp should be freely allowed to give each other reps without incurring an agression flag if you put this into place across the board it will effectively kill the ability to roam in rr gangs in lowsec at least not only will it affect your ability to travel but also it will force a rr gang into committing 100 into a fight with no possible withdrawal optionslets look at a hypothetical scenarioyoure roaming in a 10 man rr battleship gang with your corpalliance mates and your scout finds a hostile fleet of equal or larger numbers camping a gate your fc decides to engage said gang initially its all joy and roses as youre easily able to tank the hostile gang and begin to take then downthen the hostiles decide to bring in more ships or they decide to hotdrop capitals into the fray yes it happens a lot now things arent looking so rosey and youre unable to do significant damage to the opposing fleet so your fc decides to give the order to deagresswhile youre in your cooldown period from deagression you still need to keep each other alive but oh shiiii weve all got an agression timer now and cant even consider jumping though the gate to at least save some of hopefully most of our asses and were all now doomed to lose our ships because eventually well sucumbe to the onslaughtnow please dont take this as a whine because its not im merely pointing out just 1 of many hypothetical situations where an across the board agression timer for logistics would pretty much kill any chance of an already hard to find good fightfeel free to flame me unconditionally if im totally wrong here of course but as far as i can tell a lot of you guys supporting this arent really looking at the larger picture of pvp and gang warfare in genaralspas
agreedas the original post is put up im not gonna support it
anyone who doesnt support this in all likelyhood partakes in neutral repping which is a cheap part of the game that pretty much shouts im a coward
you guys need to think this through before voting for this at the moment it is not easy to know how many actually choose to recativate accounts for this purpose but i am one of themstill you may say that it deflates value of datacores this is true but you are forgetting the fact that the price of t2 stuff is still going up atm and the datacores costs alotthey can take some more deflation imho and if this is implemented they will reach an all time highgive it some thought
yet why should you get the benefit of an account that youre not paying for
not saying you should im just saying what the results of such a change would beedit leave space for people to find text
if your not paying for the account you have no business exploiting an game mechanicmarket prices are frakked as it is because of the exploitation and anything else you can think of that people shouldnt be doing it isnt an excuse to allow it to continuefor you to even dare defend such a thing proves this is a larger problem than you claim it not to be
right lets try to have an intelligent discussionyour first point if your not paying for the account you have no business exploiting an game mechanici agree with this apart from the fact that you call it an exploit it has been like this since 2003your second point market prices are frakked as it is because of the exploitation and anything else you can think of that people shouldnt be doing it isnt an excuse to allow it to continuewhat allowing this particular thing to continue will allow the prices to remain as they are stopping it would create a massive increase in t2 prices that would frakk the marketyour third point for you to even dare defend such a thing proves this is a larger problem than you claim it not to beat the moment the market would suffer more from changing the current mechanicbroken or not than it would benefit from it so yes i am defending it have you even seen the t2 ship prices latelydarax thulain
daraxi dont think the markets are a fragile as you make them out to be lets say this proposal goes through and the exploit gets fixed you could still maintain your datacore income by simply paying for those accounts every month like everyone else or lets say you the greater you of people that do this choose to fight back by not paying for your accounts and attempt to crash the t2  invention market a temporary vacuum will be created that will be immediately filled by entrepreneursi envision things will go like this ccp announces the end of ghost datacore production all accounts like yours become active and cash in to avoid losing the cores you have already accumulated a small but temporary decrease in t2 prices result as the market is flooded those flood stocks will eventually run low increasing demand active players will notice this and rush in to fill this demand and their wallets the markets will again stabilize healthier than before thanks to active producers supplying a steady stream of cores rather than a group of individuals dumping thousands of cores into the market on an annual basisanother way to look at it if you choose to not keep your accounts active then you could always sell the characters on the forums for another isk windfall to people that will keep them active and producing coresas always feedback and discussion is appreciatededit just because this loophole has been around since 2003 is no reason for it to continue our goal should be to make this a more fair  balanced game
 vodwell you do make alot of sense as far as prediction goes this one is as good as any but since i am one that have made numerous rd alts i can at least attest that this isnt something you do overnight and the market would not be immediately
daraxi appreciate you arguing the other side of this issue it has given me some valuable insight on the potential results of its passageto pick your brain a little further if this measure is passed and implemented what would your likely course of action be with your datacore accounts although its a given that any market speculation at this point would just be a shot in the dark lets say datacore prices were to increase would this influence you to keep those accounts active and reap the rewards or would you find it more viable to just move on and sell the accts legally or let them sit unusedat this point im just trying to gain more info on the results  impact of this issue on characters like you and the marketsvod
market results easy enoughif all unsubbed accounts used to farm datacores where subbed because of this change prices would remain at roughly the same level there may a slight decrease at first from ppl cashing in their datacores all at once but over a period of time the price would stabilize back to their normal levels the accounts that are left to die would be replaced with new datacore farmers
it all depend on your definition of pvpgatecamping is pvp the shield regen rate help a lot while armor buffer tankers need the help of repair drones from other peoplesieging a pos without a gunner again the reg rate help a lot while armor tankers need rrroaming gang sure the shield thing suck there as you are jumping to another system every few minutesthey have different advantages i repeat if you want istant regeneration after each jump you must pay losing the extra regeneration over time one or the other not bothoh look lots of hp one of the requisites to have lots of ehp mean you have a good regeneration rate and having them boosted increase that regeneration rate
ehm no the recharge  stay the same the hp recharged change so taking your typical fit numbers for granted10625 shields recharge time 1875s recharge 566 per secondwith bonus 14608 and 779 hps156250 shields recharge time 15000s recharge 1041 per secondwith bonus 214843 and 1432 hps2808000 shields recharge time 36000s recharge 780 per secondwith bonus 3861000 and 10725 hpsso if you dont want to lose the bonus regeneration and want istant hp the other solution is that armor link should give a bonus to armor reppers beside the armor hp
i could say the same to youthe ehp buff only arrives after the shield has regenerated itself which on a bs can take a good 1015 minutes and on a cap it probably wont regen before you get bored and log so basically if your moving around in a fleet and jump into an enemy gang you want all of your bonuses applied instantly to gain max ehp but with the shield one you dont gain the hitpoints before the fights over
first i find it unnecessary to arbitrarily reduce shield regeneration rate if applying the proposed solution by the very examples sokratesz and you provided such a detriment would not even be significant were talking about reducing a percentage of 053 to an even smaller number adding the shield hp immediately upon receiving the bonus would not enable the recharge rate to be an overwhelming factor for any of the shipexamples providedsecond there are already warfare links which provide bonuses to armor repairers the proposed change addresses the perceived problem that shield hp bonuses are at a disadvantage to armor hp bonuses at a level which causes imbalance if you upgrade the shield hp bonus to pursue balance why is it necessary to add a bonus to armor repairers thus recreating the imbalance
supporting the original idea proposed by sokratesz in this thread im tired of newbs asking me why they just took some damage when they join my fleets the newbs are right they shouldnt receive damaged shields as a bonus for being in fleet and even newbs know itnot supporting all the bickering and faulty logic thrown up by the opposition in this thread
the bonus is good as is
so to sum it up you want both advantages for 1 shield shield link but nor for 1 armor linkif the 375 increase in recharge rate is not important you can shed it without problem and in exchange get the shield buff immediatelyif it is important so you dont want to give a similar advantage not a 375 bonus to active repping note but a bonus that give a comparable passive repair or a bit larger active repair bonus to armor buffing links you have and advantage bonus recharge rate in exchange to a disadvantage not immediate buffing of hpyou can chose one or the other not both btw the title of the theread is shield gang bonuses should be applied just like armor ones and it is exactly what i am suggestingyou get the immediate hp increase but lose the shield regeneration bonus
all the arguments about the shield regeneration are ridiculous if your shields arent passive tank fit then it doesnt matterbut how about this as a solutionsince shields dont fill up the potential max is increased do the same to armorinstead of filling up the armor increase its potential max they would need to rep up to enjoy the benefits then armor tankers would be on an more even playing field in regards to fleet bonuses
just had loot stolen againnow ccp may i ask how difficult it was to makecans belonge to the one who drops itnpc wrecks belonge to the one who started the missionmake a wreck flag free for all and if you get concorded because of a suicide run make the suicideganker wreck free for allmust be difficult to programm a solution to our problem

actually i debate it at least in the long term remember that while insurance provides a floor to mineral and ship prices it also provides a ceiling most larger t1 ships tend to hover around insurance profit plus or minus 1 for those ships which can be produced cheaper with that incentive gone shipbuilders are going to leave the large t1 game removing insurance would long term drive up prices on large t1 ships while driving down low end mineral prices the net result is new players make less while older players make more the truth is that a player willing to accept the boredom of mass suiciding himself can make 12mil per battleship buying off the market the builder supplying him can make perhaps 35 but to produce in quantity requires considerable time effort and seed capital as a relatively new player with only nine figures in my account i cant see how the high end of that equation is especially meaningful the low end though serves only to accelerate the new players if someone has 1bil to buy a bpo at market puts the time into researching it to proftability makes the effort to collect the materials and find factory slots he can burn 247 for weeks i dont see how a profit of roughly 5milhrslot based on four hour per ship production is going to be a big deal maybe if there was a way to bid for factory slots  
how it is now payout  2  premium  basevalue  04how it can be payout  2  premiumi think removing the 40 unconditional payout while leaving the double premium compensation alone would be what the majority can live with it would require the ships market value to be 30 of base value to break even with insurance instead of the current 70 of base value i dont see ship prices dropping that low in the foreseeable future
my only problem with the idea of modifying the base payout in any way is that right now t1 ships and by extension their components are pegged to insurance plus or minus 1 the more you believe that overproduction for suicide is propping prices up the more true this is if 10 of the ships constructed are sold as suicides no insurance change in any direction will change much else if 90 of battleship production is for suicide then changing insurance rates will directly change the prices those builders are willing to pay for minerals so they can still make suicide ships raise payouts mineral prices go up directing more filthy lucre from the megarich mass suicide builders to the newb miners lower payout and you wont change the big boys balance sheet much but you will change the new guys an alternate theory is that there is a magic number below which the big boys will stop in that case theyll probably stop building ships entirely raising the price on a bs even as the mineral prices plummet
i prefer having a single char that can do it all however i can see how this would lessen log outin hassle for others and less load for login related servers
a simple alpha layer to control colors of certain parts of the ship shouldnt cause much load because the base skin texture is still the same on all ships doubt it would increase lag either since the extra data here is simply rgb codesafaik this is what is already done between all variations of a ship someone correct me with facts if this is untruealso this would be a fine isk sink as well
theyre all minmatar anyway just sell them at a minmatar station and let their fellow republicans free them or eat them or whatever it is they do to each other
confirming my support for this please ccp look at the ideas and concerns of us the players who are making faction warfare our end game a lot of very very good ideas in the various threads take a look or at least let us know if you have plans for fw throw us a bone ccp please

good idea i hate to do that over and over again and again and againsupported
good ideawell needed on the battlefield especially with the current dominion lag thumb up 
verone i sympathise with your sentiments but i fear the law of unintended consequences will come in to play hereat the moment with santioned legitimate character sales there is at least some recourse banning legal character sales will just drive more people in to the arms of the rmtersthe answer is improved options account security a cooldown period on character sales and maybe even an option to lock a character to an account for a specified period
supporting this topic for my brosef verone
in my opinion what they really need to do is secure the login systemthe primary email on the account should not be changed without gm intervention the method of changing the primary email on the account needs to be made as secure as possible to prevent unauthorized changesmultiple 3 failed login attempts need to be forwarded to the primary account email with 1 ip address of the person trying to login 2 region country state city 3 partial password half of it or sothe last successful login should be displayed when logging in including the ip address and regionplayers should be able to optin to a region lock to only allow an account to login from a particular region player can configure countries states cities that logins are allowed fromlogins that violate these conditions would alert the account owner and deny the logonany changes to the account including character transfers will require an email to be dispatched to the primary email to confirm the changesdisabling account transfers wont stop rmt or account hacking both of these were problems before ccp decided to put in the transfer systemaccount hacking can be fought by implementing new security measuresrmt can be fought by proactively going after isk sellers in the game and ruthlessly banning farming accounts before they have the ability to generate large amounts of iskhacking being on the rise is a sign to me that they are having a hard time generating billions of isk from farming because ccp is going after them so they are resorting to hacking to make up for the losses now that they are fighting rmt more its probably time to fight the account hacking by implementing some security measures for the 21st centuryi dont support disabling character transfers because in my opinion it wont fix anything by itself if they just disable character transfers they can still take the account and clean out the assets and isk leaving the player penniless they still winwhere as if they secure the logon systems more itll protect the accounts from their stuff being taken and prevent unauthorized character transfersbut i see where youre coming from and im fairly sure your overall goal is less hacked accounts
ill be the veto outcast and go against what seems to be the grain here hahive made for too much isk over the last 5 years from selling off old toons i get tired ofhave no use for to endorse thishowever if this thread were simply about beefing up security in some way longer passwords req of more complex passwords log in forms that firefoxie cant retain credentials for i would fully endorse it3 to the fascist dictator and those in the family that have recently had accounts hacked i just dont see quite eye to eye with many regarding this
agree with thissosigned
supported good arguments were put forward
pretty obvious that account hacking is on the rise verones idea at least represents a soft counter to the bs thats been taking place regarding this issue which is definitely better than nothing hopefully some sort of solution will come out of this if nothing else and hopefully the devs realize whats going on and do something to correct iti have made use of the character sale program before and in theory its nice but im not thrilled at the thought of my personal information being hacked over an online video game just so someone can make a few bucks i would prefer having account security over the ability to make some extra isk on the side or buy an alt anydaythread has my support
no issue here the scrambler notification on the overview is perfectly clear unless you havent turned it on in which case youre kinda dumb and should fix that
indeed one of the first things you tell a nub is to get evemon and play around with skill plans
plain and simple after you kill someones ship there drones unlock youi remember reading the game mechanics correctly and drones are controlled by a players ship so if the ship is no longer present then should the drones unlock the target they were shooting ati call for this because having just lost my arazu i only lost it because after my fleet and i had killed the ishtar we all started wrapping off i couldnt cloak because the ishtars drones were still locked onto me even after wed killed the ishtar his m8s came in and were able to get a point on me before i could warp awayi wouldnt of died had id just been able to cloak up
i agree seems that would make sense seeing how they are controlled by the ship hence is ship is gone the drones become should inactive
3rdd i agree with you that once the ownerowners ship is destroyed the drones should basically become imobile and stop every action including targetting
i support this
i support this yes once the ship is dead drones should stop all current actions i have experienced this scenario myself
supported needs a fix
agreed
agreed
agreed this proposal makes sense
another cloaker dies the world is a better placebut yes drones should shut down active locks once their controlling ship is gone they will even retain lock if that ship warps off or abandons them
eve is a game of risk vs reward and i love this game for that however i was sitting cloaked in a enemy system for a few hours scouting the activity in my pilgrim then i went to the cinema came back and was still cloaked and started watching activity againthen it hit mewhere is my risk in this i sit there and cloak in a safe spot makes me invincible no one can scan me down no one can probe me down and i will never decloak or risk anything unless i want to this does not seem like the eve i loveso im sure this as come up before but why not have cloaks require fuel of some sort give it a long like say5 minute cycle time which you can cancel mid cycle and have it cost 50 units of fuel there is plenty of room on those ships to carry enough for hours of cloaked but this would also prevent afk cloaking in systems and force pilots to actually be in the game at some pointi understand the common arguement of cloaked ships are weaker if they engage yesi know but thats if they engage and with fuel you can still hunt cloaked up for a couple hours and do everything you normally would but not for a day or two at a time the only thing this would effect is it would put a little cap on the perma afk of cloaked ships because i thought ccp wanted peopel to actually play the gamenot sit afk with no risk to their ships does not seem very eve like to me and i do it
thumbs down
they play the game they put psychological pressure on the people in the system or they gather intel all playingdont fix what aint broken god all the whining lately s
i knew there would be some one who fails to read i am a cloak user i do collect intel i do cloak in a system and gank their miners or ratters how is that whining i rather enjoy how easy it is heck i can get kills while eating dinner watching a movie or cleaning house its easy butis afk sitting in a system really playing and the main point was the risk where is the risk you sit invulnerable for as long as you want okwhat do you risk for your reward and if you say i risk getting baited well pick your targets better every one risks getting baitedjust saying i love cloaking up but afk cloakersare lame and i am guilty of it myself projectile guns werent broke but we fixed them in some peoples opinions nano didnt need to be nerfed by a lot of other peoles opinions i use cloaks and im against unlimited time for cloaking thats all
risk is only half the equation the other half is reward wheres the reward if its in spooking the insystenm players then you have to count your entry to and exit from the systems into that ratio as a covops pilot i know how risky those two points can be and feel they cover the reward in fact i would say your riskreward ratio is worse than a welltanked afkmacro miner
and of course youre always vulnerable to the ratterminer who pays attention and is on comms youre in 00 you should have friends
2 cloakers in local and miners cant do anything anymore no matter how much attention they pay cloakers never have to pay any attention and are completely safe and can risk free gank the miners if they would be stupid enough to continue mining
ratters are absolutely fine even miners can work if they pay attention mining with potential hostiles in system may be a bit difficult given that you need to watch dscan constantly but thats a problem with mining barges a bit too slowweak on buffer than with afk cloaking
how exactly do you see a cloaker on dscan they come in drop bombs you lose your hulks nothing you can do against it and the chance a ratting ship or worse someone doing anomaly surviving 2 sbs before help arrives is also very small
hulks against a couple afking sbs you probably have a point but thats a problem with hulkswhat kind of failfit ratting ship do you use that dies to a solo bomber if hes in point range you can put drones on him if you can put drones on him hes dead or if you can call in friends hes dead if your ratting ship cant survive that long then get a better ship for the job
which part of two did you not grasp and have you actually ever tried in a ratting ship or worse again anomalies against a nonfailfit sb it can take you out before your light drones kill it
lets not forget a pilgrim and a falcon combo can kill any ratting bs especially if they have a sb with them sb are not the only sneaky cloaked ships im all for being able to sneak around and hit and run and stuff thats a great aspect to the game im not saying get rid of cloaks cloaks are a ton of fun but reallydo you need to be able to be perma afk cloaked what if you could only carry enough fuel to last around say4 hours that is enough time to zoom in scout around and head back out again all it would do is hinder afk cloaking thats it not people who are actually trying to find targetsthat and it would help the economy we are in a recession 
eve is a game of risk vs reward and i love this game for that however i was sitting cloaked in a enemy system for a few hours scouting the activity in my pilgrim then i logged off went to the cinema came back and logged back in and started watching activity againthen it hit mewhere is my risk in this i sit there and logging off in a safe spot makes me invincible no one can scan me down no one can probe me down and i will never log back in or risk anything unless i want to this does not seem like the eve i loveso im sure this as come up before but why not have logging off require fuel of some sort give it a long like say5 minute cycle time which you can cancel mid cycle and have it cost 50 units of fuel there is plenty of room on those ships to carry enough for hours of logging off but this would also prevent logging off in systems and force pilots to actually be in the game at some pointi understand the common arguement of logged off ships are weaker if they engage yesi know but thats if they engage and with fuel you can still log off for a couple hours and do everything you normally would but not for a day or two at a time the only thing this would effect is it would put a little cap on the perma afk of logged off ships because i thought ccp wanted peopel to actually play the gamenot sit logged off with no risk to their ships does not seem very eve like to me and i do it
good for you for realizing there is no risk to cloakers in 00 unfortunately youll get flamed to hell and back by cloakers as they dont want to lose this immunity to them eve is a cold harsh universre only applies to everyone else not them
imho there is no need to change thisa cloaked ship activly is no harm to anyone it would make most activities i did with cloaked ships uselessnot supported

i believe the guy above me just owned your point and you need to learn how to fit no support for this topic
i dont really see what is so bad about the possibility of being a target in a war why should some people be immune to pvp if npc corp members could be decced individually maybe people would start trying to form real corporations of friends for mutual protection
mainly due to the fact that the entire universe isnt a war zone more specifically high seclow sec what the op wants is 00 action everywhere no rules about who you can and cant shoot or whenwhere
there would be rules the rules of a wardec the main addition is that now you can wardec individual pilots in npc corps or chose to dec an individiual pilot in a regular corp of course that pilots corp could decide to join in in which case its just a regular corp v corp dec like we have nowif youre in an npc corp and have ed off people so badly that you feel you would be permanently wardecced perhaps you should rethink how youve been treating others
for ship specific distance settings
preset distances would be useful perhaps a possibility to tie this with overview tabs as well
csmccp feedback request how to better use sound in evebut i do like the chantingthe reason you hear wind in space is because its windy otherwise you are going too fast wait five minutes and try again

hi alli was sitting in a belt mining earlier this morning when i noticed just after a recent rat spawn that my drones were being attacked by the rats but while being set to aggressive were not attacking the aggressing ratsi had to command them myself to attack the rats before they would do anythingi remember back in apocrypha ccp made some changes to the drone ai and i am assuming going back through a few older patch notes that this is the entry i was thinking of drone ai has been improved when a single drone is attacked and is part of a group set to aggressive and focus fire the rest of the drones in that group will aggress instead of sitting idlethis ie exactly the situation i was in and my drones just sat on their thumbscould someone on the csm please get ccp to look into this for me and othersto quote patch notes 117956 drones would sometimes refuse to attack certain structures theyve been given a stern talkingto and will now obey orders with more diligence please ccp give them another stern talking to on the above mentioned matterthanksjase
yes please my drones have become stupid again as well
i experienced a similar situation this morning as well darn near lost a retreiver over it
the drone ai programmer really needs a swift kick in the fork
the entire drone interface is poorlimited in choicesat the very least it would be nice for the drones to fight back when shot at
a stern talking to never mind the talking just beat them over the head
the drone ai really is more then poormaybe fitting some drone ai into the drones would help or better give the programmers some signed
even todays autonomous military units have ai programming to function without constant supervisioni remember having my drones do nothing or attacking tactically least important targets in the most intense fights where i dont have time to babysit them all the timesome choice on which targets to prioritize and whether to automatically attack hostile targets would be good perhaps a tool for players to create their own ai functions similar to dragon age origins tactics whenif enemy this and that  of left and so forthdamaged fleet members attacking broadcast targets attacking player ship engage only smaller than x size ship change target when current at x  of hullarmorshield lefte a drone manager logic if drone bay has replacement drones damaged ones could return before destruction
why should you be rewarded of doing something else while the other focuses on keeping the order at the top if you treat the market as a job instead of a hobby it will make sense to see that your orders are competitive for the purpose you intend
competative yes you can do that easily once an hour or once a day not 001 every five minutes
you dont seem to realize that the current system rewards those that play the gameyour idea is terrible and youre trying to fix an unexisting problemwhats wrong with that if youre tired of it and want to sell faster sell for cheaper and another trader most likely one that plays the 001 isk game will buy it from you and sell it
not supportedif someone likes to sit in jita all day tweaking the prices so he can sell faster then the others why the hell he shouldnt be penalized you are just angry because you cant or do not like to do thatit must be quite boring imho to do that but who knows i know players who only do trading all time and its part of eve
what he said when you look at pvp use of carriers rr is the most important ability not tanking or more fighter damage
thats ed up
fix thulium fix neodymium fix technetium i dont care how you do it just do it thulium is pretty much universally found replace technetium with thulium technetium is not universally found it is in only a few regions in the norththulium and neodymium should be worth more compared with a less rare mineral like technetium
fyi  a shield tanked myrmidon will usually be packing acs  blasters ouch not a good idea try a 17 cap recharge rate mine is 15 for a turret boat youll have few options on what you can put in there and expect to use acs are about it if you expect to have any cap for things like warpingive flown one and still fly it at times but only for mission workshield tank fits are a bit different than armor as you fit the ship up the components magnify their effects as you max the fit out it starts looking godly then you try and figure out what to pull out to make room for other functions and it starts to aim at the toilet very fast its a huge tradeoff fit in theory they can fit close to the tank of a drake but around 100 dps higher  as long as your pointblank acs get used but as you point out they dont move so well and short ranged guns arent worth a hell of a lot when your target can easily stay at range drake  missiles  myrmidon  acs  drones kill drones and the fight is mostly over  except for that tanking then its hope like hell help comes or youre there for the next weekyour description shows either a weak shield tank fit or someone did tradeoffs trying to balance it out a bit im betting the latter  fly one and youll see why my ships shields regen is a little under 400 dps well over 14000 hp shield with roughly 54 resists its a boulder  unfortunately it also flies like oneits why youll read all sorts of brags about they had to get help to knock me down but little about getting away or actually finishing fights to a win hell ive had npc battleships outrun my shield tanked myrmidon in l4 missions keeping at range drones for the win baby because you sure as hell arent woopn arse with medium acs against a target sitting out of effective range that you cant close with
bumpyes i know a minor issue so it should be an easy one to fix think fixing it is a bad idea vote against it
i respectfully disagree with the op i pay my monthly charge to play the game same as everyone else if i get frustrated or wind up on a 24 hour flight somewhere in rl and dont play thats my decision i do not feel that deserves to be penalized skills are a lot like contracts and trades you put some isk in spend a minute setting things up and it will keep right on rolling for the next 24 hours
i completly agree this is by far my bigest gripe with the eve client i would hav ethought the launch of dominion update would have been a great time to work it in they alreay cleaned up a bunch of ui things like fleet control evemail etc would it have been too much to fix the font problem while at itdo developers read these threads are we just waisting time complaining here or is there soma chance that someone that can fix this will see it and do something
sounds like a plan

hey pitbossi think this is and using either your changes or alekseyev karrdes wont change a thing except anyone with half a brain will change some lowslots on the rr ship but again your alliance isnt the shall we say brightest bulbs in pvp so not suprised you wouldnt get thatquit whining and ing about this since your alliance is just as bad as anyone else about neutral rr its so damn simple to beat honestly anyone that cant figure out how to doesnt deserve the km i use it rr and i beat people that use it all the timeinstead of whining about it beat it the rr not what you were thinking of off the top of my head i can think of 4 different ways that dont include a falconrook try thinking instead of whining

agreedhad this happen in a friends corp on christmas day of all days ir cost them 4 hulks and an orca when an incorp spy decided he wanted to give the corp christmas gifts he called itathough a small fleet was in the area shortly after to deal with the aggressor and they could have easily popped the persons ship in a single volley 2 npc corpd players in logisitcs ships appeared and started remote repping the target there was nothing they could doif it were possible to aggro the npc players for assisting hostile targets even though i know in this case it wouldnt have made a difference being the aggressor was protected by the fact they were in the corp being griefed then this sort of bull could be dealt with and the cowardly aggressor wouldnt have anyone to hide behind
mucho support this issue has gone on far too long already for something that just makes sense when you consider how practically any other remote effect pvp related module creates a no dockingjumping timerand yes i wish i wasnt such a noob that i lose in fights when our force equalled their force but then they also had neutral rr support im trying my best dammitwhile im at it the issue of not affecting repping within the corpalliance in my opinion is something which would need to be solved by allowed aggression against anyone in the alliance not just anyone in the corp this way when you do rep someone not in your alliance it can be flagged differently to the system than it is currently when for all intents and purposes they may as well be someone you have no in game association with

not supported and this sums up why
so to sum it up you want both advantages for 1 shield shield link but nor for 1 armor linkno the proposal here is not about adding advantages to shields or armor bonuses its about addressing a perceived disadvantage that shield bonuses suffer as compared to armor bonuses ive been convinced by soks arguments that this is an actual disadvantage and i believe that making bonus shield hp apply filled rather than empty is a good solutionif the 375 increase in recharge rate is not important you can shed it without problem and in exchange get the shield buff immediatelyi do not believe there is a need here to compromise shield recharge time in order to apply the shield hp as filled upon granting the bonus that is the point i was making im not saying that shield recharge is unimportantim saying the recharge rate gained from the bonus hp is not significant enough to warrant compromising the proposal with a nerfyou can chose one or the other not bothi disagree with the premise of this statement that there are only two options from which to choose there is the proposal that shield hp be added as filled as stated by the op and i agree with it
absolutely agreed passive regen is all but irrelevant in pvp fits
i support this signed
supported i would also like links in notes to stay there when copying them
regarding averages ccp could easily monitor this by average price sold rather than current orders open on the market this is somewhat subject to fraud but notably less so than the current system apologies if this is a repost
i have thought about this for over an hour my conclusion is i dont care there are long term advantages to keeping and to getting rid of insurance short term is bad in either scenario the danger like someone mentioned before lies in whether or not some pvp players will stop paying subscriptions so ccp what is it going to be are you going to risk some subscriptions in an effort to make the player driven economy rely on npc bounties and rewards or do you keep a welfare system in place both are good in long term but there will be termoil in the short term
i agree with the issue and the facts exposed by malcanis and othersas such i fully support malcanis proposal
the magic number you speak of is obtained by pegging the net insurance value of the the ship to slightly below the mineral value at the time the ship is insured thus at any given time it will always pay someone better to sell or reprocess a ship than it will to insure it just to suicide it it will never be worth building of ships just to suicide them because the net payout will be less than the cost of the minerals you used to build itif you peg the net payout at say 90 of the mineral cost the effect on player who use the ship normally will be fairly minimal without the artificial price floor the market will be able to set a true value to minerals and prices will probably fall i reckon by at least 30 this means that a tier 1 bs will probably sell for around 40m isk given that it costs about 2040m to t2 fit a bs increasing the postinsurance cost to 2444m isnt really going to make a big difference to most peoples willingness to use them even if prices stay the same were looking at 255  455m instead of 2040m
unless you are sending an entire new skin over the server it will not lag that much the only data that needs to be sent is the rbg values of two colors per ship the ammount of lag this would create would be not even remotely noticable because guess what it allready sends these values the only differnce is that youd be sending differnt values for each ship instead of the same ones even if it doesnt send these values the ammount of data would be so small i could transfer it all on a dial up connection in a minute from one machine to another if that was the only thing to be transfered besides systems with 900 people in it allready lag if you dont like the lag in such systems i got a piece of advice for you stay out of them its that simple and its also why contracts called courier exist and why there is more then one trade hub even though painting your ship has no effect to the game or you ship it makes it more graphicly appealing to the customer and alot of people expecialy kids want graphics and are willing to put up with a little lag to get it no game is going to be lag free and im suprized eve is as lag free as it is
support for 1hour or less reduction per levelhaving the time be 19 hours instead of 24 isnt going to create some huge migration of toons all the time

proposal implement t2 small tractor beams small tractor beam iithe basic idea behind this proposal is to grant a more efficient tractor beam to pull wrecks or cans since it is often used in eve one would need science iv or v to use the module it shouldnt be much trouble to implement since its all about adding t1 to t2 invention t2 bpo t2 bpc and the module itself in the database i doubt that adding new entries in the database is an issue since ccp keeps adding new ships and modules for holidays and such the market might also be affected in the first week or two until the prices eventually stabilize here is a list of proposed cons and prospro a more range right now you can pull from 20km with the t1 variant so maybe 25km would be fine or 22500mpro b faster pull speed right now its at 500ms maybe increase to 1kms or 750mcon a more capacitor usage per cycle right now it takes 5 per cycle every 5 seconds with t1 maybe increase that to 7 or 10con b requires more power grid right now its at 7 maybe increase to 10 or 13con c requires more cpu right now it takes 20 maybe increase to 23 or 25feel free to add more pros or cons or other specifics
we already have these theyre called marauders
before we bother with t2 where are the medium and large versionsall we have is a small and a capital no middle ground
yes because racial battleship v seems like a logical prereq skill to use a tractor beamop i dont know that they need to pull any faster but additional range would be niceedit thumb
supported id very much like the faster pull speed so i can actually salvage at a decent speedbut thats less important then a longer range
salvaging with tractors is easy enough already not supported
i have mixed support for thison the one hand character trading alows people new to eve to get a catch up on the learning cliff and yes i am sure there are a few bitter vets out there who believe that new players should go thru the same often toturous few months before they get to any stage of confidence but i personally believe that the ability to buy an already experienced character is something that will attract and retain new players so no this feature should not goon the flip side there does need to be stricter measures in place to counter the proliferation of hacked character sales hal
totally agreecigi
i agree and disagree with the suggestions here first off i 100 agree that character sales need to be more secure ive done two now myself and its odd for me to say this but i really did think it was almost too fast and too easy this makes it very easy for these hackers to steal toons from their rightful ownersi also agree that your reputation and persona is wrapped up in your character even though ive bought a toon before it does bug me a bit that it can be so easy to wash your hands of one character and put your self in another with no real draw backsa ill state out a few issues i see with the current proposal and arguments for the removal of character sales 1 hacking of accounts was going on long before this current rise in attacks i myself had an account hacked but luckily the only thing they did was change the training que and i received the account back after about a week or so i was lucky and had no real assets on that account stopping character sales will not stop the hacking as there isnt much ccp can do to stop someone elses computer from being violated adding to this the hacker has access to the persons computer which will allow him to check email accounts and so on in many cases2 if you look at any other mmo they all have these same problems as far as i know if people cant sell their toon in a legitimate way they will sell them via a black market which will likely be controlled by the very hackers we are dealing with todaylets not forget rmt and toon sales is a very big business when you figure these groups are doing this very thing to many other games and not just eve these guys are making millions of dollars a year doing this stuff which means they wont stop just because ccp bans character sales it will just move even further underground and pull the player base to them right now even though its not as secure as it should be at the very least ccp has control of the market on the sales id much rather them have control and work on making things more secure than just ban it and turn the entire market over to the hackers and rmtersb now ill toss in a few solutions that i think might help this proposal i do think something needs to be done for the various reasons many have posted already1 i think we shouldnt actually be able to simply sell the reputation and persona as verone has mentioned i see this as the major draw back in character sales not to mention 90 of the characters for sale have crappy names the solution to this would be that only the skill set should be sold this would mean you could still effectively sell the time you have invested but not your actual toon it would also be safer because if theft did occur the toon would be in place and only require the skill sheet to be replaceddoing a skill sheet transfer would mean each toon created would remain in the original owners hands until he decided to terminate that toon this would mean that you would keep your own history and others simply couldnt just buy another players game historythis would mean that the market could still stay alive and players that havent been in game since beta could still get access to decent skill sets if they could afford themthere are of course advantages and disadvantages to what ive suggested but even from a rp view it should be more reasonable to do than actually buying the entire toon i will add to this that as a early 09 player and noob to the game the training time is very discouraging at times i cant do anything to make my toon train faster other than skills and implants even that is really not enough when you look at how long a basic skill plan can be meanwhile i do make enough isk that i can afford to buy a older toon there are of course many like me which means the market will always be there because of this i really think ccp is doing the right thing by controlling it we just need it to be safer
one thing did cross my mind its certainly not a solution to the problem but could certainly ease the burden on ccp and the targeted original account holderim wondering how practical it would be for ccp to offer those of us who have no intention of selling our characters the option of opting in to a minimum period of non transfer maybe 3 or 6 months at a timewhile admittedly the hacked characters assets would still be at risk there would be some form of comfort in the fact that the non transferable character can not be soldim just thinking out loud really

the drake is perhaps one of the most loved and demised ships in eve in my opinion it is among the finest ships in the caldari line up it holds the distinction of being the only nonfaction ship with 7 launcher hard points it also holds the distinction of having the smallest cargo hold of any other ship intended to field heavy or heavy assault missiles as its main weaponi recall during the last alliance tournament that one drake apparently ran out of ammo the commentators even laughed i did a little research on all the missile ships in its same weapon class what i found is that the drake cargo hold is lacking not only to other bcs hulls but to cruiser hulls as wellit is also worth noting that despite popular belief heavy missiles are the largest medium charges in the game heavy missile charges have a volume of 03 m3 more than 2x the volume of medium projectile charges at 0125 m3 despite this fact even minmatar projectile ships have larger holds though their ammo takes up less m3 here are the numbers battle cruiser hullship  missile slots  cargo hold drake  7 345 nighthawk 6 700damnation 5 645hurricane 3 475cyclone 3 475claymore 3 475sleipnir 3 475note the consistency across all minmatar battle cruisers and commandslets look at smaller hullscruiser hullship missile slots cargo hold cerberus 5 650sacrilege 5 615broadsword 3 452caracal 5 450onyx 5 450stabber 2 420vagabond 2 360curse 4 345 same as drakeis tere any reason for this insane gimping i am aware of the fact that some of the above ships are often fitted with cap charges but that does not account for the obvious unbalance of these ships when compared to the drake deciding to fit a cap charger is an option drake should have no less cargo capacity than any of the above named ships it is apparent to me that it should be boosted at lease to the same level as nighthawk it does after all have more missile hard points
supporting dis
why arent you comparing the drake battlecruiser with other battlecruisers  do you have an agenda harbinger  350prophecy  350myrmidon  400brutix  400ferox  345also if you point out that all minmatar bc  cs have the same cargohold size then why are you ok with the nighthawk having far more cargohold the the other ships you listed can you please give a more complete picture of the problem edit use hams  they use less cargospace
yeah guys boost drake it sucksnot supported post above me clearly illustrates why
i love my drake i cross trained from minny to fly it its better than my cane and thats no mean statement that said drake needs no buff its cargo is plenty comparing it to command ships is stoopid it may have 7 seven launchers but that does not qualify it for a bigger hold than everyone else its a balance if a smaller hold is the downside to seven launchers ill take it every day and twice on sundaysnot supported
2 words cargohold expander
as much as i respect your oppinion normally but you should be shot for that suggestionpthough i dont see the drakes cargohold as much of a problem 11500 heavies last a while roughly 28h with cn hmlalmost 3 with t2 hml not taking reloads into account and you would be firing constantly thats plenty of ammo if you ask me
supported drake has too little cargo bay for its ammo need
dear sir you did not read my post i compared the hold of ships intended to use heavy missiles andor projectile charges because those are the highest volume charges it is common for ships that use missiles or projectiles to have larger cargo holdslaser and hybrid focused ships typically have smaller cargo holds as you pointed out in fact your list further proves my point drake cargo hold is more comparable to that of a laser or hybrid focused ship it should not be it is as it the person who designed the drake was preoccupied and simply treated it like a hybrid ship when it came time to give it cargo m3all of the minmatar bc  cs are split weapon platforms and have generally the same number of missile and turret hard points they use the second largest charge projectile as their main weapon and the largest charge heavy missile as a secondary weapon they should have the large cargo holds they have drake should have no lessnighthawk has the largest hold of all bc hulls 700 m3 precisely because it has 6 launcher hard points this is balanced around the need to fit more missiles did i mention that heavy missiles are 03 m3 therefore how is it that the drake with 7 launchers hard points only has 345 m3please revisit this match at7 day 6 hun reloaded vs the wrong alliance fast forward to about 1230 in the vid the drake runs out of ammo it almost cost his team the match listen to the commentators give color read the comments on the youtube post that should be a pretty clear picture they lambast the pilot for running out of ammo now you should see what may have caused thisso you are saying that the way to solve the issue is to fit a short ranged ammo what if the engagement calls for long ranged ammo please refrain from posting if you have nothing of value to add
from a functional point of view rather than comparative to other ships i dont think any increase is necessary the fastest base rate of fire on a launcher is 1050s on the caldari navy and dread guristas launchers suppose we take that and give it bonuses to an arbitrary number of 80s if firing nonstop that results in 75 missiles per minute and 450 missiles per hour this is per launcher so times seven means 3150 missiles per hournot accounting for reload timethe drake can hold 345m3 at 03m3 thats 11500 heavy missilesif fullyfilled the drake would have to fire nonstop for at least three hours to empty its cargo of missiles thats plenty of space
he didnt run out of ammo they assumed he ran out of ammohe actually left his overload on too long and burnt out his high slots try again unsupported
agreed
id imagine any drones have ai in them just like todays uavs to me it makes sense that they work autonomously based on the target orders given from controlling ship so the comms link to drone is open only when issuing new orders rest of the time it works autonomously for example when the controller ship is destroyed the drones stay to perform given taskdrones should stay to perform the given task even if the controller ship warps out but would stop after the current objective attack order is fulfilled target destroyed or escaped and stay put to wait for new ordersnew breed of drones would be a logical step tech 3 hello ones that have built in ai so they keep attacking anything hostile and escort anything friendly once controller link has been lost this would obviously fubar fleet fights with more server load bandwidth wise
not supported kill the drones or the drones will kill you they are are a unique weapon in that you can completely disable the offensive capability of dronefocused ships by destroying their drones just as a final volley of missiles will still do damage and a bomb will still explode after its controller pops its important to keep in mind the fight is not over until all threats are eliminated

i dont really see a problem here obviously yourre a bad miner ok lemme be nice and support this ive ninja mined with an orca and a hulk in wh space on a laptop on the bus so there i was sitting with two accs mining in wh when a bloody falcon appears lucky me i was aligned so when he uncloaked both my ship warped off to a ss and took defensive measures like cloaking  see no problemand honestly if you loose a hulk to a bomb youre doing it wrong if you pay attention theres no ship that can kill you while rattingmining theres no shame in warping away honestly if theres two cloaky in system spread out or gather up in a great pile of aligned hulks and btw theres an extremy useful command in fleet for protecting a fleet its called regroup its like warp gang but this time the gang alignes to you so when you press warp gang evryone warp out this you can control a minor army of hulks versus nasty bombers and evil arazous learn to pay attention learn to use fleet commands and yes this does force you to play the game or is that the problem that your jealous of being forced to play the game while mr cloaky goes to the cinema if thats the case you dont belong in nullsec nor lowsec ive lived in all three i never lost a rattingmining ship while miningratting i have however lost a ship on bubbles but those are not usually a problem while ratting this is my 2 cents on the matter
are you thinking about what youre sayingyour advice is to force someone to play the game because otherwise they dont belong in null sec but dont anyone dare force you to play the game you should be allowed to go to the cinema instead you guys are the true carebears of eve
the kind of failfit ratting ship that is already tanking rat dps a good nullsec bomberrecon pilot will know when to strike there is nothing harmless about a cloaker in system
its more like there is a risk to cloaking and the anticloakers refuse to see it yes a cloak ship can sit as long as it sits in a safe which means it cant see of course they have to get to that safe first and theres the risk taking a light ship through a gate that should be guarded if its your systemyou seem to think that a camped and specifically afk cloaked ship is somehow more of a threat because its something you cant see i counter that i can scout you actively with my ship and duck into a station when i see a safe chance now that im there i can afk for days just waiting to call a whole strike fleet through the gate when youre weak my capabilities are not diminished in any appreciable wayyoure in 00 unescorted miners are never safe if theres another name in local ever if you havent learned this the hard way yet youre luckyi will happily come out and deal with your camped cloakers for you in less than seven days either they will be gone or your people will know how to counter them effectively of course countering a cloak ship requires actual work and certain skills and im not sharing the details for free but will happily send ccp the details directly   as if they dont already know them if youre not willing to invest in your systems safety of course youre going to be hit by a sb fleet or just a big blob at your gate
the only point i never understood is why being cloaked makes you untraceablei understand it hides you from visual but the ship itself is still there signals would still bounce from it like from probes and other meansi suggest adding some technobabble to patch this up
hamano walker have you actually ever been in 00 you are saying we should perma camp every entrance to our space do you know any entity who does that with a large enough camp that they actually catch cloakers that try to come through because i am reasonably sure no alliance does that and what kind of defensive fleet arround your miners do you think will do anything against a stealthbomber i guess a fleet of titans would work to decloak anyone trying to come close enough to the miners but that doesnt sound to practicalluckily you and only you are able to decloak afk cloakers but of course it is a top secret sounds legit
oh i didnt say i can decloak them i said there are tactics which will keep you safe from them at least as safe as you would be from anyone coming through one of those unguarded gates now just to differentiate undetectable cloaking from idling im perfectly ok with people who are afk for x time being logged off as long as its universal cloak ships mining pilots nonpos deployable equipment etc if no one who is idle is allowed to effect gameplay thats fine picking on cloaks sounds more like an unwillingness to figure out how to deal with themill give you a hint the best defense is vigilance you should be vigilant in 00 all the time anyway
oh dear lord knucklefux why is this such an issuejust turn of the g local and stop acting paranoideve whine 524 but if there is an afk cloaker out there how can i do any afk miningits not fairplease visit your user settings to reenable images
sounds like someone wouldnt survive 5 minutes in a wormhole without going insane from paranoiayou could be surrounded by dozens of cloaked ships there and never know it until they rip your face off which by the way is an amazing featurei think instead of fixing afk cloakers they should change local in 00 space to act in the same way as it does in wormhole space what you dont knowsee cant hurt yourightfyi im a complete noob and do not have the skills to fly any ship which uses a covert ops cloak
yes the problem in all of these threads isnt the cloak  its the uber ultimate intelligence tool local
ive read this and come to the conclusion this is one gigantic trollthat or the people who believe this are complete morons pick whichever one suits you

please understand my prop 1 i dont talk about pvp only but about the general fw experience pvp pve whatever there are many other things besides pvp2 why should i quit fw if i like the idea of being part of my states army  i wanna have fun in the game i choose to play3 why the typical cynical im a ossom possom answer towards a beginning pvp player that wants the csm to think about how to make the game better by helping rookies in fw  does ccp care about new gamers and make them feel at home in a large and complex game  tutorials are not the only way to goso to be clear here are the points i ask the csm to discuss fw is elitist for the moment it excludes new players its fact that must change in a way or another period there should be a way in to fw for newbies even for day 1 players who in the csm represents the interests of beginner players  the fw is so broken not only for newbies but certainly for seasoned players too  see other forum topics that ccp should completely remake the system and think outside the box factional warfare is military conflict it should feel military no more freebooter or corporatist capsuleers which is also great but pilots within a rigid military structure with military campaigns orders crazy squad leaders etc so go shave your hair rookie and report for your marching orders at 0500 thxg

you really need to train your engineering skillscos seriously if you cant fit the above fit tech levels nonwithstanding then your doign something wrong i can and i dont even fly thoraxs
my skills are fine thank and that thorax fit proves my point  not only does he have to use the smallest possible blaster in the medium size but he is forced to lose 20 of the gun dps by dropping a gun that is bloody huge the balance is the sacrificenice try but i have done my research

we need moar powahhhjust kidding we need less powahhhwait we need a little moar powahhhholy crap ccp fails we need less powahhhwhy does this game so unbalanced tbqhoh and yeah tortuganin case you didnt catch the hidden message quit fking asking for minor adjustments
acs are fine stop whining
jebus this didnt take long we get a buff approaching parity with amarr they are still better and already come the nerf minnies whine threads not supported
yeah nerf matar
i disagree with this proposal as i think the projectile buff finally put acs on a level playing field with amarrs lasers even still lasers have an advantage of range and almost instant ammo changesblasters imo now need a bit of an update to also be brought up to par as they still suffer from horrible range that puts them at a disadvantage to both acs and pulse lasers
ummm no it dont for your delectationyou have already been shown to be wrong you say small weapons you dont say anything about medium weapons no matter what tier they may be your changing the goalposts now youve been proven wrong the above thorax fit gives you a viable pvp tackler fit thorax that fits medium weapons an mwd and a 1600mm plate it also has higher ehp 28336 rax to 27195 rup with my skills roughly equal dps ruppy slightly outguns it with sr ammo wo taking drones into accountwhich would probably tip the balance for any gallente pilot and has superior cap stability which means it can mwd for longer and as it can also move fastr mwding 1112 to 1096ms it can go farther again before needing to turn off it also has the bonus of not instapopping once its armour has dropped away due to the gallente structure tank pso no the proj guns dont need nerfing nor does the rax or im sure the other ships mentioned need boosting
electron medium blasters  highest tracking with only a minimum dps lost compared to ions or neutronsplus i couldve put a small neutron in that 5th spot to make up for some dps but whatever nos neut small blasterplus the power diag gives you added shield buffer lol cap recharge rate and total cap meaning longer mwd burn time or more neuting against your opponentwould it be nice to fit 1600 plate with 5 med neutrons and 10mn mwd yes it would be niceis it game breaking to have to resort to my fit of course not
as anyone whose ever watched a naval warfare knows formations are an integral part of warfare groups of ships gather in different ways to do things like concentrate their firepower or shield smaller ships from harm yet in eve despite all that we see in our beautiful trailers players lack the ability to get all their ships together in a lovely formation while ripping opponents to shredshow it works a new leadership skill under the working name formation management allows a squad commander to group up to 10 ships together into a formation while in formation ship control is slaved to the squad leader all ships in the gang will travel at the speed of the slowest thereby encouraging groups of similarly fit ships together each class of ship battleship cruiser frigate would have its own set of formations destroyers and battlecruisers are counted as cruisers for thisin order to prevent abuse the bonuses of a formation would be directly linked to the number of ships within it if a player breaks formation all ships would lose the bonus that the leaving vessel provided ie 3 rifters are in a skirmisher formation all recieve a 6 bonus to speed one breaks away returning to its default speed while the remaining two only have a 4 bonus to their speedsexample frigate formationsskirmisher wing v shaped wing all vessels within recieve a 2 bonus to speed per vesseldisruption wing each ship recieves a 5 bonus to web and warp disruptor range per shipexample cruiser formationsshield formation xshaped formation each ship gains a 1 bonus per ship to all resistsbarrage formation all vessels recieve a 3 bonus per ship to damage per shipexample battleship formationssniping formation semicircle shaped each ship recieves a 2 bonus to range and falloff per shipendurance formation each ship recieves a 2 boost to armor and shield repair amounts per shipplease let me know what you think thanks in advance
you know that ccp has that on the agendaif not see this around 55minutesthe proposal sounds quite nice but some details could use more work eg how do i break the formation how much more piloting would be needed for a squad memberbecause if full control for moving goes to the squad commander the bonuses might be a bit strong
i wouldnt mind a simple wall formation for defensive purposes the ships are arranged and aligned together and in return get a defensive bonus ships could still be focus fired but a  of the damage would be spread to its squadmates instead of 100 going to the focus fired shipfor each ship in formation 48 of the damage would be spread to its squadmates instead of itself this means at a squad of 10 ships the primary target would take between 2060 of the damage with the remainder randomly distributed between squad members it would add another layer of tactics to battles as it would be better to concentrate on ships within a single squad first instead of picking pilots alphabetically furthermore squad composition would become an interesting addition to fleet formation as people try to protect weaker ships with stronger squad members
darius is quite correct in saying that ccp is working on it for those who are too lazy to go watch the vid here is what they said they want to dowork as a full mechanic not just visual appeal though thats cool as wellmultiple bonuses to squadrons in formation bonii which means many bonusesnot just a random ai running thingsadds organization to tactical combatdid we mention that they are awesome
that distance would be different planet to planet depending on the mass and speed of rotation of each planet its not a universal number for every planet
game mechanics wise this is not such a good thing until the planets have a flyable atmosphere and possibly starports on groundwhat happens when someone flies to the planet similar gothru as in warp or insta explosion at some 300 meters per second atmospheric entry no
yes the convo accepting would stay with the proper buddy list also i think the bottom corner loginlogout indicator should stay for buddy list only known targets list should have a redgreen indicator but only when viewed in the corp tabyou might also be able to link in locator agents somehow into this list im not sugessting a straight right click find all my targets button but some sort of interface between the two systems would be nice
this should of been a reply not a thread lock please
just give all dessies a rof penalty tracking and damage bonus and call it quits then people can move back to whining about lasers v hybrids v projectilesoh and give the coercer an extra mid ffs
i agree that the coercer needs a boost an extra mid and more power grid will help it a long way

this is not the correct place to raise proposals they have to go into the assembly forumfeel free to post the link here but if it isnt in the assembly forum at least 7 days before the meeting it cannot be discussed at that meeting
suhport
your post has virtually everything needed to create a viable and fun black ops experience they dont need more hp and they dont need more dps what they do need is better range and better fuel economy add to that the ability to use covert cynos in highsec then theyre golden the only thing i would like to add is that they remove the scan resolution penalty from cloaks
i think allowing covert cynos into high sec will make them more useful as that will allow for a more surprise warfare in high sec space this was suggested to ccp by csm3 and ccp was favourable towards the idea
cov op cloaks one more tank slot and give sin and panther bigger drone bays is my vote
i can fly a bo when i heard they were coming i was excited then i noticed the jump range and didnt get onei have seen bos used however considering the effort and expense and the actual results they had the traditional bait then bring in the fleet method would have worked betterbecause of the sp and isk sunk into running a bo gang there are generally only a few groups who do them in any given location so after running a bo gang a few times the locals get wise and reverse the trap trapping and eventually killing the bosthey need love range would make a huge difference at the very least enough range would make it significantly harder to track down the bos that are bridging the gang in
blackopsneed more damage flexability and ew to make up for poor tanks they are deployed for hit and run in gangs and all offer heavy duty gunnary dps and some ew not quite in the same class as recons as well as command abilities redeemer 75 to large energy damage 75 to large energy tracking 10 to neut amount per levelsin 75 to large hybrid damage 75 to large hybrid tracking 10 to warp disruption per level screw drones give it 6 gunspanther 75 to large projectile damage 20 to large projectile falloff 10 to webifier range per level widow 5 to hybrid optimal 5 to hybrid damage per level 30 bonus to ecm target jammer strength all of these ships should have 6 gun slots and 2 utility slots they should also require command skills and be able to fit command modules fitting usage reduction as per command shipsnew penalty to even things up 20 to active tank repairboost not sure if this should include remote repping too probably this in addition to their poor natural tank means that deploying them means weighing up the oddsi also think the jump portal should give 100 more range but the whole fleet must jump through including the black ops if you are going to engage do it and do it together and risk it then jump out together if it lives
yeah that would only make sense if the bo could turn itself inside out and jump through the bridge it made if black ops had to titans would also have to in both cases i think the pilots of said ships would not like this idea
hi bagehi ill talk to you on vent tonight with my main i think titans should also have to use the jb when it is activated and move the whole fleet in one basicly it would open up a oversized wormhole and pull all fleet ships into it within a certain range the idea of having a ship that basicly just sits around bridging people is annoying to me in terms of physics creating wormholes basicly are turning yourself and space time inside out punching a hole in it and so going through the short way so it is no more bizarre or unrealistic then thatif you are in a fleet and are moving the fleet you should move with it this would give more consequences tactics and basicly fun and risk to using thisplus the epicness of having a titan drop on you with a fleet same goes for black ops to a lesser extentbesides i digress black ops need to be the core of any black ops group not just sitting at a pos bridging stuff a pitiful distance and rarely failing in combat when actually used at the right time
loloops wrong quote i wanted to quote the player that said id imagine this is less difficult than wormholes or something similarlarger text font option pretty pleaseyou would think this could be addressed rather easily and quicklyover a year i have repeatedly asked for the text fonts to be upgraded option for larger font size most needed these old eyes even with newly prescribed glasses cant see some of the text esp the map featuresdo you ccp see that players need more font featuresplease give us the font options and include larger text
i dont think the fix goes far enoughi think remote reppers should be treated as if they attacked everyone who has aggression to the pilot he is repping yes concord should come high sec and gcc should happen low sec one exception to this rule if the repper is at war with at least one of the pilots who is aggressed to the ship he is repping then no concord or gcc sanction should happen but in every other way it should be like the repper attacked everyone attacking the pilot receiving the reps fix the killmails to show reppers if you used two ships to kill a target its not a solo kill and shouldnt show up as one either stop using killmails or make them accurateif there are insurmountable problems with what i propose then this proposal is better than nothing
do they include a scorpion

dude whatever go spend forever hauling your ships in your freighter and let the rest of us decide on how to go about this
you basically want to have a single ship with the ship transport capacity of a 10 carriers lol
sure why not you can transport just about anything in eve in bulk but not rigged shipsi could rephrase your question into you basically want to have a single ship with the transport capacity of 20 industrials lol  enter freighterwe already have specialist ships capable of transporting large quantities of specific goods orca and rorqual both have ore bays for instan euhm guess theyre the only ones p  so why not introduce another in an area where there is definitively room for improvementsi got lucky just a few days ago i could move my junk from amarr to gallente space missioning tends to get one kos to the opposing faction trying to repair that   with just two freighter runs but only because i only have 1 bs besides the iteron viator hulk and some scanner frig
dont take this as a personal attack but i think that perfectly proves the point that there is a problem you and presumably others are able to make what amounts to free money your research accounts buy a gtc and come online twice a year or however often and dump their datacores your primaries get the benefit i dont have a problem with making enough profit to buy gtcs per se its that my research alt which i dont actually have costs me 5month monthly rate3 for 3 characters on one account since its on my primary account and yours costs you 10 a year same formula but only active for two months of the year for exactly the same benefits
since the inception of the game the longer you remain in the game the more metagaming tricks you learn the metagaming tricks are more than anything else why older players have fat passive income while newer players struggle it is also why i think newer players get frustrated by the game if players make it long enough in the game to get into corpsalliances they eventually ask how do you make so much money the answer is usually met with stunned silence or complaints about how it breaks the game whether it is 20 mining alts sucking on veld afk or pos tricks that magically create moon mins or inactive training characters to sell or inactive research and anything else they really do not help the market as a whole as only a small portion of people are actually involved in these activitieswhen income disparity comes from manipulating the game not playing it the game is broken
supported frankly i cant believe they allowed this to the one guy who argues the opposite if you made a bunch of alts that you dont want to pay for then sell them if the cost of datacores skyrockets like you claim it will then you should make good bank from them
drones in general are in need of a serious overhaul regarding their ai and general user friendliness almost all ships in new eden are dronecapable so lets give them some lovefor implementationdrone tactical interfacethis is a uiai improvement that i believe would add a degree of depth and functionality to drones the drone tactical interface dti is an overview box screenshot belowtarget priority and then a number 1 to 10 in sequence 1 being the highest priority and 10 being the lowest your drones will aggress these targets 1 2 3 and so on once a target has been destroyed the numbers refresh and 2 becomes 1 and so forth allowing a tenth target to be added and given target priority 10 ignore the target will not be attacked by drones under any circumstancepve functionality  a drone user may warp into a mission lock the spawn trigger for the next wave add it to the dti and then select ignore this npc will now not be aggressed by drones under any circumstances pvp functionality  a drone user can warp in lock a variety of targets add the interceptor going at 12kms that your drones can never possibly catch and select ignore your drones will no longer chase a target they can never hit pve mining functionality  a miner can target 10 asteroids with skill listed below at v and add them to the dti with sequential target priority the drones will mine the first asteroid then the second and so forth new skill  drone tactical interfacingintroduction of a new skill  drone tactical interfacing total sp  256000 in line with drones drone navigation and drone sharpshooting description  allows 2 more targets per level to be added to the drone tactical interfacenew drone settingsthese settings are made available via the drop down on your drone tactical interface new drone setting screen is here at the bottom of the screenshot  linkagedrone range settings  engage close range  drones will attack the closest object first and move outwards engage long range  drones will attack the furthest object first and move inwardsengage optimal first  drones engage targets around their optimal ranges first sentries does nothing for nonsentry dronesengage any  drones will not prefer any distance drone aggression settings  engage ewar vessels  drones will wipe out vessels performing ewar first ignore capsuleer vessels  drones will not under any circumstance engage player vesselsignore pirate vessels  drones will not under any circumstances engage npcs pve functionality  allows drone users to actually set what they want their drones to do also prevents the destruction of players whom are unfortunate enough for their drons to autoaggro a player attacker pvp functionality  ever been in a fleet fight and your drones go after the npcs who have spawned on a gate also  allows easy destruction of ewar vessels when coupled with the fleet functionalityedit ability to see drone damage via the drone tactical interface while in drone bay as to not overcomplicate dronebay overallimproves drones for everyone
dont forget to check the i support this box when you post edit  ignore player vessels changed to ignore capsuleer vessels not in screenshot and ignore npc vessels to ignore pirate vessels in screenshotedit  i had considered this but i feel that it is a little overpowered for just clicking a box and then wandering off hence the idea of having a limit to what ships you can assign priority to via the drone tactical interface also  i believe that the assignment of drones to a particular character via fleet mechanics exists already with assist this would just be an alteration that makes the system work admittedly it could be balanced but first we need the changes listed above to even consider implementing anything else thanks for postingsecond edit  right priority overrides the attack ewar vessels first so if you have ten ships from 1  10 and say number 7 and 4 are ewar the drones will attack down the list in sequence however if you remove all targets from the priority listings the drones will engage ewar first its essentially a preference that is entirely secondary the drones have orders to attack ewar as primaries except where the pilot has specified manually more important targets also target priority of things not in the dti is considered to be 11 otherwise the ignore order would essentially be a rating of 5 or lower drones kill 1  10 and then everything else with preset settings edit  very true however the core ideas here are both very functional and not too complicated at the least id say this is well worth being passed around ccp to see what they like and what they can implementedit again due to general rethinking the fleet mechanics side of this post has been removed however im leaving the quotes regarding it up on the basis that later reader may want to know wtf they were on about pwell drones auto attack regardless it bears logical analysis that they can be ordered to attack only certain things also there is a distinction between automated attack robots and guns one can attack on its own one needs someone to pull the trigger kinda like friend or foe missiles yup need to lock to add to dti  drone control range is the limit
i love this ideawould make missionsmining way more intresting pvp easierplexing just niceso go do iet

although i can imagine the person in fleet controlling all the drones dying and then half the fleet forgetting about their drones for the rest of the fight any upgrade to drone functionality gets support from me

awesome idea just what drones need
i too support the above idea
fully support this idea this would make drones much more fun n easier to keep a track of wth they are doing rather than have them start attacking random stuff like your ideas

eithera the regeneration takes significant time in which case the problem is realb the regeneration doesnt take much time at all in which case giving the full bonus immediately doesnt really matterbut yeah session change is the real issue here
theres absolutely no reason the shield bonus shouldnt be applied in exactly the same manner as the armor bonusthere are plenty of disadvantages to shield tanking already without this in the mix signature radius nobody wants a shield tanker no shield equivalent to the 1600mm plate
awesome idea as long as each person can select whether or not to display it if for some reason the alliance logo looks horrid on a certain hull
this works if something provides stability to the mineral price from manipulations probably something along the lines of the median price paid over the last 7 days throughout all of new eden can be computed during downtime  offline payout and premium would become static as off when the policy was subscribed so if bs prices went up 30 then net payout would become something like 66 if price went down significantly you could strip the ship blow it up and buy a replacement for a small onetime profitanother thing is that with insurance guaranteed to pay less then replacement cost daily or weekly premiums would make sense improving the affordability of insurance to new chars while being mostly irrelevant for old chars
i disagree even if pegging insurance to mineral costs were not subject to manipulation the cost of ships would likely hang around the current insurance value so now it would be not only profitable to make suicide ships it would be profitable to make speculative suicide ships and hold tham until their insurance value goes up also note that the amount by which individual minerals are below their base value does not bear out the theory that suicide ships are the problem the higher the base value of a given mineral the greater the percentage deflation in other words tritanium and pyerite are produced in quantities closer to demand than megacyte since the total value of a constructed ship remains the same because of insurance you would expect that the most expensive as a percentage of base cost minerals would be those that are produced in the least quantity the numbers show that for whatever reason the less experienced players are actually getting a better deal than the lowsec miners
recently made about 100m while watching a movie using this insurance fraud method pretty silly if you ask me but i cant really complain as it benefits me like many real world corporations insurance should be handled by the corporations or maybe on an alliance level if ccp wanted to be nice about it they could do most of the maths for us so ceos dont fly to iceland and go postal allow corpsalliances to set reimbursement levels  a percentage of risk burden the corpalliance takes for a ship this could be set negative to dissuade players from flying certain ships or to create income for the corpalliancethe cost of insurance would then be calculated by the risk of ship loss for that ship type for that player minusplus the risk taken on or added by the corpalliance  this should easily be able to be calculated when a player opens the insurance window for that ship it shouldnt take much computing for the servers especially if the average market values for ships were tabulated daily at downtimelets be honest many alliancescorps are already doing something along these lines already as insurance for t2 ships is a joke and insurance barely covers the cost of caps let alone the piles of much more expensive mods required to fly them along those lines it might be best if there was a fit check that reimbursed based on specific fittingsof course all of this would leave the npc corp players without insurance so something would need to be in place for them such as insurance with an across the board loss per shipit wouldnt be an easy or quick fix to the system but it would be a true fix
have you any idea how much isk it would take to move the whole mineral market by more than 10 trillions wouldnt be enough and youd need to move it rather more than 10 to actually make a profit and do it quite fast as well that kind of manipulation would not only require vast capital it would also be fantastically susceptible to outside interference if the dynamic insurance price is based on market sales that means you can only change the mineral basket price by actually buying or selling minerals unfilled buysell orders wont affect the insurance price even if youre just selling them back and forth to an alt the quantities involved would rack up inconceivable broker fees and people would start to notice long before youd moved the basket price 2 let alone 20

the problem is account hacking and specifically your members falling for real obvious real life scams via email or whatever your solution is to get rid of character transfers that doesnt solve the problem if someone hacks you account and uses the character for rmt and gets banned your character is just as gone and youll never get it backwhat would solve the problem is a secure method of trading characters other mmos have ityou are way off because this happened to people you know people want to do character transfers and will do so no matter what you want all the rules changed now that if affected you get real
in short i agree more security for us is better
not supported removing the legit channel will only take character sales undergroundother ways to improve the situation lock all characters from resale by default default lock 24h can be increased upto a month by the account owner longterm account intrusion needed for character resale prominently display last login time  ip on login and make personal login history easy to view making it easier for players to detect intrusions email notifications for character unlocks etc also make it possible to subscribe to a dailyweekly account activity summary making it possible to notice intrusion when you are not actively playing for an extended periorpossibly also display character sale in employment history  call it personality restructuring alternatively make it visible in api checks allows better corp security reduces metagaming issues
banning character sales is a really weird solution to account hacking because it doesnt address the actual problem and it causes a ton of other problems i dont know why you would think this is any sort of good change1 it takes away a revenue stream from ccp and puts it back in the hands of the black marketthis alone will make it not happen2 doesnt address the other consequences of account hackingempty corp personal hangars deleted characters banned accounts3 makes things overall less safe for players now that a service for which there is a demand is now in the hands of the black market character and account scams will be backi dont see any good thing coming from banning character sales or transfers some sort of protection to prevent hacked character sales would be best outright bans no

with the release of the 2 most recent patches it seems that ccp has unintentionally broke the killmail system1 apocrypha and new bays  with the apocrypha ccp added new bays to ships well in doing so they forgot to add what was dropped from these new bays if the ship is destroyed for example if you pop a orca in lowsec that was carrying hulks in its shipmaintenance bay you would have no idea that you did so furthermore any ore that he was carrying in his ore hold would not show up as well this is also true for other capital ships and there fuel bays something needs to be done so that loss values reflect true loss value 2 dominion patch  after the dominion it seems that the killmail system just went to hell i have witnessed kills that killmails were not generated for i have also witnessed pos kills that do not show everyone on the kill that was shooting at the target this is unacceptable most lowsec pvp alliancescorporations live and breathe killmails in most organizations it is considered taboo to tamper with killmails at all thus cheating people out of hard earned killsccp needs to address this issue in the next patch if a total rework of the system has to take place so be it however to continue on with the status quo is unacceptable to the majority of lowsec alliancescorporations that live for killmails

id like to see my learning skill in effect without using eve moncare to add the decimals to attributes so my perception shows as 2592 instead of 25or at least make the number rounded
wutcyclone53 layout hurricane 63 layout sliepnir 73 layour clay 53 layout all in favour of proj your generalisation is perhaps the most wrong generalisation ive come across this month none of the minmatar bc are designed with split weaponry as the intended dps loadout or they would like the phoon have split bonuses they dont they simply have utilityhighslots that can be filled by missiles as a supplement to their primary damage but which in real terms are rarely used as such as the missiles slots are of minimal use in most circumstances and completely unused on the cs
you are aware that the drake can hold over 3000 missiles right
i was unaware of this information possum thanks for posting it it does not change my view that the drake needs a look but we can agree to disagree
could you tell us why you need more than 3hours constant firing worth of missiles in your ship
vheri kaior you should reread my post i did not make a generalization that the minmatar ships listed are split weapon in the way a phoon is you read that implication into my text on your own talk about seeing what you want to seei did however compare drake to1other missile ships in the battle cruiser and cruiser hulls this to show that despite having the most missile hard points in the medium weapon range it has less cargo hold than all others except the curse2 minmatar battle cruiser and cruiser hulls why pay attention this time because they use projectiles which are commonly although erroneously considered the largest charges i wanted to show that because projectiles take up less m3 than missiles almost every dedicated missile ship in the same hull class has a larger cargo hold than a projectile ship in the same class except the drake it just so happens those minmatar ships also have missile hard points no where in my post do i state that they are meant to be a split weapon platformi hope that clears it up for you
only if you bring one type of missiles with you  which is prety lame in most situations i usually bring 5types of missiles with me then running out of one type during ops is more than possibleoh wait missiles werent desingned to be able to choose dmg types 
patri you are replying to many people pointbypoint who are making senseless arguments against your proposal but you are failing to respond to those who are telling you why the drake doesnt need more cargo space please read all the replies if you havent already
well you can still choose the dmg type for quite some time before running out and even if you have to use a less optimal dmg type it isnt like you are not contributing to kills anymore
i think you missed the point of my post you said generally the same number of missile and turret hard points this is a generalisation as is any statement beginning with the word generally regarding the nature of minmatar highslot configuration it is an incorrect one i am genuinly not fussed about whether the drake needs more cargo space ive not used one enough to carewhat im fussed about is inconsistency and bad logic you want ccp to increase the size of the drakes cargo hold you need to give them good and logically consistent reasons that maintain its balance with other battlecruisers
assuming you divide your space evenly among missile types if you bring six types and fill your cargo with just missiles then youre bringing approximately 1900 missiles of each type 11500  6  191667 rounded downfor this calculation again im going to assume the use of the best faction launchers with a base rate of fire of 1050s then add bonuses to an arbitrary rate of 80s note im going to round numbers down to account for fractions of missilesto go through 1900 missiles of one type using seven launchers you would use 1900  7  270 per launcher for 80s that takes 270 x 80s  2160 seconds divide by 60s and youve got exactly 36 minutes this gives us a minimum of 36 minutes for every missile type brought along for the operationnot accounting for reloading timeto run out of that missile type in my opinion thats reasonable because you still have three hours worth of missiles left even if they arent optimized for the targeti think part of the challenge of being a missile pilot is the decision on what damage type you bring and i think the drakes cargohold gives plenty of space for this
this its like comparing the ravens cargo to the paladins cargo
i want to have the same option as most other ships to run a cap booster on a drake now of course this will draw every possible flame to the topic but it should not because of the limited cargo in relation to the charge size cap booster charges are not a viable optionwhy do you want cap boosters on a drake will be the question it requires no answer it is a sand box right i should have the option but it is not available because heavy missiles and cap charges do not mix well in a 345 m3 hold but let me try any wayi put together a build on sisi to try and test the viability of fitting a drake similar to the rocket wizard nighthawk made famous by fon revedhort you know what it works well kinda you see i can not fit enough cap charges to make it viable even with a cani think i should be allowed to explore nonconventional fits on this ship the moronic question has been asked why do you need more than three hours worth of missiles can we therefore determine that any ship with the ability to fit 3 hours worth of charges should have its cargo hold reduced cargo hold size provides options for different fittings ships with large charges should have larger bays or their options are limited unfairly imagine the sacrilege trying to run the common dual armor rep set up with a 345 m3 cargo hold it has 615 m3 and it is meant as a ham platform smaller chargesheavy missiles are big missile ships have bigger cargo holds than any ship in their class except the drake
go away please
so missile ships should only fill the hold with missiles what if i do not only ant to have missiles in my hold nighthawk raven typhoon sacrilege builds are viable with cap chargers just like practically every other ship why because they have a hold that takes into account the size of their charges why should the drake not have this optiondrake has more limits on setups and choices for pvp than any other ship because of its limited hold it has plenty of space only if you limit it to carrying only missiles sandbox
so you want a cap boosting drake ok fit it the hell out take less missiles maybe 1000 into the fight the rest of your hold going to 800s at 64m3 as memory serves you should be able to fit 3 or 4 in the thing i personally have never been in a fight long enough that needing more than 3 or 4 charges happens we either win run or die before that point capacitor stability is irrelevant for any pvp fit not a capital ship unseiged and untriaged and i doubt you would be able to fit a drake in such away that you need more than 1 charge in any 5 minute periodand citing battleships and amarr ships when your making an argument for a caldari battlecruiser is dumb cos battleships will always have more cargo then bc and ammarr will almost never need what cargo space they have for anything but cap boosters i mean seriously laser crystals of any size take up what 1m3 pu at most
sticking to t1 ships heres what ive foundraven 665m3apocalypse 675m3megathron 675m3tempest 600m3the other ships in the ravens class are within 10 of its capacity it oddly enough as the missile ship has slightly less cargo space than the apoc and megacaracal 450m3maller 280m3vexor 480m3stabber 420m3the oddball here is the maller the vexor and stabber are both within 7 of the caracals capacity 30m3 with it falling in the middlekestrel 305m3inquisitor 315m3incursus 165m3breacher 175m3the kestrel inquisitor and breacher all have bonuses and hardpoints favoring missiles and they do have the most capacity of the four the idea applies in some order here but the breacher for some reason has 40 less space than the kestrelthe evidence here i submit does not support the supposition that missile ships as a rule have greater capacity relative to the ships in their class at the frigate level i think theres enough to warrant a correlation but not a generalization
i have made the case for the considerations which seem to go into determining proper m3 of cargo holds you have refuted none of them the fact that you only fly with a gank crew where 1000 rounds and 34 cap boosters is enough is great for your play style obviously you do not kite with a burning mwd but tell me what other bc is limited to 1000 rounds and 34 cap charges when fitting cap boosters so you are saying cap boosters should only be fit on cap ships i cited missile ships you tool to show that all of them bc hull and bs hull have bigger holds then any other ship in their own class except the drake i cited no amarr ships i did compare some khanid ships which use missiles so wth are you on about crystals missile ships tend to have a larger hold than most non missile ships a class above them the exception being projectile shipsfrig kestrel 305 m3  cruiser cruiser moa  250 m3 cruiser caracal  450  bc ferox  345 and all other bcsbc hull damnation  645  all battleships except raven  665bc hull nighthawk  700  all battleships i use nighthawk and damnation because there is no other missile battle cruiser to compare the drake to and because those ships have sensible holds compared to their missile hard points imo this is where the drake hold should be
i wanted to show that the drakes cargo space can hold enough missiles to support it firing for well over three hours how the pilot uses that capability is of course up to the pilot sometimes i add exotic dancers to my cargo just because i have enough missiles for whatever im doing and i have plenty of leftover spacei submit that the drake does actually have this option if you take 5000 missiles then youre using 500003m3 150m3 of space for missiles thats enough firepower for at least an hour and leaves you 195m3 for other contraband six cap booster 800s is 192m3again i disagree that the drake has plenty of space only if you limit it to carrying only missiles im not sure where this arbitrary idea came from apologies if it was inferred from any of my previous poststhe drake has enough space to give the pilot the option to take enough ammo to fire for up to three or more hours at a very considerable rate of fire the pilot can then designate that cargo space as he sees fit with what i believe is plenty of room for creative use of the ship

in features and ideas  jump clone changesbasically make jump clones only work if you are in the same station as them andor if you within range of a rorqual with a jump clone you could even decrease the 24 hour grace period to hours instead of a day you could then get jump clones into wormhole space with rorquals and the clone bays they can have you should be able to destroy any jump clones you have and enemies who capture an outpost should be able to destroy any jump clones inside
supported eve is too small already guess they never have flown a freighter p  is the most heard argument against shortening the time between jumps in fact i think its about the only one as defending your home territory becomes too easy amounts to the same thing and considerably shortening the period between jumps within the same constellation or even station will cater to both sides eve wont get smaller and you can pvp with your empty pod and then go back to normal on your 4s or mine ice first and then ore or whatever reason you might have to swap implantsit shouldnt be instant but the 24hcreep is just annoying oh today ive jumped to pod x when i start playing tomorrow i cant jump yet so the day after tomorrow i can jump again for the working class a 24h cooldown might just as well be replaced with an 36 or 40h one we wouldnt notice the difference
ah i see the cloaked trolls have found another thread to plug their i want an iwinbutton and be even more invisible remove local junkboohoo my fragile ship will blow up if the gate i go through is camped tears wont help you as just about every ship will blow up if the gate is properly camped and after that youre home free to pick your riskfree targets warp off unseen if there happens to be more support than you initially thought and generally disrupt the systemwhy so vehemently against cloaks ive seen cloakers misguidedly thinking they are no worse than ships that are not cloaked well youre wrong uncloaked ships can be scanned down and removed from the system you cant do that to cloaked ships as for the one making a lemming of the op with cloaks replaced by logging out are you really that dense logged of you dont have intel you are no threat you cant shoot anyting and indeed ill grant you that you dont risk anything you can log on and hope in the meantime some ratter appeared in the belt you logged off in but thats about it

you donUFFFDt have to use gates even after you get one guy with covert cyno in system beautiful isnUFFFDt it
the problem is not cloaking the problem is having a local to begin with remove local from 00 and then people will not cry about people being in their system this is one of the first games i have seen that claims to be a pvp game that also warns you when people are around for freetake cloaks away from ratting battleships that cloak up as soon as someone comes into local if you really want to change cloaks
are you really that dense afk cloaked you dont have intel you are no threat you cant shoot anyting and indeed ill grant you that you dont risk anything you can come back to your keyboard and hope in the meantime some ratter appeared in the belt you cloaked afk in but thats about it
absolutely agree with thisexcept that i think it would work to remove it from lowsec as well the problem is that we automatically know someone is there when we should have to do something to discover them i believe local is the root of this not cloak functionality
first i lived in whs for a while and had no problem with detecting cloakers cause they had to use probes to find the sites i was mining at so i could detect their probes before they found me however in 00 the belts are clearly able to be warped to at will by covert ops and they dont need to use probes to find you even the grav sites in 00 arent really that secure because once a red has the bm he can find you at will just like a belt but in whs the enemy tends to never stay more than a day cause they dont want to lose their precious link to their home system so tomorrow ill probably be completely safe again whs dont have a local like 00 because its unexplored territory and its link to familiar territory is constantly changing 00 is explored territory and its link to familiar territory is constant those are the differences that make them unique and a different gameplay if you dont like local in 00 then move to wh space where it is like that i will never understand the complaints of those who hate local so much but refuse to go live in wh space where local is perfect for themsecond i too am a cloaker and i know that most gatecamps ive flown through in my covert ops had no chance of finding me unless they were very experienced or just got lucky however as a miner and ratter i hate it when some cloaker just afks in system and there is nothing you can do about it truly imo this needs to be changed having a cloaker lock up a system is very frustrating when he can be there for hours and not even at home to play the game if not implementing a fuel for cloaking devices then simply implement a timer where if your character does nothing at all ie type move around use eve voice anything then he is auto logged out of the game that by the way would also lessen the lag on the servers from players afking all over the universe tbh if you arent at your computer for 30minutes then you really have no business taking up server bandwidth anyhow
nice lemming too bad you didnt quote i almost missed ityoure only leaving a tiny bitsy little problem out of it how do you know the cloaker is afk there is no way an offline account can gather intel or approach a prey or make descisions when it would be best to log in and when he would get a free kill by decloa euhm logging inunlike cloakers though there is no way to tell if they are afk or not they could very well be only 15km away ready to blast you to smithereens or they could be miles away from their computer cloaked on some safespotthats why a system shuts down when there is a cloaker or actually just any red but unlike normal decent pvpers you cannot hunt down the cloaker in system
this thank god there are people that see the big picture rather than the narrowminded in 00 u should be ready for an attack 247 but i dont have to be bllshtcloaking in 00 is in essence clicking your pvp flag off while making everybody else be vigilant and prepared even if the cloaker may be having ice cream with his buddies at the local store 
several modules in eve are fairly useless im going to list two that i would like to be changed if people agree please vote yes 1 or yes 2 and i will try to keep this post updated if you want to add a module to the list with a suggested fix please do so1 shield flux coil  suggested change1 dramatically increase shield recharge rate  slightly increase shield capacity drawback2 reduce capacitor need of shield boosters and reduce recharge rate of shield2 capacitor flux coil  suggested change dramatically increase capacitor recharge rate  slightly increase capacitor capacity drawback3 capacitor batteries  suggested change increase of capacitor capacity bonus introduction of cap recharge rate drawback
shield flux coils sfc seem to be a redundent module their drawbacks completly ruin their bonus a shield power relay is a far better option trading cap recharge rate for a passive shield recharge rate is far far more appealing than than removing a fair ammount of shield bufferi suggest that the sfc be given a very large boost to shield recharge rate but also a larger drawback to shield capacity this would give people the option of do i fit very high recharge rate with very little buffer weak vs high alpha damage or do i fit moderate recharge rate with good bufferi just feel the sfc is totally outclassed by the spr and a change in how they work would giving some diversity to the passive fits out theresfc i fitting and parameterscpu 20shield recharge time 25shield15spr i fitting and parameterscpu 20shield recharge time20cap recharge time35sfc i suggested changecpu 20shield recharge time40shield20
capacitor flux coils cfc which are harder to fit than capacitor power relays cprgive a much smaller overall bonus to cap recharge rate losing some of your cap capacity with an underpowered bonus to cap recharge rates makes this module obseletei would like to see the cfc recharge rate bonus increased significantly with a small increase to cap capacity drawback this will give the pilot an option to fit for very high capacitor recharge rate but very low capacitor reserve so you would be very vulnerable to heavy energy neuting but can pulse certain high cap usage modules relying on you very high cap recharge rate to recover sufficiant cap in a very short time
capacitor batteries which are harder to fit than cap boosters i believe are underpowered i would like to see a change in the way they operate i would like to see them given a larger boost to cap capacity but also a balanced drawback which removes any recharge rate bonus from having a larger capacitorthis would create a module that gives a pilot the option to have a very large capacitor but a normal recharge rate
i think what is needed for the capacitor batteries is to change from static values to precentages the smaller ones have higher precentages but a significantly higher drawback tha way if you fit it on a friggate dealing with generally lower numbers the drawback isnt noticable but if you fit it onto say a battleship the drawback becomes overwhelming that way the benifits change based more on your skills than just clunking down an extra chunk of cap
these are useless items i agreemore capacity buffer means more effective recharge naturally over time so this counters the point of the changes you suggestyou need to be a bit more inventive i think 1 shield flux coil  reduces the cap use of local shield boosters reduces passive shield regen2 capacitor flux coil  more cap recharge reduces ships power grid higher fitting cost3 capacitor batteries  increase capacitor capacity reduce effectiveness of capacitor neutralization
capacitor flux coils are fine i think the fact that they are harder to fit and have drawbacks is balanced against the fact that active shield tankers can make use of them without nerfing their boost amount unlike a cpr cfcs also give a better effective recharge increase than pdu iiscapacitor batteries need to be looked at however

you tards are using reactor controls and power diagnostics systems on a thoraxprojectiles use no cap to fire hit almost the hardest now and take the least amount of power it is clear as fing crystal that they are now the flavor of the month and overpowered and now im finding out they can discriminate using specialized damage types in close rangeso theyre missiles that hit instantly using no cap and ignoring signature with magnificent tracking and almost no power usage sounds perfect
cool story bro i cannot remember the last time i saw a pvp fit ship of any sort that didnt need to fit an rcu or the like to get everything on it without gimping the fit in some way and something you seem to be forgetting is that projectiles that is to say the group you are generalising as the new fotm are not the best and that what your whining about is more to do with the problems surrounding blasters than it is autocannons merely one amongst two kinds of projectiles being op as i said before the thorax fit above almost equals the most comparable ruppy fit in dps and has superior speed tank cap stability and turning capability not even including the gallente secondary weapons system with an rcu that thorax fit can add a final gun and it becomes superior to the ruppy fit in every way

i havent found any disscusions on this and if there were i apoligize now for bringing it up againdominion has introduced 3 new items into the game world into making systems better claiming systems and taking over systems sovereignty blockade unitterritorial claim unitinfrastructure huband has had player owned stations for as long as i can remember i have been sold on the idea and i have sold other people onto the idea that eve has a player driven economy and just about everything in the game that is meaningful is bulit and sold by players however they are sold by npcs at a set pricewhy were bpos not introducedwhy also are they not avaliable for poss i can build an egg for a space station from a bpo but i cant for poss or sbus tcus and ihs i dont see the reason for this is it to make sure smaller alliancescorps can not build them to cause havoc to the larger alliances this imho puts the smaller corpsalliances at a disadvantage when they want to branch out into 00 alliances in 00 have access to higher dividend items  oreratsplexsetc so the price fixing does not faze them as much as the smaller ones you take away from the industrialist feeding the war machine and making a profit from it and also from them saving and building items without paying for them let eve be a truly free economy and let us build and sell what is in the game if this cant be done then please explain as to why not in my short field of vision i can not understand without explanation why this is not feasible
wait you think having bpobpcs for the sov structures will benefit small alliances more than large alliances review your logic herebig alliances have more isk big alliances have more mining capabilityso they have more ability to buy bpos and be the ones who sell the sov structures and they probably would jack the prices as it is in their best interest that no one outside their alliance has themsmall alliances have less isk they have less mining capabilityso they are less likely to drop billions for a bpo to build something like that instead relying on the available structures seeded by the big alliances at jacked prices no no if you want smaller alliances to have a shot the existing npc driven method is better
i tend to disagree here just because someone has more mining capabilities andor isk is that a reason to deny having a player driven economy i in my carebearish land can buy a carrier bpo and build the ship which btw cost way more than any pos tcu ih or sbus and mine the ore with a smaller outfit than any alliance and compete in price with the big boysthey large corpsalliances can purchase and build these massive ships and are not npc price set so what makes these items any different let the players build and compete for the business or please make a better arguement as to why not
two wordsgame balance
please could you be more clear how does it affect game balance in a negative way i am assuming its negative because you did not say you agree with me how can anyone buy a bpo for a carrier or titan which costs far exceed that of the items discussed up above yet these items you can not they are npcccp price controlled and almost all other game modualsships are not please define how it ruins the game balance
support
doubt it caps require a dozen bpos each around 1b plus months of efficiency research to build at market prices based on this the structure bpos would either be billions each or require subassembly bpos like caps totaling billions a small alliance would probably be aiming to control and develop one system 2b in structures they would have no need to manufacture more than 1 claim and 1 infrastructure unitadditionally requiring these to be built would have led to a huge run on the mineral market as well as a much longer limbo period for the new sov system to be fully implemented at this point demand has significantly slackened for these structures and will probably remain fairly low the most important thing however is that manufacturingbuying these would be a huge flashing red light that would serve as weeks of warning that an alliance was gearing up for war
very good point and arguement however now that sov is fully implemented there should be no reason not to as for my example of carriers and titans it is just to show that we build it not npcs we dictate what we think its worth and how much we are willing to sellbuy it for although i do buildsell my own carriers as far as the warning goes to others that war is coming i believe that is a bad excuse and here is why every ship sold can be said that it is going to be used of war i doubt people buy dreads and carriers to rat and if the buying individual wanted to keep his identidy secret he just needs to buy the item with an alt and if he didnt and bought with his main nowhere does it state who or when hes attakingthe point here is just letting the players of the industry trade or anyone else get in on this action even though they dont live in 00 let the free economy thrive
i agree here with the op and even though the demand has dropped if they could be sold for less or the alliances themselves makes the items then that could lead towards more aggression which in turn makes the industry workers more isk another income source if you willsupported
supporti remember when you could buy shuttles prebuilt via npcs they took that away because of the cap it put on trit and it let players then really decide what trit should be boughtsold for i agree that players should be able to build and sell these itemsalso on that note let us remember ccp can still somewhat control push towards what they should sell for as they decide what minerals or components are needed to build the items
hellothe strategic cruiser is a wonderful ship in terms of customization you can make a lot of combinations to fill different roles you feel nessecary one problem i see is that each time you want to do something different you need to throw away your rigs and replace them with new unless you can afford owning multiplewhen you can refit subsystems anytime you please why not create a subsystem for rigs that will hold a unique set that you can swap along with the other subsystems the subsystem itself could cost a lot to make for all i care i just think it is a flaw that can be corrected with the otherwise wonderful ship class
dont kill the rigs make war not new rigsread ftw apparently this is not an issue
knowledgebase on tech 3
i dont think the op made himself clear but im sure i understand what he wantssince i dont use t3s im going to generalizehe has t3 ship with subsystems set up for pvp his hull has 3 trimarks on ithe then decides he wants to switch subsystems around so his ship can be used for mining unfortunately his ship is stuck with trimarks and he would have to destroy them to use cargo optswhat hes asking for is a subsystem slot especially for rigs so the rigs can be switched out with the appropriate subsystem settingsunfortunately thats a crappy idea and i dont support it everyone has to deal with this if i want my domi to be a fleet rr bs one day neut domi the next and a lvl 4 runner the third i have to decide what rigs to permanently keep on my ship or i can destroy and rerig everytime i switch occupations or i can just buy and rig 3 domisthere is nothing except price stopping you from purchasing more than one t3 hull and rigging each as you see fit at least you only need one of each type of subsystem and can play legos all you like
no there is a corp which specializes in the removal of offline poss hire them or join themconcord preservation and recovery cprthere is an ingame solution we do not need to add anothermike
i like the concept but id prefer at least seven days to be fair to the ownersi come across abandoned poss all the time while exploring wormholes i cant do anything to or with them i cant destroy them because even in offline status without any fuel left theyre still hella difficult to killthe vast majority of the time whenever i contact the owner theyre too lazy to go pick it up theyd prefer to write it off as a 100 loss instead of paying a small locators feeposs that run out of fuel should auto unanchor in seven days
this here is a mindnumbingly awful concept so i log in join fleet and then i can go afk for 8 hours while my squad leader flies my ship around for me in a pretty formationahahahahahahaha no hilariously abusable absurd nonsensehow does a player break formation exactly when the squad leader is doing the flying for them this does nothing to prevent abuse because the whole concept is an abuse we already have leadership bonuses and ganglinks doing these things passed down through the fleet we already have the ability to set different bonuses for different squadswings and segregate shiptypes accordingly we dont need another layer of it tagged on randomly and we certainly dont need it to be enabled through what is effectively a sanctioned accountsharing scheme that youre proposing you dont see the harm here ok imagine goonswarm fielding 3000ship fleets 237 because we all logged in handed our ships over to formation control of whichever squad leaders happened to be online at the time and then went off to workclasssleep while a few active players multiboxed us to glorious victorynoand now a more general point the whole concept of formations even in its generally used sense where the fc can use it to position his fleet elements in predefined gridpoints still seems to be a buzzword a solution in search of a problemmanouevering ships into the correct positions using multiple covops warpins prepared bookmarks clear orders etc is one of the most important abilities an fc requires it creates opportunities for fleet members and commanders to make errors and fleet command in eve is often about taking advantage when your opponent makes errors for example oh wow those idiots they just gangwarped all their snipers into the gatebubble everyone jump go go go go gogiving the fc the hand of god where he presses a button and everyone in his fleet warps to exactly where he wants them to doesnt do anything to make eve a better game instead it removes a layer of opportunism and human error from the process and takes players another step towards becoming mere passengers
unless the squad leader only controls movement and the pilots still have to do the shooting heh
if we wanted a game where all we did was shoot and somebody else moved us around the battlefield wed get out our lightguns and play time crisis
hellosome of you playing recently when the servers suddenly crashed would have been browsing around to figure out what was going on like myself i went to this website first but it was also down it seemed and to be honest i was out of immediate options i hear eve radio is good place to go in these cases but alas its not official informationi actually did go to twitter since im a follower of ccpgames and other game development companies fyibut there was never a single mention about the dt what happened wether ccp was aware of it or even working on it nothingand i got to say by todays standards  considering other game companies ability to inform via twitter  this is hard to accept why didnt ccp announce something to inform us eegerly  some frantically   awaiting players i think ccp should start considering ways to communicate to us what happens and when servers will be back etc when things like what happened yesterday happens ie server  official website down twitter would be a good place to start its a very good way to get in touch quickly and effectively with your clientelle regarding any issue really it will also help portray a more serious side of ccp because most of whats currently being posted there is immature to be honest but thats for a different topicccp my request is for you to improve on your communications toward us and my suggestion is to use twitter for thiskind regardswesf
imho  make the main website more stable and use that for informing about outages using a 3rd party site should be the last possible option
ok wormholes and more rare ore wooptie do go ahead and raise prices of hulks to capatilize on corperations going out on expiditions into uncharted space it has been about a month since dominion came out and the prices have stayed at around 200 mil nearly double what the ship costs to manufacture you have already cashed in on the boom now can you please return the damn prices to normal so the low sec miners dont go ing broke mining has never been as profitable as missioning and cashing in on corperations is fine but enough gouging the solos already and people always wonder why there arent more mining chars sheesh
delicious tears in dominion the build requirements have been changed for hulks this has lead directly to a hefty increase in the cost of building hulks see many many threads discussing the issue in market discussionswhinging about it wont lower prices so htfualso this thread doesnt belong in assembly hall gtfo 
you obviously were not around for the 500 mil preinvention hulk prices180200 mil prices are cheap so your whine is baselessand this thread belongs in science and industry
if hulks are too pricey use a covetoredit and what the hell does this have to do with the csm shouldnt it go in market discussion or something
get used to it 200m is normal now and producers arent making any more money from them than they were when hulks were 100m each say thank you to the new build requirements and the technetium bottleneck pushing nanotransistors to about 4 times their predominion price
looked around couldnt find anything so here goesfor a multitude of obvious reasons i dont really want to list dockinggames is one of the most ridiculous and hilariously lame things that go in lowsecempire warsmy suggestion is simple and easy and shamelessly stolen from somewhere elsemake the nodocking allowed timer from engaging in pvp last for 10 minutes if youre ongrid with a station when you fight only for the station youre ongrid with imo it makes sense as far as game mechanics go as well as fluffwise and might even take some of the smack out of the dockingrange heroes basically if you dont want to risk your ship you shouldnt be fighting in iteditdoh of course i found another proposal regarding dockinggames 30 seconds after i posted this 
i completely agree to a freezing of the fw map reset where sovereignty equals occupancy either by ccp or by the players if we wanted to hold a pilots boycott on plexing to make a point i would be in favour of negotiating this on the minmataramarr front
i would like to see all ships scaled down a touch and then rebalance their size relative to each other i think some of the larger ships are too small compared to bs so i would be perfectly happy if they just made everything smaller and made the big ships look biggeralso ccp please fix the bm locations for some stations a lot of minmatar stations have you warping to the lower superstructure of the station yet the docking bays are at the top wtf
so for those of you discussing the warp through planet theory and the slow down trajectory change etc if youre going to get technical about it a warp drive warps space around a warp bubble the ship itself doesnt move at all while the space around it moves at faster than light speed explained here
i agree the art dept needs to take a serious look at scale not only planetsmoons but even between ships as has been mentioned before the ship size chart is definitely not reflected ingame
i see people posting ideas to reform insurance as a bandaid for the current market situation everything is so cheap due to cheap minerals that there is practically no loss after insurance payout changing the insurance policy would be complicated and would only be a temporary fix until the market swung around later due to other game fluctuationsi propose keeping the current insurance values they are there for a good reasonthe fix for the market should come via inflation in the amount of minerals to build a ship it is quite simple really lets say as pod pilots grow in number the complexity of their ships increase meaning more minerals are needed for their hullsby increasing the amount of minerals needed across the board for all ships by 5103050 or whatever the devs feel appropriate the cost of ships will go back to normal they can always reduce this inflation as the market gets unbalanced depending on carebear to pvp activity it is simple because it is percentage based inflation affecting all ships and is long term because it can be adjusted back and forth just as easily it would also preserve insurance on ships to make t1 ships affordable for those who do not have 10 hours a day to play and make isk in a not so insanely deflated economymarket control through mineral requirements for ships that is my idea
i think this is one of those ideas that seems good at first i can see plenty of issues though all of them accept as a given that self destructing ships for insurance is a rampant market moving practice i dont accept that myself but it seems to be what leads to this sort of post1 if mineral use moves on a sliding scale you have a new variable beyond insurance large operators can increase production to drive up the cost of each individual ship not just for themselves but everyone else this raises the insurance payout then they pop their less expensive ships for the payout of the now more expensive same ship made today2 speculation on ships will increase people will buy when theyre low production value and sell when they get high what youd have is spurts of building and selling this wont change market swings it will make them wilder this will go out to the mineral market as well as the demand for minerals will be based on whether ships are in a build cycle or a sell cycle3 the potential exists to build a ship wait for the mineral requirements to go up and reprocess it for more minerals than you started withright now there is a single major market control insurance payouts every ship ive seen at market is within about 1 of its payout anyone who goes too much above this will find themselves undercut the value of ships is actually stable in fact if more people built them for insurance fraud the demand for minerals would go upif you look at the mineral costs to build a t1 ship compared to the base values used to determine insurance youll see that the higher end minerals are vastly more expensive than their base value its the low ones like tritanium and pyerite that are the problem there is so much supply that even with the massive amounts needed the price has dropped to half or less of the base value the best way to raise it would be to decrease supply and increase supply of higher end minerals in other words more miners need to start spending an hour or two a day in lowsec instead of 10 or more macro mining in highsec
totally for the win
im all for it

there are probably rules about linking off site but his points are valid
nope no scorps needed either
hells yes supported
supported what gets me is that privateer alliance are the ones asking for this yet there the ones i see use this the most
spas i see the point you made and would be open to the idea that if you are repping someone in your corp or alliance the rules should be different i mean from a scouting perspective the enemy could see you had those reppers before engaging however i still think repping someone who is engaged in combat should be counted as aggression maybe there could be a rule that would say that repping someone that is not aggressing other than by repping would not trigger a new agression countdown in other words make it so reppers are in the fight at least as much as the guy they are repping but not necessarily more than that there are various ways they could work that out but im not sure its necessary or good im just saying there are other optionsheres an example of how it might work you and your corpmates are in a rr bs gang on a gate some sniping bses come and hit one of your gang as long as he doesnt attack them you guys would all be able to rep him and still jump through the gate but if he starts firing back and then you all rep him you are all then agressed your situation could have various rules that apply i would suggest that repping itself does not trigger a new aggression countdown unless the person you repped still had an aggression countdown based on the current agro rules so if you rep someone who has 2 seconds left on their aggro pursuant to the current rules you would earn yourself a whole new timer but when you rep that person in your next cycle say 10 seconds later that rep would not add to your timer at all if someone repped you and you were only repping then they would inherit the same countdown you have  no more no less the current mechanic is so bad anything would be an improvement however i think if they are going to fix this they should just get it right
well since i see lots of support for the idea that 20 is too many ill add a note of possibly being only 10we just figure 20 was the max u can fit b4 it gets so big that u can fit a niddy in there lol

sounds pretty well thought out i doubt the mining section will be implemented however as that might help afk miners and i dont think they want to do that the combat section sounds great though 
this really needs to happen

out of many ideas i have come across in this game none of them have ever gotten my supportthis has
very good idea well documented proposal
supported as long as it has a gui the right click menu is to cluttered as it is
i like it
i think this would add some very useful functionality
not supported for the reasons already citedwhat i think should be looked at is the fact that after jumping with the fleet you will have lost the bonus then reapplied so there is shield missing this could be solved by adding a grace timer to bridge the jumping period 10 seconds or sothis is lame armor tanking has its own problems and there are shield mods without armor equivalents as well
fully supported  lets remove instant armor hp gain they can still rep them back to the bonused maximum
gang shield tanks need a looking atfurther issues are the stupid reqs for shield transfer arrays shield transfer arrays should boost more than there armor equivs to make up for lower base resists in the same fashion that solo shield boosters can boost more hp than armor equivscurrently 90 of rr gangs using armor shows us that shield rr is brokenwhen gang bonuses are applied the shield charged  should remain the same imoso 100 shield before is 100 after gang bonuses applied90 shield before is 90 after gang bonuses applied etc
awesome so youre arguing in this thread but you dont understand what ehp is hint its not the same as raw hp
ehp  raw hp1average resists since this thread isnt about bonuses that affect resists what on earth are you driving at
supportin dis
regen and repair rate is also ehp as they are also hp that the incoming dps has to defeat
i agree and yet notregen and repair rate are better compared to dps essentially ehp is a more informative number when considering an alpha strike or enough firepower which will easily overcome regeneration ratesie youve been called primary so your regen doesnt matterits your ehp that sits between you and a lost ship attackers have to deal approximately the ehp damage in order to rapidly kill a target however in a fight where thats not possible they instead must overcome the regeneration to get the kill
somebody needs a hug and learn to lighten tfusupported anyway
it seems like this should be a fairly easy thing for ccp to do hopefully the csm can squeeze this into a meeting
going to have to support malcanis on this one i understand that prices on ships will go down but i cant help but think that whenif there were no insurance payout a lot of people would do much less pvpif in effect your making isk when a ship is blown up taking insurance right out as fillius wants would up the cost to me to where i would really step back and either fly something much smaller or stop flying pvp at all vovi still support moddingremoving insurance because insurance fraud as an industry is wrong
so you want to base it on  lets say 90 of the mean price of completed orders for a given mineral in the last  week month six months year the basic problem is the same one as pegging it to actual ship price i may not be able to manipulate the real sell price the price that someone else pays for minerals i grant two operators with a few billion between them can drive the value of completed orders of tritanium up pretty quickly though depending on the calculations you might be able to throw them off by having one sell many units to the other at slightly higher than market value or by selling a very few units at an insanely high value no matter what the system is static or dynamic someone will find a way to game it i consider most of this immaterial though after looking at actual price vs base price of minerals the entire argument that insurance is a problem is based on two assumptionsdemand for minerals exceeds nonfraud supplymineral prices are artificially high as a result of thisits also taken as a given that the amount of low skill highsec mining taking place vastly exceeds high skill lowsec i agree with thatbased on these givens one would expect that higher base price ie rarer minerals would be more inflated above their base price while low end minerals would be less inflated or deflated since all of them together have to add up to the price of one ship the adjustments have to balance out somewhere if you look at the actual numbers tritanium actually sells for more than its base price while megacyte sells for about a third this is not a result that supports the two fundamental arguments
how about having in the graphics options show custom palette shows customized palette of shipsshow corp logo shows the corp logo somewhere standard on the shipshow alliance logo shows the alliance logo instead of the corp logo in the same place on the shiplike that people can chose to turn it onoff depending if they want quality or performance
the fact is ccp is devoting an entire part of its company to walking in stations which is pointless graphical fluffif they are going to do these types of things they should include a relatively small option  option to have custom ship colors i will never agree with decals as thats custom data to load as opposed to rgb numbers client sidea simply rgb paint job would suit me nicely and allow me to tolerate more functional ships because i can pretty them up a tad also no one has been able to give me a technical example of how this would impact a fleet fight most large fleets turn all their graphics all the way down and zoom out anyway this would simply be an extra option for those of us on max shaders and textures in high sec tldr yes ccp is going to make pointless graphical fluff so at least give us the pointless fluff we ask for
i think the following are all good ideas and valid pointshowever i can understand why for a lot of reasons from server load to preserving the look of eve there will be those that are againsti say at least give the option to have your corp and alliance logo on your ship maybe even automaticaly assigned fleet squadron and wing logosnumbers on the ships that was the original skin isnt changed just added to 
im pretty sure it doesnt ship textures are stored locally afaik
i am a big boy now and can look up in the left hand corner of the screen and see my aggro timerfor the love of god  please give us the little box so we may check do not show this warning for when we undock with an aggro timer goingtalk about holding a carebears hand  whats next  emergency warp to station when an pirate enters the system
i see no reason why we shouldnt have the option to turn off the warning message
all popups and warnings in game should allow players to disable them
why we needed this in the first place annoying 
please make this a general ui proposalall click ok notifications in the game should have a tickbox that disables themall click yesno confirmations in the game should have a tickbox that disables themthere should also be a list of all of these boxes that can be browsed which shows the warning text conditions when the warning is displayed the current status active or disabled and allows toggling themin interfaces where the action can cause disproportionate harm dispanding an alliance thrashing assets the action should not be taken immediately but with an appropriate delay  and be undoable during that delay
yes please

while it makes sense to have t2 tractors as having medium and large versions also would id rather see tractor beams requiring a specific skill and getting like 75 bonus to tractor range and speed per level
please stop posting in here you are smacking more than you are presenting ideas your post is poorly thought out and you are arguing for the sake of arguing drone implants arent gonna be cheap and they will offer the same advantages other weapons have not everyone will have them and the rigs for drones are a joke make some more variations for drone boats that have been nerfed to hell and back your ideas are basically just shooting down other peoples suggestions go away
thumbs up
no really drone implants would become a standard of course when most drone boats have perfectly viable fits missiles implant slot layout is far more in need of overhaul unable to incorporate a pirate set  bonused torpscruises whereas no ship exclusively relies on drone damage lots of viable fits to let a domi use blasters or an ishtar the fact that people dont is indicative of the inability of playerbase not hull
people seem to forget about the curse and how its a nice solo ship

free by banning the name of a character i typed above instrumental in uncovering the whole nasty bob related events a while ago its made ccp reek of a quasi fascist stance on controlling their customers voices unfortunately this still goes onwhen the player base rises en masse against a single topic instead of responding quickly and openly they are more likely to mass delete every post and thread concerning the issue in the hope it will simply go away its sometimes pretty scarydepressing seeing it go on

agreed id support this with more but i currently an unable to for replicating a thread of mine that was deemed permissible 3 month prior
thought i would respond my my main for the lulz here the first bolded part is the primary problem here you have made a case for what you think are the considerations that go into determining cargohold size hypothetically speaking its as likely as anything that the other that is to say gunbattlecruisers get a larger cargohold because they are capable of more varied tasks than the drake such as mining afterall not all miners use cans i wont deny its viable options in either pvp or pve are limited but thats not the issue the fact you think the cargoholds are designed a certain way does not mean they are for all we know they may be completely arbitrary numbers the fact that i have refuted none of them is again because you dont understand what im doing i am trying to get you to refine your argument properly here since in this instance i see no reason to grief you like i am doing to other proposals atmas to the second part i boldedwell thats the reason im using my main you see anyone who is aware of the current political enrironment in eve might be aware that there is something of a kerfuffle going on in pure blind and geminate atm both region being controlled by norther coalition alliances i happen to belong to one of them this kerfuffle is burning through ships and ammunition rather quickly awesome thing is i figured i only need to bring 1k or 15k ammo and a few boosters with me on an op because 1 it stops me being wasteful with the boosters 2it saves me money when my ship dies and i barely operate hand to mouth in eve and 3 taking less boosters might theoreticall mean less cap stability but as i say cap stability is unimportant in subcapital warfare if you need to run an mwd for long enough to burn through more than 1 booster youve already screwed up and chances are your fleets burning all around you aswell lastly i dont know where you get your capital fits from but last i checked cap boosters werent exactly considered standard or even sane fittings you might want to hit the killboards to see what kinda stuff you should be fitting
yes it is based on what i think are the considerations it is anecdotal and circumstantial is also based on and correlated to facts in every single class of ship from titan to frig missile ships have the largest hold in their class projectile ships have the second largest there are only two times when this is not true 1 miningindustial bonused ships because of their role and the drake every single classanecdotal and circumstantial yes but also compelling it is one thing to call my evidence circumstantial problem is a mountain of anecdotal and circumstantial evidence can send a man to death row if it is uncountered they teach that in even online law schools now if you really want to help me refine my post how about you get to work showing how charge m3 is not correlated to hold size thats how adults debate ad hominem and obfuscation worked well in the frat house but i find that boring nowso your play style  all others got it i mentioned cap charges without any mention of capital ships then you saidyou brought up cap ships i did not i did not understand what you meant but it seems to imply that no one should be fitting boosters on any ship as cap only matters in capital ships perhaps that is not what you meant next time be clearer i do not fly caps and do not care to i do know however that many setups for ships from frig to bb call for cap boosters 00 is not the only place pvp happens

currently i live out in scalding pass it wasnt until the other day when i was manually jumping a new ship from jita back out to my scalding pass home that i realized the very same thing jump clones as ive used in the past really do make eve feel small they take all the risk out of travelling to and from empire dont get me wrong i use them for that very purpose but i also understand that it may be time to take another look at this system
i agree completely and i go so far as to say there shouldnt be any countdown perhaps just the session counterbecause sometimes i wanna jump out of my implant clone and go pvp and i dont wanna wait 24 hoursits not the distance i can easily take a small ship and scoot down to empire

ill keep it short and simple people who have experience dealing with ccp and handling the exchange between playerbase and programmerdeveloper shouldnt be cast aside so unnecessarily id motion in favor of a cool down period between csm terms 2 terms so as to allow for fair competition but allow people who have proven themselves widely effective at communication the thoughts and ideas of the playerbase to continue to do so if they so choose

i always have been and still am a very strong proponent for some sort of cloakfinding method and as ive mentioned in the past as necessity it should be far more skill intensive both sp and player skill to find a cloaker especially in covertops type ships but it should still be possible somehow to require the cloakers still be attentiveperhaps something like a specialized probe with a severely limited range and perhaps even require more than simple triangulation say for example eight of these probes must all intersect on the cloakers location to finally get a 100 fix yknow give astrometrics 5 some real use other than just as a prereq for other skillsin any case its not how its done thats so important as the fact that there should be some way to do it
you know i was utterly sure this was a horrible horrible troll about people who cry about intel gathering but ill bite see my earlier post for my opinion that still standsfor one the few hulls that can use cloaks to any advantage are not the omfgsodangerouzsz youre thinking about here since ill assume youre not completely ed ill say youre talking about covert ops cloaks here so lets break down what vessels can actually use these and what they docovert ops  scout ship functionally no weapons at all and all it would be used for is intel and probing stealth bombers  the one ship you are specifically targeting in this torpedoes are not exactly functional on anything below a battleship unless you screw over what little tank you have for target painters even then you need at least 34 sbs to do anything significant sidenote bombs are a one trick pony you have a specific amount of damage vs one resist the only time these will actually kill something is when you have an enormous sig radius frigates with mwd on being a specific example most of the time if youre in a moving cruiser with no mwd on you really dont have a problem your specific examples which i find personally hilarious are hulks considering the type of tank you can stick on a hulk if you get killed by a single bomber either your skills suck incredibly or youre a  if youre standing still and multiple bombers bomb you youre going to die get over it trying to cry nerf on dying to bombs due to cloak is barking up the wrong treerecons  one recon per race and the recons that can use a cloak arent exactly dps machines very much hoping youre not complaining about theseyour entire argument is based on two things 1 cloakers being able to gather intel in a system with no consequences and 2 bombers being able to gank lone ships if a cloaker is gathering intel so be it covops are specifically designed for this if youre keeping your eyes open while mining you shouldnt be having a problem with avoiding a gank if you dont know what to do when you see local spike up or youre not keeping your eye on dscan get the hell out of my 00 and stop trying to dumb down my game bombers can gather intel and have an offensive punch but they are hardly the invincible powerhouses youre crying like children over if you arent aligned to a celestial while mining and just sit there while the bomber makes a bombing run and the bomb travels the distance to get to you you deserve to die as stated its 00 and its called nullsec for a reason no stations to run to no police to help you you have to keep your eyes and wits about youcant do that stop playing my game
directional scan can not pick up cloaked ships only their probes which no one needs to use when every single belt is easily accessible from the right click menu how about you learn how to play the game before you talk
theres usually more than enough reds in total around and with covops cynos they can gank your freighter in secondsand you are right we are or at least i am quite specifically targeting stealth bombers as that has become the de facto ship to fly if every red their kitchen sink and their grandmothers are flying sbs instead of the previous mix of other ships id say there is some kind of unbalance theresbs are even brave enough to lob a bomb at industrials that jumped through a jb at a deathstar with several other active ships there as well ive no idea how much damage it wouldve done as i hit warp before the bomb arrived but they have to derive their sense of invincibility from somewhere  i didnt spot him on the killboard afterwards so he got away with it
last night i spent over ten minutes slowing and painfully killing a brutixin my arazui then cloaked and chuckled at this thread and the zillion other fails just like itbtw opi note you have yet to kill anything in your pilgrim
thats the thing though every red and their mother arent flying sbs in actuality if you see a multitude of reds in local that usually points to a gang which will have a mixed group of ships at most you may have 24 sbs in a large gang youre generalizing in saying that everyone is flying an sb and youll see why i say that belowthe point remains a gang of sbs have a very select group of targets to pick from they cant tackle they have very little tank to begin with and to gank anything below bs you need 23 of them with no tank at all and nothing but tps slow targets like freighters and industrials along with bs and above are the only targets an all sb gang can feasibly kill anything else and their dead sbs and cloaks have plenty of weaknesses cant cloak while being targeted limited target range paper thin tank that it is balanced as isim having trouble comprehending the intelligence you would need to have to formulate this response from my diatribe you yourself even answered your own stupidity in the same paragraphyou are whining about covert ops gathering intel gathering intel for what a gank of course if you keep an eye on your dscan guess wut ohai i can see probes and other ships close by that may be warping to me i can even warp out before they get to me if im aligned like a smart person whheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyou have no idea the drop my iq took just posting half that answer in caps youve proven you have no reason to be in lowsec let alone nullsec please get out now
in a gang youre absolutely right the proposal itself however was about are they afk or notsolo reds and those are more often than not in a sb or something else with a cloaki for one am not against cloaks per se and neither was the original proposal we seem to be straying a bit i am however against a single person being able to put an entire system on edge for hours and hours while being totally free from risk so much so he might as well be out watching a movie or somethingthe very first thing the forum trolls as they are so lovingly called shout when someone proposes something to make eve simpler or less tedious is your sic supposed to play the game not get free moneykillsbonusseslet the game do everything for youwhatever and id say that school of thought applies here as well
let the carebearification of 00 beginthe whole essence of a sovereignty holding alliances existence in 00 is just this  to provide a secure environment from which to power the economy and political wellbeing of said allianceif an alliance does its job in 00 then its reasonably safe for an aware pilot to rat or mine providing they follow intel the rewards of industrial 00 are completely off the scale compared to any hisec or lowsec endeavor if you want the rewards you have to take the risk this is why alliances exist and why people join themchanging cloaking in any way removes an incredible portion of that risk flying a lone cloaked ship in 00 being something ive done a good deal of i can tell you the bomber pilot who moves through hostile 00 is in more danger than anyone ratting or mining in their alliances held space
well insofar as being afk cloaked theres not much you can do about it introducing some sort of bay for fuel wouldnt work as you would have to do it for all cloakers not just sbs and you would have to do it in such a way that it doesnt limit anything else on the ship most roams i go in last longer than 4 hours and in 00 you basically have nowhere to go to refuel a bay or something of the sort so a bay would limit and hinder active cloakers and not just supposedly afk onesi wouldnt be adverse to the afk x amount of minutes kick offline but you would have to extend it to everyone not just cloakers if someone is afk at a pos or afk outside a station in highsec or even afk in a station they should be booted just the same as an afk cloaker you cant pinpoint one specific ship for something that would be as big as making a timer for afking theres also the problem of ccp defining what is afk is afk sitting in space not moving at all is afk being cloaked but moving in one direction cloaked while orbiting for x minutes all these things have to be taken into account because if youre scouting in a cloaked ship chances are you will be doing one of those three things listed stationary orbitting a fixed point or moving in one direction
this is why i suggested having a balanced drawback of capacitor recharge rate with the battery to prevent getting a much higher recharge rate from a larger capacitor buffera capacitor buffer is how i would like to see these modules operate but not give the pilot a hidden bonus of recharge rate like the lses give you right now
cfcs are harder to fit however give a smaller boost to capacitor recharge rate after removing a chunk of the ships cap a pdu gives you 5 bonuses to your ship pg cap cap recharge shield shield recharge which is why the bonus is smaller its more of a jack of all engineering modules master of none kind of modulewhat im suggesting is that the cfc become more of an option for other people than active shield tankers to fit it however i do also see your point that it is the shield tankers module and the cpr is the armour tankers module im an armour tanker and i missed that point all together 
3 different mods in 1 post makes it difficult to support anythingi woulda supported changes to sfcs and cap batteries although not neccessarilly the changes you advocatecfcs are fine imo they have there usescap batteries could do with lower fittings there use over cap rechargers is a vary rare occurance  well at least with fits ive made

by game balance i mean isk sink currently all alliances have to pay isk as a hard cost outside the alliance to claim and maintain sov in an area they cant write it off as a soft cost of just making something internally its much the same reason that many of the fuel components for poss arent available anywhere except via npcs a large alliance with deep pockets could buy the bpos and then manufacture all of these items they wantneed which could depending on research levels and other factors significantly reduce the amount they pay to claim and maintain sov over their areas the intention of the sov changes was not to reduce the cost of sov according to the dev blogs that were published on the changes prior to dominions release
op is a ridiculous lil cryin babby
hmmm i agree with the op that is of course rt training is one of eves strongpoints but is needed because the skills training time often spans multiple days making outofgametraining absolutely necessary but as my favourite game reviewer once said seriously why am i being rewarded for not playing the gamei think all players should have a 105110 training time multiplier by default which drops by 001 for every week the character does not do xxx maybe modify his trade orders until 100 is reached id even go there and suggest giving an additional permanent 1 for every year of active subscriptionsedit explanation when realtimetraining is due to long training times the burden of tedious skilling is lifted with faster training making the game more fun to play

supportedyou forgot a few small things like being able to prioritise shipclasses for example attack all frigates first then all cruisers then all battleships eve already attempts this but just as drones that are setup to focus fire will all run away in different directions they also pick targets at sort of randomfurthermore i really love your idea about the fleet drone tactician i think however that this should not just be a role but also requires you to setup your ship for this role for a long time ive annoyed myself for the advanced drone interfacing function you do not fit the module that needs this skill on a carrier if youre serious and battleships cant use them either therefore the use for this rank 12 skill kind of escapes mehowever the fleet drone tactician has a use for it if you make it a prerequisite  i would add a leadership skill which allows you to install fleet drone tactician modules these fleet drone tactician modules would fit only on specific ships namely fleet command ships or a new hull and carriers  motherships  titans the skill would also need advanced drone interfacing to lvl 4 as prerequisite these fleet drone tactician modules allow you to take control of drones as lvl 1 your squad lvl3 your wing lvl 5 your fleet with 10 people per level per installed fleet drone tactician module maxed at 5 installed fleet drone tactician modules 1 per level in fleet drone commandships as a fleet cannot be larger than 250 to begin withfurthermore as these specialised fleet drone tactician ships can use fleet drone tactician modules they will now also be able to fit drone control units on a subcapital class hull
imo there are some details that need to be specified but overall i think this is a very good proposalprobably a little bit too big to be implemented in one expansion but who knows those detailswhich setting is stronger  target priority or drone settingsengage ewar vessels first and a normal bs as target prio 1  which will be attacked firstwhat is the target priority of targets not added to the dtiwill all targets in the dti be destroyed first and then all remaining targets or do targets have a default priority of eg 5 this would allow to instruct drones to attack certain targets last without having to specify the complete order threading models usually work this waybut as i said above those are mere detailsgreat effort on sharing what you had in mindthe screenshot really gives a good idea how this could be
since a dev told me that capital booster is not of any use on my ship and i dont wana play with 375 of my main tank after every session changesupportedand to add to the discussion here1 armor tanks have also slave sets working2 the imbalance especialy after the hp bonus on supercaps is bigger bcs you apply a bonus on a bonus3 60k shield per min is nothing whenif you die after a few mins how much time do i need to stay alife with passive shield regen to balance the double armor tank bonus instant gang bonus applied on slave bonus

finding clocked ships is a whole other subject but as you mentioned it finding ships with a prototypeimproved cloak fitted  fine come up with some sensible mechanism finding ships with a covert ops cloak fitted  nope that would break them utterlyi like how it is now cowardly to lurk in a system and watch for targets some would say it is a valid form of intel that people have been able to avoid doing because of local if you are that scared of an afk covopsrecon in your system then youll love the no local idea because then they wont show up there to frighten you to answer some of the other comments removing character info unless you speak from local will not change how you find targets if you are in hostile space youll have a local beacon count to show there are people in system but you wont get free intel on the corpalliance etcit is by design that you wont know how many of those people in local are friendly you have to decide on talking in local to get friendlies to reply and give free intel or being slightly paranoid perhaps there could be an option to transmit a friend or foe so you show up in local as now but then it becomes your choice and you give free intel to lurking spys this proposed change is for 00 only because it would make empire a very lonely place you could say the empires require all ships in their space to transmit a friend or foe beacon this type of system upgrade might be available to sov 00 space toothe actual mechanisms are up for discussion were looking at the bigger picture not the minutiae of implementation but the concept is one i think worth pursuing
you dont see a blob because of the fear of trapping a fleet in wh space with the only exit dropping them 40 jumps partially through high sec where some pilots in any fleet wouldnt be able to travel from their home systems worse the fleet might end up having to break up and travel multiple separate 40 jump routes as whs have been known to collapse after only some of the pilots go through it has more to do with the unpleasant flight back than anything else no fc in their right mind would risk this
the people who complain about local being a super tool for pve and preventing pvp have not run a roam been a scout or simply just been on a pvp roamwhy local is an even more important tool for pvp than pve1 local allows a roaming gang to quickly find targets pvp fleets usually fly through a dozen empty systems before a scout finds targets in local to kill2 local lets pvpers know if their prey has fled the systemlogged off3 local spikes let pvpers know that another gang usually a defense fleet has arrived to drive them off or kill them4 local lets a roaming gang know where a defense fleet is so they can escapein short if local was removed roaming pvp gangs would cease to exist they would be forced to move a lot slower  as the scouts would have to spend a lot more time searching each system to find out if there are potential targets hours of boredom while looking for something to kill wouldnt be balanced out by that random raven kill when the roaming gang is discovered as they always are the defense fleet would have a significant advantage over the roaming gang roaming gangs would diemost gate camps would also cease to exist generally they have a network of alts in various systems near the camp to find incoming targets so the camp can be at the appropriate gate to kill them otherwise they will slip through also those alts let the camp know when a fleet is coming to break up the camp as usually ends up happening if they didnt have local those alts would be near impossible to use camps would rarely catch people so pvpers would stop willingly sitting in a single system with others waiting for something to killin short you need a different intel system if you want to get rid of local this is why i came up with this idea it would fulfill the same function as the existing local as intel while penalizing both pvp and pve blobs the bigger they are the less local intel they would have

there must be some stronger penalties for team killers in faction wari understand that individuals who do this get a massive faction hit when killing other militia members however there are corporations in militia who make team killing a policy and when their faction standings get too low they repair them so they can keep team killing even under the current penalty system they seem to do this over and over again and remain in militia to continue to team killthe militia is a defacto alliance between corporations and members of a given militia members should not be allowed to continue to team kill and repair their faction standings this goes against the very nature of faction war designed by ccp otherwise there would not be faction militias or the need to install some degree of penalty for team killing to begin withccp allows for militia corporations to wardeck each other and it should be left at that however these team killing corporations prey on the fact that people dont see them in their overviews which are 99 of the time set to only see neutrals or opposing militia war targets and when they are set to see everyone do not expect members of the same militia who they are not at war with to make an organized effort to kill themi propose that the penalties be increased so great that after a couple times of doing this the memeber cannot recover their faction standings which will go towards corporation faction standingscorporations who wish to engage fellow militia members should rely on the wardec system not be allowed to team kill and repair their faction standings to team kill again
i support this idea as it is one of the reasons that i am hesitant to join fw
i presume that when you say team killing you mean friendly fire from corp to corp
yes when both corps are in the same militia and no wardec exists
thats not goodand the wardec thing imho shouldnt be possible if your in the same militia
the only reason the team killing mechanic is allowed in corporations and alliances which is why the mechanic hasnt been questioned before is because in corporations and alliances players have the ability of policing such behavior ie kicking offending playerscorporations as fw factions function similar to alliances make it a 24 hour vote to kick a player from the faction initiated by a friendly kill additionally just having a system in place to vote to kick peoplecorps from a faction would probably take care of several other annoyances ive heard people mention about the fw mechanics this is a sandbox players are supposed to have control
10
needs to be applied to corporation as well you can have a corp with good standing and a few 10 pilots in it that can essentially kill at will with no hit whatsoever since their contribution to corp standings is already maxed outwhile at it sort the embarrassing standings hit for actions in nullsec
this is something i have thought much about i agree however it is an idea that i dont see that ccp will entertain
this gets my vote too it does not make any sense that a corp in an fw militia can wardec another corp in the same militia in a normal alliance such an action would result in you being expelled i dont like the idea of corps or pilots being expelled from militia by some sort of a vote that would bring all sorts of risks of misuse so why not just change the game mechanics to prevent wardecs inside militia
this is not about alliancesthis is about militias and while i do not play fw i whole heartedly disagree with anyone making a comparison as suchthe alliance does not answer to any empire or any faction as they are indipendent to themselves aside from paying dues to concordthe militia is essentially an extension of said empire therefore the empire would enforce certain stipulations forcing a nonfriendly fire mechanic to take place inducing wardec makes the most logical senseif you want to wardec you should leave the militia and then wardecif you want to team kill the penalty should be severe if not resulting instant secloss likening to getting a concord penaltyeither way the current system is not something i call balancedtldr  the militia is nothing like an alliance mechanic shouldnt apply here
perhaps among other things the ability to lock a character and a twoweek delay to unlock them for sale or deletion after all people seldom sell a character on the spur of the moment
i agree that something needs to be done but stopping character transfers i dont feel is the correct solutionthe issue is how to ensure that the owner of the account is agreeing to transfer the character at the moment this is done simply by username password and also the credit card used to provide the transferthe first part is easily circumvented by various techniques keylogers phishing hacking forums where people have the same username and password as their game account etcthe second part is circumvented by using a stolen credit cardso the current attack will be something like the following assuming ccp check the address on the account with that of the credit cardobtain login details via email scam etcchange the accounts user details to match the stolen credit card details and the email addressstrip any assets worth selling by repeatedly undocking and ejecting so an alt can board watch for people doing this and report them asappost a character sale threadsell the character paying with the stolen credit cardlaunder the iski suggest that the character transfer system be modified asap to do something like the followinglock all transfers by defaultto unlock a character you must confirm via an email linkchanging email address locks the transfers for 3 months for example emails the old address to say that it was changed and flags the account to the gms the old address will also remain on the account and be notified of changes until the 3 months are up or an email address change confirmation is clickedchanging account owner address or billing details should send a notification to the email addresses assigned to the account and also flag the account in some waythis is just a quick look and i might have missed something out hopefully this would allow transfers to be initiated by legitimate parties but make it very hard to do so maliciously there might be things to tweak a bit such as sending confirmations more than once in case the email doesnt get though but that is still better than the current systemi am aware however that more official emails from ccp with links to click might have the undesirable effect of allowing scammers to send something similar perhaps no link but instructions to type eveonlinecom into their browser and cut and paste a key into a special page thereccp also need to retain logs related to people ejecting from ships and track who is taking them to facilitate recovery of assets from hacked accountsone final thingccp should run a query over the user database looking for any accounts where the account name is the same as a character on that account those active people should be contacted and given the option to have their account login renamed to something elsethe first step in avoiding these kinds of scams is to have a different account name from your character if you see an email addressed to charname not accountname then you might be more suspicious though i believe ccp send out emails with the charname instead for special reactivation offers  bad ccp 
thisand thiswelcome to the internets use wisely
i only support stronger account security and character trading securityall the great points have already been spelled out in detaila really big fan of an entry of character sale being made in the employment history not just importing the skill set people need to know if a character was bought with the skill set idea overtime it would just look like you created him
while its not a major flaw theres no reason why it cant be fixed with a very simple solution when you are first scrambled or if you have stabs when scram strength exceeds your warp strength you should get an aura announcement your warp drive is disabled when you have cleared all the scrambling you should get another clear announcement your warp drive is online again even better this should also apply when youre in a bubble so you get notified the instant youre clear of it
this in lvl4 missions i long since decided it should be sop to kill frigates first because they are the ones that will kill you i have imparted this knowledge to the people ive got into playing the gameyou see the genius of this stratagem is that the frigates cant scramble you if they are wrecksit makes missions eminently more survivable i am doing you a favour by imparting this secret to you make use of it
i agree
you dont get warp scrambled before level 4s i remember before the overview icons i lost a dominix when i got scrambledbut now we have the lovely overview icons and the op needs to stop whining
u could turn off damage notifications in the esc menui for one found it rather pointless to know how much they hit me for since i tanked everything anywaywasted space for me so i just left my dmg to see if maybe im getting missed hits or if im actually hitting that cruiser rly up close to meanother thing is that in response to number 3there isits called the log check up and down ur neocom for itits thereive actually hot keyed it to alt l so that i can pop it up right when i get a huge hit with my guns i wanna brag about or if i get a funny session change message everything that pops up in that little black box in the center of the screen will be logged note that the log will reset after a session change but all ur logs are saved to my documentsevelogsgamelogs
the easiest thing would be to change the unknown i think this is what it displays on the ew bar to display what type of ew is being used again you as it is already shown on the overview this shouldnt be a problem
you get even warp scrambled in think lvl2 and lvl3 missions

you know i was actually considering proposing this the other daysupported
all right then since so many clever buggers have come up with compelling arguments as to why the drake shouldnt get more cargo space we clearly have no other option than to nerf the cargo holds of all the other missile ships its only fair
actually1 i was implying that pilots should not need large amounts of cap boosters because cap stability is not an issue in sub capital fights i passed no comments regarding cap boosters being used by capitals that was you either mis reading or attempting to obfuscate the situation2 im simply stating my play styleyour assertion of what my play style is not my play stylethe best play style again this is either your misunderstanding or an attempt to make me look the fooland responding to your first point last3you are ignoring multiplicity of roles which is something i did infact imply might be a possible cause it is entirely possible however unlikely i consider it personally that ships such as the cyclone have a larger cargohold than the drake because given their preference for turrets they are able to do one thing the drake cannot mine as such it is possible that the drake as a dedicated missiledps boat was not thought to need a cargohold as large as ships which can be used in small scale mining operations as i say i do not argue the point on the drake having limited roles i am infact arguing that this limitation might be the cause not the result of its smaller cargohold
you forgot expensive too
supportedi think that you should be able to jumpclone and change your medclone to within the same stationsystemconstellation where your pod currently is perhaps a new skill like interstellar consciousness can increase the range of setting a clone and jumpcloning just as with trading starting at station improving to region at lvl 5
if jcs make eve small so do alts remote market orders jump bridges jump portals contracts that can be seen from every corner of eve etc i can see how somebody thinks these things make eve small but imo this is a nonissue and no reason for the proposed changesjcs have uses in protecting implants as well as traveling i use them in both ways and i have no reason to want them to be nerfed yes i also voted for the proposal to introduce a skill that reduces the jc timer by 1h per level
you could also say that jump clones help afk empires do your tradingmissions in jitamotsu and then when your afk empire is threatened jump to defend then back to your isk making in empire you could say it stops people from settling in an area and making use of it
with all the rampant abuse frequent absences violations of the nda insider trading and inappropriate behavior with the last csms do you really want them to have longer termsmost definitely not supported
this i would however support limiting them to zero terms
leave it the way it is they do less damage that way what is the csm purpose anyway clown show doing a good job if they areif ccp wants ideas on how to improvefix the game then have someone read the two forums that are provided for that the csm is just a waste of space and a pr stunt nothing more and nothing less
nope

 wrong forum board for my post 
no to skill grinding in any form i responded in the assembly hall to the op so i wont bother hereas to the why are you rewarded for not playing you arent skill training is the basic service provided for an active subscription the only way to get something extra is to actually play the game that is the only way to get more money and implants that provide substantial gains and you are therefore rewarded for actively playingi dont see any reason why people should be punished for not doing xxx at regular intervals or to provide even more sp advantages to veterans they are the ones least in the need of it if the training times are too long for your patience than have the testicular fortitude to say it straight or at least have the decency to suggest increased training speeds for all instead of just yourself
provided we the community are able and willing to help and give them time to work out the kinks again with community support im for it
for great justice bump for blasters
ccp when you will aknowladge that 10 more dps is not worth 3x less of optimal range than lasers and what if something moves in less than 15km with 2km optimal of medium blasters  you cant track propely unless you hold still and your target is webbed and scrammed thank you web nerf  and gallente ships with self repair bonus in order to use a bonus on ship you have to downgrade guns insalny low becuase you lack of powergrid which negate even this pathetic 10 more dps bonus than other gunsandits obviosuly better to fit something diffrent than blatsers or rails in taht matter on ships with no bonus to hybrid guns i belive it says something about how blasters are brokenthere is much more issuesthe whole gallente needs a redesign including freaking lp store and armor stuff that is no better than t2 but 10x more expensive and just clogging your database as if you have nothing better to do with your resources

as far as pve goes yes caldari do have good ships for thatstill any other race have perfectly usefull ships ishtar domi zealot munin vaga are perfectly valid choicesas for damage types  ill take only 1 example minmatar have a good choice in using either emp based damage or explkin damage emp  barrage  shurly its not as versatile as misile boats but insta damage should cover for all thatas for pvp well ability to choose dmg only works in very very small engagements probably most notabily in 1 vs 1 an areea in witch caldari ships come prenerfed anyways as for larger fleet engagements by the time a caldari switches ammo fires and the misiles reach the target its a good posibility thats already dead and if not well because of the delay  you lost much much more that you gained
not supported agreeing with lili yaay and others
dude chill telling me to shut up and that ive been proved wrong several times doesnt help you at all i could say the same exact thing to youmissiles are all damage weapons they can use all types of damage but that does not mean you have to that also does not mean they should get bonused to all 4 types missiles always hit always hit within their usually pretty large range and depending on what types of missiles tend to do very good dps also they are capless have the option of using any type of damage that is alot of good things about missiles is it really too much to just accept some of caldaris ships only get bonused to kinetic which is what your races flavor is anyways yes other races get multiple damage types but for gallente and amarr those are the only two damage types so it cant really be viewed as a tactical advantage cause they would be shooting those damages all the time no matter whati personally think its balanced how it is
i agree with this guy the hawk needs a boost but rockets well ok a small boost would be good but the thing is rockets have low fitting requirements and can hit from much further out than blasters they definitely have purpose they are essentially a damage boost mod for most ships the ships that have them as an intended primary weapon need the boost but not so much rockets in general a rocket kestrel is a strong frig and can put out very good damage if you fit a web the problem is if you fit a web you have no prop modrocketsvery good rangevery good fitting low damageno capalways hitlook at fitting rockets like they are just a damage mod then i think you will see they arent so bad i fit rockets on most of my pvp frigsi never use standard missiles for pvp though imo they really suck

this has brought a tear of joy to my eye i also like the detailsrefinements mentioned by two of the earlier replies will ccp listen that is the milliondollar question i cant see the button for two thumbs up
single best drone overhaul proposal i have ever seen
nice
good lord sir that is a brilliant idea would the drone aggression settings possibly include going after other drones
im not sure i like this proposal quite as it is but i agree prioritizing targets and ignoring targets would be hugely beneficial to drone users
no waylag is pretty bad as it is forcing computers and servers to deal with aditional load will only make it much worse player generated content while nice feature in theory dosent go well with the scale of this game not to mention that due to crap like discriminations and players being offended by diffrent words or images everything that is player generated must be checked and theres a whole new world of trouble that way
well no one said anything about forcing it it would seem easy enough to add a little graphical option to turn them on or off like showing turrets or drone models although i honestly doubt that lag is going to be affected by a few tiny alliance pictures which have already been downloaded and the tagging data is already thereand as for your second point which is mostly moot by making it an optional graphical setting you clearly have no idea how the alliance logo approval process works or looked at local recently
i had an amazing idea on this subject tonight and i apologize for not reading everything before posting this so if its already been mentioned my bad but here goes bit deeper than just the pc version problem since the debate has widened as far as i have been reading on the interwebsin my opinion ccp were dipping their toes in the water with an out of pod experience when they came up with incarna it seems to me that the idea has swept them away to create something more bold on this level without properly tweaking their first objective in the past ccp have been meticulous in their scrutiny of every detail and aspect of the game and creating the perfect balanced environment but maybe theyre trying to run before they can walk bad pun but what the hell but maybe we are looking at dust at the wrong angle a pc version would be expected due to the loyal followers so far but the idea that players will control a grunt in a corp within the alliance their eve char is in is an interesting integration we know pc gamers are superior to console gamers so let them be our grunts think about it console gamers inevitably create clans or in this case a corp whats to say that your characters progression in dust wouldnt be rated on something such as a kd ratio with a ranking system possibly in the same fashion as merc corp being hired for a sov battle they say they want to integrate the battlefield pay the grunts with alliancecorp isk and they could improve their characters with better gear etc take on the mission of the sov battles or to capture planets maybe even capuring a base station linked to a moon minerpos orbiting in space etc as well as interstellar defenses this would bring about conflicts simultaniously taking place around the plants and moons of a system with eve players assaulting possplanetary facilities from orbit and providing tactical analysis on very large battlegroundswhich will hopefully be a feature of dust one thing eve got right was the scale of the systems whilst the dust battle also rages on down below this would bring about a much bigger feel to every system with fleets able to hide within systems rather than just camping stargates and much more intense experience for all partiesthese are just a few ideas sorry for the epic post but to answer the simple question clearlyofc dust should be on the pc
this thread still generating tears like it has been said many times console only is the best way pc  hackersbut please keep the tears rolling in though they taste the best
this is a business decision of a rl companyyou may agree with it or notimho its out of scope for the csm
fine make it a console game get the new market but make a pc version too
i love this huge drama about dustdo you people think alot according to the diffrences in console and pc gameshacking a pc game is easy using programs to do everything for you is easyhacking a console game now that is hard and you cant write programs to help youand making the game on multiplatforms will force them to make 2 diffrent servers 1 for console 1 for pcas people have said yes you can hook up a mouse and keyboard to a xbox or ps3 but the performance is not close to hooking the same equipment up to a pc making it console only is a excellent starting point and people that dont want to pay monthly subscriptions for a game that has a insane learning curve dont have to worry they can just toss in a few coins from now and then to buy new stuff to kill and blow sht up withbut these are just my thoughts

i seriously doubt that they would be able to do this those broker fees will add up fast for one thing and basing the basket price off of market sales means that this toing and froing with minerals is susceptible to other players ninjaing in their own orders one tiny slip by the wouldbe market manipulators would leave them with billions of units of someone elses 25 isk trithave a look at the weekly mineral sales volume over the whole of eve and work out how much youd have to spend to raise the aggregate mineral price by say 20 using the methods you outline the sums involved are almost inconceivable and theres no way you can do it stealthily and theres no way you can prevent other people profiting by at least as much as you but without spending all that isk

supportedlocal wins in wh space why not 00
because 00 isnt wspace a lot less players so you wont have to poscloak up every 30 seconds you know up front there will be no local you can choose to go there or not ofcourse you can choose to go to 00 or not but unlike wspace when it was introduced a lot of ppl are already in 00 no gates so theres a rp explanation why you dont know whos there riskreward you take a higher risk and you cannot possibly think removing local will lower any kind of risk and theres the shifting way back home for higher gains lots of sites lots of sleepers etcand imo local doesnt win in wspace its fing annoying to be forced to grind some buttonclicking for basic survival directional 9999999999 km 360 degrees spam button see probes pos up which is a major reason i left there
not entierly sure i support it but im inclined to changing local to a number in system and comms if anyone breaks radio silence would make the covopsrecon ships more suited to their purpose as it is anyone can drop into a system and have a decent idea of the number of targets at least in a red vs blue vs neutral way the current probing system will give you an idea of what is in a system but to find out who safely will require specific recon ships the obvious choice is covops cloaked vessels but other fast movers can zip in get a quick look and zip out this turns covert warfare and scouting into more than just looking at local
you dont get it if you actually live in wspace system and you are more then solo farmer  you have poeple scanning doing sites minning travelling etc there is really no need to spam button ever 2 seconds  if theres a lot of active people your chances of spotting someone increases dramaticlynow adding static gates to the equation that can be camped by alt with sound turned on it really ist that hard
not supportedthis will drive alot of people out of 00 as it will effectivly stop any resource gathering op from out of empire space it will become echonomically unviable to have such ops either by having to take an unreasonable ammount of precautionsif you compare 00 to wh space you will find that wh space has alot more rewards in it 00 does not most 00 allianceses need an industrial backbone and most members in those allianceses need isk for various things this will break all that remember this is a game and there should be a reasonable ammount of effort involved in playing iti will also remind agony empire representative that not all eve pilots like to fly t1 inshured ships with t1 fitting they might be fun and cheap and lot alot of resources needed for them but most players prefer the t2 ships i say that corelated to the effort gathering enough resources to fly them in 00 as it is now it just dosent support it with the added risk that you proposeand pvp will jsut become one big blind game you should remember that there are still deep sses made so no matter what you do you cant scan averything if you try to realistically predict what will happen you will see a huge drop in engagements in 00 space various pirates and all the people that have highsec mining  missioning alts will be ofc enchanted by this not so the people that moved alltogeather in 00 what this will do is to force them move partially or complete to empire 2 cents 
actually i think i do get it sometimes better than others not everyone is in some huge alliance with a gazillion alts for every conceivable purpose working at it like eve is some kind of job some are just friends playing a game togetheri did actually live in wspace thank you not solo but not with a very large group either 3 persons 5 accounts we were usually all in the same belt mining now why would we be scanning down sites you seem to be in a large group assign everyone one if the sigs in 5 minutes youve got bookmarks of all of them travel whereto the wsector next door when theres enough to do back home without the added hauling and risk of the wh collapsingif there are more ppl then yes the chance of finding or probably being found by someone get a lot better too bad most of the time youre found the other party in some gank ship obliterating your mining op before those aligned but for obvious reasons at 0 ms barges or exhumers have accelerated enough to enter warpi rather spam the dscanner than rely on the offchance i spot them before they come out of warp at their optimal rangelocal is perfect the way it is the roaming pirates dont have to work hard just to determine if there are targets near but can just start warping to belts ready to put a point on whoever is in them and those peaceful targets get a moderate chance at safety without some forced buttonclicking all the time because some vocal minority is bleating their targets are trying their hardest not to get ganked guess what thats life zebras run from lions as well youre the lion im the zebra and we both have racially different points of view
firstly 00 is supposed to be dangerous and you should have to take precautions to protect any resource gathering operation that said with a local count it wouldnt drive people out it would just mean people in the same alliance would have to talk to each other when moving around so as not to spook the rattersminers etc when local count goes up an mmo encouraging people to interact  shocking 00 has higher end resources not available in empire your pointif your isk generation will be destroyed by the removal of free intel on who is in local when it only shows a count of active pilots then it is time to evaluate what you are doing in 00 allow me to correct a misconception or threeagony empire is not pvp basic we live in 00 we fly t2 ships we fly faction ships we even t2 fit our t1 ships yes sometimes flying a t2 fitted t1 ship is even more fun than flying t2  like when you kill a faction fitted t2 ship with a rifter i wont speak for most players only the players i fly withwhen not killing other people or teaching how to avoid being killed we make isk in 00 by ninja ratting running plexs and even go into wormholes thus i can say with confidence that the retaining local count proposal for 00 is easy mode compared to wspacerisk vs rewardcurrently you can ninja rat in a 00 system with a pve fitted ship with a cloak and when a hostile comes into local you just ss and cloak not much risk for potentially huge rewardwith the proposed change you can ninja rat in a 00 system with a pve fitted ship with a cloak and when local count goes up you can just ss and cloak oh no the end of life as we know itdifference is that you dont know who that is it could be a friendly or a hostile and you cant tell without taking some action the advantage for you is they dont know who you are either  it cuts both ways i disagree it will allow better tactics and allow covops to provide intel more effectivelydeep safes are useful but that doesnt matter if somebody isnt in scan range of you then you are not in scan range of them yes they might put out probes  no different to now it will not force them back to empire if anything it might mean more people fleet up instead of being solo in an mmo
i dont have all that many experience in mmos some 2 years of eve and a month in wow shocking an eve player playing both  and both have its merit heathen burn at the stake how dare you compare eve to wowive never once felt the need in wow yet lvl 35 atm to interact with others much sure some pick up groups for some mission or other but beyond that solo grinding the instant gratification npcs mostly worse yet playing together with a friend is nearly imposible as you both have to be about the same level preferably be on the same quest so it wont get boring as im a few levels higher than the mission or wenowhere near eve online where i have friend in my corporation or alliance and beyond where were very actively chatting and interacting scouting for each other running missions together tankingscoutingmining together and though im a carebear myself pvping togetherid say eve doesnt lack social interaction so no need to patch that with a piratebufffriendlyinhabitantnerf disguised as some answer to a nonexisting social problem00 is dangerous and we are taking precautions telling us we should do so in a manner suggesting we arent already is a straw man argument one revealing you want easier kills at that
i am not per se against the local nerfchange the problem is that every proposal ive seen so far has far reaching consequences with too many unadressed downsides does not suggest how to compensate or is generally vague and agreeing with a previous poster ccp would either lack the balls to make bigger changes or screw upfor that reason id rather suggest smaller changes like making covops not appear in local unless they talk delay peopleidentity showing in local until they brake cloak or after a small fixed time this could be tuned and enhanced over timenot supporting this proposal for being vague
i agree with the proposal i particularly like ainekos idea of having a skill related to tractor beams as just about everything else in eve doesgreygal
in october 2006 i was introduced to eve online my four now teenage children and i have always held a high personal standard for games1 no witchcraft or magic2 no excessive blood or gore3 and no games that force you to do wrong or commit evil actsthese are our personal standards and as a family we hold to them even to todaywhen we were introduced to eve online all of us were excited we found a game that was truly a sandbox which allowed us to explore and prosper without violating personal standards though there are a few fellow players who have demonstrated a less than mature attitude on the most part eve online players have exhibited an intellect and maturity not always found on other gamesfor the first couple of years we have played the role of carebears the missions are fun and my two daughters thinks its great to go asteroid mining then you brought out factional warfarefw is great because it helped us break from our fears and get involved with aspects of the game that we never knew too much about all of which never forced us to do wrongwhen i joined fw i wanted to find a fleet corp that held high standards i remember looking for months and my initial choice came down to a few in the end i decided to join vfor later to merge into 1st praetorian guard because their standards were high and their demand for focus and discipline are second to none the benchmark they have asked from me and my peers makes your game a lot of funover the next year we worked hard on fw the game mechanics is simple and appeared to be fair and balanced capture plexes and you contest a system capture enough plexes in a system and it becomes vulnerable when a system goes vulnerable our faction can capture it over the course of the year the amarrian minmatar combat zone seemed balanced sure the matari could speed tank most if not all of amarrian plexes but this didnt discourage us 1st praetorian guard worked hardthen we started noticing bugsbecause 1pg holds each other to high standards we unanimously agreed not to exploit any bugs even if it would be to our advantageone bug is where a pilot can warp off a timer and keep the complex running while not in the plexanother bug is to use nonamarrian players to bring down systems since the repubic fleet wont attack themwhen these bugs came into full bloom many of our enemies were outraged the caldari were coming in and taking down systems and even pilots like sasawong or indra nithil couldnt keep up with the load when it became known that 1pg refused to use these exploits even our enemies applauded our position and expressed their respect for our standardsnow with christmas and new years on the tide is turning many minmatar are using exploits to take down amarrian systems we repeatedly find plexes running in amarrian systems where no enemy is on the timerand i find myself more ashamed of ccp than i am for those pilots who cannot succeed without cheatingccp i love this game because it has always appeared to be balanced eve online never required me to become some zombie king to defeat the game you never had the game designed to allow and promote cheating until nowam i crying over the loss of amarrian systems no its part of the game what i am crying over is that known exploits are being used that are violating the gaming universe and ccp has not respondedfrom the perspective of a player youve allowed cheats to go uncorrected and for this i am ashamed
agreedalthough i dont think most players use the exploits enough of them on all sides of the conflict dountil this problem is fixed just report the ones you catch cheating and try to stay above the pettiness
unfortunately computergames are often riddled by people seeking to circumvent game mechanics or use flaws at least in eve its possible to petition pilots that try to bug the timer
fw has been getting worse treatment than a red headed stepchildccp think of the stepchildren voice echo returns giving a sense of huge empty space and loneliness
im one of the pilots who applauded 1pg and now i run offensive plexes in the bleaks and devoid none of the fleets i run knowingly use a bug to capture a complex we do on occasion warp out due to too much damage or wt pressense or the call to assist in an adjacent system and return to find that the bug closed the plex in our absence this is an unfortunate side effect of the bug it can be triggered even when the act is not intentional so please dont be too quick to judge every selfrunning timer while i have no doubt that some pilots are exploting this its not always entirely under our control continue to petition those abusing the mechanic as i do and will and we will see you on the battlefield i would say that the caldari situation had the added effect that there are many more minmatar pilots running plexes than there used to be the gloating and chest beating on the igs forums over captured minmatar systems made a lot of people rather upset and this is part of whats going on some of it may be related to the bugs but most is related to a lot of hard workthe csm has voted to take fw up with ccp which is good as it is broken on many fairly deep levels it does behoove us to keep this in the fore of the conversation here though as well as the other threads around squeaky wheels get the grease as they sayno
i stand in awe of your puritanism never the less i support the ops complaint
you know you are responsable for your own computer securityif a hackercracker got in wtf do you want from ccp  you are not paying ccp to do security in your computer most security systems ccp would employ would be simple defeated by an atacker that gained remote access to your computer plain and simple token based auth would be a way but clumbersome and not cost effective maybe an option for it for people that desire it would be welcomeas far as char trades in every major mmo there is the black market account trading and along with it comes alot of legal issues and so on and so forth problems for users and for developers ccp made a bold and smart move by allowing char trades and givem the years needed to develop a char i say its one of their best movesremoving char trades will do nothing to help security it will be only replaced by account trading and stealing for rmt traders  and will just only fend off players that wants to enjoy the game a bit more wo playing it for 4 years
agreeing with helen malcanis mazz tea and others that are against the shutting down of char sales but pro increased account security sorry verone your proposal does not fix the problem in any wayedit shameless plug to an account security proposal
signedquick fix  just as theres a buttion with move items with broadcast to top of overview there should be one with move items with warp scaramble effects on topthings are ok with 34 targets  but when your overview is filled well thats when  hits the fan and you just dot know what is doing what to you its both usefull in pvp and pve and not an overpowering feature
is that the one with the arrow on it
i have to agree with the others dennis in a few years time you will be able to appreciate it for yourself the way its always intended to be i dont think eve is going to disappear before you turn 18 and if any of the previous fests are anything to go by they wont be stopping them any time soongood things come to those who wait patience is a hard skill to learn but it will serve you well
at least this year fanfest was pretty much a 3day drinking binge with occasional mentions of internet spaceshipsi realise that the typical mancunian 16 year old is no stranger to such things but ccp probably doesnt want to be seen as sanctioning it
actually i cannot understand why eve is only rated as 12 raise it to 18 and we can get rid of the profanity filter on forums ironically the game itself does not filter and other limitations
ccp should post live petition statistics these statistics should include number of petitions presently unanswered petitions pending and petitions completed for each categoryaverage response time should also be included for each category this would allow a player to very roughly predict an expected time until their petition would normally be answered these average response times should clearly only be used as a very rough guide for players but it would be more information than we have at the momentslow petition responses are annoying for everyone to ccp aswell i think and i think the situation needs improving even if response times cannot be improved perhaps providing more information to players would at least show them progress is being madeanyone have any thoughts on this
i think the elephant in the room here is how badly petitions are dealt with at times and how stubborninfuriatingignorant gm responses can be except for the more obvious and easy to fix player problems like stuck character it seems the petition system is designed to be a series of hurdles intended to make the highest possible number of players give up as to reduce the amount of work for gmsccp to get something done for them players need to show a lot of endurance exchanging multiple mails with gms until the petition gets escalated to a senior gm exchange multiple mails with him annoy him to get him to do something endure ban threats and in return threaten with canceling subscription of all your accounts as protest with much luck you might get your issue solved at this pointso yes im favor of any measure that sheds light on this mess ultimately something needs to be done
everyone knows it would take 5 months for a reply and even then its allways this does not show in our logs p
with the dominion patch the cosmic anomalies have gotten more popularity currently the only 2 cosmic anomalies that are giving a bit of a challange are the havens and the sanctums my proposal is to make them and the other cosmic anomalies more challenging by increasing the spawn volumes this will enhance teamwork becasue remote rep will be needed on the toughest anomalies my idea is to reduce the 8 spawns in 2 or 3 massive spawns
yes the anomalies are lame being easier than lvl 4s even after doubling to tripling the spawn size they would be soloable with a decent pve ship but in keeping with the riskreward formula if you make them harder they must pay more
let us research negative mepe blcscertainly this simple mechanic change would help out all those struggling with invention profitability and reduce the strain on moon mineral supplies
this has been brought up zillions of timesthere are better proposal like carrying over a fraction of the research levels on the t1 bpc used in the invention over to the invented t2 bpcalso dont confuse actual moon min demand with speculation
post dominion this is even less true doing anomaliesplexes matches mission income you have indices to keep up and with moon gold mostly gone the 00 corps have to make isk from diffuse sources ie you pveing in their spacefurther most 00 people who still do empire missioning use alts for it not jcs same goes for empire trading which is only practiced by a minority anywayand calling jcs the culprit for people not settling into space is just lol there are a hundred other issues or game mechanics that have greater impact on that dominion failed at reducing the space held by alliances and even if it was reduced it still doesnt stop the big players from just stomping the small trying to conquer space

fix titanshow many carriers and dreads have to be killed wo the slightest risk to titans before you admit that theyre overpoweredadd a delay to the dd of 30 seconds before it can even fire add an immobility delay after the dd is fired of 1 minute 0 speed unless bumped
see ccps very obvious plans for 11 coming soon here
youre confusing cause and effect here the skills training time spans multiple days because of the rt training not the other way around nothing requires ccp to make skills take weeks of training time they chose to do so because of their belief in their system of realtime training its unique as far as i know anyway and as i stated before a huge draw to the game not everyone has the time to grind out levelsdespite the fact i am very active right now im sure if ccp were to back out from one of the fundamental features of their game and require you to be online to train or be penalized if youre offline id leave i like the idea that i can advance however insignificantly without requiring to think of eve as a second job i like the idea that even if i hypothetically couldnt play for a month my subscription fee wouldnt be going to wasteyoure arguing about something that makes eve the game that it is you may as well ask for a carebear nopvp server or hell multiple regional servers for that matter we should replace spaceships with knights and wizards
little feature  possibility to remote stack stuff in hangar like repackaginga feature that will help ccp to lower database charge to fight lag monster 23 years ago dont remember exactly they decided to limit the number of stack by station to 1000 to lower server charge but its still possible to have above 1000 for example when you buy hangar cleanout they dont dont auto stacki have stations where i cant dock hostiles where i have more than 1800 items which would go easily at 9001200 if i could stack theminitial thread in feature and idea discussion created by john roe
