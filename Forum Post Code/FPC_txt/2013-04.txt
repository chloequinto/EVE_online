so youre essentially asking ccp to give away free game time no
what are you smoking tell you what stop smoking it get a clue then realise how daft youre beingdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
okay so now everyone buys plex that makes ccp no money because they just spawn magically how exactly do you expect ccp to survive as a company i eagerly await your obviously highly informed opinion
i had been wondering what software people were using to multibox with thanks for clueing me up on it 
aye im not up for doing daily wh ops with red capital ship blobs getting involved keep it classy please
this is a very interesting thread so im bumping thisi think you can dramatically nerf high sec just by modifying the content of belts example10 only veldspar some concentrated veldspar very rare scordite small pirate gangs roaming powerful enough to kill an unexpecting and poorly equiped venture09 same maybe a bit more concentrated veldspar and scordite08 same as 09 some rare condensed scordite07 add some dense veldspar and rarely massive scordite pirates are stronger lonely ventures can not survive long need to group for protection maybe implement a system that gives the opportunity to frigates pirate oriented players to freely shoot someone only getting the suspicious tag only in belts06 same add plagioclase and the occasional azure plagioclase more roids rats now attack with the occasional destroyers even small parties are at risk05 same now pvp pirates players do not suffer any tag and anyone can shoot anyone freely in a roid belt only place where you can find rich plagioclasethoughts

i get it he wants to take away nullsecs abilitity to generate income  give it to highsec mission runners instead
i thought it was clear that i would remove bounty and increase lpthe point would be to not remove barriers of entry but have some loop holes through itwhile i am bitinghigh sec dont need boosting it needs fixing null sec is what needs a boost but not a monopoly oriented one
so then add as part of the tutorial and all new players get reasonable insurance quotes from the npc corps
you still havent come up with an explanation as why removing insurance is a great idea  how it could be replaced by the players
you never asked
its the whole point of a proposal  what separates a proposal from a bad post
ignore the fact thats called insurance its really just a pvp subsidy so that people without shedloads of isk will continue to get blown upalso y u trollin again
because there is absolutely no way at all that an autoblocking feature wouldnt block people who had nothing to do with jita bot spam you would end up with pretty much everyone in your block list i also dont agree with account blocking if its going to tell you the persons account name actually i dont agree with account blocking at all
could you elaborate why you think it is a bad idea at all personally i dont care if it actually tells me the account name so i would be fine if it did not give out that information and just showed the character names as normal
because proposal is too mainstream 3first of all be indulgent with my english as im french and i just woke up yeah yeah who cares just tell your noobish ideas alreadyfrom what i already read in the forum most players want more interaction between their own characters some kind of meeting point in every station to walk around with some neat features while thats quite cool i believe we should be more ambitiouswhy not implement the possibility of walking in your own ship and create some interaction with your crew even for the frigateclass there should be at least 1520 npcs just to operate the vessel of course not every one of them should be interactive there will be key roles quartermaster engine operator second in command if you played me or ftl you can relate to this in some extent being efficient in your interaction should be very important as it can make you win or lose fightsin the same idea players could board other players ships in station and help command the ship of their friendsanother idea that i have would be to implement maintenance costs to the ship like paying for fuel maintain guns keep food reserves

i have to say the dynamic music system we have now is ok in a sense it gives an accurate sense of fitting for example when entering lowsec or a wh music suddenly changes to a more fitting one remembering where you arehowever it turns itself to be annoying when travelling around in the same type of space lets say highsec and music changes apparently randomly every 2 systems right when i am enjoying the song sometimes its even more bizarre logging in with a certain song and then changing just seconds after seeing my docked ship moreover while all songs are great including the new wh00 ones you can end up tired of being forced to hear the same ones over and over again having to change space type to hear something different even a quick wh trip ends up to be boring in that sense i prefer not to imagine living there or in nullsecid vote for being able to enable the old jukebox or the new one at will from game settings so you can hear the song you want or keeping the locationsensible mode active whenever you want oh and please add the new wh00 themes to the old jukebox

i dont think the op knows how the plex selling system works ingame if he did he wouldnt have made this ridiculous threadsummary of eves last four expansions
let me translate that for you into englishso swiping your real life cash everytime you lose a ship takes the edge of an encounter did your brain logic have some polarity reversal or something
see what happened you got trolled by rl poor ppl who play internet spaceship game for free some ppl are rl rich theyre known here in eve as noobs others are rl poor known as 1337 vets here bums make fun of normal ppl dont take that away from them
people who buy plex help pay for the free icecream ccp hands out to you every monthin world of tanks newbcake schoolkids moan about people with jobs buying lowes to make ingame credits but they cant bend their little minds around the fact that those premium tank buyers are paying for their free gameplay selling plex officially also makes gold farmers cry and encourages them to go pollute other mmos 
its called the power of insert number here as advertised by ccpworking as intended
it sounds like youre suggesting making belts in 05 system essentially nullsec pockets where anyone can attack you and the only consequences for such an action are the consequences you can inflict upon them the reality is the belt system already functions similar to this 10  05 increasing belt worth decreasing concord response time to criminal actions 01  04 theoretically increasing belt worth although not in practice no concord response to criminal actions limited protection on gates and stations from sentry guns 00 best belts lawless the problems are a belt valuesec status gradient needs rebalancing b mining is generally a loweffort activity while npcs do become more potent with lower sec status its the risk of assault from other players that poses the most threat to you and that threat is binary in nature extreme threat if a neutral is present and no threat if they are not there is no real gradient to playerinduced danger on an individual the gradient doesnt exist until you examine gang vs gang
 thisplease just stop posting op get a little experience under your belt first before suggesting major game changessummary of eves last four expansions
uhm no grumpy cat
eve feels small enough as it is it doesnt need any help getting smaller
i like the ideaevery time i go to jita 4 i see a huge number of ships all in each others way exiting the station a busy spaceport like this probably whould benefit from having multiple number of exits and such the look of the station isnt a big thing for me as such but it seems reasonable that the busyest trade hub ingame whould have a more extravagant look than others
just because your entire corporation is full of ridiculously cowardly carebears who will scatter at the sight of a single other player does not mean that other player and what hes doing is overpowered it just means youre cowards and have no right to the nullsec space youre claimingman up or go to highsec
currently i am running my own corporation and alliance in null sec the corporation itself is very new player friendly and tried to encourage new players to get involved in null sec activities but one of the biggest problems that i have noticed is while yes they can loot and salvage behind more experienced players or rat in groups when the corporation is quiet there is nothing for them to dolets say we have a player whos only been playing for 3 days and can only fly a frigate hes on during the quieter times when not many people are around what can heshe do the anomolies will tear him to pieces even the lowest null sec anoms like a hidden den the belt rats those too he cant mine because of said rats toowhat i would like to see is not a change in the anomolies themselves but adding in the high sec anoms such as hideaways burrows and refuges having these anomolies in the null sec anom list would give new players something they can actually do on their own while being part of a group as a wholeso tldrweek old players cant run null sec anoms soloadd hideaways burrows and refuges to the null sec anoms listit will encourage more players to get into null sec and allianceswhat do you lot think of the idea
currently players in highsec are abusing corp mechanics to avoid wardecs  if they get a wardec they leave corp or disband it and then reform it btw james315 also uses this mechanism to grief miners who wardec his one man holding corp  heh i suggest that leaving a corp during a wardec should result in every one of your opponents getting a free one month killrightdisbanding a corp during a wardec should result in the sameforming a corp should not be something a player does lightly if you just want a social group ingame make a chat channel 
why i mean what do you think this would achieve  aside from locking people into a way they cant win i mean do you expect this will suddenly make them change their behavior and come out to fightor more likely will they simply log into their alts in an alt corporation and continue to ignore the wardecthe risk averse are not going to suddenly manup and start undocking to fight if they wanted to fight theyd be fighting without any extra incentives all your proposal will seemingly do is make alt characters in alt corps standard issue for any corporation that wants to avoid wardecsalso they arent abusing the mechanics  theyre using them in the way ccp has stated time and time again they are allowed to use them so if you want to blame someone blame the guys with the rule book
they can either fight  or they can hide either is fine not being able to use your main for a month is a fitting punishment for someone who is completely risk aversebut they should not be able to just walk away from a wardec without consequencesand yes this behavior is currently allowed proposing a game change is the correct way to fix this
yawnkick everyone reform lol  decerscant kickkillright still generatedsweet recruit players wardec corp with alt kick everyoneenjoy 30d of free pew pewexcept then people would be even less inclined to join corps which is counterproductive to ccp goalsnext
i like it
personally i like achievements i find them funny and motivating even though theyre nothing else than a tag as long as they dont modify game mechanics and encourage people to try more things why not
id like to add in to this proposal if i maywe should also receive an audible alarm when our drones initially start to take damagewhen a drone is taking damage it should flash red in the drone control window in the same way players in the watch list window flash red when they start taking damagesummary of eves last four expansions
thumbs up for this more drone transparency this will make droneboats more manageable and using drones allaround more fun and meaningful a lot of feedback from what happens to your drones is missing and for gods sake make a hotkey for mining drones mine repeatedly
i agree with this many times ive missed my drones where being damaged because i only have a little screen which i have to expand several times and my camera to notice theyre being attacked and im not a drone boat user i hope this and other drone issues are being improved in the next expansio or major update
a few cloaked afk ships cannot shut down an entire constellation they cannot in fact do anything no modules can be activated while cloaked no actions can be taken while afk they cannot shut down anything the only people who can shut down the constellation are the residentsalso what kind of imbecilic world do you live in where suggesting corporationsalliances in nullsec have defense fleets is nothing more than troll statementsgo back to highsec little bear
well thats a decent start thank you for having the human decency for doing thatnononodid you not read any of the old threads when you used the search tooli had such high hopes for this one
only time will tell unfortunatelyo cellydont mistake fact for arrogance supposition for fact or disagreement for dismissal perception is unique in that it can be shared or singular run with the pack if you wish but think for yourself a sandwich can be a great motivator
in some ways pos warfare was superiorlarge alliances rarely fought over their space until the bitter end  more often than not if the defender lost too many fights early in the conquest they would implode and try to evac what they could this left swathes of space ready to be taken by the agresssorstarbases claiming sov would eventually run out of fuel meaning they could be rather quickly destroyed without the protection of hardeners and the delay of a reinforcement timerhowever under dominion sov structures take no effort to maintain aside from ensuring the autopay button is clicked and many alliances would rather keep paying for their former space simply to make the victors grind through multiple reinforcement timers whats more these structures automatically regenerate their shield in around 7 hours and dont need manual intervention to replace stront and restore the reinf timer therefore its quite easy to inflict a constant dull structure grind on a victorious opponent with next to no effort or risk at all this is bad gameplay pure and simpleand of course there was also the option to kite towers bringing subsequent battles into more dubious timezones for attackers able to put that effort in no such luck in dominion reinforcement timers are so safe and secure that crosstimezone wars become pointless dominion was an abortion of an expansion that gave us a halffinished sovereignty system which not only failed to fix the flaws of its predecessor but in many respects also magnified those flaws what we need is a system that allows sov to be affected by a larger variety of factors not all of which are boring structure shoots
buying plex does benefit those who do the real world grind for money if thats how they choose to spend it arguably eves real time skill system also benefits those with other commitments i have no problem with it and given the average eve player is an older gamer i think its a good match
let them buy their plex they are too stupid to actually make that isk them selves people who arent lazy or too stupid will continue to make more isk and play the game for nothingalso form a business perspective during these times plex is a very clever idea it helps ccp continue to pay its staff even with the trouble with the banks in iceland and the rest of the world
my personal opinion is that eve should be a freeforalli recognize that the logical consequence of unrestricted warfare is that the strong will prey on the weakthe goals of war in both eve and in reallife are to disarm the enemy and to enforce political goals to varying degrees this can involve to varying degrees the destruction of armies the invasion of territory and the breaking of the enemys will warfare in highsec whether concord sanctioned or not involves the destruction of enemy assets and the destruction of the enemys will to fight due to game mechanics territory control in highsec is a dubious goali take it for my premise that the main complaints about highsec violence chiefly revolve around the fact that most highsec residents especially primarily pve players have no desire will or ability to fight against aggressors with both the will and capability to conduct war unprepared defenders never stand a chance some highsec wars seem to be stalemates or cases where the aggressor does not continue the war and the defender does not make the war mutual id argue that the statistical majority of these cases are events where wardec evasion in the form of defending members dropping their corporation and reorganize in holding corporations and other forms of social gatherings and making use of the game mechanics to generally avoid war in some instances it may well be that the aggressor does not have the capacity to overcome the defenders in which case the most logical course of action for the aggressor would be to stop the warthe only case where a highsec defender would suffer any meaningful loss from attempting to evade a wardec would be if there are substantial corp assets such as poses and expensive officeshighsec warfare in eve is as all warfare conducted for political reasons in the most extreme form of war the goal would be the destruction of organizations and the disbandment of a gathering of players just as in the most extreme forms of nullsec or reallife war the goal would be the annihilation of the opposing political body limited forms of war in highsec would involve the destruction of assets be it ships or structures it can also involve the containment or the erosion of the enemys capabilities by inhibiting income generating activities or recruitmentthe primary reaction of players who avoid war is denial they never wanted to be in a situation where they could suffer loss they are often outraged that another party would have the nerve to interfere with their activities as a result they do not respond to war as a form of social intercourse where one party being unable to fight would be forced to treat or surrender rather they try to ignore the problem and use every game mechanic available or even metagame appeals to gamemasters to avoid conflictthe tension between those who desire to force aggression on others and those who seek to avoid or rather ignore conflict at any cost is often seen as a social problem in eve as a problem between solo or antisocial players who only want activities be it pvp or pve at their own pace and those who in my opinion rightfully insist on full interaction between all playersripard teg for example compared unrestricted aggression between players and groups of players as highlevel players being allowed to crush lowlevel players many critics of this view would dismiss the notion of distinguishing players or corporations as being higher level or lower level because eve online contains no clear inbuilt indicators of playerprogression or skill the social and realism aspects of the game makes mechanics like skillpoints less decisive or rather a poor indicator in determining an individuals or groups capabilities and performance in the game i propose that the difference between the performance of players and groups of players in eve online rests entirely in the metagame organization strategy and psychology are more often the defining factors of a groups abilities rather than the actual ships and modules that the game mechanics empower them to use for this reason it is impossible to implement any game mechanics that measure groups but based on cursory estimates of the disposition of groups of players it is still easy to tell the outcome of any conflictif some organizations are indisputably stronger than other organizations should they then be allowed to aggress weaker organisations in highsec proponents of aggression would argue that nature must run its course in eve the strong will survive those with the will to build strong organizations will prosper opponents of unrestricted highsec aggression will argue that this would lead the the annihilation of the weak which to them is a bad thing some go on to say that players with no desire to fight being forced into conflict will result in the loss of subscription revenue which would be a bad thing for ccp in fact entire arguments are formed around the gain and loss of subscription revenue the main problem with an argument revolving around subscription revenues is that it assumes that ccps best course of action for the game is to capture as diverse a player base as possible they would go on to say that low and nullsec are pvp outlets for players and that highsec should be a place for pve players to play in peacei believe that the essence of warfare and combat in eve is the ability to pursue the conflict to decisive endscontinued
continuedi believe that the essence of warfare and combat in eve is the ability to pursue the conflict to decisive ends anything else would turn eve into a sports game with pvp as an outlet for aggression and pretty player explosions pvp in eve is not a contest as a starcraft match is a contest but rather war in eve is a form of politics one group exerting its will on another through forcesuicide ganking is another story more on that laterthe questionnaire is here

uh thanks for the responses i didnt intend it to be a questionaire theyre just guiding questions and comments that i put down while thinking the issue through and i just happen to do my thinking in a resolution format
ganking and wardecs need to be made easier and more fun theyve piled on nerf after nerf to them over the years but why the main draw of eve is how open it is and basically how much of an arse you can be they used to promote such things in the bloody trailers i mean no one joins up to eve because of the pve  at least in other mmos the pve is colourful and varied in eve its red crosses on a spreadsheet
made a proper survey form to get some scientific data i hope to see responses from all sorts of players

thanks for taking the time to write a long answeranyone who does not want to write me an essay should use the multiple choice questionnaire i hope to see some carebear responses in there too
1 who should be suicide ganking in highsecanybody who can or wants to2 who should be ganked in highsecanybody that others want to gank3 why should these people gank and be ganked highsec especially when economic considerations are disregarded by the aggressorsif people make themselves victims by the way they play then they should be treated as such by those who are predators3a should wardecs exist outside of rvb and giant nullcoalitions settling scores in trade hubsdefinitely war decs are a way to inflict both psychological and economic warfare on others4 considering that many people avoid pvp like the plague and the prevalence of dec avoidanceemphatically yes were playing eve precisely because its not a copy of every other mmo out there5 considering that anyone with half a brainstem would commit aggression when there are favourable chances of winningonce again emphatically yes6 noting the outrage over the infanticide of vulnerable corporations and alliancesif vulnerable corps and alliances were immune to war decs then they would become the norm and thats not good for eve as a game or an idea its up to corporations and alliances to organise themselves so that they arent vulnerable not ccp7 who should be deccing whomanybody who feels that they have a reason to just for lols or because they can8 why should they be in wardecs in a structureless sovless highsec does there even need to be a reasonhighsec isnt absolute safety and neither should it be war is a natural progression that is encouraged by the single shard and the competitive nature of the game9 stronger corporations and alliances should not be able to harm weaker corporations and alliances in highsec i assume that noone would even consider this notion in low or nullsec but is this statement valid in highsecno see my answer to 69b if a nullsec entity launches a vicious propaganda campaign against another nullsec entity noone really caresbut a highsec entity launches a vicious military and psychological campaign against a weaker highsec entity and this is called bullying griefing newplayer and newcorp infanticide etctoo many people think that highsec should be safe they need to have that illusion broken as soon as possible eve is a competitive game no one should be immune to unwanted aggression10 does a new player have a right to avoid pvp in highsec does this only apply in rookie systemsno while in a rookie system they are technically in nursery school and pretty safe the moment they leave rookie systems they are valid targets if they never experience pvp they never learn from the experience11 considering statement 10 does a new corporation have the right to avoid pvp in highsec no a new corporation becomes a valid pvp target the moment it is formed npc corps already fill the role of corporations that are for all intents and purposes immune to pvp although thats not necessarily a good thing people who are pvp averse gather in npc corps and use them as a decshield it gives them the ability to affect others without others being able to overly affect them11b if we consider corporations that are newbie friendly or that brand themselves as places for new players to learn the game does this or should this affect the ethics of wardecsno newbie friendly corps and teaching corps such as eveuni should be teaching their members to protect themselves from predators if they fail to do so then they arent newbie friendly or teaching corps theyre just terrible corpsall this considered what is the future of highsec aggression12 considering that highsec aggression in the form of predatory wardecs and suicide ganking is not a violation of the eula although it is seen as and popularly labeled as griefinggriefing is defined by ccp what players think is griefing is irrelevant no matter what other games have taught them about what is and what is not acceptable13 also considering that many concessions have been made to the pacifist community in the form of mining barge buffs and the permissibility of wardec evasionsthe mining barge ehp buffs werent needed a tanked prebuff barge was already unprofitable to gank for the most part as it is the current barges are unbalanced the mackinaw is king of the hill for the afk14 and bearing in mind that a statistical majority of characters accumulate their wealth in highsecmost nullsec players have isk making alts in highsec because the industry balance is skewed badly in favour of highsec player owned stations should be better for industry than npc owned ones15 should we be encouraging or discouraging highsec aggressionwe should be encouraging more people to shoot at each other in highsec destruction drives the economy and it drives the player run stories15b and to what extentas much as possible crank it all the way up16 harsh competition in highsec costs us subscription revenue  does this warrant any interference with highsec aggression would the game be better if highsec was a less competitive environment emphatically no to both questions ccp have stated in the past that they see themselves as janitors therefore they should not interfere unless something is broken eve is a niche game catering to the lowest common denominator would kill the game and the ideal that ccp set out to achieve its not meant to be a copy of every other mmo that just happens to be set in space its meant to be a representation of an alternate reality where the protagonists are immortal and where warfare is just another way of doing business17 would the game be better or worse if there was more prevalence of highsec aggressionit would be better despite the amount of anguish it would generate from players whove come from lesser games
thanks for the well thought through response jonah the statements in the first post are just a photocopy of my thoughts if you want to write an essay you can use whatever structure or style you wish but im glad if you find my comments usefulin other news ive finally gotten carebear responses keep em coming
1 who should be suicide ganking in highsec anyone who wants to 2 who should be ganked in highsec anyone the gankers deem a worthy target for whatever reasons they have come up with for that worth 3 why should these people gank and be ganked highsec especially when economic considerations are disregarded by the aggressors crazy loot in the cargohold running their mouth target of a merc contract posting surveys on the forums etc should wardecs exist outside of rvb and giant nullcoalitions settling scores in trade hubs absolutely 4 considering that many people avoid pvp like the plague and the prevalence of dec avoidance with very few exceptions everything you do in this game indirectly or directly competes with another pilot typically through economic means as such they should always be subject to shiptoship pvp which is the most direct form of competition in game while i fully support the idea there is a time to fight and a time to run i firmly believe that the simplicity of war dec avoidance is simply broken there should be a mechanism that ultimately encourages you to operate under the dangers presented by the wardec rather than simply remove yourself from danger 5 considering that anyone with half a brainstem would commit aggression when there are favourable chances of winning winning how do you define winning is it wiping out your enemy ships and salvaging the field is it destroying more isk than you lose is it cockblocking your opponent is it getting your opponent to disband is it surviving hardening up learning new things trying out a new tactic or simply enjoying your time playing we are all stuck on the standard gaming concept that winning is not suffering loses be it stuff lives etc but in a game where you respawn indefinitely where you can accrue as much resources as you desire winning is ambiguous enough that both sides can fight and both sides can win simultaneously in short yes 6 noting the outrage over the infanticide of vulnerable corporations and alliances the need to htfu adapt or go npc 7 who should be deccing whom anyone and everyone 8 why should they be in wardecs in a structureless sovless highsec does there even need to be a reason settle scores drive off the other guys stake a claim as best as possible to a system etc  you do bring up a good point with this question highsec needs more vulnerable assets this will encourage more conflict both for offense and defense 9 stronger corporations and alliances should not be able to harm weaker corporations and alliances in highsec i assume that noone would even consider this notion in low or nullsec but is this statement valid in highsec that statement is ridiculous no matter the sec status 9b if a nullsec entity launches a vicious propaganda campaign against another nullsec entity noone really caresbut a highsec entity launches a vicious military and psychological campaign against a weaker highsec entity and this is called bullying griefing newplayer and newcorp infanticide etc bullying a corp does not equate to bullying a person if you make a corp it is subjected to being bullied accept it 10 does a new player have a right to avoid pvp in highsec does this only apply in rookie systems no a new player does not have the right to avoid pvp and rookie systems pvp protections are generally a bad thing 11 considering statement 10 does a new corporation have the right to avoid pvp in highsec absolutely no 11b if we consider corporations that are newbie friendly or that brand themselves as places for new players to learn the game does this or should this affect the ethics of wardecs no shielding players against eve for any reason is a bad thing 12 considering that highsec aggression in the form of predatory wardecs and suicide ganking is not a violation of the eula although it is seen as and popularly labeled as griefing suicide ganking a 100 viable tactic it should be encouraged not discouraged all corps should be subject to predatory wars thats the danger in being in a nonnpc corp npc corps should hinder game play more steeper taxes refining taxes market taxes etc 13 also considering that many concessions have been made to the pacifist community in the form of mining barge buffs and the permissibility of wardec evasions the mining barge changes were ok but not quite optimal t1 mining barges should have slightly lower tanks making max yield fits more susceptible to suicide ganking 14 and bearing in mind that a statistical majority of characters accumulate their wealth in highsec conflict is quite often economically motivated if highsec represents the largets economic activity it should be subjected to all forms of conflict 15 should we be encouraging highsec aggression conflict should be allowed to chase the moneyresources anywhere 15b to what extent players should have the opportunity to defend themselves from losses 16 harsh competition in highsec costs us subscription revenue  does this warrant any interference would the game be better if highsec was a less competitive environment no to both 17 would the game be better or worse if there was more prevalence of highsec aggression better conflict drives our economy it creates content and is a good for the game
thisdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
even if there was a time limit you would still complain
what the wormholer saidwhat you experiencing is mostly fear and perceptions created by power projection one way to fight a war in a video game is to convince the enemy they are going to have such a bad time trying to oppose you that they should do something else insteaddeal with it its nullsec after allthough id love to see the same happen in highsec warfare war target in system everyone dock up oh no hes from dt to dt panic
if a noob cant run solo maybe someone could hold his hand while he learns to walk
well so constructive my god what an insperation how about go back to the troll cave were talking about giving new players something they can actually do within their first week of playing
there are things they can do in highsec in fact id much rather more things are added to highsec rather than nullsec because the renting of space in null is causing stagnation and now nobody is fighting but i also kind of agree with you that more things for new players should be added in general
killrights for dropping corp is a bit much but there definitely needs to be some form of penalty or limitationseven if you just extended a 24 hour period in which they were still valid targets while concord sorted the paperwork out id be very happy instantly being free from war decs makes them pointless
joining a corp and creating a corp should be a serious decisionnot something to do for lolsgrief corps would encourage people to research before joining in fact this is a fine idea  the new order should start a special mining division and recruit in the forums and eve universitys job faire thanx
24 hours is too shorta week maybe but i still think a month is required to make corp membership serious business
there should be a corp mechanism that ultimately encourages you to operate under the dangers presented by the wardec rather than simply remove yourself from danger this idea simply makes removing yourself from danger more difficult also who exactly gets the killright the ceo what if they leave an alliance the ceo of the executor corp certainly not everyone in the corpalliance as that would be ridiculous
ramming a capital ship through a fleet of subcaps yeah
i find all your ideas desirable i approve
no pos sov was horrible not that the current mechanic is any better personally i think invaders should only have to anchor maybe 4 sbus which in turn makes a central bunker vulnerable give it the hp of a medium tower with a reenforced timer if the defenders kick the crap out of the invaders they blow up the sbus in less than 24 hrs and the timer stops if your getting steam rolled a system can be lost in a little over a day and a half with minimal grinding that leaves the invaders vulnerable while sbu anchoring and bunker busting gives defenders an additional 24 hrs to get their defense crap together or they loose the system due to real world time zones you cant make taking sov bubba clyde easy or your going to log in after work and find another time zone just rolled you in your sleep but on the other hand not make it so mindnumblingly boring your alliance starts cheering at the prospects of a mining op pos sov falls into the later category no thanks
its looks like a great idea although ive read just a few pagesi think ill read it all a bit later on the ebook 
so when do you plan to upload the pi 30
just reached page 30ogame with graphics  thats what ive thought about while reading the military part cool and the civilian one too i dont want to spend much time on active gameplay will it be ratting or ship pvp so itll be cool to play this game as the caesar to build a big city and make it my main game style without a rush just planning and watching it from my balcony in the command center the very cool thing could be walkingdriving around your city while waiting for somehing to complete and maybe accidently come up with some new idea for the city
i have hopes of publishing it in august 2013
ive just read the part about the social banks and the loansthe loans part is fine but what about the deposits they should exsist together because when you start a bank you dont just giving avay loans from your pocket the main source for loans is the money from the clients deposits loan interest  deposit interest  proffit
oh thats not very soon 
the large xl and capital shipyards on the planet looks a bit strangebecause the battleship or capital ship cant just take off the surface and fly to the orbitthey can be constructed of course but how to deliver them to the orbit after that in the rl theyre launching the large things in space partbypart the repackaged ship looks like a disasembled to the smaller parts to use the cargo space more efficiently but such a large ships can only be transported via freighter which i dont think can land on the planets
the deposits are facilitated by the existing corp wallet payment mechanicsplayers can make direct deposits into the bank by giving isk to the corp wallet the bank is linked to i dont see a reason to formally code an interface for deposits given the existing mechanics in placein terms of actually creating a wallet division for every person who banks with that corporation might prove to be a massive albeit impossible undertaking given some technical limitations but i read some interesting things about hanger revamps with the odyssey expansion so lets wait and see what that pos revamp brings before we start mulling over ideas about delimiting corp wallet divisions maybe the hanger revamp idea could be applied to wallet divisions
getting some great responses including those from carebears hope to see more
1 who should be suicide ganking in highsecanyone willing to accept the consequences2 who should be ganked in highsecanyone deemed a worthy target for any reason3 why should these people gank and be ganked highsec especially when economic considerations are disregarded by the aggressorsif the aggressors are not getting anything out of the gank their target has most likely wronged them in some way it could be an enemys mission alt it could be a competitor if the target is profitable to gank simply because of their cargo or fittings that is acceptable  it is up to you to decide how much you are willing to risk in a single ship and if you show callous disregard for your assets you shouldnt mind being relieved of themshould wardecs exist outside of rvb and giant nullcoalitions settling scores in trade hubsabsolutely nobody should be exempt from wardecs the idea that any new corp that pops up is simply being slaughtered is a work of fiction and hyperbole7 who should be deccing whomanyone should be able to dec anybody it is not up to us to determine who should declare war on whom but to make that option available8 why should they be in wardecs in a structureless sovless highsec does there even need to be a reasonhisec is not structureless because last i checked you can anchor a pos9 stronger corporations and alliances should not be able to harm weaker corporations and alliances in highsec i assume that noone would even consider this notion in low or nullsec but is this statement valid in highsecthat statement is not valid anywhere there is no metric that one can reasonably use to determine organizational strength and implementing any such thing into game mechanics makes it utterly easy for a corpalliance to declare offensive wardecs while avoiding counter wardecs before subbc t1 ships mattered a corp like brave newbies would not stand a chance against groups a tenth their size9b if a nullsec entity launches a vicious propaganda campaign against another nullsec entity noone really caresbut a highsec entity launches a vicious military and psychological campaign against a weaker highsec entity and this is called bullying griefing newplayer and newcorp infanticide etcthis is not bullying or griefing harden the  up this is eve if you and your corp are worth being demonized by another entity you have clearly done something to justify that10 does a new player have a right to avoid pvp in highsec does this only apply in rookie systemsonly in rookie systems and this rule should not be used to allow older players to hide behind the veil of a rookie system for gm protection11 considering statement 10 does a new corporation have the right to avoid pvp in highsec absolutely not11b if we consider corporations that are newbie friendly or that brand themselves as places for new players to learn the game does this or should this affect the ethics of wardecsthe ethics of wardecs are not a ccp policy and should not be if someone declares war on say eve university any consequences they face should be from the uni themselves or from their alliesall this considered what is the future of highsec aggressionthe current problem with wardecs from what i see is that it is too easy to evade wardecs not just for the defenders but for the aggressors if a wardec backfires on you you shouldnt be able to simply turtle up if you get wardecced you have other options to exercise seek allies get your members into cheap ships hello buffed t1 cruisers and harass the aggressors or be creative this is a sandbox for a reason12 considering that highsec aggression in the form of predatory wardecs and suicide ganking is not a violation of the eula although it is seen as and popularly labeled as griefingwhat ccp defines as griefing and what the playerbase define as griefing are two separate concepts and have always been13 also considering that many concessions have been made to the pacifist community in the form of mining barge buffs and the permissibility of wardec evasionswardec evasion should have been made subject to punitive action when they revamped wardecs ccp made that concession and has not retracted it despite making wardecs less onesided with the ability to bring in defenders the barge buff should have enabled the choice between yield or tank to be more meaningful not simply giving them a free tank ccp have shown that they disregard balance when dealing with highsec14 and bearing in mind that a statistical majority of characters accumulate their wealth in highsecthe excess availability of wealth in highsec is one reason why new players are unable to compete there15 should we be encouraging or discouraging highsec aggressionneither this game is not about pushing players away from one activity or towards another it should however be allowed16 harsh competition in highsec costs us subscription revenue  does this warrant any interference with highsec aggression would the game be better if highsec was a less competitive environmentharsh competition in highsec is a result of excessive rewards for veterans being available in highsec compared to pitiful rewards for newbies address the cause not the symptoms ccp is not losing subscription revenue considering that they are gaining players faster than ever as a result of allowing newbies to be more competitive17 would the game be better or worse if there was more prevalence of highsec aggressionhighsec should not be a fragfest like darkfall it should also not be a pvprestricted area there is a balance but we are pushing towards the latter this is unacceptable its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
im getting about 20 carebear responses been asking in the euni and ultrashiny incursion channels
how do you identify carebear responses with that survey just because someone thinks you should be allowed to wardec other corps with impunity does not mean you arent a carebear there are a significant portion of highsec carebears that know how to handle the risks of being wardecced that know how to handle the risks of being suicide ganked and have no difficulty adapting to how these aggressors alter their environment there are also many people that may have tried theft suicide ganking wardecs etc but that doesnt make them not a carebear in short i get the impression your biased in how you categorize pilots
im just using the term in a very broad sense to refer to nonaggressive playersfrom the individual responses i do see quite a few players who wont harm a fly but are more than happy to play in a more aggressive environment
this is true note that some of the loudest voices arguing to nerf highsec aggression out there ripard teg trebor are people that nobody could honestly call carebears just pvpers who happen to prefer the null sec experiencei would be interested in seeing the results of your survey it seems like everybody in this thread is pretty much prohighsec aggression myself included but i am sure that many people out there feel differently the lack of diversity of opinions here is probably pretty good evidence of how few people actually look at this sub forum how can we get more carebear tears in this thread hmmm
results can be viewed here
any news on if ccp decided to assign someone to fix thismake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
youre actually wrong about mining in its current state in the current system its generally lowsec ores  arkonor  highsec ores  other nullsec ores in terms of iskm3 arkonor is about tied with lowsec rocks and you can find lowsec rocks in limited quantities in parts of 00 but not in grav belts and a lot of lowend nullsec ores are completely terrible and worse than highsec despite being the most valuable lowsec is still not worth mining in due to how very small the price increase is over highsec mining income which is probably the best place to mine people have talked about mining changes ad naseum so im not going to reiterate arguments on that just making a small correction to the current state of the gameon the risk of nullsec as a 00 resident id like the punishment of losing your space in nullsec very high not only in losing lucrative opportunityasset locking in station but in losing industrial infrastructure there is also a cost you could define this as an increased risk or decreased reward to be shouldered by the nullsec entity as it engages in defending its holdings to avoid the risks you mention above of course everyone pvps in all areas in space but the stakes need to be raised in nullsec such that people are willing to put fleets on the line to defend their infrastructure where in higher security you are able to avoid a fight that seems too risky by just docking up with no consequencenote that i dont really care to have an argument with people about whether and to what degree nullsec is like the above paragraph now but rather describing how i think nullsec risk should work in a perfect world
i recently described a possible feature and workaround for many of these related issuespersonal division hangarswith a pdh you could let any slot usage behave like personal when used from a corp posthe slots would show up on both corporate and personal list but with cancel rights from ceo onlya few more tweaks would ofc be needed but it does seem to resolve some of thisalso other members could be granted access to the pdh and thus take from that storage and even use private bposif someone has pos slot rights and take rights in the pdh of an active builder that person can also cancel those private jobsnote personal access to pdh to other corp members can be granted by ceo or the pdh owner himselfjust a few ideas that would help many pos issues and station hangar issues
for gods sakethis forum too really learn about the search button feature or try google or since these things appear beyond your comprehension
really so when my rapier is cloaked can it launch fighters can it rep other ships can it transfer energy to another players capthe answers are no no and noseems you just dont understand the games mechanics go learn them then you wont look so ignorant when you post
010 trollconsidering he didnt even need to use the search functionthere was another waaaaaaa cloakers post 7 posts below this one still on the same pagebut since the op cant even manage to operate in a forum correctly how can we expect they can manage to escape the cloaked ship that is more powerful than a carrier where can i buy one of these btwi want one fail troll is fail troll ps when you quit can i have your stuff
a really nice idea would be to add a variation of interbus system so you could move equipment from station to pos when at the station if you had needed rolesthe pos would have rat like convoys that would be owned by pos owner sort of like lostleft drones if shot down the interbus would be impossible until respawnthe remote admin of certain things from station to pos would be nice  but it should be with a connection delay 25 min to initiate contact the need to go manually to the pos should not be removed also you should not be able to move between facilities the remote would send the commands but they would not be initiated until the timer is completed a bit like anchoring so that mechanism is somewhere in the code for reuse i would assume
im a firm believer that we should allow planetary networks to have manufacturing and research slots that can be used from the building types on the networks
i think slots planet side makes perfect sense just now we can not attack planet structures so a balance would be neededbasically like pos modules but with half the effectiveness speed to not compete with pos that risk aggressionthis would make sure stations dont run out of potential slots there would be a need to add fuel of some sort or the benefits would be to high i have suggested elsewhere about changes to pi and adding need for populations like marines laborers and scientists etc using a mechanic similar to over heating work force exhausted labor overworked state that would be fixed importing new labor recreation etc basically creating boostings buffs debuffs mechnicsalso i suggested changing storage limits to pure transport capacity limits so you could work from buffers and would not worry about overflow but only on upgrading the lines and moving manually at a labor over heating cost overtime basically
if you havent already you might want to look at this topic in the assembly hallit covers allot of what your talking about with regards to pi
that is a very nice collection of ideas but really as two step pointed out huge complicated solutions wont really helpsimpler ideas in short presentation that inspire ccp or gives solutions that work somewhat within the current framework and codeif you shorten things down and do smaller part demos i think you would get furtherwhat i just suggested in the above is an example i am asking for things that only need a days work of code change container sizes in pi installations to infinite or very large and put the bottleneck in the launch pad at 25000 m3 this is hardly any change but the potential is hugethen adding a feature that already exist in weapon give it a bit different graphics and change the names again this is very easy the buffdebuff is also already partly in the game and features ccp is already working on boosts from dust is already announced adding a state to an item is not that hard and if its function is basically the same as using nanopaste its hardly extensive codewhat you ask for is the full developer team to create a whole new feature from scratch that rarely happen in any gameyou vision is rather awesome though
the highsec community would adapt to such a change something likeplayers would stay in npc corps and join channels and mailing lists and pay a recurring fee tax to participate in events players would create indyresearch players that sit in highsec poss and do nothing else what benefits does a corp provide in highsec that cant be sidesteppedyou could encourage participation through rewards but that would shift a balanceif a pilot was rewarded for staying in a corp that was wardecced ie rewarded for pvp it would result in even less reasons for pilots to venture into lownull where pvp is a way of life and there are no extra incentives
the problem with all the ideas like this is the carrot and stick problem you have to carefully balance the carrot positive incentives with the stick negative incentives too much carrot results in no one doing anything else but too much stick is just as bad as the players will simply go do something elseyour idea is to be frank all stick all you would do is convince the risk averse players that player corporations are too much trouble and theyd just stay in their npc corps where they dont have to deal with it then youd be back here in a month asking for a nerf for npc corps which will in turn just hurt the new players and drive them out of the gamelets toss the roleplay bs aside for a minute  what the new order is really after is the ability to freely kill noncombatants and thats fine go shoot them but dont act like youre in it for the good of the game when you suggest ideas that make it harder for them to avoid you its biased selfinterest nothing more
we also need kamikaze modules that we can pack with munitions to give our flying bombs more kickand slashers will become the new catalyst
all good theater film and gaming experiences rely on an audiencesparticipants ability to suspend disbelief by removing the jukebox feature and making me go into the real world to manipulate my ambient sound while playing you have substantially diminished my ability to suspend disbelief as a result i enjoy the game less and you as a company provide less value eg when i began a battle in the past the ambient noisemusic automatically changed to let me know i was in a battle i dont want to do this manually because if i do i will no longer feel like i am in a battle but rather that i am in front of a screen i dont want to be in front of a screen i want to be in a space battle
okay are you going to drop this survey in say rancer local or just carebear groupsbecause ill laugh if somebody uses the results of this as a talking point when the groups sampled are incredibly biased one way its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
to be fair i saw that he also advertised this in cp and on wwwminerbumpingcom rancer local could be good though pretty funny comments on there
idea for using aurum in metagame and 3rd party servicesccp creates a well designed metagame portal websiteevelife or something similarthis site hosts different outlets and services like artists video links podcasts etcall these services are created by the players as kickstarter like project pagesthe project then has a donate button this makes you able to directly donate isk to a service or project first is startup and a donation target to start the service when the service is running it show weekly revenues from donations the project creator can then cash in the isk to his character or get aurum that can be used on any character on his account preferably the aurum should also be possible to somehow cash in for real life value but only things from eve products this could be buying keychains etc after such items have left ccp its free for the private person to resell these on something like ebay or to friends fools and familywont this cause a potential competition and loss to ccp revenuesno not really the added value the project holder has created and invested tim ein has more value then any competition basically he is voluntarily donating his time and labor to create content and value to ccp that would directly be linked into the revenue producing plex and subscription economypersonally i believe most projects would cash only in isk because you would need some considerable volume to want to try and convert to any real value in this system also i think a lot would invest in plex for themselves and their affiliates and supportersto mention examples of a recent very impressive labor that would have been very suuited to this model would be xander phoenas crossing zebra candidate interviews he did 28 candidates of about 1 hour each and put in post production and preproduction research to total something around 120 hours total work that is equivalent to almost a months full time effort or 3 weeks at least that means he produced content equivalent to 4000 using icelandic avg salaries you would have to get a lot of donations to be able to extract that value in any way so lets say he got quite a lot of donations maybe 1000 worth of equivalent plex conversion would it not be fair if he could withdraw physical values for say at least half of that this is only the player voluntary donated ones i would say that once a metagame reach a certain consistant level of donations ccp should consider making that persons account a legacy account where no payment to play way needed if traded that status should ofc be lost i think something along this would really make sure some of the players that risk burnout or ragebreaks or real life commitment issues would still feel strongly connected to eve without being able to maintain ingame activity or even keep up metagame productivity
i think its better to make the deposits support bu this bank mechanic too there is a reasons1 the main reason why the people dont invest isk in deposits is that there is no guarantee  its can be yet another scam which is currently working but can be closed anytime with all the money in rl banks there is at least some insurance  if bank is collapsed yll be able to get your deposit back its an only reason to keep the money there  the lowest  in the world its hardly a incomewell its kinda hard to do such insurance in eve but there is at least can be a mechanism to prevent an obvious scams2 i was thinking about an opening some project like that when ill have more time for game but what stopped me is that whenif ill have many customers ill spend all of my time just checking the isk transfers well with crest i think itll be easier
just finished readingits the first time i see such a detailed proposalaltough i can argue with a few things the whole idea is great i think id made it my main profession in eve along with the current mining and industrythe strong part of it is that there is a wis elements im still looking forward to the avatar gameplay although there is no reason for any hopesthe skills are cool too a lot to train and this is good  the current pi are nothing without an alts so its not my typewell good luck with that are there were any comments from ccp about this
1 anyone with the will and means to do so its a sandbox2 anyone who makes themselves an obvious target especially while wardecced bonus points for people who make themselves look juicy to bait gankers into failing at ganks3for the gankers the fact that its a sandbox for the gankees of the subset who i declared should be ganked its because the consequence of protecting capsuleers from their folly is to fill new eden with foolsshould wardecs exist outside of rvb and giant nullcoalitions settling scores in trade hubsyes sand box4aaaaaand now youre using leading questions thus cheapening the survey and skewing the results which in turn makes it easier for nuuuuu no ganks evar whiners to point to your skewed methodology and shout you down stop that5 a statement which assumes there are no other concerns behind aggressive action that whether or not you can win which is wrong also see 4s statement about leading questions6this would be much less of a problem if the ingame resources properly explained both the advantages and disadvantages to being in a playerowned corp instead of cheerfully telling inexperienced eggers that its a great idea to leave the undeccability of their npc corps to enter into a much more vulnerable state that they dont fully understand yet also why would you add a leading question that leads in the opposite direction from where the others were leading7people out for fights should dec people similarly out for fights people out for easy kills should dec the weak and the weak should mob up to counterdec and crush the people trying to prey on them dont get mad get even8 it sounds like fun should be reason enough by extension we need a mindset among juicylooking highseccers that it sounds like fun to crush those who would seek to prey upon you drive them from the grid and hear the lamentations of their insurers9 nope9b its almost like the the people being targeted by psychological and political campaigns are responding with psychological and political campaigns gasp10rookie systems should remain gankfree as they are tutorials should explain how to not be a juicy target for gankers or how to look like a softer target than you are so you can laugh as gankers fail their attempts and get nuked by the cops the remaining umpteen squillion highsec systems should remain places where ganking can and will happen11 see my answer to 6  the thing that needs to be done is for the game to include a proper explanation of the risks as well as the rewards of going playercorp11bnope treating this as an ethical concern would raise an easy opportunity for corps to label themselves as newplayerfriendly or whatever for a cheap easy shift in public opinion euni already does it ffsall this considered what is the future of highsec aggressionif proper ingame explanations of the risks of being in a playerrun corp are implemented i expect to see the supply of easy targets drying up leading to a general reduction in highsec aggression outside of suicide ganking12 once again leading questions see also my answer to 9b  what goes for the goose goes for the gander including swaying public opinion by decrying the people who give you trouble13 wardec evasion is the counter to wardecs the counter to wardec evasion by extension is to insure some cheapfit tier 3 bcs and go suicide ganking also leading question14 people keep their wealth in highsec because thats where its easiest to get to their wealth and they earn their wealth in highsec because thats the easiest way to get their wealth to highsec no point getting yourself a ton of cool ships if you can never reach them to get into the cockpit after all15 neither what we should be doing is making good information about risks available to newkids  partially to educate the ones who were just uneducated and partially to tell the ones who knew and tried anyways that you knew the risks now htfu or stfu15b we need information information information in other news i am the new number two dont ask of what16 ahahahahahahahahaha no anything that draws one group of people will repel other groups of people increasing the games friendliness to carebears such as myself will in turn lead to the people who like shooting at us looking for another game17 worse for some better for others who the some are and who the others are depends on what sort of aggression is spiking  i would love to see more oncepeaceful highseccers lay their vengeance upon aggressors mainly because it would sort out weakwilled givemeeasykills whiners from the people with the actual will to fight
that survey result is full of it note how half the ppl have been playing for more than 3 years then consider the average player retention rate in eve is 6 months its safe to say if what these ppl wants goes retention rate will be even less than 6 months

right its not legalizing crime to prevent crime besides that though buying plex from ccp directly with ingame money hurts the game since your not paying them a subsciption for every plex you buy from another player ccp has made almost 20 usd compared to the 15 for a recurring subscription it also helps the playerbase do you know how many people buy plex from other players because they cant afford an account alot plex allows those people to have someone else buy their gametime for them with isk being given as compansationthankyounot to mention is ccp accepted the isk directly for gametime it would royally break plex because ccp would constantly have to redo the price to compensate for average player income so they dont go broke read as making sure almost no one can realistically afford it right now plex is balanced because depending on the marketeconomy they can range from anywhere between 400750milof course theres also the basic rmt prevention and that every dollar someone spends on ccp instead of a chinese golffarmer gets put right back into eve to help fund those two free yearly expansions
first of all let me bow down to your obvious collective forum warrior superiority but alas i do not care about the forums much so please let a rambling buffoon speak for a momentalso i have to state right now that i do not partake in faction warfare which my suggestion is regarding i am a naughty pirate i am somewhat interested in getting involved in it but in its current state it has put me off somewhatmy idea is somewhat multifaceted and would be something of a major overhaul from ccps perspective but i think there might be some potential what i am proposing is that the current broken system be changed into a mixture of exploration and its subsequent miniprofessions and incursions in a manner of speakingbefore you obvious trolls start bashing let me continue i will admit that this is a rough draft and not a complete proposal so there may be areas that ive missed or arent complete if you find any please at least try expand on my post in other words if you dont have anything constructive to say please be quiet the first and most obvious part is that all sites are similar in style to incursions to run ranging from the scouts to the headquarter class sites in principle as in the number of people required to run them though not to the same degree perhaps these require different systems or maybe there can have a mixture of classes in the same system thats open to discussion the real change is that these sites require scanning down and these sites also do not have acceleration gates completion of these sites yields lps and influences the system control much like in incursions once this influence is completely down a final site is ran like the mother ship site to transfer sovereignty over to the attacking faction during this time though the defending factions influence aka sov regenerates a certain amount over time thus requiring a maintained presenceso you what that didnt make sense attackers have to continuously probe down sites and run them to attack the sovereignty lp gains for completion of sites defenders simply have to do what it says in the tin defend their space ie kill the attackers lp gains for successfully defending a site as in once a site has been started prevent the attacking forces from completing it within a particular time frame where it despawns rewards in the form of lp gains this would need fine tuning for balance  exploiting purposes acceleration gates are removed to increase the riskand to promote pvp the longer a certain faction holds sov the faster sites spawn incentive for the attackers where as the defenders receive different benefits i dont want to go down the same penalties as incursions though perhaps the current sov mechanic regarding dockingclones etc is sufficienti had considered that the lack of gates means things like cynos and capitals appearing in the sites initially i thought this would be a problem but the more i thought about it i dont believe it would be too much of a problem because those capitals would attract attention and fights would escalate as a resulti have tried to predict with a mechanic like this how these risk averse fw lp farmers would behave to be honest i cant imagine the behaviour changing much in the grand scheme of things but at least there is a greater element of risk since you cant stab up cloak up and afk the site to farm those lpsanother area of concern with this proposal i can see is how these sites scale for obvious reasons you want to keep the entry level low so that there is content for everyone yet scaling the difficulty in the higher tiers to promote cooperation and fleet composition for the sake of examples how about the followingscouts achievable in 23 man groups designed for frigatesvanguards achievable in groups of 56 designed for cruisers assault achievable in groups of 1015 designed for mixture of cruisers  battlecruisersheadquarter achievable in groups of 1620 designed for a mixture of cruisers battlecruisers and battleshipsi have given samples here but the thing thats important here is that all of these should be achievable with tech 1 ships and there also needs to be a way to encourage people to fill various roles though i assume that could be achieved with the use of allowing npcs ewar capability
everyone is probably familiar with the sansha incursions that pop up across space how they spawn communities and drama drop bpcs for sansha ships and loot and otherwise act like as the high end of reliable group pve play well the fluff lore storylines player rp etc doesnt seem to have any single reason why only sanshas nation engages in these mass raids of top tier npc ships to be opposed by mercenary capsuleers funded by concord these make little sense and also have no option for pirates or other enemies of the npc empiressuggested changes and features1 why not include other factions launching incursions with mostly pirate incursions happening in high sec empire incursions that gain lp with pirate factions added in lowsec and both varieties in null sec2 if the spawn conditions for the constellations were tweaked slightly on a faction by faction basis it would also increase the number of incursions spawned in space other than amarr fairly rapidly3 also use incursions as a way to temporarily modify the rules of space so you have lowsec with functioning police occasionally if there is a concord pacification expedition in a given lowsec area or a highsec area without as a high influence pirate incursion4 use the expanded incursions to then seed limited runs of pirate or empire faction ships to be put through real world test as a ship with a limited but unknown number in the game world has a limited lifespan as a usable ship type for any combat activity examples empire faction battlecruisers seeded in assault and hq sites from empire incursionspros1 increased immersion and player choice2 more requirements for different fittings tactics and such to balance the high iskhour of the established incursion communities3 ability to add new content in a manner which makes sense in universe while limiting long term problems if a feature4 more accessibility to incursions for enemies of the amarr5 added realism and fill gaps in the lore ability to run semihot war as well as the factional warfare proxy warcons1 more space open to being interupted by incursions2 more requirements for different fittings tactics and such act as high barrier to entry for newer players3 more complex code for incursion spawns and many more hotdropped threadnaughts about incursion spawn mechanics and mom politics
i think these threads are just part of an elaborate bot we all know that the only people who complain about cloakers in their system are people who run farming bots maybe the bots have been upgraded to spew drivel on the forums demanding the removal or nerfing of cloaks
prior to this weekend a collection of scripts had been introduced by a member of the goons as well as by trebor that allowed block voting to be done if you trusted andor blindly choose to follow either one of those scripts it allowed a simple one click approach to voting that ensured block voting on a massive scale for some reason a member of ccps staff decided to first introduce some sort of work around that disabled the scripts from working  forcing you back to a blank voting form there was no information put out that these things would be interrupted they were simply made unusable and changes made to the voting site that corrected and point of fact did make the process easier but not as easy as it could have been most things done on an alliance level are automated these days because its the only way to manage organizations with thousands of members so why not voting they still have to click the button to submit their votesdiscussion  why was it deemed necessary to implement these changes and does this not show that once again ccp is refusing to communicate unilateral changes to their playerbase
it seems that ccp is continuing to quietly manipulate csm politics from behind the curtain of course they want the nonblock and least vocal candidates to be elected because it will make their lives easier over the coming year it is becoming obvious that those who manage the election have their own agenda
that is my fear as well i understand the desire on ccps part that not want an entrenched politico environment as part of the csm as they would be in a better position to expose the gaming community to the happenings within the company but this just smacks of blatant election tampering to me
political assassination anyone i guess 4 years of outspoken criticism from trebor was enough for ccp to deal with
easy is not always good a huge part of the political process is motivating potential voters to vote the script has three negatives 1 its not available to everyone the script makes voting very simple taking the decision efforts completely out of the picture this really disenfranchises the nonblock candidates because they not only have the blocksupport system they have to compete with the evemadeeasy mode 2 the script not only makes things easy but guarantees how people vote when they use it lets say your block gets 2000 voters if they have to manually enter votes a huge portion of them will alter the order of the list will omit names of people they dislike not bother filling out the entire list and will make plenty of personal changes that ultimately improve the democratic process while undermining much of the powerblocks potency 3 if the three largest coalitions in the game came to a consensus on who should be on the list and had all their members oneclick vote for all candidates they essentially game the system and insert only their desired candidates and lets be frank coalition politics are way too much bathroom stall you scratch my back ill blow you politicking i dont think thats the most kosherhealthiest way to populate the csm
incorrect actually the ability to create your own block was made publicly available you simply typed in the name of the candidates and hit submit the link could then be shared with anyone you make the exact point of why this was a good thing for powerblocks the script also did not block any possibility of changing your votes the csm is there to directly represent a huge portion of players if the largest collection of players in mass decide on xyz candidate then that is in fact the best choice for them talking about blow jobs and sucking each others dicks dont really have a place in the discussion but its nice to know where your minds at
how is this any different then the csm vote match site which is designed explicitly for people who havent been paying attention at least the script has full transparency for all we know the people behind the vote match site could be manipulating the data to steer people into voting for the candidates that they prefer
my ignorance shows this should be publicized by ccp so people know its out there then if they allow it pages like this aleks endorsement of the csm candidates could then have the link at the bottom too good for power blocks does not mean good for the game balance is what is truly needed both in terms of politicking as well as in terms of game mechanics if most forums had a discussion section listing the pros  cons of candidates and put a link on the bottom with their order id be completely down for it however i feel with the current voting system the csm votes will become a bargaining chip eventually turning the csm voting process into a game of diplomacy between eve power blocks i dont think this is a favorable outcome as it eliminates many of the grassroots candidates that often represent a sizeable yet uncoordinated playbase the script isnt central to the issue although i fear it will help exacerbate it
if the script autoappeared on the bottom of the votematch site then it would be much more reasonable and it sounds like it can as for bias in the votematch site im sure it exists
fun fact 85 of eve playerbase is in highsec thats the 85 that dont vote unless if its one click ccp put out your fire before you burnt yourself wheres the gratitude
if you cant fill out your own ballot you shouldnt be voting this is a stupid topic
hello derp herp pod my suggestion is simpleunlock the training skill on a second character from the same account after x monthsyears of subscriptionfor exampletotal of 5 years subscription the second slots is unlocked and can be trainedtotal of 10 years subscription the third slots is unlocked and can be trainedull make your players happy and addict enjoy 
noterrible ideayou do realize that you can train a character on slot two or three any time you wantjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
thisdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
show me another game where you can train multiple characters on the same account at the same time
i have a ringtone of you yelling at someone that scammed you
keep this post on topic as the forum rules state
so long as they dont replace the current anoms i dont see why not more stuff for new players to do by themselves is never a bad thing
just small and very simple solution to information streamswhy not add a pane on all item info that can load info by a search done by server on evewikiit could just be a button the takes your ingame browser to the wiki entry or something fancieran added epic feature would be letting wiki edits be done directly using game client credentialsmaybe control abuse by needing an ingame skill
there is one thing that would be exceptionally handy is an option to allow the 3d stellar map to ever so slowly rotate or have a wobble cycle ive noticed i get a clearer understanding of the 3d depth when i wobble the 3d map as i look at it i remember way back in privateer the darkening the star map in that you could set to rotate and it seems to allow the brain to comprehend better the 3d depth of viewthank you for your time
the 3d map can die in fire give us dotlan style 2d map with all its functionality in game
im going to try and bring this up as non ragey as possible the new ai is annoying i am just coming back to eve after an extended break so im sorry if this has already been brought up i have heard rumor that this new ai was to make afk mission running impossible well it succeeded but it also made any drone boat practically useless as a mission shipnow i spent 3 years getting to the point my character is at yes i can fly many things yes i can fly a missile ship i fly a drone boat because it is well was the most profitable for those of us who took the time and commanded themnow i cant have light drones out to kill the frigates at all since they immediatly focus fire when i pull them out i can eventually glitch the ai and get them to all stay on me but that takes almost half an hour generally ill lose at least one drone in that timeframewhy bother with drone boats now why not just take them out of the game they cant hold aggro since they only have 4 weapon slots everything breaks off of them because of the massive tank they can havethis is the second time the devs have fixed something that didnt need fixing why rework the ships no need quit ruining the game by making up  to do so you can justify your jobinstead add content instead of trying to fix what isnt broken
this has been brought up before many times there are so many problems with the new ai its stupid but ccp seems to be sticking to its guns on this one mostly because a few people massively abused the former dumbness of the ai and lots of players asked for the ai to be less dumbhowever one way to keep the ai focused on you is to use ewar any ewar or remote repair i use a target painter myself
i am greatly in favor of this as well
interesting ideas worth taking a look at i think
this is some crazy magical space world where death is trivialized and yet there seems to be no way to perform a basic sex change operation this cant be technically complicated for ccp do implement and i really want to have some sweet female genitalia instead of goofy male one i mean have you ever seen a penis it looks ridiculous
i too would like to be able to swap out wangs like i do with ships
unzipsuses it to smack ops faceno it isnt  albert
yeah why dont you go vote tea party or  your own sister or whatever it is you people do
1 i have often felt a deep sense of regret that i did not take the opportunity to live my wildest dreams in making my avatar a female so that i can experience life as it was meant to be experienced please do this ccp
i always wondered what blawrf would look like with a nice pair of knockers and appropriate matching nethers1
oh no afk cloaker better drink my own 
just a short questioni am searching for a candidate with the quest to help the smaller and not so important players so my question is who goes to ccp and talk about these cloakingsystem in evea few player can disturb small alliances for a long time so they become serious problems ccp have to create a way to find cloaked afkneutsis there a candidate who want to fix it
there is his name is riverini and i believe that he has the full unwavering direct support of the mittani montolio elo knight dns black and vuk lau via write in support from his internet cafe you should totally just put his name there and ignore anyone else also oh no afk cloaker better drink my own 
you should unlock slots by killing monsters and gaining xp
up to the top big deal here need changes addedhrolt ceo live free die proud
so its yet another case of few ruining it for the many i hate to sound like the old guy but i miss the old days apocrypha was the last time it seems that the game added contentsorry ill leave the forums now i never read them anyway
news for you theyre gonna nerf t3s so wh economy dies well the subs that arent already useless that is
ahhh another i have to think waaah thread regarding the new aiman up weve dealt with the same ai for years in wormholes from npcs that hit a lot harder too
off topic replies topic locked
1 nice idea
does it really make a difference how many players decide to stay on eve is not for everyone were a weird niche who enjoy staring at spreadsheets all day brutally cruel pvp mind numbingly boring pve or all of the abovewe cant cater to the instantgratification esports generation of gamers without breaking eve
youre about to get a whole lot of data
congratulations your data shows that nobody but a minority is crying over the current mechanics
you should run for csm give the pubbies a voice
shut up forever
i filled out your form i also added in the comments section my contention that tier 3 battlecruisers made suicide attacks much cheaper to perform its time for ccp to admit its crimewatch system has failed haulers will line up with a station and grab the loot and enter warp almost simultaneously then they remain docked until the suspect status subsides tier 3 battlecruisers enjoy dps bonuses and 8 turret slots something not available to many battleships their cost to damage output has completely changed the frequency of ganks its time for tier 3 battlecruisers to be removed from the game and they need to revert to the older system where it was nearly impossible to grind your way back from a 10 sec status if you get below minus 5 i think its become clear how you want to play the game and you shouldnt be allowed in high sec anymore especially with the safety features that prevent mistakes
in pure cost to damage terms catalysts and thrashers are more efficient than taloses and tornados upshipping helps if the number of characters available is a limitting factoreveryone could help by sending them survey links to their gank victims we need more carebear responses
themittani says hiuh thanks goons send out those survey links for me will ya
you need to ask better survey questions how satisfied with current mechanics are you think it through someone could be dissatisfied because they make suicide ganking too easy or too hard several of your survey questions are basically worthless because you phrased them very poorly
if you want to play a single player spaceships game go play one
i guess i could have split that one into two questions
for any bears that need a breather from all that ganking i recommend artemis spaceship bridge simulator play it with your corpmates while waiting out your wardec
your question sheets are a mess both of them but i will go with the second one just because you separated the suggestive manipulative part from the real questions so i can more easily ignore it i also filled out your google form already but i would like to take the chance and elaborate a little1 who should be ganking and who should be ganked in high secwhoever wants to gank somebody should be able to try at least and therefor nobody should be immune to suicide ganking while it is a good thing that there are ways to avoid being ganked most of the time with a little bit of know how and common sense nobody should ever be untouchable in eve this would probably break a lot of things and take away from the sandbox that is so unique to eve2 what does the public consider to be valid motives for the act of suicide gankingi dont really know about the public but for me that would be anything the ganker could come up with eve is a game where you can just go and shoot someone because you dont like his face his playstyle his ship or just because you feel like shooting some random guy at the perimeter gate and that is a good thing3 who should take part in wardecswell thats a weird question right there nobody should be immune to war decs if that is what you are asking because if there was a way to gain immunity from war decs people would exploit that to hell and back4 what motives if any are considered valid by the public for the practice of highsec wardecsonce again i am not the public but i consider any motive valid you dont even need a motive at all how do they say whatever drives your boat man5 should stronger corporations and alliances be allowed to harm weaker corporations and alliances in highsecyes of course apart from disallowing this being a stupid idea larger corps would just split up into smaller ones if they wanted to declare war on someone6 do new players have a right to avoid player aggression in highsec outside of rookie systemsanyone has the right and to a degree the means to avoid player aggression should they gain immunity hell no instead ccp should make it clear to everyone that new eden is a harsh and cruel place where pvp does in fact happen if you want it or not in fact i would even like to see a tutorial part where newbies are asked to blow up other unsuspecting newbies that would be hilarious new players would know what they are getting into and no harm would be done since noobships dont cost anything7 considering question 6 should new corporations be allowed to avoid player aggressionhell no people would just remake their corporations every so often very stupid idea8 should training and newbie friendly corps have special considerations made for them for avoiding player aggressionno but i would really like to see the criteria that make a corp a newbie friendly or training corp 9 should we be encouraging or discouraging highsec aggressionlike i said especially newer players should get encouraged to try pvp or at least they should get prepared for it an industrial or businessoriented pilot can avoid stupid losses most of the time but only if he actuall knows about pvp war mechanics and suicide ganking if you dont know what the  you will lose ships in hilarious waysi have killed enough industrialists because they thought they were safe either because they thought they could hide from me lol locator or that their shiny expensive battleship could easily beat my cheap and ugly little rustbucket or other stupid reasons10 would the game be better or worse if there was more prevalence of highsec aggressioni dont know but does it matter i like the amount of pew pew in high sec as it is
hisec statisticsfive standard deviationsfive dead mackinaws
no prob guy an allall broadcast got you a whole lot more data
facepalm
ive done wormholes you twit i know the ai that used to be in them hell i did them when they were first added to the game dont preach to me about something i already know about how about next time before you make an ass out of yourself for assuming ask a question or maybe you would like a jump to conclusions mat for your basementmy problem with new ai is it makes drone boats useless to solo in some of us dont like to play a video game with the likes of youalso i tried using a target painter on a group they still went after the dronesi used to love this game hell even when i wouldnt play i would still pay my subscription now the game feels soft a whole lot of hand holding is going on especially for any player with an account under a year oldplex was the first mistake there have been many since and they seem to be growing exponentiallygood luck with something that used to be good thegunslinger42 be proud you are supporting the degradation of something that used to be special
something i would love to see is a shortcut key for tags even a single hot key that just tags target sequential select target press hot key tag 1 is applied select next target press hot key tag 2 is applied etc something simple but it would be niceeven possible auto tagging broadcasted targets sequentially 
i love the candidates this time around go roc there has been concern over how to determine how active a csm member has been and what rule or standard should be in effect to establish if a csm has been in violation by inactivity i want to suggest that the csm could have a biweekly assembly hall topic which is posted by each csm member beginning with the elected chair and alternating down until the 14th member im not doing the math atm  damnit i just did anyway  i see there would be only 2 posts per the 14 candidates a year by this method if we keep this by the primary 9 members that would be 4 i suppose if a csm fails to comply with a set word count and post by that deadline wordcount determined by the csm members then that csm will have forfeited their position to an alternate with the closest votes and is demoted to the rear of the csm poll as the 14th member i dont think there should be second chances there are only 4 posts required by this method and it provides a great avenue for all of us to follow what that particular csm chooses to discuss and be able to follow for the remaining 34 posts to see their gain with ccp in these related issues and provide a great place for pilot feedback via the forum i like this idea as it alleviates much of the stress involved in being burdened with the secretaryvice secretary positions and the weight that they carry for the others in being so thank you for your time and patience oreb ps hopefully this could be placed on the launcher as csm  update or some such csms that have a blog could easily link their post or paste it here
that would be great a small convinience i sure wish the clone activation delay was for each individual clone 
1 very useful idea
it keeps on trucking slowly but surely
just wanted to change current track oopsi also want jukebox to be back
read the docand i love it this would add so much more depth to the game and tie in the dust bunnies with the world in a seamless fashion let us hope ccp will take a look at the proposalexcellent work btw
updated the front page doesnt it look better now no more guiding questions for your essays but ill still look at your long responses if you write them

my question here is what would you do if someone was fighting you and you got drones dumped on you would you not want to take care of them first since they would be causing more damage to you or do you go for the drone ship itself i believe that would be a choice of strategy and there usually are more than one way to do something i dont have a problem with it as is i just drop the drones target a rat in a group and plow into them with my shipthey have no choice but to fight me when i am in their face i dont let up so they tend to not be able to attack the drones as much it seems to work just fine and i usually dont loose any drones in the process maybe you should think about changing your tactics and find out what works i for one enjoy a challenge and smarter ai is just thatjust my 2 isk on it
i have tried doing just that and for some reason they still lock drones instantly am i supposed to now go back and get into a frigate to kill the frigate ships because the 4 frigates in a room instantly lock and focus fire a single dronei cant make money doing missions anymore is the biggest problem even if i leave out the drones and loose a few thats still a 3mil hit on drones alone and thats if its only light drones i dont spend that much on t2 ammo in a missionyes i agree with you that i would target drones first hell its the first thing i do most of the time anyway even if they arent a drone boat but im not fighting a player is there money to be made fighting a player i mean real money the chance modules will drop is too low and i dont do piracythis issue is just the issue that finally pushed me over the edge to complain yes im complaining and i make no reservations about it it was complainers who brought this change about so i figure fight fire with fire im not saying make the ai dumb but instead of all of the frigates locking and targeting one drone how about a couple to one drone and a couple to the other at least then it would seem like the time i put into training drone defense skills would count for somethingon a side note no i had no idea they were going to nerf t3 ships as well i cant really say that it surprises me the trend is to get more low level players in so they can buy plex just dump plex for  sake its making the high level characters useless in terms of balance trying to balance out the fact that high level characters can just pay for their sub by afk running dump plex and all that changes prices on ships will go back up as they should people will have to earn their keep instead of just playing a game basically for freeim mainly pissed because for the most part the people like me who still paid for a subscription where the ones paying for the expansions even though that isnt what they are anymorein the end it seems like everywhere i go they loyal get screwed ccp doesnt listen to the player anymore they listen to whiners so thats what im doing im whining till i get some positive results because as the twit from earlier said waaaaah its not the way i want it so change an entire game just for little old me
allow the use of 
theyre done with fw for the time being this could be for another sovereignty struggle somewhere else in low sec or npc null sec
well this is not entirely true since you can set the roles to be able to use a chasma higher than the role that grants them access meaning if you set it up propper you can have a few levels of security on who can access which chasma but its still not really safe which nothing in eve otta be we used to run secure and unsecure hangars and smas so we had 2 levels of securityother than that yes corp management is horribly broken if people want to steel stuff they should make work off of it gain trust get roles etc and no only letting someone that put in the job cancel it is not a good idea but being able to set multiple labs up with different role requirements to operate them would be
baboliiiiiiiiiiiiiii
1honestly this would get me interested in doing incursionsas it stands now you need to have the right ship and fit or everyone thinks you are a noob and its tough to get into a fleet
this isnt necessarily intended to lower the entry level of incursions as i see it incursions and wormholes are the two top ends of pve content with incursions being the top end of group pve and wormholes being the top of solo pve as for getting the right ship and fit ask in one of the newbie friendly community channels and theyll help you out warp to me incursions in particular will take almost anything that will survive a site
thank you both for your support if you would please pass this idea along to others that you know so we can keep the support comingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
1 who should be suicide ganking in highsechonestlyanyone its eve2 who should be ganked in highsecagain this could be answered with anyone but it really depends on the gankers choices and preferences3 why should these people gank and be ganked highsec especially when economic considerations are disregarded by the aggressorsusually economic considerations are disregarded by the aggressors because there arent enough consequences when you gank for example you gank a hulk which is worth upwards of 200mil depending on its fit it could drop atleast twice the amount in loot of what your gank ship cost not to mention salvage so you loose a cat worth maybe 2mil big deal you just killed a target worth more than 200milagain if the guy wasnt paying attention to what they were doing then by all means gank them eventually they will learnhowever the consequences are minimal when you think about how easy it is to get around them so you have an alt that took you all of 10 hours to train in to a gank fit destroyer that now has horrible sec status and is killed by concord constantly has a crazy bounty and tons of those miners that you ganked now are making iskies off you selling their kill rights on you oops deleted the character created a new one wahoo ganking spree i bet a lot of inmates in todays correctional facilities wish they could do the same but heh its a game gotta have fun some one rightshould wardecs exist outside of rvb and giant nullcoalitions settling scores in trade hubserr last i checked they did alreadyhowever the war dec system is flawed big time you have one side saying that there should be a reason behind the decs based off a game mechanic of some kind usually carebears or players that dont want to participate in pvp then you got the other side that doesnt want to pay a dime to dec someone else i see both sides as both destroying and helping the game in all honesty i would rather keep what we currently have but add on the ability to dec npc factionsmmmmmcarebearstastienot to mention all the botters etc etc4 considering that many people avoid pvp like the plague and the prevalence of dec avoidancelol well ask yourself do you avoid someone trying to kill you like the plague in real life i understand its just a game but heh some people dont like to get killed in a game just like some people like to kill others in a game its that whole moral mental thing that shrinks have been studying for years and trying to explain yahdah yahdah5 considering that anyone with half a brainstem would commit aggression when there are favourable chances of winningyeah6 noting the outrage over the infanticide of vulnerable corporations and alliancesokay7 who should be deccing whomanyone could potentially dec anyone this is where the whole war dec balancing comes into play the game would be dec fest if there was no cost to decs or limit to the number of decs you could potentially have in the extreme after maybe about a year or so the only mining and traffic you would see in high sec would be people in npc corps low would be as empty as it is today there would be a couple of large null sec corps that would either all be friendly with each other or all be at war with each other i believe it would be very difficult for new players8 why should they be in wardecs in a structureless sovless highsec does there even need to be a reasonsee this is where ya lost me the main factions have sov in highsec and they create something like the un concord to police those systems hence why you need a dec to attack with out concord involvement in empire space9 stronger corporations and alliances should not be able to harm weaker corporations and alliances in highsec i assume that noone would even consider this notion in low or nullsec but is this statement valid in highsecits a bullshit statement by a carebear the strong prey on the weak its how the world goes round for those of you that dont understand this look up nature followed by carnivore 9b if a nullsec entity launches a vicious propaganda campaign against another nullsec entity noone really caresbut a highsec entity launches a vicious military and psychological campaign against a weaker highsec entity and this is called bullying griefing newplayer and newcorp infanticide etcdont think ive seen this one
10 does a new player have a right to avoid pvp in highsec does this only apply in rookie systemsyes and no i believe that a new player should be granted a certain amount of time to get their feet under them however this time is officially over if they aggress someone else first which means all you guys out there that think of ways to get people to aggress you have at it lol as for the rookie systems isnt high sec all rookie systems in the fact that pvp is well kinda prevented11 considering statement 10 does a new corporation have the right to avoid pvp in highsecno by creating a corporation you are proclaiming to eve that i am an adult and i can handle what ever comes my way11b if we consider corporations that are newbie friendly or that brand themselves as places for new players to learn the game does this or should this affect the ethics of wardecsno most newbie friendly corps are look for mindless minions would no habits and are not yet tainted by the game to do work similar to that of work drones in a beehive12 considering that highsec aggression in the form of predatory wardecs and suicide ganking is not a violation of the eula although it is seen as and popularly labeled as griefinggriefing is anything that happens to cause grief for example a terrorist is only a terrorist to those that they cause terror too however to the terrorist they could be freedom fighters or a sovereign nation same goes for griefers a griefer is only a griefer to those they cause grief too otherwise a griefer could consider themselves a newbie trainer or a pirate or just your average pvp player its all about perception just remind yourself that eventually like all narcissitic actions they are eventually selfdefeating 13 also considering that many concessions have been made to the pacifist community in the form of mining barge buffs and the permissibility of wardec evasionsok this is where we differ a mining barge rebalance has been needed for a long long time also out of the 6 barges and 1 frigate gankers can still solo gank 4 of the barges and the frigate and a determined predator can kill anything as for wardec evasions they have made it harder for aggressors to get out of war and almost impossible for the defenders to do so if you leave a corp after they have been decced even if you join any other corp including a npc corp you can still be shot at for a period of time by the original aggressor if your corp closes all members can still be shot at by the aggressor you cant evade or shed a dec anymore you can however call on help easier rather then your help having to pay to dec the people deccing you they can join as your ally however the wardec system is still flawed and if i get a chance ill post something in a third post because i dont believe that i will have enough room in this one14 and bearing in mind that a statistical majority of characters accumulate their wealth in highseci believe that has been proven incorrect on many occasions while the highsec market is where a majority of transactions take place a majority of the wealth is accumulated in null sec and held by null sec players15 should we be encouraging or discouraging highsec aggressioni believe we should be encouraging it to the point of constructive competition and discouraging destructive actions that could potentially harm the game15b and to what extentwhen i get into further wardec improvement possibilities in the next post youll understand16 harsh competition in highsec costs us subscription revenue  does this warrant any interference with highsec aggression would the game be better if highsec was a less competitive environmentthe quoted statement is a farce competition is what drives markets and interaction between people as for the whole aggression thing read 3rd post17 would the game be better or worse if there was more prevalence of highsec aggressiondont know i believe it would be better but you cant have a freeforall with no mechanics or way to protect or defend yourself eventually the people claiming to be predators would be come prey themselves think of the vampire bite scenario in order to feed a vampire has to bite its victim if this bite were to turn the victim into a vampire every time the vampire feeds which could be as many times as 3 times a day or as few times as once a week eventually the entire population of the world would be turned into vampires vampires dont conceive like humans do vampires cant feed on other vampires so eventually the food source for the vampires would vanish much like in even the cheap ships and easy prey would leave the game eventually leaving only the pirates and pvpers that dont do any manufacturing and the game would slowly but surely die
so as we all know the wardec system is flawed there are a lot of different views on this arguement but mainly its two extreme sides one side is no decs no cost freeforall the other side is high cost must have a reason based off game mechanics must have consent of both sides for war both are well extreme i believe that either one would destroy the game if you have a total free for all it would be difficult to attract new players while the game might receive a few it would shed more players then gain and in the long run the lower number of players would mean fewer engagements which would mean more players would quit because they were looking for a fight and didnt get one if we swing to the other side we would end up with a game that was all hunky dory and basically a space version of the classic fantasy mmos we have today like wow guildwars and final fantasy with out the colorful pve storylinesso what should we dowell balance is the key to everythinglets feng shui the wardec system lolfirst off things that i believe are currently wrong with just the wardec system 24 hour waiting period fixed dec length and pay period cost no market warfare abilities cant dec npc corpsfactions unable to counteri am going to try and stay as focused on the wardec system as possible being that i dont want to get off on some tangent about pvp and other systems that have flaws and could be better perfected in my opinionanyway the 24 hour waiting period before the war starts is kind of a moot point i understand there needs to be a cool down period otherwise everyone parked outside jita would dec any freighter pilots corp then proceed to pop the freighter with out concord intervention however the 24 hour long waiting period is a little excessive i believe it should be more like 4 hours because in all honesty you declared war to fight correct so why not fight in the same day and not have to wait till the following day or later to begin that fight also 4 hours is more then enough time for an active corp to put up defenses or send out information to its members if its members are running bots or are alts etc etc that do things with out reading evemails notifications or checking corpalliance chat then they deserve to diethe fixed dec length of one week then having to renew it every week is so annoying so you dec a corpalliance you pay for the first week and you are stuck in it for a week you could potentially renew every week however the defending side knows all this and can just log off for a week thus screwing you over you have to then decide to dec for another week or not so you choose not to they all log back on and a week later you dec again same corp same thing this time you go for another week maybe three same thing one or two pop on to check if they are still decced how annoying is that eventually you dont dec them again and they still cause you problems so why not a day by day payment period a slider would work well here under the war tab in corp menus it could go from say 1 day to 1 month and you pay accordingly then at the end of the period you could choose to renew and continue the war or cancel it choice is yourscost now here is a big problem while a lot of people believe its cheap still others believe its super expensive especially when deccing larger corps personally i believe it shouldnt be a variable the whole idea of a war cost multiplier is well demeaning a corp should be able to dec as many corps as they wish of any size they wish so a one man corp can dec 100 1000 man corps if they can afford it i did believe back in the day when corp to corp was 2mil and corp to alliance was 50mil was a little off i do like the fixed flat rate of 50mil across the board corp to corp or corp to alliance etc however i never did like the dec multiplier or the new member multiplier it should be a fixed amount and as stated above the corp or alliance should have the ability to adjust how long they wish to decthis is a big one currently we have no market warfare abilities when a war dec is issued you could undercut orders but how do you know your not undercutting allies you could buy out opponents but how do you know your not funding your enemies with trade warfare abilities you could impose embargoes tariffs blockades and other trade sanctions this could destabilize and potentially harm the defending or attacking corp more than killing ships would however im sure there would have to be a mechanic involving some sort of isk value be paid to cover these sort of actionsthe inability to declare war on an npc corp or faction would seem to be the most frustrating of all the flaws in the war dec system i mean think about it the factions can attack each other why cant a stand alone corp or alliance attack the factions in so doing you could declare war against gallente and gain major standings with caldari for it this while a small tangent would effect not only the wardec system but the faction warfare system as well you would have to move new players into undecable factions such as concord or have them with out corp or faction this way you could declare war even against concord wonder what the out come of that would be dec concord and you dec all of eve hrmsounds funnow here comes the balance money talks if you want to counter a dec you have to pay for it why not have the ability to pay concord protection money basically if your corp or alliance has a overall positive security standing you can pay concord to void any wars that come your way so if corp a wants to dec corp b who is paying concord protection money corp a doesnt loose any isk and cant dec corp b however if corp bs security status drops below positive or under a certain amount say 50 then corp b can dec corp a
ive participated in your little survey altough i think such a survey is a complete waste of time eve is a sandbox and everyone should have a place in it if a carebear wants to avoid pvp there is nothing wrong with it if a priate wants to suicide someone there is nothing wrong with it either anyone should be able to do what he wants there needs to be room for everyone 
the question not improving dps anymore so target painters not a issue problem what to do with drones if they spend 70 of time flying to target and back to drone bay and also they die every time  orges especially my ship is droneboat and now it useless drones useless sp in drones useless i want to swap droneboats to direct damage ships
ive been running level 4 missions on my alt partially to see what all the fuss is about i used an sni with no ewar and hob iis over the last week ive lost 5 drones to a combination of negligence on my part or because if a rat is almost dead sometimes ill just let the drone die it might cut into mission profits but 1 bs rat later the drone is paid for from my observations sending drones more than 1520km from your ship is turning them into kamakazis when they get aggro and they will they will die before they get back to your ship i usually wait until the little buggers are looking in my windshield before i put the hobs out soon as i get a red drone health bar i yank in and redeploy soon as i have all redboxes on me some missions seem to be worse than others for some reason sancha seem to especially hate drones in my experience not sure if that is just a fluke or not also although drones are supposed to be targeted by size yesterday i had a rat in a cyclone trying to shoot my hob ii not sure what was up with that but i managed to get it back in safely frigate rats are usually my last priority clearing rooms and i can tank them indefinitly so having to recall a couple times is not a deal breaker all in all missions are still a fast means to earn decent isk with virtually no risk at all ill take the reality of rats shooting drones over the reality of what would happen if i actually jumped my sni into 10 dramiels 8 cynabals 6 cyclones and 5 machariels maybe ccp should put realistic fits on mission rats
its still bad so gl going to fix it somewhere elseto the op nice idea 1 one small change any none fw player will not be able to warp to the site sorry pirateUFFFD
when the other side just has a bigger blob then thats it end of story and im not talking fighting force here just more players earning isk by plexing in wcs shipsi would rather that all had t2 bonus all the time than thisthis has been put up many times before so i guess the text is landing on deaf ears too just pissed off that nothing is being done about it
be nice if they could make the undock a little easier in the process too perhaps have 4 exits to help lower the bumping of ships
would be amazing add viplounges for cq for iskies where you can see whats going on on the outside and you have a pretty solid isk sink on top of a nice eyecandy
i current maintain 3 accounts when i went to vote i had to sign out and in out and in on the last account it did not allow me to vote it only presented me with the your vote in the csm election was anonymously registered message so frankly im not sure if that account voted properly or notin general i would say that1 i have no receipt for my votes so basically i cant tell if they were properly tallied2 i would rate the ease clarity and enjoyment of the voting process a 05 out of 10thanks for listening
1i also think that adding the potential to have bpcs for the incursion factions ships drop in sites would be nice i can go ratting in an amarr 5 and potentially get a cruor bpc off a high sec rat but dont even think twice about leaving behind countl
add siege mod for titans that improves theyre tracking to the old daysbut they would have to siege 5 minute cycles  titans get used more and will generate more content
players who fly and pvp in low sec get punitive security status just by engaging in what is typically consensual pvpthis is because the first of two players who touch a player or ship in most cases players not only are willing to engage but consider risky behavior part of why they are in lowsecso i recommend the following to reduce the number of sec reducing incidents dramatically increase the suspect timer when performing an action in low sec like to 60 min this will make people who are engaging in pvp get much fewer sec status when brawling with other propvp players reduce the security status hit when someone has their suspect timer on so for example they get a 01 hit if they engage when they are not currently flagged as suspect but only 005 this makes players who are planning on engaging in pvp a reason to proactively turn on the suspect timer provide a turn on suspect toggle andor a when in lowsec enable suspectbecause of the benefits of having suspect turned on enable a way to keep your suspect timer turned on whenever you are in a low sec systempodding can still take a sec status hitwhat can happen is that low sec corps can institute a suspect only policy allowing pvp among consenting players this means that players can live and pvp in low sec without being forced into pirate sec status by only engaging war targets active pvp players and pirates
please add bitcoin as a payment option for either plex or subscriptions this is really a no brainer
yep it really is a nobrainer no intelligent company should ever accept unestablished and nongovenment backed currency even though the physical and virtual value of those government backed bills are faithbased at bestmaybe in 1020 years if bitcoins are still stable and carry a predictable and consistent value ccp can consider itwhats that they arent stable and vary wildly in value now well then i guess hell no
doesnt that seem a little ineffective to you i mean by having to wait for them to be in your face what is the point of having all the done modules to extend control range not to mention the time it takes a bs to get into that position half the time i try and do that if im not shooting at them they run away if i slow down so basically if im not charging in they turn tailisnt the point of a drone ship to sit off 80km away and slow boat to the gate while the drones do the dirty work thats the point of other bs is to sit at a good clip away am i perceiving this wrong are we not going to have two different styles of play anymore well more than two but these are the main is it headed in the direction of up close and the way of the sniper bs or any class ship for that matter is going to be a thing of the pastthis has gone beyond my original question but its still prevalent to the matter at hand which has moved on from a simple mission ai issue to a deeper degradation of a once spectacular game
aye mentioned quite a few times including by meit is the main factor for fw becoming stale but ccp have already said were happy with fw in other words they dont do fw as everyone in fw know the downfalls of tier 1
or better yet attack the plethora of 10s found throughout lowsec with impunity no secstatus hit no gatestation guns no suspect timeryou can also go 10 yourself and bait people into attacking you or attack them anyways because most people are too skittish to attack you unless you are taking gatestation gun fire
in all honesty good ideabad deliveryi would like to see jump bridges in high sec however for what you are talking about i dont see it happening a jump bridge is good for what 5 light years the distance between all those systems exceeds that also compared to other jump capable ships a jump bridge jump range is way shorter especially if you have the skills leveledthe reason there is a lot of empty space in null and low is because there is about double if not triple the number of systems allocated to low and null as compared to high not to mention the fact that a majority of players spend their time in high sec rather than null i know players that live in null though and a lot of them spend time in large groups moving around looking for things to doin reality though every time i see someone say eve is small i laugh there is currently 53191 players online at this very moment according to
yeah because additional internet spaceship pixile clones cost money to make right
destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
yes the game does cost money to run
and it doesnt have to run had a few extra subscriptions not been there
it has grown stale for a lot of reasons i was with amarr and gunship for that matter doing some fw pew and have to agree that t1 should be buffed i like the tier system but maybe only a 15 lp payout for t1t4 is broken because well it is most likely the best isk in the gamemy spreadsheets for lp conversion are a bit out of date but i was easily earning 320350k lps and 3540mill isk in rewards per trip of running l4s duel boxing bombers this would take me about 2 or 25 hoursthis was around 120mill isk an hour at 850 isk per lp pretty easy to find if you looked even moving navy battleships would get you around 800 and move lp fastnow that im in a c5 i have to say for just earning isk an l4 fw would be better its about the same isk maybe a bit less but in fw you can do it non stop all you want and your duel boxing two ships for a combined total of 100mill iskin the c5 im watching my back the best i can in a billiion isk fit tengu it still is fun in the wh and really enjoying the challenges and being able to fly ships that you really cant in fw butthe risk to reward is really screwed in fwthis would also be the same compared to null where in a faction or pirate bs with carrier support you might make 2535mill more isk an hour than a guy duel boxing bombers in minnie fw but your risking 4 5 billion isk in assents in null and often cloakly camped or in war so you cant run havens while in fw you can be in an npc corp and churn out all you wantthis is why it has become a heaven of alts
yeah i gather that one of the points of this proposal was to save the inevitable secstatus hit that one would be faced with when engaging non 10 targets or  50 in lowsec UFFFD thereby avoiding the limitations imposed on a character with low sec status ie no highsec entryi think that the overall idea of making changes to the current security status mechanics in lowsec pvp is worthy of further discussion this could only improve the profile of engagements and available targets in this area and potentially reduce one of the barriers of entry to lowsec
being 10 doesnt mean no high sec entrydestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
thanks magspoor choice of words there i agree but i think that everyone is well aware of the limitations placed on 10 player in highsec space which was what i was getting at i am also aware fully of ways to be  50 and still function without any significant issues in lowsec alts neutral logistics etc but this is beside the point  i only mention it here to avoid the inevitable you can still be 10 and get ships etc out via a b c from highsec argument
1 in principlefor fact see signature
this idea is incredibly popular despite the fact that it not only flies in the face of what ccp imagines planetary industry to be like but also splits up pi into three categories even when it would be far better to have them all integrated with each other entirely
ccp have been free to finish their pi minigame with follow up expansions post their plans for pi in terms of how it will evolve and tie in with dust and incarna or comment on this ever evolving suggestion for the last 3 years or as long as this topic and its predecessors have been running on the old forums lobbying for continued development of those gaming dimensionsthey havent bothered we have instead been granted refinements of pi as is ie no more click fest extractors we have ecus moveable drill heads better interfaces etc which is nice were grateful but in terms of whats next for pi nothingmore over given the sheer lack of information in the public domain around what ccps plans are for piit stands to reason that your making broad unsubstantiated sweeping statements about what ccp wantsso this topic has become popular because its based on an fi discussion such as what ccp rice is currently doing with the battleship revamp around the megathron and hyperion where the community out here debate and form a consensus about what would be a great addition to have having substantiated why and thinking it out properly so it not only ties in well with the current game mechanics we know love and love to hate but that it also provides the opportunity to add value to your gaming experience while adding overall depth to the eve universe in terms of things to do and places to go do it in sadly this facet alone makes this idea overly complex because it impacts much more things in eve that your spaceshipin terms of your opinion of having a single command center category that can build everything youll be changing existing pi and upsetting allot of people in the process the whole point of this expansion conceptmanifestation was to not touch the existing industrial pi networks while adding more flesh and game play options to its bare bones for the people who want to take it further
did you get your economics education the same place as your spelling skillsin todays world economy any fiat currency and they all are has no intrinsic value and is thus susceptible to fluctuation and even collapse virtual decentralized and nongovernment attached units of value for trade would be of great benefit in continuing your virtual existence whilst all the rest of the worlds currencies spiral into collapse dont you want to be able to still play eve from your bunker nothing in todays hyper connected world takes 1020 years to either improve or decay most experts are saying that bitcoin will prove itself somewhere between 1218 months you can determine a exchange rate based on fluctuating market values have you heard of forex do you know how currencies are traded
it is kind of appropriate to allow subscriptions in a currency that amounts to little more than a reallife version of the typical eve ponzi scheme
i think anyone that truely wishes to see some change in fw should stage a protest thoigh im not sure it would help unless done on a scale of huge sizehonestly everyone should mass change to ome side and farm the  out of it will take ccp 3 momths and they will change it up lol if not sooner
currently celestial objects can be located very close to player owned structures and example of this is the station in vfkiv which is located 100km from the physical location of a moonthis is both unrealistic and impacting game play as cloaking devices cannot be used as intendedit is unrealistic that such a large structure comparable in size to the moon would be at a distance of 100km as gravity would prevent thisthis also hampers the effective use of cloaking devices for example in vfkiv you will be uncloaked in a close proximity to the station as the majority pilots do not have the distance to celestial objects on their overview the object acts as an effective giant hidden uncloaking spherei propose that player owned structures should be 10000km away from celestial objects
maybe the moon isnt very dense like a giant sphere made of pumice
i agreeyou cannot predict where a celestial is in relation to another object this makes it dangerous to try and sneak in when in reality you are many kms away but still get decloaked
like the idea as well 1 from me in fact anything that makes logistics more viable without diminishing the size of the overall galaxy like jfUFFFDs and jumpdrives did in general would probably get a 1 from mebut i guess that is another story told another time
thanks for the 1 and comment my goal isnt to diminish the vastness of new eden just make transporting things across said vastness a little more user friendlyi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
thank you for the link here the document was a very interesting read if youd ever apply for csm youd surely had my vote to promote thisallow me to add some points of critisism toughthere are many repetitive passages about the planetary an lunar facilities which in effect are the same possibly you could pull the two togheter and make emphasisized passages about the differences applying eg pos effects custom offices atmospherei would also like to voice my disagreement about the habitability classification of the planets id suggest a master of orion approach on planet type bonimali that are more diverse than just population growth effects such as population size bonus on planets with own atmosphere upper four on the list maintenance penalty on planets with harsh climate more heating on ice planets reinforced structures on storm lava and plasma planets incurring a building cost penalty moons should be classified as barren planets imho to my opinion it should be more likehabitabletemperateoceanicicestorm upper have atmosphere and water lower have none and would need a complete hermetic sealed encapsulation adding to building and maintenance costbarrenmoonslavaplasmagas no solid nor fluid ground to build on basically a settlement of any kind would in effect be a very planet near space station facing gravity and grave atmospheric pressurehostilein the military installations i miss some sort of security contracting center as a kind of dustie base where the authorized city officials can contract mercs to assist local ground defense on a player set set of conditions like capturingrecapturing districts via domination capture the flag or depletion of respawns defending for an amount of time sabotage extraction and escort emergency evacuation of goods roughly resembling the sidetasks in mass effectvice versa the invading fleet could have a shipmodule dropoff invason command center or so allowing for troop deployment as soon as the ship is within range usable for dustmercs with or without npc soldiers vehicles etc
bump for fanfest
how do you you reckon after the initial farmwar patchexpansion inferno june 2012 it took 45 months to get a change through  that is what we have now oct 2012 and it is coming up on its eight months anniversaryi am all for hope but it should be founded on reasonable expectations and not blind faithproblem for me is that i have lost all sight of what ccp actually wants fw to be in relation to the rest of eve and have a sneaking suspicion that they have themselves lost sight of it  no other explanation fits changes have been semi random and followthrough nonexistent almost as if they they are using trialanderror as a tool
well 3 months if it truely was a mass move to one fw sideas in get minnies t5 and amarr would have near zero active pilotsmilk the isk as much as one can show our incomes post it recruit as many isk jew horders as you can just get pve guys and show them how to spam l4s crash the isk per lp market pi think it would be fun could get on some eve news if done right and could turn some headsim thinking right now of making a fw minnie corp amarrians need isk too or something along them lines lol
overview need some love in next update last inventory improvements where great so tweaking this most important part of ui would be at least beneficial definitely  1
i guess i should have come back to this thread huhbecause otherwise players would be able to easily manipulate it to create deep safes
the game is expanding there is more players than ever before low seec missions they are almost useless in terms of risk vs reward compared to their hs counter parts fw are nice since they can be blitz in a stealth bomber and yield about 14k lp per mission with high lp to isk missions are other words ulseless in terms of risk vs reward i dont see a way to fix this issue without removing lvl 4 missios from hs no one really wants that so ill leave it at that adding more isk for the low sec counterpart would be more of an issue than a fix low sec exploration its mmeh terms of isk per hour its maybe maybe on par with lvl 3s you make get lucky and get a pirate cruiser hull a faction medium mod or medium faction tower you cant really fix this without buffing null sec exploration so another stand stilllow sec mining isk is ok there is a lot of high yield ore in the belts only issue is you cant control the space as well as 00 some fixes add more low sec space this will allow more miners to have belts allow temp anchored warp bubbles these cant be in line with a star gate or station they should be unstable so lasting about 13 hours before they need to be replaced boosters they need to be looked at again yeah they are good and all for what they do atm but there should be rare sites that offer the null sec gas maybe look into having them effect more systems than what they do now remove the high sec net between all regions this making it you must go through 1 to a few jumps of low sec to get between regions the effects of this change there will be larger trade margins with region trading as not all traders would want to take the risk of traveling through low sec people can use blockcade runners to preform trades to move larger loads it would require more team work in a lot of cases more alts lol would make eve a more rough environment as it once was maybe even add some lvl 12 and maybe lvl 3 pirate faction agents not in stations the ones sitting in space this would make risk doing the agents as you can get ganked as you are talking to the agent lp pay outs should only take in 00  im not a fan of gate camping there should be more than 1 route between empires some direct ones but there should be a good number of indirect ways between empires i hate gate camping and it is not real pvp 30vs1 is not really a fight

malcanis wrotezlake wrotethe game is expanding there is more players than ever before low seec missions they are almost useless in terms of risk vs reward compared to their hs counter parts almost useless to you maybehe does have some valid points though i think low sec really tends to be quite dead as soon you get a few jumps away from high sec apart from your occasional 10 pirate cruising through desperately looking for something to fightim guessing theres a reason why so few bother going there could be the things op listed
i would like to agree with the op it makes sense that they would target your drones but it just feels so bothersome and often quite unfair as well even though i know youll have a lot of fun trolling me on that one i find that lag is really a big issue now in the old days it didnt really matter so much that commanding drones would have a few seconds delay now however by the time the drone health bar has updated correctly and your order to make it retreat goes through its entirely possible that your drone will have been blown up managing drones in general just feels really clunky and ineffectiveso basically i can see the reasoning behind the new ai but i really think its necessary to make controlling the drones much more responsive and tight so you can actually react properly to the changing aggro and suchalternatively or also there could be added drones specifically for being more tanky and attempt to draw aggro away from your squishy dps drones but of course dealing less damage in turn just to try and give people different ways to roll with their drones rather than having one single way to do it which is as andracin described
just giving this a hopeless bump
way too late for the party my dear fw lp market bottomed out years ago on a semirotational basis from bomber 4s and has since the infernal patch been permanently depressed for all militiaslp gains are not the problem per se or at least not all of it far bigger part is the underlying system of tier beings manipulated by unaffiliated farmers to maximize their intake and wreaking havoc on the warzones in the processin the beginning i wanted a mesh of pvp and pve to help set fw apart from the rest of eve but the utterly uselesshopeless patches of the the past 23 years have convinced me that ccp has no clue as to how to go about it  so no i advocate a complete segregation of the twoexample popup on plex timer start asking if lp or vp is wanted  and never the twain shall meet with a 30km activation sphere one can be fairly certain that timer start wont happen with any tangible threat in immediate vicinity so hard to find a downside
hi im issuing a fiat currency the callduron its being announced here as a world exclusiveid like ccp to accept 30 calldurons worth 30 per month instead of charging me real money to play evelet me know tia
simple fix for titans  make them scannable when logged offthink about it  theyre almost the size of stations and poses so why should they be able to magically vanishplayers would still be able to stash them in poses etc to keep them safe but we wouldnt have a game where some dudes log on once a month and still dominate the game
use sentries
and from that point on around 17 vps per day will be accounted for w00twant to dump the farm festsetup a roll back timer if you leave or cloak in a plex fix tags so that doing full l4s in a non sb is a bit more worth itreduce the effect of the tier system you should get something if your winning t1 25 50 per each tier over t2 not 75increase the lp cost in store very slightly maybe add a bit more isk base cost but very littlethis will reduce the income right now minnies can get around 750 isk per lp selling faction bs doing a l4 in a bomber is easy and earns you 5560k lp plus 6mill isk when duel boxing bombers and getting 1012 missions at a time you can earn 250300m an hour easy this makes people from null and other areas that just want isk move alts or even mains to fw just to earn iskthe rewards are to high cut the income for fw high end by half make the low end a tad betterthis way fw can be what it needs to be small gang pvp with a way to pay for losses and maybe a bit of savings but not be such good isk that people are docking up there faction bs and ratting carrier in null so they can use a bomber in fw and earn better iskt1 should earn around 75mill isk an hour and work up to t4 at around 125m an hour 150m at t5you keep it around that range and everyone has fun loosing side can pay for some ships and have fun winners can make decent money and pay for ships to have fun a lot of the alts will go away and back to ratting in a carrier in null making 150200m an hour
i think it would be cool if you could salvage corpses in pod wrecks for possible implantsthat is all
one of the few ideas that i have felt compelled to give the thumb instead of the finger very nice and comprehensive1
not a lot of people do the low sec exploration as you can make about the same in hs missions whs need groups of people and you can find those in high sec and null people that really do them tend to live in there
please everything is a ponzi scheme by your standard gold value fell 13 in 2 days just last week gee gold must be a ponzi scheme and less trustworthy than bitcoin now everythings a commodity get over it
i dont think i call it a ponzi scheme but them gold selling commercials targeting old people on cnn sure are a scam pthe more gold we buy at cash4gold pawns and sell overpriced on tv ads the more the commodity goes up till no one buys it anymore cuz we soaked up all the retirement funds into gold and it drops back down to a more true term used loosely valuesmart thoughid still guess that a few of the gold sellers from tv pushed to far and risked to much and got hurt from the current gold prices dropping all part of the gameto the op yeah no your cyber money is worth even less than carbon credits and thats sad because carbon creds are worth 
65 mil per clone is a bit high and doesnt provide any incentive to engage in regular nullsec pvpdiscuss
ruins implant market and isk sink so you can farm pods off jita undock so no
this is a commonly proposed idea please do a forum search before posting a repeated thread go see those threads for the pros and cons of this idea
looks cooli am just not sure how will that overview react live on 600  objects in it  or just 200after all eve has become a game of numbers i think it will just bring more lag on client side
it doesnt really do anything to change the amount of information received just the way it is filtered and displayed and even then it doesnt appear to be much difference at all on the former as such im not too sure why you think further lag would be a problemreally if thats such a huge concern for people with older comps they could always leave in the old overview as an optionall of this is assuming of course that they manage to fix the inherent overview problems that already exist
this i do believe however that ccp is making these nerfs to ganking and wardecs in order to help new players theres a lot of power differential between someone who can barely fit a frigate and someone who has everything maxed after 5 years not to mention actual pvp experienceif you cant understand that new players being slightly coddled is a good thing for the game never ever become a parent youll never understand why a 2monthold baby shouldnt be working a fulltime job while going to universityhighsec needs to have high security and high consequences for belligerent actions however anyone who stays in highsec beyond 12 years is admitting that they dont have what it takes to move on to low or nullim still very new to the game and i understand thisits good that eve has a learning cliff however the frustration curve needs to be managed to be slightly less than the reward curve for player retentiona friend of mine started the game was told that faction warfare was a great way to learn pvp even if youre just 3 days old and left the game a few days later because he cant even go through a gate by himself without his ship being blown up he was extremely frustrated to not be able to do any activity in the game if his corp didnt have a fleet up and have to leave the fleet without any reward because his ship was always among the first to go without a hauler alt it was a huge hassle to reship all the time hed take forever to put one together and it would be gone in seconds it wasnt about the isk it was simply being unable to undock and get a rewarding experience for himself in any wayhis corp had to give him isk to replace his ships he wasnt able to make any he wasnt able to undock without knowing that at least 4 other corpies were there to roam if he undocked alone he lost his ship before making any isk or even being able to shoot at the people who killed him because they had the skills trained to shoot from far awayi was told that it would take 6 months to be equal to others in frigate skills 6 months he didnt want to be dependent on others for 6 months before being able to have a chancealthough thats not highsec wardecs it does demonstrate the new player experience in this game either stay in highsec where its safer and run boring missions for very little isk or get blown up repeatedly without having any fun because youre simply too new to do anything usefuli blame myself because i hadnt tried fw and had also been told it was a newbie friendly way to go a nullsec corp tried to recruit him at a week old but hed been told fw was better for new players than null and had enough isk rewards to replace your ships he didnt want a carebear life in highsec so he just left the game
any currency that can be price manipulated solely by the power of a ddos attack is not significantly stable enough to be considered a world currency but more of a criminals plaything
do you actually know what ddos is
hey thats not a bad idea besides the callduron rolls off the tongue infinitely better than the names of most of the worlds current fiat currencies also something tells me that you are far more trustworthy than ben bernakethough that really isnt saying much
i have been involved in network engineering since dial up and isdn lines were the only mass connection options available to non businesses so yes i am very aware what a ddos is
nice isk sink there good for evehighsec is that way 
ccp has said theyre not happy with the current system and the topic in general has been discussed to death i can summarize the discussion for you hereits a flawed system which only punishes loyal subscribers by additional money grinding and acts as a needless limiting factor in certain types of pvp the only positive side is it acts as an isk sink but it isnt a good enough reason to keep the bad mechanic the system can and should be greatly improvedim rich and dont care about such costsyour characters are old so its okisk sink is a good enough reason to maintain the  system isk siiinkreally you can have a 50 page thead about this and thats about all youre going to come away with the discussions are pretty much done the sides are chosen and now we wait what kind of plans ccp has for the system its one of those ancient system that was never designed with all the knowledge in mind that now exists its pretty much guaranteed to get revamped at some point but there isnt any guarantee if we get minor changes or a total redesign to the system
maybe theyll do away with clones and just let you lose an increasing amount of sp for every podding keeps the lid on that high sp
yeah i think that op meant more clear and infographic style map mode not real view more schematic and clear 2d views would be very useful to see all stuff at first glance without using printed maps or dotlan  also you had an minimap under f11 key check it out 
hello i would like to suggest adding bright colors option for ingame map i found used now black background map very hard to see too much contrast  anything and im forced to use dotlan maps to find anythingadding brighter colors white or greyish background theme as option would very improve readability of map and made scanning less pain to my eyes also more schematic version of 2d and 3d map would made navigation more intuitive im not hardcore eve player but studying map and plotting course on both 3d and 2d mode feels very confusing and unclear incoming expansion is meant to be about exploration so its an good reason to made map easier to read and enjoyable to explore cheers 
flying through faction war space its getting to the point where i see more t3s on dscan that combat ships ccp claims that they want to do away with ogbs but they dont have the technical know how yet at every phase they buff them t2 links buffs to active tanks buffs to missile kiting platforms im starting to question ccps word on this one make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
imothe problem is not the rewards themselves its how you get the rewards the most effective way to win sov is by flying stabbed ships and avoiding all pvp that is the problem that needs correcting make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
opwhat are you talking about i have 2 ravens in my office one on each end of my display shelf
watching the balancing laughter and tears soundwave mentioned he would like to have two larger belts rather then the 20 small belts in a system we love this idea  please continue to post your own thoughts on this as i just built the post to reiterate what soundwave mentionedlarger gridgreater options for game playgreater pvp options

yeah larger belts maybe in grav sites instead of static would be great theres this planned for tomorrow  14000700 eve is real  asteroid miningperhaps soundwave dropped an early hint
perhaps we will see
in before locki think ccp rise is one of the best appointments ccp have made
it actually follows an old ccp pattern of doing things because of hey itd be interesting if we do this instead of attempting to responsibly balancing the new geddon is a prime example geddon is one of the few perfectly balanced boats out there yet ccp rise choose to remove it and introduce a new neut boat that has extreme potential to be game breaking why not just introduce a new model for your new toy instead of breaking whats working for a whimsical experiment
i value and respect your point of view yes he had done excellent work in the previous two expansions yet his present behavior and arrogance is and will be detrimental to the game we all enjoy that is what i personally want to bring to the attention of csm and ccp if the age of your character is any indication you have only just started your eve journey which may be part of the reason for what i think is your incomplete view of the present issuehe seems to have forgotten that when you ask for feedback you read understand and analyze it there are many great and valid points and concerns that were raised yet in his replies he essentially said fck you i will do what i want anyway cause i am ccp and am always right which indicates that he doesnt understand an important concept in business dont belittle your customersin a business such as this it is paramount to maintain a healthy relationship of communication and action between customers and provider this was done in the past yet if a provider asks for feedback and then ignores or belittles the customer problems arise potentially those problems could result in the end of a companyccp is a fairly good company compared to many of its competitors blizzard and ea would be prime examples of jerk companies i do not think that as a whole ccp wants to ruin the game that is eve online i do understand that they want a better retention of newer players which is fine i have no issue with that perse however it has to be done in a way that doesnt cheapen the achievements of older playersthe same would go with regards to game mechanics the game is best when there is a delicate but crucial balance between the ships and systems there shouldnt be one ship that can lord over all the competition nor should a particular ship make such a drastic departure from the roots and lore of the flying race for example the gallente are dronemasters as such they should and do have the best drone boats in the game amarr are known for their armortanking and lasers caldari are known for their advanced shield missile and electronic warfare capabilities minmatar are known for their ability to tank armor or shield but use versatile projectile turrets these are the characteristics and the ideologies of the races that must be preserved in their shipsif you want to fly drones you specialized in gallente if you wanted to use lasers you specialize amarr if you want missiles caldari if you want the versatility of projectile guns minmatar the amarr and gallante are the two largest and imperialistic empires opposed ideologically amarr are a religious and totalitarian government gallente are a freedomloving democratic crusader caldari are a capitalistic culture that broke free of the gallente minmatar are a tribally tight culture and exslaves of the amarrall this lore and backstory of the races is shown in their ships preferred tactics etc it is what makes the story we the players tell so powerful i hope that you understand that dr minxthe last time ccp employee did something this gamebreaking reckless it almost resulted in the end of eve i fully admit that i havent played the game very long yet i have watched you all and this game for the last few years with extreme attention in the end i decided to invest some of my time and energy to play this game we enjoyi cannot stand by and let someone push an agenda that will be so destructive to the new eden universe as a whole
ccp please see following post
you know this is actually a really good idea it would add a whole new level of realism to the game while it may pose some interesting issues when it comes to war decs i believe it would introduce a whole new level to social networking working in the real world most people work for multiple companies  corporations for example you may work for walmart target and kmart all of which directly compete with each other infact you may even be a supervisor or manager for all 3 i myself have worked for 2 different book stores while working at a movie theatre when i was younger by allowing players to join multiple corporations it allows players the possibility of having a more enjoyable playing experience in the end it is up to the leaders of the corp on whether they wish to allow a player to be part of their corp so if you are a corp leader and dont wish to have players that are members of multiple corps in your corp then dont do itone last little tidbit most players run multiple characters they have characters in pvp corps characters in faction war characters in pvemissionincursion and players in industrial corps most of the time they even have an npc neutral character some times they have mutliple pvp characters to get the pvp fix some times they have multiple industrial characters to feed the pvp character in the end they end up joining multiple corps whats that saying dont keep all your eggs in one basket anyway like i said good idea would love to see more discussion
then ppl jump corps like they do now
agreed that roles are broken preventing industrial corporations from becoming truly huge enterprises also posting that ccp have known this for years and have done nothing and are likely to continue that trend as an increase in player numbers would overload the hamsters
i took a breakfanfest brought me back i notice nobody is talking about boob bounce at fanfest whats up with that anybody brave enough to ask the question at a roundtable or after a presentation cmon
i want to give you a 1 like but its sitting at 69 and i feel that would ruin the overall feel for this request
i knowit has been sitting there for a while and i have been kinda wondering myself how long it would stay that way p
lolj3ssica alba killed it
sorry but i had to approve of your request this is my signature there are many others like it but this one is mine without me my signature is useless without my signature i am useless
i approve of better boobies we should also have the option of making characters which are morbidly obese as well
something no one has touched on is how plex sales help all those sites you love battleclinc evekill etcthey sell 60 day gtcs which are converted to two plex and sold on the market so you take the purchase of plex away you hurt those 3rd party sites that make eve a little bit more fun to show off to your friends also plex is pure profit for them i buy 6 plex a month to sell 6 people use those plex to add game time thats 6 more subs eve has it helps them because those 6 people werent going to buy a sub from ccp now i get a little extra cash for my time which makes my eve play style a little better for the month that 3 billion isk didnt destroy the game or make me super god or some  so 7 people got to enjoy eve another month and ccp made about 20 bucks in pure profit that they would not of made with out plex that adds up really fast to all those ships your flying and all the devs are getting a paycheck instead of this game disappearing or worst become free to play which we all know would be pay to win also what do you think is paying for dust aur might keep it going but it was plex sales that help create that game
isk is not generated from plex people swipe a credit card to get game time they then trade that game time to another player for isk at freemarket value that player spent time in game to accrue that isk and it is completely up to them whether they wish to trade it or not i personally think the implementation of plex was brilliant and certainly dont support removing it from the game
isboxer is not a macro program and if you die to 40 people in a pvp fleet why are you soloing a 40 man fleet snip please refrain from personal attacks isd ezwal if you see a 80 man mining op do what everyone else does pop the orca pop the orca for real where do you people get your info isboxer has keystroke broadcasting but mostly is a visual aid to see what the hell is going on with your multiple accounts in mission some pvp and of course mining these large one man 40 ship pvp fleets are so rare that you really never see them or find someone that has proof that they saw one also if you attacked 40 ships solo weather one person was controlling them or 40 people where controlling them your still gonna die wake up and stop crying its not hurting the game or making people leave you dont have to have multiple accounts to win in eve its just a play style
turns out it is another eve to rl presentation nothing to do with the thread lets keep this idea flowing i also personally loved his idea that in conjunction with the larger static belts versus 100 small belts in system addingremoving off grid gang links and possible having them be local to the fleet where you may need multiple boosters to cover the belt
you ever been in a real engagement dont answer we all know you havent in real life off grid assets effect the outcome of a battle you ever seen a drone they can scan the battle field and tell the troops on the ground where every single body is in a 5 mile radius ever seen artillery called into a fight no thats way better than some boosts effecting your fight this is the future in space off grid assets have been effecting the battlefield since the invention of the long bow so why in the future where were flying spaceships cant we use off gird assets to effect combat scan them down kill them and quit whining this is eve people might use tactics to kill you whining about it doesnt keep you alive and guess what 90 of those tactics are unfair honourless or some other cry baby term learn to fly learn to kill
they need to nerf the range of rockets and hams then torp range looks good  and in line with battleship weaponsi suspect the td change is the main thought of ccp on buffing missile tracking but they will have to nerf their range to implement them anywayyou see each size of weapons is doubled so rough figuresrockets 8kmhams 16kmtorps 16kmso therefore its unbalanced and out of sequence so in order to address torps range you have to address the sequenceblasters have 6km optimal with voidt1 antimatter infact all guns short range ammo is under 20km lasers are supposed to be the longest range weapon and its optimal is 15km granted it has 10km falloff but thats guns advantage and you dont really use falloff on most turrets besides projectiles i would also suggest that missiles should trade places with arties in terms of alpha to rof ratiotech3 ships need to be put down like a rabid dog drooling everywhere in the house they are out of line ccp ytterbium nerf missile range into place where is the td missile change projectiles should use capacitor abcs should be t2 habc and nerf web strength its still too high
they need to remove exp radius and exp velocity then torps look good while were at it bring aoe torps back
explosion radius should stayvelocity on the other hand is kind of  if you ask me what irritates me about missiles in general is that the damage from them is too inconsistent for what they are done purely for balance of course but according to the lore missiles dont ever actually impact their target they explode just short of impact this is why velocity matters for the explosion itself the faster the target is moving away from the explosion the less damage it takes the mechanic itself makes sense what doesnt make sense is why someone would make a missile that explodes just prior to impact instead of impacting and going as far into the object as possible before exploding this is the future

i would love to know ccp really see these as natural abcs rather than a strange specialization more akin to a t2 classas i think people would rather have a more natural line of abcs using the combat bcs like the navy versions seem to have taken up that linei have mentioned in the abc thread that i think they should become t2 bcs heavy assault battlecruiser so much like hacs that fanfest has said will be more like t2 attack cruisers with mwd bonus i think these would be a natural progression on hacsthen 4 of the bcs could become attack bcs although the navy bcs seem to have done this alreadyi would be interested to know if any of the csm agree or not and would post on this thread pleasetech3 ships need to be put down like a rabid dog drooling everywhere in the house they are out of line ccp ytterbium nerf missile range into place where is the td missile changeUFFFD projectiles should use capacitor abcs should be t2 habc and nerf web strength its still too high
well from what ive heard everyone say and i cant help but laugh is that ccp would not be able to pay its employees without the selling of plex sohow did they pay their employees before the selling of plex was implemented with candy how did they manage to give us free expansions before selling plex did they work all those years for free
i buy plex with real money to fund my game playstyle  i could mineratwhatever  i choose not to know why because im sure as heck not going to chew rocks for however much isk an hour when i can just pay to play for the time i want to spent in the game having fun not going to happen who loses out from this no one people who enjoy making ingame isk to fund plexs get a reason to do so and i still get to play they get to trade mine rat scam whatever they likewe all get to play eve in the way we wantsomeone still has to earn the isk to buy my plex which i then use to buy more stuff on the market to enable me to do what i want in game these people gain a plex which enables them to do what they want its not like im taking the isk away and locking it in a dungeon  its straight back there payinfg for things keeping the economy goingwe all get to choose our playstyles ccp gets to make money do you work for free and we all go home happy bunniescould you please explain how this is not analogous to real life and how this is in any way a detriment to the gameits called a market a sandbox a choice its called eve
youre an idiot plex allows people like me who can actually make isk to play the game without paying others foot the bill to ccp for usif you dont like it dont use it
did a doubletake at this solely because your character has the exact same name as the operations manager at the rl company i work for oooh i also agree with your point

overall i like all the changes suggested in the resource shakeup in odyssey just donUFFFDt call it a cataclysm  companion blog however i have a suggestion related to the iceore miningif ccp is reducing the ice in highsec and giving more ore incentive for players to move players to lowsec or nullsec then you need to do something about the compression game mechanics suggestions1 buff the rorqual stats for compressiona increase the iceore hold by 100b increase the compression factory slots by 100c decrease the compression time by 50 if my numbers are not realistic i think they are please do your own calculations and adjust them as necessary2 create a pos module for iceore compressiona make it big like a rorqual and take up a lot of cpupower resources on the posorb make it small like a refinery so you can put several of them on a posthis could be done instead of changing the rorqual stats or it can be done as a added featureoptionthanksloney
bumpcan we get this in odyssey
um no stop nerfing rockets stop nerfing missiles in general
if anything i would say torp range needs to go up a bit as opposed to dropping the range of hm and ham missiles have enough inherent disadvantages already for example turrets cant be firewalled and turrets cant be warped away from after being fired before they deal their damage just to name a couple combine those with the fact that torps cant hit  for full damage without a tp and you can see where i am going with thisbs missiles need work in general and the coming cruise changes are a good start the only reason torps look so good on bombers is because of the ridiculous bonuses they get from the hull itself on most any bs though they are barely short of laughable
i have to disagree with the range compare them to the other battleship weapons and you will see the range is rather similar and better and in some casesmissiles have advantages over turrets too like you cant miss  no cap issues to stop you from firing and more importantly you dont have to brawl at any level atm to use the high damage ammo besides rockets and even then its still got much higher base range than the turrets ammo types and faction rockets will give you enough range outside of scram range also look at hams compared to the the other cruiser sized weapons a drake can do 700dps ish at 16km a brutix cant even hit you at that range with null hail cant hit you conflag cant hit you  what does that tell youjavelin can hit further away than scorch and eveyone says scorch range is op again what does that tell youtech3 ships need to be put down like a rabid dog drooling everywhere in the house they are out of line ccp ytterbium nerf missile range into place where is the td missile change projectiles should use capacitor abcs should be t2 habc and nerf web strength its still too high
it tells me that you ignored all of the disadvantages that i pointed outyes missiles always hitif they arent destroyed en route by a firewall they also do total almost no damage to any form of sigspeed tanker with anything more than a paper tank as for the cap projectiles dont have to deal with cap usage and their range is pretty damned impressive with a proper setup i have seen ac setups that can hit from much farther away than just about any torp ship one could make the tracking argument but look at it this way anything small and fast enough to get under the guns of acs before they are dead is small and fast enough that torps arent going to do  to them anyway even though they always hitwhat you are overlooking is that the longer a missile has to travel the more likely it is to be destroyed on the way or to be avoided altogether since the damage isnt immediatebs missiles look sexy on paper but that doesnt always translate to sexy in spacekeep in mind that most of my arguments are geared toward the larger weapons because wellroflkets they just recently became even remotely viable for anything short of the hookbill light missiles tend to have decent alpha for a frigate but their dps output is trash except when fired from rlmls which dont exactly fit well on frigsas for jav vs scorch point see what i said above about missile travel time firewalls and warpoff
christ you dont halve concentrate on the negatives of missilesdoesnt justify their extra range  just excuses to keep their range more optravel time and firewalls arent much of a issue at short range but yes they do need to buff missile velocity and tracking but thats for the tdstestcs changes to help with but their is no point talking about battleships hitting frigs thats not really the point of battleships guns wont do much against a frig with transversal and small sigbut my main point anyway is more towards rockets and hams high damage ammo having in essence turret long range ammo range this is unbalanced clearly irrelevant of missiles disadvantages and missiles have just as many advantages to notetech3 ships need to be put down like a rabid dog drooling everywhere in the house they are out of line ccp ytterbium nerf missile range into place where is the td missile change projectiles should use capacitor abcs should be t2 habc and nerf web strength its still too high
for the t2 rockets i could see your point if not for the fact that their damage is pretty laughable when compared to acs or blasters now of course you can say that the damage of those turrets doesnt matter when a ship is out of their range and you would be correct however theres a reason that merlins and incursus are currently far more popular than say the breacher or the kestrel hell the only thing that even makes the breacher worth mentioning in the same breath as the merlin is its drone bay and what they can do with asbsyou cant just isolate the weapon groups however there are many mods that can increase the optimal falloff and tracking of any and all turrets all missiles get is rigs that makes their launchers tear even bigger chunks out of their cpu its actually very possible to make an ac cane that can outrange a ham drake is it ideal not so much but most ham drakes arent exactly running an ideal tank either give and take and all of thattry to compare things on a more reasonable basis by looking at the entire picture as you said theres the incoming td changes to missiles at some point so why not wait for all of that to play out before you open up a whole new can of worms with a nerf cycle that may need to be undone or even turned into a buff cycle to compensate
some good points there just exploring explosion velocity potential using 1 rig and javelin is still pretty low 258ms on rockets174ms on hamsnot sure how that translates compared to turrets using 1 tracking rig and their longer range ammo say barrageon the drake i have to disagree you dont need any tracking bonuses just webs and scrams will be more than enough to get the target below even what rage hams need to do full damage and without sacrificing its huge tankand this i can backup through experience of doing italso no the cane comparison doesnt work barrage vs javelin range without any range mods  21km barrage30km javelin225km scorch and 5km falloffand ofc barrage has 3km optimal range tech3 ships need to be put down like a rabid dog drooling everywhere in the house they are out of line ccp ytterbium nerf missile range into place where is the td missile change projectiles should use capacitor abcs should be t2 habc and nerf web strength its still too high
like the title says we should be able to spend concord lps on a specific faction to better our standing with them excluding pirates obviously

thank you all for your support guyslets keep this thread alive  thank you for 1 and dont forget to post a comment
complete support
in a word  barely
youre fairly new to the game so its understandable that you dont know how it was before plexes were introduced despite your ridiculous candy remarks ill give a serious answerbefore plex were introduced people traded directly in gtc you bought a gtc and sold it ingame directly for isk exact same thing as now except now theres an ingame item that represents it
ill do you a favour and give you a little heads up stop posting until you have a clue about the subjectdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
lmfao at the suggestion that you can pay to win in this gameactual player skill trumps everything else by several orders of magnitude

1 the weird semicircle belts really screw with immersion having massive broad belts that actually span a solar system would be pretty amazing  especially if the belts had interesting things to findexplore
i agreeif they are changing the static ice belts why not do the same with the ore bests and make 13 large ore belts per systemthanksloney

why yes actually all those people trying to sell you gold on tv are scams unlike bitcoin however at least gold doesnt gain and lose 50 of its value every 10 minutes
i support this because as a leader of an alliance skilled at separating morons from their money bitcoin offers a rich vein of untapped morons that will spigot more isk than tech moons ever did
max therion you seem like the sort of enterprising young gogetter we here at goonswarm recruitment are always on the lookout fornaturally someone with your talents would be offered an immediate director spot well just need the standard security deposit send me an evemail
i am sure that would depend on whether you accept calldurons
the only currencies that will always retain value even after an economy fails is precious metals such as gold and silver virtual currencies will fail just as easily as the false currencies we all use today
id rather invest in tinned food firearms medical supplies books on agriculture farming tools seeds and construction equipmentprecious metals are only that way because humans like shiny rocks  if the world goes so bad that money becomes worthless a years worth of food is worth more than its weight in gold the equpiment and knowledge to grow more reliably pricelessedit also lol bitcoins eve online isk is a more stable currency than bitcoin and we can print isk by shooting little red crosses with a spaceship

like isk for standing but with something less usefulit took you a long time to ruin your standings it will take you a long time to get it back the decision and its consequences were yours other ppl choose to pass the isk of farming tags so they get more incursions in return simple tradeoff
i have been thinking a lot about this little easter egg soundwave let loose during fanfesti agree but not only with what ccp puts into the belts i believe this would create a massive amount of player driven content as wellloney i am not sure about this as new players often default to using the civilian miner to make some isk in the very first few moments of their eve career and tackling scanning is something of a challenge even for vets
1i like the idea of making more options for compression instead of just the rorqual as the bottleneck factor but i think if they just change some of the stats on the rorqual there would not be a need for other things like a pos or station compression me
realistic i think it could be like thisrorqual stats for compressiona increase the iceore hold by 0b increase the compression factory slots by 300c decrease the compression time by 0 the size of the bay is fine and so is the compression time i mean its less ten a minute per cycle the real problem is the limited compression slots of 4 the rorqual should have 6 slots base with a ship bonus of 1 slot per level of ship skill this would be a maxed skilled rorqual pilot 11 manufacturing slots which also happens to be a max slots a maxed skilled builder can usesummary by only increasing the manufacturing slots from 4 to 11 this would make the compression mechanics of the rorqual and game play more inline with its intentional gameplayi hope the csm can really get the devs to take a look at this and make the simple ship changes to come out with the new patch i hope this helps
i like the idea of a pos module like the refinery it would be up to the devs to decide the specs of iti also would like to add something that maybe you can edit stations so it can compress ore too this would have several benefits i see 1 it would give the compress mechanics currently limited only to the rorqual other methods of compression2 it would also add more value to the compression industry i mean seriously why do you even have ore and compressed ores on the market as nobody buy or sell it cause it too much of a issue to do it3 it would reduce or eliminate the need for people to compress other items like rail guns and sensor booster etc i remember the reason you guys mad compression changes for lots of items but still people dont compress ore and ice cause its limited by again the horrible for compression rorqualsummary i like the pos module idea and i think compression should be allowed in stations tooi hope this helps
1 something needs to be done with compression mechanics
yes for a rorqual boost the ship should be the rolls of 00 mining ops nerf orca only allowed in hiseclowseci like the idea of the pos module but it should not replace the rorqual in his roleso the pos module should work at full speed in 00 50 speed in lowsecwhy not 10 speed in hisec and limited to one  pos

i know its been discussed a little but i wanted to suggest my own versions1  doomday scripts2  supercap siege modulesokay for dd scripts i suggest giving it the option of either scripting the aoe or the single target for the two scripting choicesa the aoe dd 300000 damage script would have a 030k range with 100 damage and falloff of 3170k range with 60 damage and finally 71100km max range of 40 damage anything outside the 100km aoe range would not be affected at allb the single shot dd 3000000 damage script would be exact ally like it is now so you can hit all capssupers and nothing lessnow for the supercap seige modules that if the carriersdreads have them why not supers too so when you put your siege module on it would d a few different thingsa increase tanking abilities or the damage abilities just like a dread but it should have a heavy cap penalty so it can not be used indefinitelyor b increase the command bonuses of the ship say and extra 20 per titan skill level bonus or something while in siege mode assuming its on grid to get this bonuses this also takes into account to let the titan be able to use 3 command modules at a time with nonsiege bonuses equal too a command ships or betterorc give ships some kind of other bonuses that would be useful and make it stay on the field such as someone suggested tracking bonuses but still not able to kill hicswell thats what i think yes no

when you are talking about the most powerfulexpensive ship in the game it is either going to be the iwin button or people simply wonUFFFDt use it nobody likes having something land in a fight that can simply destroy everything and leave likewise titan pilots will not risk such an expensive ship if it isnt iwin and if they run a fair chance of losing it that is why they are generally deployed in massive titan and sc blobs these days or not at alltherefore where do you tip the balance iwin or risk aversioni think ccp have got it right at the moment due to the ability of large coalitions and even some largemedium alliances to buildpurchase titans pvp would become more about who has more titans the problem i believe is one of proliferation if titans were indeed rare and we had a very limited amount of them in the game then your stance on buffing them may be justifiedas it stands titans do have a role in capital pvp as well as other useful roles and they could be used more for their combat abilities  but that is up to the players not ccp
lets look at battleship weapons shall we taking the odyssey numbers because theyre what will matter in six weeks and a skill v pilot with no mods or ship bonuses we see thatblasters have terrible range but with long range t2 ammo can reach a 31km optimalfalloff and falloff does count  its the equivalent to missiles being affected by target size lasers have much better range especially when you compare short ranged ammo because ammo affects optimal but not falloff aside from t2 ac  blaster ammo  such good range that with scorch they beat beams in the mediumlong range zone reaching to 55km autocannons well they have really good reach with high dps ammo and terrible reach with long range ammo but still get 42km optimalfalloff with barragenow lets look at torps they cap out at 304km with t2 long range ammo its 203km with standardfaction ammo and high damage t2 torps reach 169km the only gun that doesnt outrange them is the blaster which has about the same assuming t2 ammo if you look at t1 ammo they all can yes guns lose damage at range but they can actually reach rather further than these ranges if youre willing to accept low hit rates toolooking at long range weapons rails reach 66km with antimatter 102km with lead 145km with iron and 48160km with javelinspike t2 beam lasers get 50km 80km 116km and 42128km with t2 tachs get 58km 91km 131km and 144km for artillery these numbers are 74km 94km 110km and 59152kmnow for cruise missiles we have t1 missiles giving 148km and the t2 versions 106km and 74km so only artillery is outranged when t1 ammo is considered and none are outranged if t2 ammo is also counted on anything smaller than a battleship you want to be using precision which is the 74km range while the turrets can use whichever t1 ammo best suits the rangeon top of this the various tracking mods improve optimal falloff and tracking for turrets there are no similar mods for missiles only rigs and theyre also available for turrets and usually if youre using rigs for missiles theyll be to improve explosion radius andor velocity in a vain attempt to actually land full damage a pair of tracking enhancers will give about a 25 range buff varies depending on the type of turret and a pair of scripted tracking computers 35 arty gets over 50 extra range a single tracking computer gives a blaster with antimatter the same range as a torpedo guess which one has the better applied dpsso if anything torpedos could use a range buff considering their slow damage application the lack of range enhancers and difficultly applying damage to anything short of a sieged dreadnought you talk about following the pattern well the parttern you see with rockets and hams if applied to torps would have them moving 50 faster than they do now with the same duration and thus having 50 more range im all for that
you cant even mount them usefully of destroyers  theyre for making cruisers into frigate killers so far as i can tell which is another thing  do turret cruisers need to fit a special weapon system to be good at killing frigates
thats precisely where i was going with that point i generally tend to lump destroyers in with frigs when discussing weapon systems as destroyers are basically nothing more than frigates with more of whatever weapon they may be using obvious exceptions to that exist in the realm of t2 ships but thats far outside of the scope of this discussion
youve well distorted the figures to support youre argument blasters with null is about same range as javelin torps  but by the end of its falloff is pretty useless damageprojectiles with barrage will struggle to apply much damage at similar range to javelinlasers well scorch is the best at range and rightfully so with all its drawbacks now talking mods well tes are getting a sizeable nerf down to t1 te stats and tcs are largely unused as mid slots are very valuable for other mods missiles do have some rather useful rigs to buff tracking and range not to be scoffed at and ofc tps but im sure ccp are getting to adding missiles to tesso with that in mind and comparing small and medium weapons to rockets and hams my point is validas torps range is the same as hams so we are essentially comparing hams to large turrets which is very unbalancedtech3 ships need to be put down like a rabid dog drooling everywhere in the house they are out of line ccp ytterbium nerf missile range into place where is the td missile change projectiles should use capacitor abcs should be t2 habc and nerf web strength its still too high
so youre saying torps track better than blasters for having the same range thanks for putting that in perspective now i see why nobody use torps anymore i always knew torps and missiles as a whole were broken but now i am one with the wisdom which is behind that brokenness  the low range weapon also has worse tracking
csm please take a look at this tread

well theyre turning ore grav sites into anoms so youll see them right away also new scanning mechanic is awesome really simple to change the static belts to work like ice will work
would be awesome  gigantic belts covering multiple hundred kilometers  massive roids as well as normal oneswould be even cooler if we had real los mechanics line of sight  so that smaller ships ventures frigs and such could hide in belts  when attacked by bigger stuff larger ships barges battlleships orcas etc would have to stay on the edges  while smaller more maneuverable ships can dive deep and discover stuff like hacking and archeology sites and stuffoh and orcas and rorquals and such would need to be on grid to boost making security and ptarolling of belts mandatory for larger fleet ops
my thoughts exactly just in that little bit  could you imagine the sheer amount of emergent game play that could happen i have often wondered myself how a line of sight mechanic would make my wormhole space even more exciting let alone high sec and the lower secs
i propose the overall industrial endgame content industrial supercaps they would be able to either refine compress built or research depending on the new modulesthat are available they have huge ore and material bays organized like corp hangars several divisionsplus ship maintenance bays  but only industrial ships barges exhumers industrialists and their t2 variantscan be stored thereskills will be toincrease hold sizeincrease max prod  research  slotsincrease mobility it barely has any of course jumpcapable provides boosts like the rorqualan industrial mothership so to speak what does that mean  a real endgame mobile industrial base allowing to built modules and subcaps up to bc class and their t2 variants wherever you want of course slot numbers and such would have to be determined but imagine the possibilities it would provide for roaming industrial corps ninjaminining and such is all over sudden a real optionganking one of those would mean ultimate tearwaterfallsflame away
since ice wont be mined in belt that wspace lacks anymore but in anomalies could you add ice mining to wspacemining in wspace is currently a silly think to do we cant efficiently do t1 production and due to mass restriction hauling it to kspace is not really an option however if we could harvest ice for our fuel production everybody would do mining when some ice would appearplease add contents for miners and for people who like to shoot miners
i prefer cosbycoins for my internet cryptocurrency needs
and gold and silver will only retain their value as long as it has a demand when people are more worried about food shelter clothing and survival precious metals will take a nose dive kind of like the recent gold bubble that just took a nosedive already
i used the nerfed numbers if i hadnt there wouldnt even be a comparisonas for target painters well they help turret weapons as well to a pointham range is junk on an unbonused hull once you compare actual damage application hams on a cruiser hull are inferior to lasers if youre attacking other cruisers except in a narrow band from 25km to 30km unless the missile cruiser has a range bonus on its hull thus its not the missile systems that need a range nerf  if theres any nerf required its to hulls like the caracal
