i want the old jump effect back or something better this droplet effect doesnt do it justice when i was a young eve char i seen the carriers jump in i dreamed of flying something that cool now that i have a cap ship im stuck with a droplet

i completely agree with noa the old cyno graphic was so much better then the new one maybe you guys could take the old one and mix it with the distortion of the new one  just a thought at least bring back the old one
you know that hawkharpy has 80 base thermal resistance in shield right even more in armor also what does triple web and scram have to do with anything you didnt have any guns fitted it wont do much if anything to improve the effectiveness of a light drone

i remember the first time i hopped into a destroyer those many years ago first time was an absalute failure as i tryed to tank the thing then i went for the glass cannon approch but found that frigs could still tank the thing long enough to take my own destroyed out before then and then of course there are the t2 frigs that tank way harder and will survive longer and generaly have more dps the 25 rof reduction should be removed  there is no need for it at all but tbh dessies need a major overhaull and reworking when the only thing the one thing they excell in more than anything else is a salvage ship may as well swap the bonuses out for something for the salvager
great idea why hasnt this been implemented yet we just had a patch 
please consider this csm
as long as there is a public name history i would be all for thiswhen i first started eve i figured id play it for three months and quit like i did with every other mmo so i didnt put much thought into naming any of my characters now that ill probably play this game until they unplug it i wish i could get one name change on my characters to better fit who they are and what theyve becomeso with the public name history caveat i support this
assuming theres an aka supported
characters have a character id when you block a player the game adds its characterid in your block list not the name therefore even if someone changes his name heshe would still be blocked afterwards because the characterid didnt changealso i seriously doubt that scammers would be willing to repetitively pay the 20 fee or whatever the rename fee would be just to change their name everytime someone reports them for scammingi would really want this myself as long as changing someones name has some restrictions for example you shouldnt be able to do it on the same character more than once every month or so maybe even more you would also have to be in a npc corp just like character transfers for the same reasonsthis would especially be useful to all the newbies that didnt know they could use spaces and proper case in their character name and have names like ipodalot666i really dont see any good reason why this shouldnt be possible for a fee
i have not read through the whole thread but one limitation to name changing i have considered suggesting would be that the name change would tie up a second character slot rather than changing your name you get to create a new character and permanently link the two character slots together when you log in you can use either character slot and thats the name and portrait that you use during that session the other name would show as part of the character info tab and since all of the information is based off of the database id of your original character all standings and history would remain unchanged biomassing either character slot would wipe out bothessentially rather than an actual name change you would be paying concord for an official alias  doing business as namei would use this service even with the penalty i suggest in fact i would prefer it over just a name change in some ways as i would be able to fly in combat with a callsign and rp with a regular name

i like the idea of impshardw being produced by players thatUFFFDs why i support thatbut iUFFFDm not about the drugs thing it doesnUFFFDt make much sense to me to use them to make electical ciruits that imphardw are there are so many other useless items that seem to fit betterthing is i donUFFFDt really see the necessity of having an illegal activity in the productionchain of a legal productthe bodysalvaging thing sounds interesting but if you salvage the corpse you have to cut it apart therefore the body is being destroyed in the process collect it or make money out of it not both
supporting this so implants will be used more in 00

supportedship kill mails shows modules so why shouldnt pod kill mails show implants lostwars are measured in isk loss and implants add up
oooo that would be nice suport
because modules are fitted to the ship implants are not fitted to the pod
sure why not
not supported we have too much focus on killmails as it is they serve as unnecessary epeen vehicles and a way too valuable source of intel the contents of my head should be private to me alone once you shoot a human head with a 1400mm projectile dont expect to easily figure out what small implants were in it
last 4 petitions ive sent in over a period of a few months have been given cut  paste answers and in two cases replies that have nothing to do with the game mechanic im petitioning about like nothing latest one is what prompted me to make a proposalis there anyway we could have this issue brought up at a csm or something i know they the gms have alot to get through but after this last run of crap im starting to think they are creating alot of the backlog themselvesmy proposal is that ccp enforces a strict code of reading rather than the current policy of skimmingforwhatyouthinkarekeywords
would be nice not to have to escalate something just to get it read
not sure here i think they need to have access to the same tools to answer the petition by answer i mean fixing whatever we write in it well to get a faster response and accurate response and fair one i would say yes
right there is your problemthe gms get way to many petitions that are total rubbish assuming by few months you mean 3 lets take you as the average with more than 200k accounts in eve averaging 4 petitions every 3 months that means they recieve just under 8900 petitions a dayi think the real solution is people should stop petitioning for all the stupid stuff learn to write short concise non whining petitions and not fill their petitions full of emonerdrage and self entitlement no idea if yours are like that but i have seen plenty of examples that are from many another pod pilotfor the record in 35years of playing eve i have only made 2 petitions not counting the numerous isk spammers petitions i have made but those dont really count since they are meant to be skimmedtldrno
thanks for assuming they were all rubbish prior to the last few months last one i sent was nearly a year ago i dont petition every ship i lose or every little thing that happens i petition things that are screwedmy latest petition is the old im warping no im not oh im warping again great no wait  no im back at my starting position again no im warping yay gre  wait noalso youll note in my post that i stated that i think they create a mass of the problem themselves both my very recent ones werent read at all i think the gm saw a keyword there and just went to his bank of cutpaste responses it had nothing to do with what i was petitioning aboutyoure fine with that mate
i liked his emonerdrage comment very funnymaybe ccp could delegate some of the petition load to the isd volenteers or maybe they should consider hiring more gms if the current amount is overwhelmedbut people petitioning for stupid stuff doesnt help the matter not saying your petitions were about stupid stuff franga
this i dont know if idea about a special skill is the correct solution but something definately needs to be done to address thiseveryone should be able to loose their ship when they undockalso everything else in eve needs player interaction afk cloackers can sit 23 hours a day in a system without risking their shipand the worst part is you cant kill a cloacker if he wont decloack not even if you had a thousand players in system camping probing and flying all over the place with every ship module and item available in game how is this fair or balanced

sorry but this is just bull neither a single sb nor a recon can kill a lot on their own even decloaked those ships also have huge disadvantages over noncloakers a black ops may be dangerous but heh so can any other bs with a cloak fitted sitting in a safespotpsychological warfare as in making you too afraid to undock is a tactic not a weapon there are easy counters to this beginning with dont fly alone and yes this is fair as there are many situations in eve where theres no solo counter to something
getting tired of being ganked by our stealth bombers the downside to stealth bombers is drumroll theyre frigates use correct drones and you wont get ganked
not supported totally would mess up the stealth bomber after it just got fixed
totally support fuel for cloaks maybe one day ccp will realize having 2 day old scouts perma logged in every system is a stupid thing
not supported
not supported i would rather see cap or fuel usage per cycle or something probably cap as that feels more balanced but to help counter the bigger ships with cloaks on i would think that the cap usage is relative to the size of the ships radiuseg a covert op gets bonus so uses almost no cap a battleship has big sig radius so to cloak it means the cloak has to work harder and use more cap
no support cloaking is an important game mechanic and works well as it is making it possible to scan for cloaked ships is the wrong way to go about ittitan pilots need a way of going afk eg to sleep without the risk of it being probed and destroyed while the pilot is away and unable to fight backif youre worried about one sb disrupting a whole system then you need more buddies in system with antisb ships

absolutely notaccept that different races have different advantages both from a direct ingame perspective dps range etc to out of game convenience amarr not having to reload quit complaining that you cant afk pos bash if youre shooting something you should be at your computeri can respect the desire to implement this so that players experiencing lag dont miss rounds but thats a bigger problem if lag is keeping you from activating your guns lag is the issueagain while in theory this wouldnt break anything it encourages afk play which quite frankly is just dumbnot supported

simple and short proposalfuel bays are being added to blackops add a bomb bay separate to normal cargo to stealthbombers that is capable of holding say 4 or 5 bombs
i think the long term plan from what ccp hinted in their last dev blog is to have specialized bays for a lot more than fuel i know they are looking into adding an ammo bay of some sort already and this would fall in this categoryi guess it just depends how deep they are willing to go with this modification do they want a general ammo bay that combines all ammo types or have very specialized bays for turret ammo missiles and bombs separatelyi guess well see in august
i agree that there should be some repercussions for leaving drones behind however i personally have no intention of purposely leaving them in a fight or mission however im also stating that there needs to be repercussions on the other side of that argument as well for example jettison cans if someone were to take loot out of your can they would be flagged and youd have kill rights for x amount of time due to them stealing your items  i share the same logic for drones if someone steals your drones within y amount of time of being left they should be flagged for x amount of time  y amount of time being a time period before drones are completely free gamefor reasons of possible exploits on gates and other high sec areas i disagree with drones going awol  lol
you can reconnect lost probes so i dont see why you shouldnt be able to reconnect lost drones as welli support this
supported mostly because of disconnects
supported but with one changeif drones can be recalled from far space or remain connected when the players leaves the general area then the npc enemies and rats should still shoot at and destroy the drones even without the player present if this was not made the case then a player could drop drones in missions and let me take out rats as the player warped in and out to observe and refresh the connection timeout proposed a lot of effort to cheat but still sounds like cheating to me
perfect idea 
agreedre the intel issue i dont see how that should have any bearing on this everyone else in the fight is revealed the logistics guys should be too if you dont want to show up on a killmail then dont do anything
as if normal mining or even worse gas harvesting would be interestingever thought about all the poor orca pilots
if i may comment in defense of my suggestiona player with only 1 account that has trained up a roqual has already demonstrated a exceptionally high tolerance of boredom already they are not the most exciting ship to fly as they stand at the moment anyway
as true as that might be its not the ideal situation also you have to keep in mind is what happens to the rorqual pilot when he gets attacked with a 30min cycle hell be screwed if a fleet shows up its pretty much way too much expense and time sinks for very little reward isaac
i like the intent but the method is just way too dangerous no one would do it
i like the idea of distrupting enemy harvesting operation not sure though if the moon minerals would be really worth it though
you know that deathstars can lock and shoot anything on the grid right that said nobody in their right mind is going to park a capship next to a hostile pos in industrial mode and wait for a gang to show up and obliterate itmember of former gbc entity loses r64rich space immediately proposes methods of making r64s less secure news at 11
the stealing part is a good idea but i dont think multiple rorqs all mining on the same r64 is a good idea imagine a fleet of 20 rorqs all on a single 64 moon with increased yield
you can park your rorq on the other side of the planet
ive always seen bo and sbs very much in the mould of ships able to use stealth or superior movementlogistics to pick vulnerable targets and then destroy them before an enemy can counterattackas it stands most bo are rather lacklustre compared to ther t1 counterparts when we start comparing damage outputs and considering the isk investedi propose blackops are allowed to fit bomb launchers with damage boni to all damage types and an increased range to bomb deployment to bring it in line with the ranges used with close range turrets 2040 km
humm i dont really see why not its kind of the big brother of the stealth bomber in a way it should have a way to deal more damage
no support the black ops would have another role on top of its already multiple roles this is not a needed one keep it on the stealthbomber like ccp intendedisaac
recons are the big brother of the stealthbomber and recons cant
1 you cant warp in cloaked2 you need to be aligned towards your target3 you fire your bomb4 the heavy tackle that survived will get a point on you5 you need a new blackopsdoesnt sound too logical to me
you dont think the alpha from a bomb when used with a bo hotdrop will increase the likelihood of item 5 not occurringto an above posterrecons cant launch bombs seems a rather strange justification for not allowing bo to use them given the disparity in roles between recons and bo
no i dont think it will save you from it some heavy tackle or some ceptor who was buzzing a bit off will survive and happily hold you on the field while the rest will melt youstealthbomber fill that role betteredit horrible forum 
no way no please no no
currently they are the same kind however sometimes when scavenging around i just want the player wrecks to appear on my overview without having 1000 npc wrecks on there at the same time bascially i want wrecks to be split into two kinds npc wrecks and player wrecks
i think the covetor mining barge should have mining barge iv as a requirement instead of v theres no point at all in training for it since only a few more days can get you in an exhumerthe rest of the requirements should stay the samedo you think this would be fair or not
i agree
its rather stupid at the moment aint it
i definitely agree that the requirements for the covetor need to be reviewed at present the covetors only real purpose is an invention seed for hulks
since the mining barge skill is also the way to the orca i support this changeit would reasonably branch the tree between those who skill for a hulk and those who skill for an orca and it would make the covetor viable
since a hulk only requires about 23 days more training then a covetor and the hulk is supposed to be the absolute best i support thismakes sense and sounds fair
i hate mining cause its very very boring and if someone breaks my arm  my mouth with brocoli and force me to listen to barnie then i would minebut it makes a  load of sense i for one wouldnt want a covetor if i knew i had the skills to get a hulk i would even loan isk to get a hulk and pay it back with the amount of mins i can make with the hulki support this
you forgot to check the check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on checkbox
my bad
fully supported
i agree just because its not right decrease a mining barge skill requirement or increase exuumers to v for hulk too but1 price on minerals may not react well to lower requirements for miners2 if you really a miner then you need exumers v anyway
the way armor repairers and shield boosters work is just wierd imowaiting for the whole cycle to complete makes no sensewhile an armor repairershield booster is repairing the ship it is working and repairing during the whole time it is on so why we must wait until the last second to get a boost all of a suddenmy proposal is change the repairing system so that the repair process is distributed during the whole time that a module is oni hope my english allow me to be understood
why
would increase lag alot since the server would have to calculate a boost for your ship every 01 second or whateverbad idea
wrong it would be just like how the capacitor recharge itself
1 point to you since i believe calculation would be made per 1 second or so compared to 45 or so seconds or whatever recharge time you gotthe data still has to be sent to you
or passive shield tanks right
why not just let ccp decide if this would affect lag or not truth is nobody really knows how this would work so stop making assumptionsi support this feature
lag is always a valid argument however in this case i believe its a moot point i think repair modules are just fine right nowisaac
i wouldnt realy want this to happen unless it repaired alot of armour then it would kill armour tanking however i would like somthing similer done to the regenerative plates rather then them just adding a armour percentage maby adding somthing similar for medium slots and rigs so that a armour tanker could be fitted like drakeedit shield already have somthing like that their called shield rechargers and shield power relays
no you are wrong you are talking about the natural recharge rate of shields that is fine and it is not what im talking aboutim talking about how repair modules for both armor and shiels should work it makes no sense to me that you get a boost all of a sudden repairers are working the whole time you turn them on so the repair amount should be slowly given during the whole process as long as they are onand please stop talking about lag nobody know if this will have any impact on lag or not so just say if you like the idea or not
hmm no current system is fine except active tanking sucks compared to monster buffer
and why notyour sentence looks like a paradox to me if active tank sux so much why dont agree with op idea so to balance things a bit
the problem with active tanking in pvp has nothing to do with the issues being discussed in this threadnot supported tanking is currently set up to be as lagfree as possible anything that causes more possibility of lag is a bad idea
yet another proposal without understanding the problem the problem with active tanking right now has nothing at all to do with how often the shields or armor reppers cyclethe problem with active tanking is that ever since nos was nerfed everyone and their grandmother fits racks of neuts not to mention the amount of ships that a player will find himself up against in modern eve is a lot more than what the same player would have come up against when the modules were last modifiedwhen shield boosters and armor reps last saw any changes the typical fight was 1v1 or 1v34 im not saying blobs didnt exist three years ago but they were a lot less prevalent the amount boosted per cycle would have to receive a boost to keep things on par but im not sure that ccp is even interested in keeping things on par so i wouldnt look for any active tanking boosts anytime soon
i support this very much it should have been a nobrainer on the part of the dev team when they developed this window
i agree granted i dont have the problem the op has but i can see where it would be an issueif there is a general improve the ui topic perhaps this could get rolled up into it instead of pushing for a specific change it might get pushed through to the csm faster in that case
before i post the idea please respect the idea even if you dont like it and if you know how suggest improvements i tried hard to think this outwell bombs were created for the purpose of breaking up blobs they are damage based and the bombs that are not arent very effective anyway i think the system needs a new start to make them an effective antiblob tool while not making them overpoweredfirstly the idea is to make bombs a threat to blobs while not killing them but still being effective all the current bombs would be removed for a single bomb the name i thought of was random disruption particle bomb the info would be likeso as you can see the bomb would leave these disrupting particles in a 15km zone for 10 minutes now blobs would not want to be blobbed as the effects could be devastating the bombs would generate a random negative effect not like so random to be useless but their severity and what the effects would depend on the pilots skill level in bomb usagesome ideas for bomb effects werecannot use certain modules like target painters remote repsobviously would require a high level as that effect could be very overpoweredincreased signature radiuscapacitor recharge rate reductiondrone control range reductionthese effects may not seem huge but certainly you would not want to sit in a field where you couldnt remote rep plus even like 7 weak effects meaning 7 bombs launched at a blob would mean 7 new weaknesses youd have so the blob would want to move thus breaking it up the random effect portion may make the idea seem horrible but if the effects are decent then it keeps people from like super focusing the effects to do things like making gate camping impossiblethe random part is a bit iffy to me but if done right i think the bombs could become an effective tool against blobs the effects are mild and short term enough to separate a blob but not enough to make any form of camping impossibleany critique on the plan would be extremely useful and i am going to continue to refine it to make it good enough for implementation
i would like to see this bomb in addition to current ones this would be very interesting against fleets guarding stationary positions and camping i would prefer to keep current bombs as they are still interesting utility tool even though they are used rairlyi would likke to see this in action should be funny how about a bomb that causes damage over time in the area for the duration of 15 minuts
i think the current range of bombs actually does most of the things you are suggesting when used correctlya steady succession of lockbreaker bombs mean remote reps target painters and weapons are much reduced in effectivenessvoid bombs negate cap so a recharge bomb is in a sense just a duplicationdamage bombs essentially wipe out drone swarms and further to that are an effective means of breaking blobs in themselves when used in a coordinated gangall in all i think the range of bombs available is finenot supportedzos
the basic concept is good but its not perfect basicly u ask for more bomb types witch is good maybe we can use bombs that trow 15km radius bubbles this because its not hard to implement same as dictor bubbles but now we have 6 bubble bombs each bomb has its own bubble colour blue red green yellow purple and blackeach bomb has its own effectblue stands for  30 sig radius within 15km bubblered stands for  30 velosity within bubblegreen stands for  30 tracking within bubbleyellow stands for  30 agility within bubblepurple stand for  30 cap recharge rate within bubbleblack stands 1 warp stenght within bubblethe black bubble eccect bubble will give everyone in the bubble a 1 warpstrenght this means that people that are pointed with a disrupter can warp off but the onece that are scrambled can not this requiers alot of skill if it will be used buybbles have a duration time of 1 min to not make them too powerfull each bubble have stacking penalties this means that 1 bubble has only 1 effect and it cant be stacked
seems interesting to get another bomb in the field but this one could have an effect that the fc dont want or the people in fleet dont want how about a bomb that decrease the scan res of all ships in a 15km radius imagine this your in a fleet on a gate camping it and you got 20 people there imagine the effect of a bomb of that type scan res decreased at a point with makes the inty takes something like 30 seconds to lock that would not destroy gatecamp since other countermeasures exist for this but are not the greatest like the fof for exampleyou could say thats why the lockbreaker exist but thats a jamming tool that is impossible to counter with even with eccm cause its chance basedin other words your idea needs work since i dont see the benefits or the point with yours
also a very good idea but how can u be sure what the area of effect is and for how longyour need to be able to see your effect
area of effect could be the same as any other bomb to give it a fair use but the for the length i let ccp decide on this if you ask me for an idea on this i would say 30 seconds based on an inty scan res of courseof effect for each ship in a 50km radius the more ships on a gate the longer the effect will lastin the end if bombs will be more avail and cheaper then one of the outcome would be that gatecamp would either decrease in numbers or size
i dont support this people in general dont like randomness which is why there are different types of bombs at the moment
i like this a lot plus one minute keeps them from just being destroyed but one minute is a short effects for a 1m per shot weapon
when new players join the game theyre quite unaware of the long term consequences of killing those blood raiders or guristas in empire missions by the time theyre ready to venture out into 00 they have 7 or worse standings and are totally hosedi propose two changes1 install data centers for the various pirate factions2 allow all data center agents to be a repeatable mission with say a one month timerbeing able to switch allegiances with various factions at will with a good bit of effort and expense is in line with the sandbox concept
im very sorry about this but it took me a while to understand what you meant with your proposal so let me clear this up perhaps to people who went  wha wtf you target an asteroidonce acquired you point your laser at the surface of the rock and mineif theres nothing more to drill or mine at that specific surface you point it elsewhere on the same rock until the rock is no moreif thats the case that whould definitly cease the passive nature of mining one reason is you cant go look at a movie and mine at the same time or do something else in your house or worst at work some people mine cause there at work and pvp is not an option cause it requires too much attention besides these negative point i feel your proposal is a bit bettertrue i support it
not supported one word macro
make the roid overload your ship or modules in a way they would take damage if its used too extensively only in high sec this way the modules will take damage no matter what and you would need to stop your mining go to a station and repair your modules and ship for low sec and zero not damage taken since riskpeople that kill miners for fun it there to greet themthat would discourage or hope that kills macro once and for all this seems logical since the overload taking damage to a module system is there anyway make use of it then just a minor adjustment if you ask me
you got it somewhat right essentially a rock can be broken down into what would probably be 5 layers max each layer would be divided into sections better skills make the rock divide into more layers and more sections in those layers now a lower skilled person who mines a section that a better skilled player only mined part of just recieves a fraction of the ores depending on what they other guy leaves sections of the rock themselves can vary in size due to the consistency of the rock better skills allow more selectivity and faster mining options as for targeting the only difference would be the direct use of a scanner to select targets rather than free targeting and overview targeting like we currently doso you scan see a picture like the one above select a section mine and the image updates as the rock deterioratesi would expect any given asteroid belts to have maybe 1012 of these kinda rocks per system with a system dedicated to mining having much more massive rocks an more spread out areas one more thing assembly hall is about supporting ideas even if you dont think theyre possible so while you might not think the devs can pull it off if you like the proposition its in your best interest to support it anyways to help fuel further ideas for them
not really since you have to select the area of the rock constantly to get the minerals this looks like an active mining system from what i understand
how do you macro something that takes intuition
nice ideaid like to see rewards such as increased yield for skilled players
not suported this would break too many things people are currently used to its just too big of a change this late in the gameits well thought out but just too late and too complicated for most players at the momenttheres got to be other ways to make mining more interesting other than by inventing a whole different system such as this
you got a choice here either what the op proposed which makes more sense to me or a minigame like connect4 type of thing you know align 4 objects and score points lmao
just so you know every other system in the game has had complete redesigns and massive changes within the last few patches so your argument here really falls shortscanning used to be about dropping nonoverlapping probes all over the system and spamming the scan button every 5 minutes on the off chance that a site might be out there somewhere now its a minigame where you can visually move your probes around and actually see what your scanning for and get feedback on how close you are to finding itpvp used to be all about being the fastest the fastest ships and the fastest gangs either won fights or didnt have to fight due to their ability to get away with the need for speed changes pvp has been completely revamped into dps vs hitpoint buffertanks game where one side blasts away at the other and hopes that their dps can overcome their opponents buffer before their own buffer is depletedinvention nuff saida huge change to mining that is more interactive and less passive is just what mining needs im not exactly a fan of what has been proposed in this post but there are some very good ideas floating around out there to change mining into a more interactive process
ontop of a fresh new way to mine i think it would help lower the amount of macro miners in eve simply because programing a macro to mine roids that arent the same in make up would be difficult as it is right now a macro just warps into a belt and starts miningwith this active mining system it would be alot harder to have a program do it for you and it would defintely make mining more interestingsupported
fully supported it would be an utter travesty if the people who have been propping up the floundering beast that is fw werent recognised for their efforts
support
whenever bounties loyalty points andor salvage are adjusted or changed in any way there is never a retroactive adjustment such retroactive adjustments would be utterly gamebreaking it is meant to increase attractivity of faction warfare not to feed a flood of benefits to those who have already done it especially not to those who have stopped doing so
sorry no there is a lot i would support to make fw better but not retroactive rewards you guys knew that there was nothing in it and yet you spent time and effort on fw i admire that but please take into account that eve is also an economy some people would have participated in fw if they could have afforded the ships or could get rich in the process you cant invalidate their decision right now by screwing with what is essentially the pasti would expect some kind of bonus for you guys for your militia rank but not a gamebreaking fortune
that you knew what you could expect when you joined fw
supported
noi dont want eve to become a happy retroactive place
retroactive rewards are you out of your mindi spend more than a year grinding missions for the blood raiders before loyalty points were introduced do you think i or any other person who had been running missions suddenly got a huge bucket of loyalty points for all our previous work no we got jackwhat a pathetic egocentric proposal to make
like totally supported and stuff
definatly not looking for a fortune heck i doubt for me it would even mean more than 50k lp if it was completely maxed out rank based is cool we know ccp has kept records of everybodies ranks if i were to sign back up i would be the same rank now as when i left it would be easy enough to give x amount of lp per rank and i think everybody would be very happy with itkills the only kill info that is kept are the final blows yes i am on several hundred kill mails but due to the ships i fly i am only on a handfull of final blows thus receiving the km it is only those who get the km who will likely get lp something i think ccp needs to be carefull of abuse on and that lp will likely be small compared to the plexing rewards i would guess based on ship hull size  5 lp for a frig 20 for a cruiser 50 for a bs etc something that can add up but hey run a single level 1 mission and you get more lps so no none of this should or would be ground breaking i can probably get more lp running a couple of level 4s in an hour than i would with this so would most people it might bring some folks back to fw if they now have 3040k lp and want the faction navy mega which needs 200k
this and any militia rank bonus is the same bonus anyone else gets for their militia rank
this is one of the most balanced ships in the entire game not to mention also one of the most versatiletheres absolutely no reason this ship needs 7 turretsinstead why not focus on the real issue which is projectile turrets if anything in the minmatar arsenal has some shortcomings its turrets but certainly not the hurricane
that and a standard t2 fit brutix does 860 dps with 50k ehp
itt whiner demands ridiculously unnecessary buffyour arguments have been based on a hurricane not putting out good dps in its falloff as compared to a brutix at optimal try flying a blaster boat then complain about your damn falloff 
it doesnt have seven turrets but surprise surprise in addition to its six guns it can also fit a whopping two missile launchers for a grand total of eight weapons now i dont see your other tier 2 battlecruisers pull that stunt right
not supported your cane does also 662 dps even with 220mmham and 55k ehp
hurricane is not in need of love projectiles are
im sorry what cane is fine as it is it may be outdamaged by the brutix but it can put range on the thing and kill it without hitting blaster rangecant comment on the harby and i just avoid the drake in most situationsnot supported op evidently doesnt fly a cane
give the cane 7 turret slots or fix projectilesif i had to choose between the two id have the latter
love the hurricane as it is thanks probably one of the best balanced minnie ships very versatile fun to flyi agree with other posters that projectile turrets are probably where any balance tweaking should take placenot supported
tbh hurricane is very balanced and is in fact probably the best tier 2 bc no other bc can have excellent dps while fitting 2 medium neuts in its utility slots
cane has no utility slots fitting neuts means you do less dps you can fit neuts in harbingers drakes whatever as well adding extra turret wouldnUFFFDt really boost cane that much for close range 60 dps gain with 4 gyros it would simply make it better long range boat than it is nowheavy pulse ii with an multi 91 dps 4 heat sinks425mm autocannon ii with rf emp 100 dps 4 gyros63 dps advantage to hurricane however medium drone set of harbinger vs hurricanes 4 light  1 med set puts it to 16 dps difference alltogether
hurricane is fine
the hurricane is perfectly fine no support
supported  hard to tell the dif betweencruiser  hac  logistics  bc  cmd ship etc  plus being a column you can choose in the overview if you dont wantneed it  dont check it
eve has a learning curve for a reason good pilots put some effort into learning each ship and what it is capable of additionally knowing the class doesnt really help with gaining any understanding of its capabilities vs the ship or fleet you are in it is the ship itself you need to learn and its potential fit that are important since capabilities vary significantly even within classi dont see a need to spend any dev time at all on a small change such as thisnot supported
its small changes that make game betterlearning curve should imply gameplay and tacktiks and if you noticed developers are trying to reduce the curve it is a nightmare for a new pilot that is trying to do pvp to remember several hundred ship names by heart and you cannot afford to go showinfo on every ship you encounter because by the time you figure out what ship it is it either runs or takles you
i think youre completely missing the point eve is not only for the elitist such as you casual players also play this game and if something like this could help that learning curve then so be it
even if this were to be implemented you only know a little bit more not enough to make any difference so instead of a bccruiser hull and a zealot you know its a hac and a zealot new players still dont know what the hell a zealot is capable of and have to search it up anyway for its stats as to get a good understanding of its capabilities
i do and so do most competent pilots i know its not that hard
not needed for you maybe but theres a ton of casual players who could really use this
pretty useful imho

message i got when replying here time flux detectedyou are going too fast wait a minute and try againthen yes
so 450 dps from drones alone is not enough if you factor in that you can still fit bonused blastersrails just tried 3x dual 150 ii cn am 1 mfs ii just 600dpsyou live in a strange worlda cerberus eg gets just 394dps hml ii 3x bcs ii with perfect skills and cn scourge 440dps with scourge fury so you outdps it just with drones and can still add dps from turretsthat said you didnt really complain about too few dps on an ishtar rightedit typos
please visit your user settings to reenable images
this is why people should not use eft that 450dps came from using gardeiis your cerberus will just stay at 50km and shoot that 0dps ishtar to ashes in no minute on the other hand eft only shows theoretical maximum dps which never meets real dps why didnt you try ogreiis as it will give 475dps with all support skills at lv5 and that means according to your logic most frigs dying in a matter of a second am i right the thing about this discussion is that its not a really a whine about dps but a pointing out some illogical bonus structure people should never use eft or at least not before spending a few years ingame
i prefer the gank nature of said ships
his whole point was that his drones are not strong enough if you now bring on resistances sig radius and speed and all the other factors that count in for effective dps they apply quite similar to each weapon typeimho the ishtar bonuses are fine if you use medium hybrids you get rewarded if not you still got a very decent base dps do we want to talk about the cerb pilot having to switch to unbonused ammoand about the 0dps ishtar  he can happily warp out and laugh at the cerberus pilot or switch to mediums and  it if the cerb doesnt warp out if each of them brings a mate for tackling they get rewarded for another important aspect of eve teamplay
ccps stance on plexes are that they are ingame items and shall be treated as such
ok it seems i am alone on this issue  therefore i withdraw the proposalgreetings belmarduk
supportedbut to make it work properly there would need to be full client side lip sync with the model animations at which point you may be looking at a complete off line scriptable client anyway
x the ninja salvager should be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because the mission runner owns the wrecks and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamic
dont expect a change ccp are icelandic descended from vikings for whom theft was a way of life thats probably why they choose to see wrecks as not belonging to anyone ironically they didnt see things that way about cod in the 70s

and an 80 base thermal resistance doesnt make it op admittedly 12 tps wouldve been better than the extra webs but i wanted it to be somewhat realistic if i was actually expected to hold a harpy down in my 100ms dominix id need some damn good tackle not to mention webscrams do help small drones hit as they slow down the target  ultimately increase the drones rof since they no longer need to chase
if you are worried about your drones missing use warriors they have much better tracking and are faster than hobgoblins and explosive is one of the harpys weaker resists also if 80 thermal makes the harpy overpowered you would agree that t2 frigates cruisers and battlecruisers are all overpowered then nearly all of them have quite high base resists
warriors also put out a significant amount less dps especially when comparing the t2 drones however thats not my argument as far as overpowered ships t2 cruisers  bcs are infinitely easier to lock down than frigates scram web and theyre fish in a barrel frigates on the other hand generally require at least 2 webs to be fully tackled by anything cruiser hence i think afs are overpowered if anything not underpowered as for other t2 ships i think theyre for the most part fine as is aside from build costs
so the harpy is overpowered but the eagle with exactly the same base resists the same 3 bonuses plus a 4th bonus for 5 shield resists per level isnt

i agree with the above besides that i support destroyer changes i hated getting killed by anything bigger then a frigate the shipmy thrasher had very low versatility not to mention you dont get the full affect out of mwds since destroyers arent frigates
agreed destroyers are pretty worthless as anything other than l1 mission runners and salvaging boatsas others have said theres no reason for the rof penalty to exist destroyers are the only ship with an innate hull penalty right the sig radius is slightly too high and the hull optimal bonus while useful for some fits is particularly unfair for the catalyst which in most other respects seems to be designed as a blaster platformid suggest dropping the universal 50 turret optimal hull bonus for a 50 tracking hull bonus and dropping all the tracking speed destroyer skill bonuses for alternatives more tailored to the individual ship id also consider upping the base velocities slightly  as these ships would no longer be designed as extreme range frigatesnipers theyd need some other way of keeping their targets in rangeas a personal thing id like to see the catalyst reconfigured into a droneboat too but thats just me
if people already take the time to keep track of charachter exchanges in forums then whats a few extra clicks before important deals to see previous names seems rather easy in comparison unless maybe you need to do it on a large number of peoplemight be a point in making the information about previous names as easily accessable as possiblefor exampleyou would have your new name on overviews channels local etc but if someone clicks show info on you the list of previous names is visible in smaller text directly under your name right there on the fron page only one click required that way a namechange cooldown of say 6 months should help in keeping that list shorti think the estetic value of more people around us having decent names should outweigh whatever inconveniance this may cause
yup dont see a problem here all the agruements that have been raised against this are basically oh no ive gotten so used to the tools available for me to make assumptions about people that i dont want this in other words mootsupport
the csm already brought this to ccp and they said it was not going to be done why do you keep bringing it up
an excellent idea the fw setup used at the current time is lacking too many situations exist that need adjustment in fw
agreedto an extent while i would love to see further development in items acquired from npcs as in very few items  t1 bpcs and skill books only perhaps this idea does need some work instead of npc drugs which could be used in t2 boosters how about other trade goods the possibilities are wide open but you have a good start
approve minus the corpse bit thats just morbid and i can already hear the upinarms rioting of parents when a game encourages players to use parts of dead bodies to help improve your characters attributesmaybe use salvage instead
i start to wonder why we actually have lp stores if all the lp items are just going to be sourced from other places instead faction weapon spec skillbooks were good in lp stores and then got seeded on market now you want to do that with implants as well the only thing left will be faction loot and faction loot tends to be crap because its limited by tags and nobody collects tags because you have to lose access to half of empire permanently to get tags in quantity the current system is fine im all for player industry but this just seems like an attempt to extend it for the sake of extending it
ccp had promised implants production from the midas expansion the fabled industry expansion later it was shelved with most of that expansionsome of your suggestion are interesting even if i feel herschel has pointed a real problem but this need to be implemented carefully this could end with caldari getting missile railguns and shield related hardwiring and gallente only getting blaster hardwiring then there is the fact that no lp store sell bpo they only sell bpc giving them the opportunity to sell a unlimited number run and copyable bp make the reward almost useless in a short timespan if you add the absurd number of lp necessary to get a bpo from the lp store and you will see that we risk some serious repercussion on the market btw there are already several t2 hardwiring look those requiring cybernetics v
i like this it would also decrease the cost of the implants im sure i get tired of paying tenshundreds of millions just for the basic attribute implants
youre not a very old player are you two years ago they cost about 3x what they do now
while i like the idea of being able to manufacture implants i do not see the reason why to use existing resources for their production those resources are already in use somewhere else so let them stay thereinstead it should be some completely new resources and methods for gathering and production that should be needed to produce implants
not a bad idea
supported because eve is a dark cold world if youre dumb enough to get yourself podded you deserve to get laughed at

it does seem the procedures have some holesfor example there is no communication channel between gms and devs it seemsyou are unable to work through an issue with a gm compile all the information then escalate to the devsinstead you have to start from square one again with a bug reportlittle inefficiencies like this may well be eating a lot of time tho im sure ccp has the numbers to see bottlenecks
this goes back into my original post there are so many petitions that ccp outsourced some of the gm duties to a 3rd party vendor in germany they most likely did this since it would provide a built in on demand scaleabilityif ccp were to hire enough gms to allow ever petition to be read throughly with an individualized response written for each one ccp wouldnt have enough payroll budget left to staff much of anything else
any company that writes individualized responses for petitions of the type that ccp gets is barking mad cutting and pasting is the only sane way to deal with floods of identical issues just because they sent back copypasta doesnt mean that they didnt read your petition  i am not cruel enough to tell gms that they have to spend all their time typing and retyping all the same pleasantries for 40 hours a week until their brains melt and they find a better job that said the process could use some improvements
yeah im not saying i have anything against the copypasta i have something against a copypasta that has nothing to do with my petition ie they havent read ita corp mate of mine had a copypasta petition response to his ship being blown up while docked and all the fittings dropping including the rigsbut apparently everything was okay and the policies regarding reimbursement are strict and need to be adhered to
hey i never claimed it was perfect it obviously isnt i was just addressing the bit where people complain about copying and pasting  its a complaint ive heard way too often
another issue with gms is their lack of unification on rulespolicies but thats well another issue altogether

i know everybody else that uses the forums a lot is also having this problem and i know that im not the only one that is being extremely annoyed by itim talking here about the bugs in the cookie session management of this forum the session cookie is what tells the forum if you are still logged in or if your session has expiredsomething with this code is seriously wrong or the session expiration timeout is way too short either way sometimes i find myself having to login two or three times before it sinks inif youre logged out and you try to post something the application will refresh the page without posting to log you in but then you have to click submit again why not autologin and postim not asking for a whole new forum system although that is also long overdue im only asking for ccp to fix the cookie session management so that it actually keeps me logged in for more than 15 minutes at a time
please
15 minutes youre lucky there are days i cant stay logged in long enough to click into a forum  try about 15 secondswhat really cheeses me off about it is this has to be something that was changed because it didnt used to behave this way
some days the forum works fine other days i cant post because i logout within seconds
yah this has actually gotten worse rcently i type a post go afk for 30 seconds and have to relog wait a minute and then repost in order for it to actually go up its insanely annoying
i totaly support this and will raise it for next meeting btw i couldnt reply on this topic for more then 3 minutes and i had to reloged 3 times to actualy got reply button to work
i support this and have a question at the same time when im typing such a long post that the text is scrolling down its getting bugged aswell the scroll bar is moving up and down and i cant seee my own text when im typing it anyone esle got this problem
ccp recently stated it was 5050 oldnew codeid prefer 8020 with expansions not being marketing exercises that are promptly forgotten after release
i think people tend to notice minor bug fixes and they enjoy them as well  they just dont go to the forum and state that they doand while it is true that you rarely get positive feedback not just on bug fixes on anything  people are eager to complain and reluctant to praise they stop to complain about that specific part and probably start to complain about something elsei think some people would disagree on the they just fixed scanning partwell i guess its all open for debate but adjusting a bonus or a fitting requirement is not exactly what i call a bug fix imo thats mere tweaking parameters making sure that dock warps to the selected station and actually docks 100 of the time is a real bug fix for mebut that may be splitting hairs however given the current rate of introducing new bugs with new features i think the 5050 approach is not sufficientimo this leads toa too many new features depending on buggyunstableunbalanced parts of the game  making them buggyunstableunbalanced as wellb increasing the feature base faster than it can be maintained a new feature is old after the release it is shipped with wanting to be maintainedc spending most of the bug fixing time on the bugs of the newest features because those bugs are the most annoying and of course no one wants to make it any worse than it was before  and if people are living with certain bugs for months or even years they will survive another week or so right
you obviously have only a shallow understanding of the process of software development in a commercial environment it just doesnt work that way ccp states that they spend 50 of their time on bug fixes and 50 of their time on new features they cant keep bug fixing why because they cant do this because it is just too expensive and takes too much timei want the software to work well obviously but i also want new features that add to the richness of the gaming environment if ccp went through the exercise of fixing every bug that was worth fixing you wouldnt get any new content for years plus from a developer point of view bug fixing isnt exactly the most exciting part of the jobccp are doing it right or as good as can be expected they continually iron out bugs they continually add new features yay 15 update im a happy customer and as long as the client doesnt crash hard or a bug renders the environment simply unworkable i shrug at the occasional bug and be done with itall the problems you mention are real and no doubt annoying but if you know that theyre there you have to work around the problems and learn to live with them until such time as theyre fixed there is no use getting worked up over it when youre done ranting the bug is still there and you spent some time of your life being needlessly unhappyinstead you could be zipping around in space working towards universal dominance i know i amabulurd bonifaceme meceo
im not sure how i feel about this ive always kind of liked having to make your own decision on how to delegate cargo space should you bring more cap boosters more ammo extra fittings i wouldnt say i dont support this but i think an alternative might be to give a small boost to some cargo holds
read the latest dev blog about apocrypha 15 in august its already planed to have specialized cargo bays
no having to go back to a base ship and reload bombs before making your 3rd run is just fine
oh i know that but that doesnt mean i have to like it d
bombers should have bomb bays i hope the new specialized bay technology makes this happen

there are a lot of people who do not like the current doomsday mechanics most of their arguments boil down to one thing doomsdays should be used to give a side an advantage in a fight not to end a fightwith the number of titans currently in game it has become far too common place for alliances to bring multiple titans on grid and completely wipe out a fleet using doomsdays this strategy ends a fight usually before it begins the change i am proposing is two parts1 doomsday damage reduced to 45k with max skills2 limit number of doomsday firing by all titans in system to one per 15 minutesthese numbers may need balancingby limiting the number of doomsdays fired in system of all titans in system to one per 15 minutes this would eliminate the double triple etc doomsdays that only serve to stop a lot of people from enjoying a good fightbasically if there is to be a doomsday weapon in game it should be used to gain an advantage in fights not to end them
i have seen a lot of good proposals for doomsday balancing this is not one of them in practice youd be making trillions of isk obsolete because nobody would use ddd any more  wiping drones and interceptors is not enough to justify risking titans
i already posted a thread about the covetor skill requirements but after a more thorough analysis i realized that the issue goes far beyond that ship the requirements for the whole mining barge and exhumer classes are out of wack and not linear the training curve is not constant enough between each tier of mining barge which makes the retriever the only viable barge to use the procurer is worthless because for very little additional training you can fly a retriever the coveter is also worthless since only a few more days of training will get you in an exhumer the mackinaw is not so bad but not really worth it either since the only difference between it and the hulk is one level of exhumerhere is a list of the current requirements for mining barges and exhumerseach ship is compared to the previous onelegend new 1 2 sameprocurer astrogeology iii rank 3 industry v rank 1 mining barge i rank 4 mining iv rank 1 science iv rank 1retriever astrogeology iv rank 3 industry v rank 1 mining barge iii rank 4 mining iv rank 1 science iv rank 1covetor astrogeology v rank 3 industry v rank 1 mining barge v rank 4 mining iv rank 1 science iv rank 1skiff astrogeology v rank 3 exhumers i rank 5 industry v rank 1 mining barge v rank 4 mining iv rank 1 science iv rank 1 spaceship command iv rank 1mackinaw astrogeology v rank 3 exhumers ii rank 5 industry v rank 1 mining barge v rank 4 mining iv rank 1 science iv rank 1 spaceship command iv rank 1hulk astrogeology v rank 3 exhumers iii rank 5 industry v rank 1 mining barge v rank 4 mining iv rank 1 science iv rank 1 spaceship command iv rank 1continues in next post

i like the addition of spaceship command it just makes sense i would also like to see a little diversity in t2 for miners something like the did with haulers in the blockade runners less raw mining potential but covert capabilities or inherent warp stabs maybe even a miner that can fit probes and gets a good bonus to grav sites
the procurer isnt worthless because of the time to train to a retreiver the procurer is worthless because you can outmine it in a combat shipbefore i trained for mining barges i was using a hurricane to mine in i didnt bother getting a procurer because the hurricane actually mined faster than a procurer could even with an mlu fittedi went straight to a retreiver because that was the first level of barge that actually boosted my mining ratesmy only real problem with your suggestion is that it doesnt address the central problem that the procurer and the skiff are essentially useless shipsthat aside i do agree that mining barges need a good thorough looking at as i pointed out in your other thread however in retrospect i think it needs to go beyond just skill requirements
the small versions procurer and skiff can be useful if someone doesnt want to train for cruisers and battleships which is the case for most specialized miners out there my mining character for example concentrated all his training to go from frigate to mining barges as fast as possiblefor someone who just wants something better than a frigate to mine the procurer would be a good thing to buy if the learning gap between it and the retriever wasnt so small same goes for the skiffthat said i do agree that the ship bonuses for those two ships could be better to make it worth it even more
no problems i see with the addition of spaceship command iii for t1 barges and mining v for covetor and above i do find the idea of requiring science v for the hulk odd given that of the mining related science skills only hydromagnetic physics has that as a prereq astrogeology requires it at iv as does metallurgy if you really want miners to train science v the mackinaw is the place for it if the intent is merely to add a few more days to the hulk requirements i think exhumers iv is a better way to go
yeah i thought about that too but science is a rank 1 skill while exhumer is a rank 5 skill one level of exhumer is more than a few days of training which is why i thought it would be too much of a gap but it would make sense to me as well if others are accepting the changeaccording to evemon on my miner which has learning skills and attributes optimized for industry skills with 3 implants it would take around 4 days to get from science iv to science v while it would take roughly 7 days to go from exhumer iii to exhumer iv is 3 more days too much
i agree with both your points there and im adding my support which i forgot to do earlier this definately needs a looking over pure miners who arent training cruisers and up probably would find the procurer useful but i doubt my situation was unique or even that uncommon especially for people who only have time to play one characterall of that aside i agree with your proposed skill changes but i sincerely hope that any review ccp does of these ships goes beyond the skill requirements alone
humm maybe that could be something done to make the procurer and the skiff more useful make them the perfect ninjaexploration miners they would be quicker than the other ships of their class mine a little less but still able to use a strip miner and gas harvesters be able to fit a core probe launcher and have a slight bonus to scan probe strengthi dont know if its possible but to make it very specialized the strength bonus could be only for sites of a particular type gravimetric for hidden belts and ladar for gas clouds
it took me around 4 days to train exhumers iv 4s stats optimized around a plan that has a lot of other ship skills in it seemed to me time well spent for the added yield though i dont plan to do exhumers v any time soon so i think a lot of miners would be training it anyway
i like this good proposal and better done than most of the similar ones

this proposal simply makes no sense sentry drones are fine and balanced nicely  the range vs dps tradeoff works far better than it does on the standard combat drones the only change id even consider making is to have the t2 versions require the drone spec skills so that they ge the same 10 damage boost that the t2 combat drones get also why would you ever complain about having too much optimal range having too much optimal is simply not possible  more is just better and you cant limit rigs to a specific class of ships
they all should get the same damage multiplier aswell so the only differance will be the type of damage they do

hello i am wondering what information anyone can provide i want to use jump clones and almost have the needed standing but i am looking to use them with a corporation i run missions for other than my default corp any ideas if this is possible
bo dont use bombs any more than an orca fits mining lasers or a fleet command ship flies around in the thick of combat it is not a combat ship it is a support ship used to bridge covert fleets trying to turn it into a bigger stealth bomber is just doomed to failure
i think this is an excellent idea i would make just one slight tweek though instead of giving them a bonus to bomb damage give them a bonus to the nondamage effects  jam strength for lockbreakers and energy drain for voids this would make bombers the king of damage bombs and able to use nondamage bombs while bos specialize in support bombs but can also use damage bombs
bleh dont steal unique weapon system black ops should stay as a mostly logistical platform
incredibly low priority but sure
i can definetly see the convenience factor here but i dont like it a floating pile of wreckage is a floating pile of wreckage i can see perhaps an overviewfilter option for the size of the wreck but im not sure it makes sense that ship sensors could tell a gurista battlecruiser wreck from a ferox wreck that had a player pilot
i more or less agree with this unless wrecks still carry transponder signatures or some such nonsense
well you can see owner and ship class so id wager that they do
the status quo is dumb hasnt made sense since invention dropped hulk prices 80
leave the astrogeology requirements as is make covetors require mining barge iv and hulks require exhumer iv consistent and provides a good time gap to use the covetor
this used to make a lot of sense however when the exhumers dropped within reasonable buying range everyone could afford one making the retriever absolutely redundant with those skillschanging the mining barge from lvl 5 to lvl 4 will make it useful for not only hulk productionsupported
thread locked by original posters request please see this thread for more info on kaylans proposal
honestly i think this would require an entirly new type of ship strike carrier or something that has a more dedicated role smaller and faster than a normal carrier but more damage and little to no logistics
moms are never going to be defined as anticapital platforms  the finances of it simply dont work there are two ways to justify spending money on a supercapitalwell three but i dont count epeen they have to either defeat enemy fleets or support your own fleet to such an extent that the effect is worth the price tag right now titans do both of these and moms do neither thus titans are the primary strategic asset of major alliances and motherships are vanity hulls for people with more money than brains bomber drones will not solve thisunless theyre powerful enough to warrant comparison to ddds and as such theyll only distract from a motherships true role on the battlefield
the problem is they do not any unique role atm this will make them usefull actually give this to moms
youre right that they dont have a role right now my point is this wont give them one itll just make them go from being 2x a carrier at 20x the cost to also being 1x a dreadnought at 10x the cost its exactly the same problem that they have right now just in a slightly different flavour their role is fleet support  the problem is that they arent capable of it right now
the issue as i see it is that the other races turrets fight in optimal lasers fight in optimal and blasters fight in optimal but projectiles as we all know fight in fallofflasers get a better optimal range with each tier of gun in a class blasters get a better optimal with each tier of blasters in a class but projectiles have the same falloff no matter which tier you pick a 220mm ac ii has the same falloff as a 425mm ac iiso if dual 180mm ac iis fire faster track better and have the same optimal as a 425mm ac ii then what is the benefit of fitting the bigger gun the dual 180mm ac iis track so much better in fact that they will do more damage to same size targets and actually hit smaller targets unlike the 425s therefore there needs to be something that actually makes using theh 425s a viable optioni propose that the falloff should become increasingly better as the tier of gun becomes larger for exampledual 180mm autocannon ii8km falloff220mm vulcan autocannon ii10km falloff425mm autocannon ii12km falloff
i support this even though i believe not just medium guns need a buff to falloff
please do this to all projectilesi noticed this when i was fitting large dual 425s to my dominix for additional damge in mission running i had no spare cap and no i had no cc rigsi niticed that difference between range on my dominix and my corpmates teppests 800mm guns is minimal and the damage difference is tiny and i get the benefit of having better tracking so yes that is not all rightalso turns out that large neutron blasters have range just couple kilometers shot that of large projectiles but have massive advantage in dps that is not the case with mediums conclusion increase range on large hightier projectiles and cut it a little on medium 220mms
i see absolutely no need for this change the benefits are negligible enough that the player confusion from it alone would outweigh any good not supported
one of many minor ui fixes this game needs
interesting concept but im not really a fan lockbreaker and void do most of this already i dont see the need for more
i proposed a while back to use epic arcs to accomplish the same purpose and were waiting on the csmccp minutes being posted to find out what happened with that if my proposal goes through i think itd be better but failing that this could work as well
scanning was only a very small part of the game and it was still new enough that it didnt have time to sink people hated the old scanning system and not that many used it because of it ccp hated it too thats why they changed it it was not working well and the change was neededmining on the other hand hasnt changed much since day one because it works well as it is its the main source of income and the base of the economy you need mining to build things and you need things to fight so without mining you got nothingbecause it is so much the root of everything in eve online you cant just completely change it like this people just wont accept it and quit some might like it but most wont people like change but not big changesi agree that making mining a little more interactive would be nice but you cant just replace the current system with something completely different its too much of a big change and its way too late in the game to do this without really affecting the way of life of pretty much every player in the game
this has already been discussed in length and was presented at a recent csm meetingalso to clarify neutral rr are flagged in exactly the same way as any other rr as soon as you rr anyone you receive a 15 minute aggro timer during which any of the people who may at the time of your rr shoot the person you rr may shoot youa  b shoot eachother c remote reps a and can be shot by b for 15 minutes after his last rr cycleat any time you may dock when remote repairing or giving other projected effects unless youve actually attacked someone

not to be rude but if you only keep playing this game for the possibility of being able to walk into stations one day i think youre doing it wrong
well get a new novel but seriously  when wis becomes available it has the potential to draw pilots away from what really matters piloting a ship through space exposing yourself to the inherent risks of being a pilot in a cruel worldwis needs to blend in with normal gameplay and yet give enough incentives to leave your ship i prefer that ccp dont rush wis it should work on release also apocrypha 15 is not a full expansion just some more content appetizers if you want if youre looking for something unique and new you may want to try racing there are two race organizers to my knowledge

hiwhile nicer and more realistic what ever it means in a fictious environmentgraphics are always welcome i dont think that it is the biggest priority at this time i give you three reasons for this1 the graphic engine and effects have been improved recently and massively2 eve is one of the few games that manages to get your heart pumping without special effects i wouldnt have pulled this off3 usually the most i see of my drones is an x floating in space whatever graphic improvements ccp make they have to scale up to large fleets aswell rather then support additional effects id like to see a replay function why  well because to appreciate the effects you need time to watch them if you had time to watch shiny effects in this fleet  id say you where doing it wrongi hope this was somewhat constructive
signed more epicness required
yes back to the old cyno graphics it was such a nice picture and sound when they jumped out ore jumped in
the eagle is a cruiser and costs quite a bit more both in isk and sp the harpy is a frigate again im not saying that afs are overpowered as is but they certainly could use a nerf more than a boostedit typo
the merlin is a frigate and the moa a cruiser and they both have the same 2 bonuses i guess the merlin needs a nerf
i think this would be a great thing to do for the v15 release in august
nopei guess the merlin needs a boost
hmm youre right my comments above neglected the larger falloff range of the blasters even though i was attempting to suggest the cat become a better blasterboat would suggest instead to give it either a double 50 falloff bonus which is better than a single 100 btw 25 damage or 25 rof bonus so it suffers less when fighting in falloff in other words balance like the thrasherunfortunately your main point here would be a disaster one of the major issues that all small ships have and not just in solo play is the range  speed  damage advantage that the interceptor has if you as a destroyer are going up against t1 frigates this is not so much of an issueyou have the range bonus and tracking to deal with a relatively slowmoving frigate at about 24km and they die fast enough that your anemic damage will drive them away in shortordernot so with interceptors first you will never be able to influence the fight due to speed as even the slowest interceptor is going to be 4x the mwd speed of a destroyer second it is very hard to get enough range damage and tracking into one place on the ships to even drive an interceptor away the cormorant is the one ship that can reliably do this with rails and a sniper fitmeanwhile since your dessie tanks like wet cardboard the often also small damage the interceptor is doing will kill you first god forbid theyre using a ship with a range bonus to points and orbiting you at 30km its extremely hard to get small guns out that far trust me ive triedif anything dessies could use even more optimal range imoon to your second idea and a related pointid love to see destroyers split into two main base shipsa ranged ship more or less like we have now and a tackling ship both of which are optimized to taking out or driving off frigates of various sorts the ranged version would be better at taking on interceptors and the tackling version better at handling assault frigates and both would do fine versus t1 frigates both would be able to tank to one degree or another based on racial characteristicsid love to see the catalyst turned into the tackling destroyer variant optimized for blaster work and possibly even having a scrambler range bonus that would free up the ranged gallente ship to be a droneboat with drone speed and mwd speed bonuses drone damage and an active tanking bonus a kind of minimyrmidon but really designed to get drones out there fast and have them stick to the target without spending all their time in mwdmodeanyway im glad to see people agreeing that the destroyer needs some serious love its a beautiful shipeven though with weapon grouping we dont see that seductive full row of guns anymore krum
i would love some dessy love supported
gimme
lol exactly other games such as world of warcraft have this service and it never caused any problems you cant do it more than once a month and it costs 20 or 40 i cant remember either way all of the arguments against this proposal are unfounded and unjustified so i really hope ccp considers it regardless
i like this idea a lot i personally had the bad luck to select name having d for first character without knowing how the primary targets are called in this game i hate to be usually the 2nd or 3rd primary  people with names from the first half of the alphabet tend to die much often or are forced to flee the battle than the other half this is not fair and kills the fun you carry the bad luck of selected name starting with af for the entire life time of the characteri would suggest that you should be able to change your name once per 3 years such a long period for certian wouldnt affect the eve world integrity in any extend
1 csm did not really bring it to ccp  there was a lot of double talk from certain csm  who claimed that they have when it turned out they devoted less than 5 minutes of time to it because ccp said it was too hard so we did not even bother discussing it getting details2 ccp never said it was impossible  just that it will take a lot of work hence we want ccp to take time and do it properly the way pos should have been done in the first place not the halfarsed junkinspacealadeadhhorse 3 do some research on what csm actually did and you will find that that a discussion on musical instruments in eve took place got approved while the pos overhaul issue was barely mentioned as the funky pos idea now be a good boy and go conform somewhere else with the rest of the csms who really did diddleysquat about this  longest running request in the history of eve yea mate longest running longest asked for longest desired and completely legitimate and yet ignored request from the eve community in the history of eve support the pos overhaul even if the musical instruments crowd would want you to give up
the lack of progress on this and the awful state of the pos system as it is is the reason im closing my accounts
im bumping this it really has to be brought up to ccp
i think pirates have it easy enough as it is now i found it the hard way a skilled player with faction probes and t2 covert ops ship can scan you down before you can see his probes coming having cloaked probes would just make things ridiculously easy for them

this topic seems to pop up once a month ive an idea in the past that would further enhance the orca and widen its possible useorca  dry dock bay moduleusing the same principle as described in the link above you could do the same with an xl cargo expander module and the orca into a mini freighter
yes
first thanks for all comments here as far as i can see there are some major drawbacks in some eyes drugs its indeed somehow weird that there would be an illegal part in the production of an legal product well see the mission war of the softdrinks or so especially the recipe if i am right there is one drug mentioned in it so when quafe produces special soft drinks using illegal drugs they could also be used in implants perhaps the empire factions had certain certificates by concord that allowed them to use drugs in production pretty much as todays pharmacy uses morphium etc as wellto the ingame logics my thoughts were mainly that youd have to use the drugs so the body doesnt repel the implantbut it wouldnt destroy the ideas basic structure if you use something else than drugs corpses well yes it is morbid  but i dont really care about the maturity aspectmore interesting is an chronicle i think i read a long time ago but i couldnt find it to link it here there was a passage which descibed how a body was dissolved into its basic materials which could be used in further processes perhaps someone else does know which chronicle it was lp shop right uhm a first idea would be that lp shops could seed researched bpcs for t1 production and unresearched bpcs for invention not sure about that though any real ideas around here existing resources i personally think there are by far enough different items ingame if you add new purposes to old things you still increase the variety ingame somehow p t2hardwirings yeah someone mentioned that in the german forums as well not sure about that as i am not used to them perhaps see them as special t1 hardwirings higher prod costs other skill requirements in productions than normal hardwiringsedited for less errors
supported for sureedit just reread and am not sure where youre going with the idea of drugs being useless theyre excellent as is tbh maybe a little on the expensive side for the harder core drugs but the standards are spot on imowhy do you say theyre uselessand finally i still support the idea of corpses being used in implant production and implants being able to be produced as a general rule
i support this idea  corpses should have their use
we need this 
good idea good concept you made aroundlove the idea aaa
this does sound interesting id like to see it work
why
i so support thiseve is a mmorg like no other and pilots like chribba in the game that have probley made most players laugh deserves special treatment
it seems im gnawing on an issue previously adressed and never realized itmy post here
would be nice to keep track of what im losing and isk
same could be said by standard killmail they are just there to stroke your epeen that is why they got added in the first place dumbass you should opt for the removal of killmails in general thenas long as there are killmails in eve there should be podmails aswell supported

supportin dis having to escalate to senior gms just to get a petition read is pathetic some gms could really do with getting sacked tbqfh anyone whos had heartache on the 14th of febuary knows what i mean
hi i lost my ship due to a bug the details of which can been seen belowreply  unfortunately you were warp scrambled and thus you could not warp away from the hostile players yes thank you mr gm telling a 4 yr player what a warp scrambler is
i disagree the gms do a pretty good job most of the time it takes 1 hour for my petitions to be responded to often times just a matter of minutes thats a phenomenal response timeive heard of a few cases where players have actually schooled them on their own policies quoting devblogs and showing just how an individuals actions were considered an exploit and whatnot but these are the exception rather than the rule and are cases where a very knowledgeable player was able to determine an answer to a very complex rulesetif anything i think the problems brought up by people who have had negative gm interactions in this thread are due to the overpetitioning of people who overuse the petition system the gms probably get 9 out of 10 petitions that are due to things like can flipping ore theft etc and are specifically allowed under the eula their automatic response is to dismiss it when they get a legitimate one theyre likely so used to dismissing the petitions that they might be overeager to dismiss yours which is a natural human responsetldr no gms do a good job complain about noobs petitioning so much
i really dont petition any more because as the op stated its almost as if the respondent doesnt even bother reading the question i once even got an answer that had nothing to do with the problem i opened the petition forive been in customer support for all of my career whether at the retail level or as mid or highlevel systemsengineering support and if i responded to any customer with the effect of a blank stare id be fired you guys want to improve your customer support hire people like me people who have experience with every aspect of what these guys are supposed to do
afaik gms are volunteers and not actually paid by ccp much like gms in other games of course this may not be the case

nohighsec isnt risk free it isnt intended to be your proposal is motivated by a desire to see highsec become safer riskless gameplay strikes at the heart of what makes eve uniquenoyou want to nerf an entire profession without providing ample recompense or alternatives to gankersfurther suicide ganking is the only way to engage in pvp with people in npc corps abusing the fact they cant be wardecd remove insurance payouts and npc corps will be totally unassailable by nature of suicide ganking being economically impossible to supportnoyou already have the tools as a player to defend yourselves and more strike back at gankers stop whining start doing something about it in gameyou may gather i dont support removing insurance from concord shiploss
supported again we were promised a fix to this and id like to see it happen paying insurance for concordokken is beyond moronic its so stupid it would be out of place in a ridiculous fantasy my little pony mmo much less the logical economydriven world of new eden
please pardon any percieved attempt at crosspostingthis issue used to be of much more concern to alot more people and for some reason seems to have fallen to the waysidei believe the first csm was influential in getting ccp to admit there was an issue with and promised to fix insurance from concord actions and now it is clearly back in the forefront again and i humbly ask the current csm to at least please keep this as a top issue of discussionthank youwpedit 1st attempt at support  fail
insurance should be removed from all ships more expensive than t1 battlecruiserin the old days when making money was tough and owning a t1 bs actually meant something insurance was justifiable but in todays age when a month old noob is already flying raven where real battleship cost is 35 mil where isk is being printed in record numbers we really dont need the insurance crutchthis game is supposed to be tough and losses are supposed to mean something we are losing that
wronghighsec will never be risk free and this proposal in no way prevents gankers from doing what it is they do this in no way prevents them from locking my ship in a high sec system and pushing the fire buttonwrongonce again this proposal in no way prevents suicide ganking from occurring if you want to fly into noob space lock some guy in a noob frigate and blast him to hell and back i have absolutely no problem with you doing that please tell me how removing insurance payouts turns off your ability to press f1f8it does however mean that you may have to choose your targets more intelligently instead of ganking everything that crosses your path but please dont presume that i am stupid enough to believe that everyone in an npc corp is flying an ibis with civilian fittings mmkayi know i have the tools to defend myself and i use them my hulk is tanked and i have combat drones loaded my corp uses covops scouts and escorts for high value merchandise as for striking back at the gankers its kinda pointless to shoot at them once concord has asploded them all over the asteroid fieldhowever what the gankers are doing is defined by the game mechanics as a crime please name one other criminal profession that offers insurance payouts to cover lost materialill wait while you come up with one take your time i have all yearand please stop misconstruing my arguments im not telling you you cant suicide gank by all means feel free im just dont want it to be free or nearly free talk about risk vs reward
suicide ganking for isk will not be touched as it serach for good targets worth the attack even if there is no insurance subsiding suicide gank for lulz and any target is good as my ship cost nothing will be hit hard i and i think most of the carebears have noting against people suicide ganking against a worthy target to gain more than you spend but i have a lot against people doing suicide attack only because the cost is 0 counting on insurance to make the 1 attack on 100 against a target with good stuff worth doing it look the call for the new jihadswarm it suggest suiciding one or more meghatron with faction ammo to get 1 tanked hulk at best the drop will be some millions in modules where is the economic logic in that only insurance make it possible there is no good quality target no gain if all you want is the killmail you should pay it if insurance on concord kills is removed ccp can even roll back the last increase in concord reaction time as that will help well thought suicide ganking attempts while insurance help the kill all you see maybe something will drop people
risk free no but a climate so adverse to risk as to make it a hugs n rainbows carbear teaparty that might as well for all intents and purposes be called risk free decidedly yesremoving insurance payouts for concorded ships makes suicide ganking vastly less profitable this translates directly to fewer ganks occurring and a safer highsec it doesnt it just anihilates the economic incentive to do so in 90 of cases please leave the strawman alonei dont think you are stupid just that you are a carebear with an agenda that will change eve for the worse completely different mmkayyou know what killrights are right what merc corps arehint 10 players live in lowsec you can go there you even get sentry guns to help youlets seepiracy or do you consider piracy griefing and not a profession yep you want to nerf the reward for the risk we lose our ships isk yes even after insurance its significant and sec statusmeanwhile you are merrily mining away making 10 ph mining veld in an essentially risk free enviroment frankly if you get suicide ganked you are probably taking the shortbus or too greedy to take precautions or wound up the wrong people by whining on the forumstalk about risk vs reward
ill be truly shocked if that happensif it does then the change would be balanced if concord reaction times were increased above the previous prior to nerf times in order to make ganking specific targets more profitable more time  less isk investedbutop suggests nothing of the sort
and you dont see being subsidized to destroy ships by the same insurance that pay the destroyed ships as wrongor needing to get paid by the insurance as you dont care to search for a isk worthy targetis as it appear you are doing it the wrong way caring only to kill something as you dont select your targets it is only right that you pay for the privilege of getting the killmail
my four paying accounts support this unimplemented promised action by ccp there should be no payments of insurance to gankers in highsec a common argument is that to eliminate this payment to those who profess that its a profession is ludicrous and clearly evidenced by the fact that concord spanks the actor the majority of space in eve is not patrolled by concord but these professionals choose to prey upon folks that rarely need to protect themselves from criminals yes its a criminal activity in highsec go to low sec or null sec and your profession can roam free with no risk of concord death and with as many will undoubtedly declare much higher payout and enjoymentyes you know you stalk highsec only because you cant survive with your profession in low sec or null sec the real reasons why you choose to stay our of low sec is known only to you guys but i think we all know the answer
by all means lets make insurance more realisticas long as its balanced by making concord more realistic too
everyone knows i dont actually play this game i only like o post about it on the forumseveryone also knows that im in no way a lowsec pirate with a 10 sec status in a corp that lives in amamake when they arent being s in 00
yep concord should be more realistic they should bubble your pod and take you to prison for rest of your eve career for mass murder yeah because having killrights or mercs attacking alts is really usefull and definately not a waste of time and they will care so much when you kill one of their fully insured ships suicide gankign should be done only when there is decent economic profit to be made removing insurance wont change that much about that you might use some other ships but it does help against the hey it moved lets gank it idea
they should take 424 hours to turn up to the crime scene ask you a lot of questions make you feel like its you that did something wrong arrest you if you did anything like eg shoot back then take the nearest minmatar pilot back to the concord station and beat a confession out of himall empire income will be taxed at 30 to pay for this servicenow that would be realistic
yes indeed just shooting spaceships for fun has no place in a pvp spaceship game
and the solution to that as the pirates are so quick to point out to us is to move out of high security spaceits not a strawman your argument is it stops you from doing it but youve just pointed out yourself that it doesnt  it just makes you have to be smarter about doing it i thought that was what eve was all about deciding if the risk is actually worth the reward why should suicide gankers be the only profession that dont have to care about the risk because its subsidizedyou say carebear like its a bad thing piracy in and of itself is not considered a crime by the game mechanics concord does not jump out of the shadows and blast you into metal scrap if you lock someone in low sec web them point them and then try and ransom their ship  or even if you destroy their shipgood try but wrong care to try againlets talk about this for a minute you didnt lose your ship you made a conscious decision to throw it away and that frankly makes all the difference in the world
remove insurance full stopinsurance breaks the riskreward of suicide ganking theres nearly nothing to lose but also breaks the riskreward of every other thing which involves flying a t1 ship as such it should go completely either that or overhaul with a more realistic system which isnt just a blatant isk faucet to create isk from thin air
sure the ganker doesnt loose much isk when his ship gets blown up by concord but he do loose sec status which is a pain to rat back up again gankers still need to consider if the profit is worth the 15 minutes of sitting in a station possibly missing the motherload waiting for gcc to expire and the sec hit that will take hours to recovergetting insurance after comitting a crime might be unrealistic by rl standards but so is a society that encourage scamming and stuff like that
insurance should not be a justification for crime which it is at the moment nobody gives a crap about sec status because theres so many ways to neutralize any hit you might take nobody gives a crap about 15 minutes in a station because almost everyone has an alt the real life argument is always the weakest one its the common sense argument that holds dont pay people for being s to newbs
this is a pain for just about everyone i had to log in 3 times just to post this

some of you may have become accustomed to it by now but i personally find the current directional scanner a little hard to use for one main reason you cant see exactly where youre scanning and how wide your cone is visuallyyou have to point the camera to where you want to scan but theres no visual center or cross to define exactly where you are precisely pointing at you have to approximately line it up with your ship or hold alt to get the brackets around your own ship and use that which doesnt work that well due to mouse sensitivity can sometimes be very hard to center the camera on a particular object far in the solar systemi think a visual representation of the scanners coneradius would really help i would like to have a checkbox in the directional scanner window to showhide the cone when enabled you would see a dim transparent blue or other color wireframe representation of the cone which would show exactly where youre pointing at and how wide your scanner angle isthe same cone should also be shown on the solar system map this is very important sometimes especially when aiming at dead space to scan it can be pretty hard to define exactly which way you were pointing at with the scanner before entering the map since the solar system maps camera doesnt sync with your ships camera
yeah this would be really nice
supported
wholeheartedly supported not just to block the alliances i dont like but also npc corps to switch off the scammers and isk sellersben
i wouldnt pretend to know exactly the way ccp algorithms work however it seems that minimizing local while it is being spammed by 100200 or more players immediately solves the lag caused directly by that spamnot to mention all the writes to the logfiles unless ccp would add option to choose not to log local specificallyand yes that would be great for jita as well all those npc corp spammers in local  since client doesnt start with local minimized even if you left it that way
supported and let it apply to forums to this will be a bit complex but should be possible
allow this feature so i can block these noobcorps and never see isk spammers again
you clearly have never been in system with 500 goonssigned
or even one goon
ok granted ive read some of the arguments and i can see how it could be useful
while i often wished for such a feature when i was roaming delve back in bob days i think this whole problem would pretty much go away if ccp finally nerfed local chat
hoping to see this idea get a little more support 
give us the old helios modelthe old one looked like a covert ops the actual one looks like an industrial shipif the problem is that t2 version do not match t1 hulls just swap t1 hulls
supported
needed
no the change was a buff you see how ugly your ship is and it makes you remember that your cloak is off
agreed make the mining frigate ugly not the sexy t2 covops frigate
i hate the new helios i loved the old one now i prefer to fly my anathema give back the old helios
yes
i have to agree with herschel on this ive lost so many anathemaclass covert ops because i was mesmerized by how beautiful the ship is no supportactually jk yeah idk why they changed your covops supportisaac
okay if you want me to raise a serious objection how about this the imicus is the t1 scanning frigate the helios is the t2 scanning frigate asking for the helios to be based off any other hull is like saying that the ishtar should be based off the exequror because it looks better i dont give a damn how it looks the imicus is the right hull for the ship it was wrong before and they fixed it
why is it that you can warp to a bookmarked planet but that you cant align to it using the bookmark i would like this to change i know you cant align to coordinates but if the coordinate matches a known celestial or object you can align to using the context menu in space or overview you should be able to align to ithaving to quickly go through the cascading context menu to align to a station or a planet can be very hard when you have to do it in combat due to the poor interface that isplease change this
supportededit and yes aligning to noncelestials is also supported
heck yea
supported
yes for bookmarks not associated with celestials as well a set of xyz coordinates is a set of xyz coordinates
this if i can warp to a point in space i should be able to align to it
i guess itd be okay then i just thought there was a specific reason why ccp didnt want us to align to xyz coordinates
and there may behave been a reason for it but it doesnt make any kind of logical sense my ship has to align to that point before warp so the code to align to xyz coordinates is already in the game the only reason i can not prealign to a noncelestial at all is because there is no option to align to any bookmarks
supportedi would also like to see my bookmarks in my overview that way i could use the alredy existing allignbutton
agreed
the mining ships definitely need to revised skill wise and bonus wise like you suggestions
i agree with everything except science v for the hulk either science v for all exhumers or do not change it for any of them there is no reason for science to go up 1 rank the only reason science iv is required is for the astrogeology it then trumps the science as it is a more specialized skill
then we need something else to make the training gap between the mackinaw and the hulk longer but not too much so the mackinaw can be a worthy intermediate ship to use maybe set the hulk requirement to exhumer iv instead of iii this would add about 7 days of training which may make the mackinaw worth it at least for a week
good idea
the mackinaw is an ice mining ship it doesnt matter if you make the hulk outright easier than the mackinaw people will still use the mackinaw
its logic i support
right i forgot about the ship roles when i wrote this humm in this case if both the mackinaw and the hulk should be somewhat at the same level due to the specialized ice harvesting role of the mackinaw then perhaps the mackinaw should have ice harvesting iv as a required skill
ive noticed this a couple of times when you attempt to train a skill to level one that requires certain prerequisites then you can only if you have completed training all the prereqs my issue is that you are disallowed from training a skill to level one even if the final prerequisite is in training to the required level i suggest that this be changed enabling the user to add entrylevel skills to the queue when the final prerequisite is in the queue above it and under 24 hours to completioni realize that this feature was put in this to avoid people trying to skip prerequisites but there is a way to work around this should the prerequisite be canceled before completion all skills after it in the skill queue which require that prereq skill will also be removedplease take consideration to this i believe it was a feature which should have been added but was overlookedthanks  in advance  for your support ccp
i agree with you and in fact so do some other people
thanks for the url ill support it
no its a tradeoff between damage and range you want to hit farther out you do less dps
please tell me this is a troll a horrible horrible troll otherwise why dont we make all guns use the same ammo and all ships have an 888 slot layout to be fair
sentry drones are used less as they are stationary which is also their main advantage i like them and use them regulary even considering skilling t2 sentries and that considering im amarr only
im a t2 sentry user and ill say now that i dont support this idea the drones are balanced fine and as for differing damage types its purely to do with racial types wouldnt expect an amarr drone to deal kineticas for the tracking and range thing the bouncers dont have as higher damage but they are still enough to 1 shot frigates from 70km away and by the time ive thinned out an enemy rat fleet all thats left are a few bs at 20 km perfect for my garde iis i honestly think that sentry drones whilst being difficult to get to grips with are the most powerful drone they dont need changing not counting fighters
sentry drones are perfectly fine and well balanced
this perhaps we should just make all ships identical with predefined identical fits the only difference being that amarr do em caldari kinetic gallente thermal and minmatar explosive sounds goodwhat a terrible terrible idea

i petition to get rid of true sec true sec is the reason why the game is flooded by lvl 4 missioners looking at the majority of 00 systems they look a hell of a lot like low sec systems with the same ore as empire but only bigger and 23 battleships per belt that is wrong i say make all 00 systems like true sec give the people the incentive to actually move out and spread the bandwidth the added minerals will even help curb the mineral shortage i mean why nerf lvl 4 missions to get people to move out when mining and ratting has been pre nerfed in 00 to begin with it is counter intuitive

thoughts about sovereignityproblemtaskposses and their reinforcetiming leads to the fielding of large fleets aka blobs the success of defense and attack is unproportionally dependend on the numbers of pilots engagedthe situation is that a huge blob exactly knows when a pos leaves reinforcement and has only to be there for a short time to safe it it doesnt matter whether you take the risk to attack many posses since a great blob can defend them sequentially no need to split blob stays an entity pure mass defends it allresulting we have the building of large blockscoalitions and the factual impossibility to conquer regions for smaller and lone alliances or to hold themgoalmore parallel attacked targets to force blobs to split make large regions more difficult to defend than smaller onespossible solutionget rid of the reinforcementmode and modification of the sovereignity rulesto keep sovereignity with all the levels enabling this and that you sould now build expensive defense stations which you can expand with several toys and weaponsthese do have a fixed area of control where they give sovereignity loosing defense means loosing sovereignityas soon as the defense stations are attacked and its lifepoints burned they enter an overtakemode lasting for 48 hours depending on balancing similar to the reinforcementtimerthe sovereignityholder can go on using the defense keyword home advantage this means using weapons which can be shot down by the enemy as well as repaired and reattached by the defenderinstead of waiting as in the current system for the timer to go down and having a blob waiting to defend we introduce some dynamicswhile the overtakemode lasts timer every side may attack the control bunkercommand centre however itd be named its a part of the defensive system which otherwise would be immune prior to overtakemode whenever the control bunker ist hold by one of the parties a timer counts for that party at the end of the 48 hours the one party gets the sovereignity whose timing counter is the highest all attached modules selfdestruct thena successful attacker can then take downover all posses within the area of control of that defense station without any kind of reinforcement hindering himso this would be a modified system of reinforcement which brings a dynamic engagement for 48 hoursadvantageous is that noone knows when the enemy takes the control bunkercommand centre this would enable simultaneous attacks on several stations as large as the region of control of the defender as difficult it gets to defend and holdif your blob stays at position a control centres from b to h could be conquered under pretext the defense stations have fallen into overtakemode then the defender has to split his defensive blob into smaller forces the larger his area of control is this can lead to interesting fights even in smaller scale which is the important point herecompilationby attacking several defense stations being the key factor in holding sovereignity an attacker can break down the blob into smaller forces it would be pointless to stay at one place only because you have to be at several ones at onceso the size of controlled areas thus increases the difficulty to defend themthe smaller the controlled area the less attackable you areadditional necessary changestitans should loose the current doomsday ability to make normal subcapitalfleets useful again instead they should get a weapon which would inflict on a single target such an amount of damage so eg a usual capital sized ship would be destroyed immediately be it a dreadnought or a carrier in triage mode or spidertank the titans rate of fire and its tracking has to be balanced thoughjumpbridges cynobridges only work within the area of a defense station from the bridge to the border there youd have to fly again until you reach another area controlled by one of your defense stations goal is to prohibit instablobdefensefleetsthe attacker by this is enabled to scout the position and intention of the defense fleet and knows when a defensive fleet arrives at a border of sovereignityyes there will be still useful titan jumpbridges nevertheless

i will admit that i hadnt thrown the numbers together and worked out how much isk is gained per hour off an r64 moon the initial premise behind the idea is a way to grief moon mining operations beyond an all out assault on a death starmy initial belief was that a roqual would have been ideal for the task due the the fact a capital tank would allow support to assist and defend against an attack and stealing moon goo needs to have a risk factor built in to itusing a 2b ship would mean that anybody stealing moon resources would need to make sure that they have complete control over that system andor a sizable defensive gang to back them uphowever after i had considered profit from a r64 i agree that a roqual is to much risk for a small returni still believe though that there needs to be a way for smaller groups to leech moon resources off towers for their own profit and in order to force the pos owners the have a presences around their assets to kill off leecher in order to further the discussion regarding a suitable mechanic of stealing moon goo i might suggest the following alternative and then ask if others have better ideas or a refinement on that which has already been proposedmy understanding that a pos has a max engagement envelope of 250km for its guns and that also moons generate 100 units of a mineral per hourmy alternative would be that instead of a roqual perhaps a hulk could be utilized instead with a module to harvest material which would have an activation cycle of 15 minutes and would leach 25 units of material per cyclethe restrictions is would place on this module are these1 must be activated with in 350km of the target pos harvesterthis should mean your ship is outside the engagement envelop of the pos but still on the same grid2 immobilizes the hulk for the 15 minute cycleno risk no rewardi will admit that while 20 mill per hour still isnt up there with other forms of income the real objective behind the proposal is give us the tools to interfere with the passive pos revenue of an alliance
supported but let the rorqual  orca harvest 1 days of production in 1 hour this should also be the maximum
you can get a jumpclone with any corporation you have the requisite standing withhowever this doesnt belong in the assembly hall

i remember back when i started playing just after ccp finished the beta testing there was a lot of talk about updating the game to include an cockpit view for pilots who like the first person view more then the 3rd person viewback then they decided it was too much work and decided to do other things i personally would love to see some type of cockpit view for flying i think it would make frigate and cruiser fights a ton more fun i might actaully have to train my minny skills im not sure how hard this would be but with directx 10 but i dont belive fixing the camera angle and adding some controls shouldnt be that hard
never sounds perfect to mei signed up to play an internet spaceships game escaping from a walking and running game adding walking to this game really seems to me to draw the focus away from the spaceships which is why me and many others came to eve in the first placethe only reason we are even getting wis is to alphabeta test the whole wis engine for the future white wolf mmops bah humbugeditcause i suck at typing
i think youre missing the point i think what he is saying is why are illegal activities covered by the insurer at least thats how i read it if you take out insurance on your house and burn it down on purpose the insurer will not pay you out if you do something illegal in your car the insurer will not pay you out the same should apply to suicide attacks in high sec not because it is high sec but because according to concord it is an illegal act i say suicide gank away but there should be no insuring ships against illegal activities which concord respond to

ohhhhhh yes please this would be great or if they could reply within an hour that would be great too
spot on thats why you should support this topic
first that makes no sensesecond if youre going to do this just remove insurance completely not just for ships that get concordokkend
qftlets remove insurance from concord deaths and increase concords response time to 510 minutes 
wheres the fun in this gankers make the game fun and you will just kill it if you do this gankers help the market and also makes couriering deadly and mining interesting i really am against this idea and like the way gankers work atmofc in regards to topic they would be less gankers the insurance companies are different to concorde i think so i guess it is fine d insurance to all that die except mission runners
your definition of fun differs vastly from mine apparently
all npc insurances should be removed and new contract type insurance made you can issue insurance contract which reserves certain amount of isk for certain ship type lost and put a price on it you could also define time period from 1 day to whole year this could be issued to corp alliance private public etc
no
what has no place is being subsidized by the game when doing that and yes i am fully aware that could and would include ship replacement losses in missions as things stand today i would not be excessively troubled if insurance was removed for older characters or larger ships and not only for concord kills
errrr sorry this current insurance scam is simply and logically wrongwhat book of logic states that any criminal behavior is rewarded and paid for by the same society hisec empires that give other penalties for such behavior sec standing loss
thumbs up even if there are quite some whiny yarrs here
but youre fine with empire carebears getting a massive free protection subsidyor do you think should concord protection be paid for that would be an excellent idea imo  instead of basing the concord response time on system sec base it on the level of the contract you have with them that gives the gankers their risk level  they cant be sure if theyre shooting someone with platimum protection concord turn up in 5 seconds or just basic faction police arrive after 1 minute
oddly enough most civilized societies consider it a good practice to protect their law abiding citizens
oddly enough pod pilots arent considered citizensoddly enough policemen normally need payingwhich way do you want it are you a citizen with rights  and obligations or are you an independent pod pilot with the freedom to do as you please  but with no right to expect protection you contribute nothing towards
id be curious to know why you think this i wasnt aware that we handed in our citizenship when we left orbittaxes are what normally support public services like crime prevention not direct payment from citizens and oddly enough the eve empires collect taxes in the form of sales taxes

thank you for this wellthought proposal kayscha and notifying me of your post you have mentioned yourself that this desire has a longreaching history a history which i am not all aware of now myself i would appreciate if you could add some links to related posts  dev blogs if you find the time to search for them and let me check back with the other csms before actually bringing it up in a meeting for vote the last time i remember hearing ccp comment on it was in the video casts of fan fest 2008 where they raised the artistic challenge must fit with the overall eve concept art and the ship remodelling dev effort required to find and create suitable spaces to put the logos ontoi will follow up on this please stand by

yep had the problem with the scrollbar forcing me to type blindly aswell
cool idea

right about needed for everyone using the scanner
not supportedlearn 2 scan ive had no problems using my directional scanner although this is from months of being a pirate and using the scanner constantly when i log on i picked it up rather quickly i would rather not waste a month or even a week of the devs time on something that works completely fine as it is now for the majorityif not all of players out theretldr practice scanning and you wont have trouble
even i who use the scanner with great results all the time would like to see this
you find it normal that it takes a month to get used to that simple tool especially for someone using the scanner every day such as youi think that without wanting to you actually gave a positive argument in favor of this suggestion eve online may have a high learning curve but that doesnt mean that they cant make it more intuitive where they can
100 support man how i would love to block all the npc corps including goonswarm

oo
they should have fixed it the other way the imicus should look like the old helios and switch model with the maulus that way the keres can have the ugly stand wheel banana ship model who flies a keres anyway okay pretty weak arguement i admit that
dont touch my keres a big fat no for swapping both t1 and t2 imicusmaulus models besides the imicus doesnt only look industrial it is industrial large cargo probes sounds industrial to me
ive never been so disappointed with eve then the day i logged in to find the best looking ship in the game had turned into a nondescript blob of steal
obviously you have never flown in a cheetah
man whats wrong with cheetah i seriously think its a cool shipbut please dont troll anywayeditooh man you are right i was still thinking about the old vigil model i didnt remember that they changed it too you should make another thread for the cheetah it was a cool ship what a madness
i dont see a problem either
hey if it comes down to this worthless issue or getting diet quaffe introduced i will of course vote for this
have a system where only a set number of ships can lock onto the same target at onceex if your commander is in a battleship up to 15 people in your fleet can lock onto the same target as you battlecruiserscruisers 10 and so on and so onif someone locks over the maximum amount he will get his accuracy reduced and the person after that will get his accuracy further reduced or maybe reduce the accuracy for the entire group that is targetting the rp reason for this could be because the locking signatures mess with each other or somethingits not exactly a well refined idea but it would work to some extent it would largescale fights a bit more interesting instead of having the entire fleet lock onto one person at a timei dont know what do you guys think
its been proposed before the problem is its exploitable if 10 friendlies target me suddenly its harder for my enemy to target me wed see the birth of spider locking fleets
oh damn your rightwell what if they removed the debuff by canceling it when the targetting persons is in your corporation  alliance 
much as id love to see smaller gang warfare more prevalent your proposal is far too exploitable even if it didnt work on in corpin alliancein fleet members whats to stop friends in different corps from abusing the mechanicagain i do applaud the desire for smaller gang warfare but this simply isnt the way to get there
this is extremely horrible ideaalso blobs are not bad theyre pretty nice things in right places and are part of eve not saying i would enjoy that kind of warfare but massive fleets are part of this gameinstead of figuring out terribad things like this how about starting from why people gather up extremely massive fleetsheres couple of things to start current sovereignity system more the merrier no logistics problems titans instead of being antiblob they just encourage for it with current mechanics pos warfare cloakging ewar rr buffer tanking current tackling mechanics etc
the current options have been overused and its time for some new ones with possibly better graphics this timethe last time new options were added was years ago all the nice 3d and shaded graphics such as the geari think its well overdue
im surprised nobody else supported this yet
wish the forums had two thumbs up image
this seems natural
hell yes
hell yes supported
yup want this too
me wants it
why do people always resort to a limitation on numbers when they want something balanced dude its so much easier to make doomsdays 2ndary effects that can negatively affect multiple titans if theyre not careful its just as easy to remove titan mass from play when you discuss warping after a dd is fired bc weve seen how fail ccp is at affecting this so the obvious solution is not to limit numbers fired and  everyone off but rather to remove the direct damage for indirect harsh effects give it the punch wo the follow through so to speakyou want dd change that makes sense go support what vuk i and many others would like to see happen
limiting damage or making up timers is not an answer unless damage is limited to xlarge smartbomb level to kill drones etcwhole dd as an idea is terriblealso defending current mechanics by isk invested in titans is ridiculous more isk has been made obsolete nerfing different of smaller ships
just make ms have the ability for a huge shield to counter them try fixing the problem by buffing the real victim i would really like to see ms buffed rather than titans nerfed
what am i the only one who remembers dr strangelove if you use the word doomsday then it should mean just that the end of everything well at least on grid i mean whats the point of a last resort weapon if a lucky bc much less a properly fitted bs can tank iti say it pops everything on grid including the arse of whoever set it off otherwise please rename to phoenix butt blast or something not so definitive but keep the cool graphics
give a titan a sensor strength of 5yay hornets
well it is the same as when you work if you dont show up for work for over a month you can assume you have left make a policy that pilots over x amount of time get kicked simple and people will have to accept it d
we are coming up on the year anniversary of this post that states the forums will be looked at and a plan decided
yes they are looking at the forums however for a game as big as eve this kind of thing does not happen overnight nor without qa checking it out and testing itccp has stated that theyve got a team working on it here and its not in a publiclyannounced stage yet with apocrypha and calling the entire new feature team to work on the expansion theyve had their hands full yes they even pulled people off of the ambulation project temporarilyi must admit that the forums have more bugs than an apartment in new york city but ccp is choosing to overhaul the whole system rather than fix bugs when they arrive while the bugs are an annoyance im sure the devs are busy cracking the whip on the coders backs to get this thing implemented id rather have it done right the first time

id love it if large valuable asteroids had a bit of ice or frozen gas in em detectable by surveyand when you activated either any mining laser or a laser with certain crystals the asteroid would light up like a christmas tree and blast your barge from around your podbut thats just one mans fantasy mining does need a revamp with some randomness to it thats why you should support akitas idea and my idea as well mystery ore
kms are a great way to track the progess of a fight to gauge resistance and to get a feel for an alliances standard fleet fits i would never ask them to be done away with but the argument stands the implants are in the pod they are in the corpse if anything the implants should be in that the reason you die is when your shot in the pod a your shot with a really big gun in a really small non armors pod b ifwhen it ruptures your body is exposed to the vacuum of space both of these equal dead real fast im not against implants being shown when lost but i dont think the mechanic should be pod related i think the mechanic should be corpse related also if your smart and your think that the other pvper is smart you should know withing a range of 58 different implants exactly what hes running their is no gain to adding them to the lose mail as there is no way for them to drop be used or recovered aswell as this would end up turning into the largest of epeen stroking tools in the game and i dont think its needed personally i would rather not had pilots targetting pods while theres still enemies on the field sure if they are in a bubble in smartbomb range or your in a ship that doesnt take 15 seconds to lock them we but if you add implants to this your gonna get pilots in bss and caps who are epeen hungry enough that instead of locking the primary or the secondary they are locking pods to boost their isk efficiency and that is failjust my 2 cents
the winter release would be a nice treat
yeah ive also had a run in with a gm who gave a cut and paste answer that didnt even remotely answer my issue i gave him a very low rating on my closed petition of course but i really feel like ccp doesnt give enough of a service feedback methodthat and some of the gms could actually read the petitions they get itd take what an extra 30 seconds
would be good
bump
someone further up in this topic said he had his petitions responded to within an hour that has not happened to me onceive got two petitions going now due to bugs  ye olde  i did not warp off when i disconnected riddle me why mr gm  the response basically has been that i did yes that i did warp off but that vagabond obviously had an expanded probe launcher using half its cpu for that because the vaga is awesome at prob wait no and of course the fact that i didnt have aggression would support the fact that i would stay in space for 15 minsgms either do not know enough about the game or they give incredibly lame responses i think two or three months back i had similar issues and within a day i had gotten an educated response in which things were explained and my ships were returned to me promptly the difference now is basically as others have said you get a premade response saying they cant verify anything in their logs and thusly you can go boohoo in the corner its just sad that customer support should revert to something as tragic as that and as others have stated yes they do get a lot of petitions but its their job i know damn sure that in other jobs you cant lazy off and do a really poor job because there is a lot to dothat being said some gms do a good job i presume they know who they are and we love them
agreed plus raise insurance costs for frequent victims too
hey moron ccp tried to gimp empire ganking afew times now so you argument is a fail think before you blog nubagreed dont live in empire but pussies who try to pvp in empire without a wardec should be nerfed as mouch as posible
i support this mainly because the current system really dont make any sensehow powerful concord is doesnt really make any sense either though i would certainly prefer it if concord ships were possible to beat in a direct confrontation and possible and not considered an exploit to evade
supported and the above post doesnt bother addressing why criminals would receive insurance payouts for their destroyed ships and for suicide gankingsince when should blowing up your own vessel or going kamikaze or selfdestructing yield insurance payouts the same principle applies to this issue edit and my god the really need to stop howling the way they scream about the carebears whenever ccp makes a move that would make piracy in any way more difficult is a little embarrassing at least some of them offer valid reasoning but some of them just rant on and on about the carebears
both self destruct and ship loss through concorde should invalidate the insurance on the ship  i totally agree what insurance company in their right mind would insure ships lost in these circs
admits to having done it so he wouldnt have to move his mining barge through 00 no one would but every time its proposed and ive seen it proposed several times the pirate community especially those who go suicide ganking go absolutely ballistic
yep they would wouldnt they

in what meaningful way are pod pilots citizens
in what circumstances of ship loss would an insurance company pay00  neverlosec  neverratting  nevermining in a 08 or lower  nevermissioning  neverpirating  neverantipirating  neverwardec either side  neverpaying 40 above market value for a single 30 premium  neverinsurance in eve has nothing to do with rl concepts of insurance just as rl concepts of law enforcement have nothing to do with a situation where immortal pilots who are allowed to fly battleships with nuclear weapon around safe areas and where we can pay off the police to ignore huge battles directly outside public ports youre trying to apply the rules and mores of 21st century western suburban civilization to a a game set in a hypertechnological far future with radically different cultures
one of the silliest proposals everthis isnt an issue im sorry but youre saying criminals should be treated differently from how legal citizens are when it comes to financespersonal property is personal property and insurance is not the same as the police you may notice that you get paid from an insurance company and not from concord nothis is because you are insured by the company not by the police the contract is simply that when the ship blows up insurance will be paid outits a nonissue
for a sillynonissue it sure seems to be generating a lot of support doncha think
in the same meaningful way that an infant is you seem to be laboring under the heinleinesque notion of citizenship through service of course by that definition anyone with a positive faction standing towards one of the empires could be considered a de facto citizen since they have obviously rendered a service to that empire they dont just hand out faction standing at the door now do they
fact the current ed system is making highsec ganking a zerorisk issue stupid pirates can misgank worthless targets because their ships cost zero
removing insurance for concord sanctionable actions makes perfect sense ccp and devs always said that this game has consequences so consequences for a carebear who hauls really good stuff is that he will be suicide ganked consequences to a ganker is that the carebears cargo better be worth more than his ship and mods combined wo insurance
this really does sound like a no brainer oh wait because it is ccp fix it like you promised
i wont support removing insurance payouts for some arbitrary criteria like concord involvement because just what constitutes involvement in the first placea better solution which would solve this and many other issues that ive been tossing around the scc decides that it needs to be profitable so changes premiums so that the total premiums it takes in are always some percentage higher than what it pays out this could be based on ship class or globally ive not spent much time on it other than the initial ideathe other alternative is to remove insurance completely though this would not solve one of the other issues with insurance that having variable premiums would solve i dont even like the idea keep insurance for ships sized a and b as thats arbitrary after all when youve basically got a 100 chance of having a ship destroyed what company would insure it and hope to make a profit
dont most insurance companies refuse to payout on damage you intentionally caused to your own stuff wouldnt triggering concord count as intentional damage concord involvement you did something that makes concord want to blow your ship up in this case you attacked an unaggressed target in high secsure pvp is going to be very high risk but only triggering concord is guaranteed to destroy your ship

im joining the oldschool crowd in how its something you should learn and its not hard at all i mean come on people zzbut even so i really wouldnt mind i mean theres no logical reason for this to not be nifty
what is that tool youre talking about do you have the actual name of it ive never heard of this before
im having trouble visualizing how this would work when not in the map view if theres a cone starting from your ship and going out to your max scan range the indicator at the end of the cone is going to be a big circle right well if an object is halfway between your ship and the endcone circle its going to look like its inside the circle but because the cone expands as it gets further from you the circle at the halfway mark is going to be about half the size of the endrange circle so the object could be visually within the endrange circle while outside of the diameter of the halfrange circle so it looks like youre scanning it when you are not im not sure i made that make sense need a picture
supported this is a big usability issue because for low angles youre not really sure where the center of your ship is and the camera doesnt pan 100 smoothly this ought to have been in from the beginning

this is one of the ideas which make god kill a kitten every time theyre posted
yeah too exploitable and not sure if its necessary to do anything like this although it sucks to be primarymeltend in 3 seconds here is an idea i had some time ago but i think it would be tricky to balance create a new module that remotely blurs the signature of a ship similar to how flares are used today to divert missilesonce activated on a ship it results in all locks on that ship having a say 50 chance of breaking skills and ship bonus apply too cycle time is long at least 20 seconds maybe even a minute if you get primaried by 20 ships and then a friend sigblurs you you can expect 10 locks to break not enough to counter all of the dps but quite a bit very heavy use of sigbluring could result in fleets having to simply go at it 1 on 1 pretty much or call priamries for each squad or whatever theres no local module to sigblur yourselfthis could be a new minmatar ewar in addition to their current wonderful one because its related it messes with a ships signature
take a look at this screenshot and tell me this never happened to youplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesthis happens to me every now and then and nothing except completely resetting my windows settings will fix this i am so sick of this redoing all of my ui settings everytime is extremely aggravatingi can get a temporary fix by switching tabs or minimizing and restoring the window but then as soo as something new is shown on the overview it is doubled as wellposting bug reports about it doesnt seem to help and patch after patch the bug persists due to this not being reproducable on demand bug reports usually get nowhereplease bring this to ccp in the next meeting this has to be looked at alreadyheres links to other posts about this issue

hell yesi love the align to button ive never understood why it isnt included on everything
could i perhaps add something to thiswhy not allow us a shortcut like alt  x which reveals moons alt  b to show bookmarks i know the graphics are in the game already as ive seen this on the overview map thingiewould be excellent to be able to see a representation of your bookmark
if you mean in the solar system map you can already see those 2 just check your system map settingsif you mean in space then yeah showing bookmark icons in space would help too
you should be able to align any bm celestial or notfor example a safe spot
ive come up with a somewhat decent idea when a dd is fired everything is offlined warp and jump drive also this makes titan pilots think a bit harder before pressing f1 in a field of hostiles it also helps control the titan population imo
agreed no offense
this is where i stopped the skiff is a low sec or null sec space mining barge its primary role as far as i can tell from the bonuses is that its for escaping a solo pirate or whoever using just one scrambler and to mine mercoxite i think a skiff is more valuable in non high sec space simply because of the 2 warp strength
supported but personally im not sure i agree with your levels for astrogeology on the bargesi think 234 would be more reasonable rather then 345 but then again your the one crafting the idea and i approve of this in general just with that caveat i thought id mention

walking in stations needs to add a bit of life to the gameworld if its just a cold empty space filled with alts wandering around begging for isk it wont be very palatable the stsations need to be vibrant busy places that give a real feel of the culture that they belong to as for a reason for pod pilots to walk in stations well whats the point of having loads of isk if you dont get to show off id like to see player entourages i want npc assistants and servants i want to be carried around in a sedan chair and have npc bodyguards that push noobs out of my way
i would also love to see cockpit that sounds really but i understand that it doesnt neccessarily mean we need manual piloting theres lag issues which really are a big consideration and quite frankly theres other issues id rather ccp work on then something that really isnt in demand at alland really theres no need does anyone actually have any problems that would require this to fix them i certainly dont
i admit when i saw that we werent getting wis in the next expansion i myself was extremely frustrated as well especially since id heard they were going to be doing some beta stuff with it at fanfest this year and stuff oh well shrug life moves on and eve is still fun
edit what in the world is this thread doing in this section by the way i was at fanfest 2008 and got my hands on it it exists yet i do share your bewilderment at ccps silence on it since then the whole internet spaceships game thing seems very derogatory and it perplexes me that eves own fans would use it as a term of endearmentccp has always made it clear that the goal with eve was to make good scifi it only turned out to be internet spaceships at launch because they needed to seriously cut back on their vision for obvious practical reasons eve is a hell of a lot more in concept than it has had the chance to be thus far and i cant believe you wouldnt want it to inch ever closer to fulfillmentif you think walking in stations is a betrayal of eves essence id love to see what you think of what comes ten thirty or one hundred years from now
agreed if walking in stations is implemented then it will lead to a much more immersive universe it will support greater role playing it will allow our corps to hold awesome ic board meetings it will allow eventual walking in ships crew interaction watching the loadingunloading of cargothe game will become a lot more grapic and server intensive but im dying to have a lot of the thinks represented by barebones menus to be replaced by interactive content that said you could still do it that way if you wantare in a hurry but itll be more fun the idea of strolling around a station and meeting your agent in an office or bar seems much more entertaining then right click click start conversation click accept quest and go

main issue  very low applied dpsto fix this i would suggest putting these numbers on sisi for testingincrease base damage by 45increase ev to 120 msdecrease drf to 15an explanation of why i chose those particular numbers can be found here the spreadsheet and results of in game testing that led to these numbers can be found here
i agree rockets need a boost
i agree 
missiles in general are so bad atm that i cant figure why anyone would use them outside of ratting with that said i want an entire revision of the missile system and not just some tweaking here and therehowever rockets are worst off atm and are in need off a fix desperately

heavy missiles heavy assault and torps are not bad atm actually would not mind them getting a little love tho like better expl velocity adn maby a bit less exp radius so torps do not require targets to be painter and webbed as much as now but rockets truly are horrible need a real damage boostone suggestion in general is to make the warhead upgrads rank 5 skill more useful currently a 2 damage peer level for a rank 5 skill is lots of sp for little gain imo make it 3 rof bonus or maby 3 damage bonus that would give missiles in general some love

while i agree that suicide ganking is currently risk free high sec mining is pretty much risk free too in this thread some pirates claim that killing 168 hulks is a good bragging number yet it must only be a tiny fraction of all the hulks in empire so the issue has been blown out of all proportion by paranoid idiotseven as a manufacturer and trader who routinely moves high value goods in empire i believe high sec is too safe and each time the whiners succeed in getting another nerf applied to high sec piracy the game gets a bit more sterilewould only support the proposal if greater risk vs reward was applied to both sides of the equation eg by increasing concord response times in 04 and 05 and moving the best ores to these systems or some other means to make your proposal balancedwithout balance this is just another step on the road to this
not supported insurance doesnt make suicide ganking risk free and suicide ganking has already been nerfed this thread is full of whiners who want highsec mining to be 100 safe  and it shouldnt be not in a game like eve otherwise eve loses that which makes it unique in the first place and no suicide ganking isnt risk free like some in this thread are claiming insurance might make it profitable if done right but one runs into the risk of trying to gank a pilot who has basic fitting knowledge in such a case the ganker loses his ship gets a criminal countdown and loses sec status which takes a very long time to recoverrealism is an idiotic reason to change such a game mechanic unless those who want realism also want a 15 or so minute response delay on concord intervention
they dont cost zero the ships themselves cost marginally above zero then they must be fittedand there is a significant nonzero time factor plus the sec hitgod we had all this last year ccp increased the penalties for ganking already and improved conord response time quite a bit as well i said then that it was futile to do so because however much they increased the sec hit carebears like you would never be satisfied until they were perfectly safe whatever you get you always demand more safety more npc protection tell you what lets be fair lets just remove insurance altogether
i hear this alot in this thread this means what  that ganking is highsec is very unique to eve  dont make me laughits a pathetic reason first and foremost think of the insurance company thats in eve would you as a ceo that tries to make isk would want to give an insurance service to a ganker or someone that goes to low or zero sec when you know yourself that theres a high risk of losing that shiphell no no company or no agent would give a service to a person considered dangerous like that your company would go bankruptok i used the story and logic behind eve to get this argument which makes sense by me this proposal wont make ganker disappearjust more selectiveps i also hear lots of pirates go beserk when they hear the word carebear and hates them to their boneswell wake up its because of them your flying that shiny ship lmao dumb a
the sec hit is laughable and frankly a nonissue since you can roll up an alt to do your shopping and if worse comes to worse you can roll up another gank alt in under a week lets face it all it has to be able to do is fly a destroyer and fit moderate weapons as long as you can run in a pack hell you can eve go ratting and get your security hit back so dont feed me this we lose security status like it actually means anything to you if it meant something you wouldnt be ganking people amiriteas for the rest of it  no i dont want to be completely safe i do however demand that people suffer the consequences for their choices i chose to undock my ship so yes that means i chose to be available for nonconsenual pvp  absolutely nothing i can about that except fit the best tank i can and hope its enoughhowever you chose to throw your ship away  you chose to lose that ship its fittings and the related sec status for attacking a neutral target in high security space so come down off your save the gankers high horse like youre some kind of a martyr for suffering those things you nailed yourself to that cross
i am neutral on this topicbuthow about a 37 day cooldown period on insurance just pick a reasonable timeframe where basic insurance is refused and better packages cannot even be bought if you have recently lost your ship within this period for whatever reasonmaybe just exclude t1 frigates from this ruleso many things are timebased in eve why not insurancelagruna zegata

as in forbidding certain players docking privileges in empire space or destroying their pods in empire space etc got to admit i like the way you think guy
banning insurance payouts to people killed by concord is long overdue was promised several expansions back and patience is running short

the login issues spawns from the fact that you are being bounced around in the load balancerthe csm already dealt with this issue last year ccp isnt going to touch this forum code but they are working on a new forum
thats a ty logic on their part then if something is broken that bad its worth working on even if its to only have a temporary workaround in place working on a new forum is not an excuse for leaving the old one broken like thisbesides the new forum could be months away if not years do you really want to wait that long with this bug aroundits really getting out of hand everybody who uses forums enough complain about it if they tell me a new forum will be release within the end of the summer then ill wait if its any longer than that id like a quick fix please
ah i didnt see that post since i rarely go in the general forum thanks for bringing it upas for not finding the easy button well i never said it was easy to fix as i dont know how they programmed it in the first place i do know however that asp really sucks to manage
when im mining and see in the scan overview not the main overview tat roid is low in ore then i chek where is the turret moving cycle at in console to determine when to turn it off then i target another roid turn off turret when i think current cycle point corresponds to quantity left in roid and restart it at newly locked roid so turret wont be mining an empty roid to cycle end to illustrate a little say if cycle of laser is at half and quantity in roid is 6k ores i turn it off due to miners do around 12k a cycle problem is i have no idea wat turret is targeting wat roid so many times i end up turning off the wrong turret there is not even a marker in scan overview my suggestion is to assign different numbers symbols colors or something to turrets and to the corresponding marker in both the main and scanner overview to be able to see wat turret is targeting wat roid
double click on the mining turret indicator besides the locked roid
please read complete post
yeah i did or is the problem that you cant get the correlation between your survey scanner and overview sorry but it really isnt clear from your posts because you say the problem is disabling the miner which is targetting a specific roid that isnt hard double clicking will do that
ty i updated the post to be more explanatory
i support what he wants basically what he means is when you use a survey scanner it doesnt show you which rocks in the scan results you already have targeted so its very hard to know if your rock is about to popyou have to select each rock in the survey results one by one so the camera snaps on the rock in space but this is the only visual help you geta simple thing would be to highlight targeted survey results in a different color ie green background or something similar and also select the corresponding target when you click on the line you can then click the turret icon next to that target to disable it
if im reading the op rightwhich isnt easy to be sure of because his writing is godawful then this makes sense and i can support it
kaylans post seems to make sense of the runon dribbling in the op im ok with that though tbh ive never really had much trouble telling the roids apart since you use the distance marker in the survey scanner to id them or at least narrow the list to two or three possible choices
the survey scanner already does this part actuallyor at least it does on my windows vista client thats how i tell which rocks in the list i am currently mining sometimes
right but if they are almost all at the same range then you have to click on each of them until you find the right one a simple highlighting would solve that really well
no and quite frankly your ideas will be better received if you use proper grammar sentence structure and grammar
when ship is under attak computer voice should alert as to when roid is depleted then continously play an alert sound until u turn alert off or attak stops sometimes im mining and managing my skills and have no idea my ship is being attaked iim usually zoom out because dont like to hear mining lasers all the time so i cant hear attak either
yes lets make afk miners and macro writers lives even easierhell no
wow i mean u r taking tat to a level where normal players are also affected sometime i want to be managing my skills or doing corp stuff while mining and i have all the right to do tat so if tat makes me and afk miner i have the right to b one and as a miner i see the usefulness of computer voice alerting when ship under attak
drones get them use them turn them to aggressivesalvage the wrecks later
problem is if a can flipper shows up then my ship is history
pay attention while mining use a mining ship that can actually tank the frigates when they show upif thats too boring for you consider joining the help channel and assist noobs while you do it
i have never had my drones auto attack a can flipper typically they only fire back when i am fired uponedit fail at quoting
great logic good for progress lets not have traffic lights ppl should pay attention lets not have cell phones wait till u get home alarm cloks are useless be more aware of the time lets get rid of honks of cars ppl need to pay attention
seriouslybad troll 010 1 for mentioning alarm clocks
macro programs cant detect specific sounds being played as triggers to do something specific so i dont see a problem with that and support this
eve has sound obligatoryseriously sure anyone who needs this is playing the game very wrong but it should probably be included anyways
i support the idea however should the sound react on rats and people attacking you or only on people or could you change it or ould you have different sounds
from a mostlyacarebear point of view not supported if you are in space you should be paying attention or be prepared to pay the consequences of not paying attention if you want to manage your skills in a 100 safe environment then dock up firstyou can also drag your character sheet around so that it doesnt cover up your overview then you can do both at the same time
the only reason this would need to be implemented is for afkers no support play the stupid gameisaac
they dont need to they just need to detect the line of code that requests the sound to be playedhell client side modification can accomplish this already and warning noise on being locked along with warning noise on damage notification are listed as features of a ratting macro exposed here fairly recently
you should be paying attention to the overview if you are playing and not be playing afkish its really easy to spot a hostile npc or players already if you at least pay attention even if your eyes are somewhere elseif you are mining deploy a few drones and set them on aggressive and your problem is solved
well it doesnt actually work like that but whatever i still dont think this would be a bad thing and i dont use macro programs
not supported i tend to do other stuff when i mine but unlike the op i think its reasonable that there should be consequences for not paying attention
im not even involved in faction warfare yet i think its only fair no pun intendedsupported
i love the new exploration system however there is one aspect of the system that bothers mea lot for those of us who are unable to log on right after down time you ever notice when you log on later on in the day a good deal of the exploration sites have been cleared out in terms of balance this is not fair to those who dont have the luxury of getting up at odd hours of the morningnight to go get to the newest exploration site my proposal is that much like the ending time of a wormhole for example all explorations sites should also have a generation time ie a time in which they will appear in a solar system by not having all sites generate after downtime this will allow those in different time zones an equal chance of getting to run the site without being left with partially taken radar sites and mined out grav sites
you do know that as soon as a site is completed in a region a new site will spawn within that region
are you sure about this ive scanned a few systems on a few different occasions within the same day and it seems that new sites dont seem to appear within the 2hour time frame if new sites do appear within the region as other sites are completed this would be the solution to the issue however i had been told that no new sites appear after downtime when inquiring on this on the exploration channel in eve
i agree there should be regular spawns of exploration sites throughout the day and not just a mass of spawns at the beginning of the day after downtime if they indeed only spawn once every 24 hours only ccp would have to confirm this
i dont see a problem i do most of my scanning in the late evening hours of my north american timezone a good twelve hours after uptime and i have very little trouble locating systems with sites to find
you should see how goons name their stations before suggesting stuff like that
case in point not supported

while i appreciate the hardwork done by our duly elected csm candidates posts like this make me wonder if maybe blizzards model of ignoring player suggestions entirely isnt the better one

i dont see why it shouldnt be possible to bribe pirate factions to increase standings up to 20 so that the worst agents could be used as a starting point i mean come on theyre pirates money is everything to themof course donating large sums of money to pirate organizations might get the attention of the officials and faction  security ratings might be adjusted a bit as well
when im looking for systems with a security level map shows colors accordingly but some either have same color or is difficult to tell ie 7 and 8 both green it would be better if instead of showing a colored dot a number ie 7 instead of showing a green dot a number 7
your threads are all suspiciously geared towards making macromining easier ccp will you please look into that guys operations 
because macro miners would be helped by this how exactlythe only one really helped by this are i guess pirates with low sec status but not very low who want to go arround systems with too high sec status personally i wont support it because i have serious doubts it will solve anything a large mass of numbers wont make it clearer use one of the pdf version eve maps to plot your route then a better solution i think would be if autopilot could just avoid systems with a sec status higher than x and lower than y
well usually i think that if u zoom all the way out the map i think a mass of colors are no more useful than a mass of numbers sometimes when im looking for certain level to mine to go to system where i can handle the rats i zoom the map all the way in and i have to hover the mouse over the dots to see wats their security level which i think defeats in some measure the purpose of coloring the dots anyway
the macro mining argument is baseless and silly but the op is asking for a noticeably worse way to represent data if you want to know the sec status of a system hover over it you cant put that many numbers onto a map as dense at the eve star map and have them stay readable
um no its fairly easy as it is
greetings fellow pod pilotsi havent played eve in a really long time and ive been back since a few days so please forgive me if my idea is complete and utter madnesstoday i was thinking about going out for a hunt in jet my little assault ship possibly for a lonely miner after some 20 minutes of wandering through low security space this stream of thought switches on in my mind its a shame we cant go after the lone miners in high sec id usually discard these ideas immediately but not this time and this is where you guys come to give me a kick in the back ill understand it was a blasphemous thought from the get go or elaborate on it with mekeep in mind this is involving high security systems instead of the concord coming within seconds to the miners aid when engaged by a bearded man with a patch on his eye and dispatch the unlucky criminal in a jiffy you get organized mining corporations with security wings so on their regular outings they are always protected by their own private security fleetso you might ask what would the newbie miner do if theyre all big corporations taking care of extracting minerals eve is famous for its player run economy so no shortage of openings in said corporations for our newbie miners is to be expectedthe bearded and shaved pirate might be more lucky finding a bold miner all by himself without the concord coming in to shoot him after he killed the miner probablyconcord could still take care of maintaining the law in empire asteroid belts for example where the a percentage of the ore extracted goes to one of the 4 empires a place for newbies to start maybethe status quo in my opinion greatly encourages isk farming other than seriously reducing the more exciting aspect of being a miner always having to keep an eye open and of the small time pirate looking for a bit of fun where in the current situation has to either gate camp or be a statistic having dealt 1 damage in the next blob killstrict policies may be put in place to prevent high security space becoming an open killing field of courseagain i beg for forgiveness if i just made you waste your time in case this was another crazy idea of minecheerssmall time pirate with very dull prospects for his future
im not against pvp per se nor am i against the idea that mining operations should be bringing their own security with them what i dont want is gatecamps on asteroid belts to the extent that it suddenly becomes necessary for every mining operation to have a 20 bs fleet escorting itso though i say no now understand that its not the idea of pvp im arguing against despite being a member of the species ursus caveo im simply trying to protect the idea that there are places where you can go to mine without being hounded constantly by asshats with guns
in practice this will never happen because ccps subscriber base is predominantly carebear for that matter im not sure that it should mining is already lame there is no conceivable reason it needs to be made worse by giving them a specific vulnerability to pirates and if youre proposing that highsec be turned into lowsec id support that even less
so you punish the guys who are mostlikely building your ships or mine the ore to build your ships if you dont like they earn money with supplying you maybe start mining yourself and get a chunk of the isk cake but be warned mining is not excitingnot supported
wut i get plenty of excitement while i mine perusing the forums is never boring
im not saying im supporting the idea but this argument seems one sided this is one of those things that would balance out the prices of ships would go up and miners would be able to pay out their protection but i also think this would escalate into something stupid  think of the pwars and jihadswarm they took a great concept and pushed it beyond its limits the same would happen here i miss the pwars 
just remove naval faction spawns for outlaws and prevent people from hopping corp in the 12 hours prior to a wardec going live until 12 hours after the war dec has gone livethere is your highsec pvpsup carebears
actually ill go you one better and say that if a person leaves a corp during a war dec the wt status follows the former member for a period of time i think i once proposed 7 days or until the war ends which ever is shortercarebear or not corp hopping to avoid a war dec is fail imo
if you detail that carefully in a proposal i can pretty much guarantee an armada of 10s supporting it
i think we all see these proposals far too often although it does seem more reasonable then most of the remove concord so we pirates can gank all the noobs crap that is usually what is postedstill no highsec doesnt need to become less secure this would just be a nightmare for the new players
eris only got 5 turrets hardpoints since 1 more high slot is used for the interdiction sphere launcher the other 2 high slot should be fitted with 2 launchers is this a jokeeris got a bonus for light missiles so you could say that one could fit 4 launchers and 4 turrets but we all know that it just dont work well on this shipthe sabre got a bonus to turrets falloff this clearly show that there is no need for the launcher bonus for every shipbecouse of these considerations i propose to give the eris 2 more turrets hardpoints and change its bonus for a turret one optimal range or bonus or rof for exampleif you do not agree with me you should really try an eris and see how bad it is compared to the other dictors
increase in drones subwarpspeed per level
why there is a skill called drone navigation and it makes your drones go a lot fast already whats the point for another skill then
it only increase their speed while mwding this skills would increase their speed while not mwding i think its a good idea there should eb a way to do it but wouldnt mind if drone navigation was simply changed to give a 5 increaselevel to drone speed so both when mwding and when not mwding instead of just drone mwd speed
i can see how it could be useful for example to increase orbit speed so your drones are harder to trackname drone maneuveringtraining time multiplier 5 xdescription increases drone orbit velocity 2 increase to drone orbit velocity per skill levelprimary attribute intelligencesecondary attribute perceptionrequirementsdrones vdrone navigation ivas an example this would make the warrior light scout drone orbit at 825ms instead of 750ms at level 5
im not particularly interested in buffing your afk missionrunning domi by cutting travel times by 13rd and decreasing the time it takes for your drones to clear a room
the whole reason drone navigation was changed away from applying all the time was that drones started outtracking themselves if you got your navigation skill too high i dont want to recreate that situation also this is a totally unnecessary skill not supported
i canUFFFDt see what this should be good for drones are alredy at their edge of tracking if they are not fast enough for a specific target they mwd to follow which works just fineand thereUFFFDs really no need for more dronekills at all we already have an abundance of rank 5 skills therenot supported
this is your second proposal that would make life easier for macro users and afk players hmm what you want is drone navigation
this would be a great addition to the tatical overlay
id imagine a series of concentric circles with range markers on them would do the tricki find the scanner to be quite intuitive as it is simply click on your ship to get box round your ship and the tactical overlay and box work together as a kind of crosshair that said new toys are always nice
wtb reply link that doesnt put multiple session ids into the urlin any case there used to be a feature similar to this ccp removed it for whatever reason would like to have it back i know that there is a super 1337 scanner pro in this thread but for the rest of us it would be nice to have this extra tool
eve should be difficult to master because it has depth not because of a crappy ui supported
they could use something like the tactical overlay for this when you arent in the system map and the basis is there in the system map too tbh seems that all this would require is a modification of existing tools yes i know that may be easier said than done
forgot to support
not supportedtry using your alt key the feature exists youre just not using it 
are you in a bad mood today or whatif you read my post completely youd know i already use the alt key but its not good enough
supported i do not see how this is anything but good
im in a fantastic mood eleven cups of coffee will do that to ya no no  youve got me all wrong im really just an the alt key works pretty well for me and everyone else ive trained to use it is your alt key brokenlemme put this in context i tend to object to your ideas because they tend to be make things easier ideas some things should be easier but usually the things you point out already have tools that exist for them or shouldnt be made easier sometimes your logic baffles the hell out of me  which is why i went after you when you started spouting off about i know ms sql so i know tranquility nonsense thats a squarepegroundhole argument you need to understand that i respect you for what youre trying to bring to the game  innovation and new ideas i also genuinely like some of your ideas i generally heartily disagree with your usual arguments of this should be implemented because i feel like it in this case you really have no justification for implementing a feature that is already implemented
ccp had announced extra attention to the lag issue in the qa and here we go  dierdra reports a supposed fix had worked well which they tried yesterday in a noticeable fleetread up on the facts and figures on the issues workarounds  localization forum the thread called fighting lag faction warfare edition round two page 4 ff
tell you what sparky  how about you fix it now im pretty sure that ccp knows whats goin on and its probably not a quick switch flip oh sven  why dont you hit the fast switch over there on the wall yeah  that one ok good  scratch that one off the listnot supported because this is not a proposal this is a whine
basically add a new popup yesno warning when youre about to warp out while your drones are still in space clicking no cancels the warp clicking yes initiates it and checking never show again would never show the warning again oh really
supporting myself
not supportedif im running away in a panic the last thing i want is to have to click a little tiny confirm screen i will already be busy watching my ship get destroyed and be spamming the warp button
cant support both because when you need to warp out you need to warp out now and because its one of the things that separates good drone users form bad ones
did you read my suggestion if you check the never show again box the first time it pops up you wont ever see it again same as all other warnings
this is an attempt at making eve idiotproof this would be a bad thing so im going to say no
thing is i dont want this box to pop up as im trying to warpjump out a moros whose sentry drones have deployed 25km awayespecially when i need it to get the heck out of dodge now might be nice for missioners that are too inattentive to notice their drones are still in the beltmission site but this is eve you should be punished for ignoranceits the only way to learn
i am guilty of leaving drones in a belt but after i did it a time or two and had to go back to get them i learned to pay attention before i warp offit would be wrong of us to deprive future players of this valuable learning eexperiencenot supported
what the hell i dont understand any of these arguments honestly its a simple warning message its not recalling drones for you its just letting you know youre about to warp out while they are still outtheres warnings for when youre about to attack someone in highsec for the first time theres warnings for when youre about to jettison something but you cant have a simple warning for when youre about to warp out with drones outyour logic makes no sense at all it would not break game balance and wouldnt have any impact for the ones who dont want this cause they can check it off the first time it pops upif you leave all warnings enabled eve is already pretty much idiot proof except for this thing some of you probably forgot how many warnings you get when they are all enabled so i suggest you go in your options and reset them all just to rememberas for learning from your mistakes well i know plenty of veterans that still forget to recall drones once in a while before they warp so i know many would still like this everybody in my corp did anyway guess im gonna have to ask them to come here to support this post thenagain you didnt read how hard would it be to warp somewhere with drones out once on purpose and check the box on the warning so it never shows up again for you
supported because it can be turned off like all the other warnings
not supported if you leave your drones in the first place thats your problem what is this hello kitty online
i support itjust have another button in the drone settings to turn on and off and it should be finebasically if your pvp it would be off so when u try to warp it want give a warning msg saying u will leave your drones and then you dieand pve people would more than likely want it on so there drones dont die when they warp off
supported if there is a warning that pops up when you jump into lowsec to let you know you may get shot at i see no problem with reminding the absent minded miner that a drone hasnt yet returnedts
i am going to revise my stance after some further thought it would probably have been nice as a new player to get some kind of notification that id left valuable assets laying about on the gridas long as the dont show me again box gets implemented ive no problem with it
thanks de i appreciate this and yes the warning popups are all the same they all have the option to be turned off via a never show me again checkbox and can all be reset in the reset settings tab of the games options this one wouldnt be differentcheers
i donUFFFDt like iteverytime you make a new client setup one of the most important things is to turn off all warnings that might get you killed this would be just one more of themand besides what would be nextwarning you are about to undock are you sure you want to do this space outside the stationenvironment might not be safe yn
totally supportedand seriously the hello kitty joke is so old and that it tripped and broke its hip and so it became lame
not supportedeve is one of those environments that gives the lesson after the test you lose enough drones and youll figure it out its not like drone expenses have broken anyones bank well not since invention anyway
i support the idea but not sure about a popup maybe just a box similar to when taking damage letting the person know they still have drones out but doesnt effect their ability to jump when needed or have to turn it off
supported
hmmm  how about a global block on gooniessupported  i dont see why this shouldnt be an option
wouldnt use it but id say why not
some people will probably complain that itd make things too easy but i cant think of any issues that this would create that i would object to supported
bacon and no
i guess i am not sure what purpose it would serve if were going to ask the devs to devote time to something id like to know what benefit the player base is going to get out of it
i do not want even more freeeasy intell provided by the local channel no support
i dont know about you guys but im sick and tired of my credit card company charging me some silly foreign transaction fee for my subscription to eve for me it may only be 40 cents or so but the credit card company doesnt deserve it for doing nothing one way around this fee is to pay by paypal however if you do this ccp requires you to pay monthly manually every time which can get to be a pain if you have a bad memory for things like paying bills like me i went to paypals website and found out that there is a way to set up recurring payments directly through them i propose that ccp create a way to accept recurring payments by simply publishing their paypal email address and then linking the payee with the eve account so we can forever say goodbye to these greedy scamming credit card companies once and for all
i wont get into a debate over the ethics of credit card companies but the proposal to have recurring paypal payments instead of needing to manual every time i do support
i see no reason why paypal payments cant be made automagically since paypal supports it
it is also safer to use paypal i really like this i already submitted a ettion on this matter and i do suport the idea
a slider bar its always frustrating when youre trying to scan something but dont want the 5 degree setting or the 30 degree setting it always seems that 15 degrees is just too damn hard to get so either make it a drop down box or allow people to just enter a number
no no no please not another damn text menu if anything the slide bar should be applied to things like orbit distance to make choosing between fighting in opitmal  falloff  edge of point easierif its really such a problem for you go to control panel and slow your mouse cursor down or simply learn to hold a mouse properly
i agree with yani here but why not use keyboard shortcuts  this game lacks lots of shortcuts
the solution is simple leave it as it is currently but have the number change inside an input box when you move the slider you can either use the slider or type it in manuallyif you type it in and tab out the slider changes to reflect the change and vice versa
how about just spacing out the points so that theyre all evenly spread instead of being a linear relation to the angle
this that slider bar is a pita the way its set up
this tbh
the only change id consider would be keeping the 1 jump24 hours but allow you to have an extra one buffered up so you could jc to empire buy some skillbooks and then jc back to 00 again after 24 hours you can make one jump again after 48 hours you have 2 jumps available to you but after that it stops increasing just like now
no idea why my previous reply here was removed but again no and especially not by halfi could see room for a rank 8 skill which reduces the cooldown by say 1 hour per level but its not necessary
while it would be nice when you live in paragon soul the ore systems or some far away part of 00 to get skill books and jump right back this removes some of the risk from living in deep 00 it also removes one of the more interesting economies from the game resale of npc seeded skillbooks in 00 eve needs more player interaction and forcing people to fly for skillbooks if they want it now is a good one
theres little chance of a cockpit view ever happening in terms of ship piloting purely because of the fact that it completely contradicts the games backstory and setting ships are flown from the confines of a capsule the only cockpit based flight is that of npcs and fighter pilotsi wouldnt be opposed to twitch based ship control and a cockpit view if the ability to pilot a fighter was ever made possible i think doing so was something very briefly discussed and vaguely at fanfest 08 as something ccp may consider in future
more inconvenience and more things to click to do the same thing you can do with a regular cargo bay blackops have a fuel bay because they need a lot of fuel and arent meant to be haulers its a specific need that couldnt be easily addressed any other way sifting through 7 divisions of a corporate hangar array is enough for me if you want to lets continue the discussion in the original thread about the idea

all of which you have listed missed the point i am trying to make selling stuff out of restricted corp hanger to corp members not take a significant amount of time it is a colossal pain in the ass for ppl with the roles to do so a few of the problems with with the current system are1 larger corps need to have the ability to sell itemsships to corp members this requires they give more and more ppl director roles in order to unable them to sell from restricted corp hangar this increases this risk of corp theft because of the need to add more and more directors to handle purchase requests2 it takes a ridiculous amount of time to take out all individual items being purchased and give them to the member it makes it infinitely worse if you are not in station with them3 a simple store or automatic setting of prices for all items within the hangar that want to be sold could easily be programmed it would reduce the over head  work needed to run many alliances4 corp contracts are a headache to set up for every damn item and it gets exponentially bad when ppl want there own set ups and not a prefit exact setup that the corp makesmy proposal simply add a store tab to the corp hangars that would allow a director to set prices on all items within the hangar any time any module is dropped in this hangar it will automatically be priced and ready to be bought you could also make a restriction per a corp member on amount bought or items bought to keep people from buying out the store these restrictions could be set per the role you have in the corpthe point of this is to reduce the overhead running of larger corps and i think the feature could easily be added to the game via the corp hangar or via a special market tab this same sort of time saving features have been set up in countless other mmos and it is about time eve online joined their ranks obviously this is not a polished idea and i look forward to your comments and suggestions please bring this up at the next csm thank yougv
we got that already in our industry expansion called midas it is called storefrontsohh wait thats right the industry expansion turned out to be about a lot of cool features hyped and delivered on 1 aka orcame is a still bitter carebear
just noticed that minutes have been published thank you
signedand i cant even fly a capital
for min 800 mil for the ship i want an epic effect like the old one 
agreed
and lets ignore the counterarguments to this issue while were at it gooooooo csm
youve just repeatedly stated that afs are overpowered giving frankly unbelievable anecdotes as proof i dont see any new points to address perhaps youd care to state your arguments clearly for me i might be missing somethingbesides this has already been forwarded to and approved by the csm of course im glad the topic is still active hopefully is attracting plenty of attention to the issue
firstly the anecdote was legitimate whether or not you choose to accept it however at this point thats not my argumentsecondly im not asking for an af nerf im saying that theyre fine as is and if anything overpoweredas for my argument youve stated that the relationship between t1 frigates and t1 cruisers is balanced and that it is the equivalent of the relationship between t2 frigates and t2 cruisers therefore youve argued yourself that the relationship between t2 frigates and t2 cruisers is evenadditionallyafs are harder to hit than cruisers therefore tank better by defaultafs have ridiculously high resistances its not hard to get 80 across the board which means excellent active tanks and ridiculously good remote rep 1 large remote rep on an 80 resistance tanks 426 dps not even factoring in the size of the shipafs cost a fraction of the price of t2 ships of other classes a vengeance costs literally 17th the cost of a zealot in jita and take about 13 the time to skill intoa competent af pilot will engage t2 cruisers and leave if the fight doesnt go their way ive engaged pilgrims ishtars deimos to name a few in my afevery af has a role but no af has every rolethe main argument for afs not receiving a boost is something thats hard for a lot of people to fathom its that their mobility is their greatest asset you can really choose your fights if you know what youre doing and if people arent specifically set up to kill you railguns on a deimos to catch an orbiting af a full nano pilgrim to catch an mwd af in neut range then you can kill them with ease what you cannot do with afs is go rambo into any fight with any ship and expect to win you need to be cautious if youre in a blaster harpy you probably shouldnt be going after that vexor with small guns  drones if youre in a rocket vengeance your targets should be other afs and frigates not cruisersafs are not and should not become i win buttons a competent af pilot should be capable of taking out some but not all cruisers and of course the occasional lucky kill of a better ship i believe this is the case currently for the long list of reasons stated abovei would appreciate some input from our delegates if any of them have the cajones to actually make arguments for this buff rather than just apologies for the wall of text 
anecdotal evidence is still you know anecdotal and does not really add muchi dont believe everyone here is advocating a buff but a coherent design with t2 ships a fourth bonus does not necessary mean a better ship if it is rebalanced in the process but coherency aside there are some nagging issues with afs for instance why should i bother with gallente afs when the taranis hits harder fly faster and actually can withstand quite a beating sure there are specific situations but is this how it should be in general
if theyre rebalanced in the process sure but quite frankly theyre fine as is and while adding a 4th bonus might make them more coherent the rebalancing entailed would just create more work that ccp doesnt need with no gain as for gallente afs vs ranis that sounds like youd be advocating a nerf of the ranis rather than a buff of afs however if your ranis would like to 1v1 my ishkur id be happy to oblige 
supportedit seems to me that the general opinion among eve players is that rockets need to be boosted
i would personally love to see actual rocket barrages much like the robotech macross plus rocketsmissiles click here for an exampleinstead of being fired like normal missiles rockets would fire in bursts of several rockets rockets would do more damage individually but have less precision and possibly have a chance to miss since rockets are so small they should also be unguided thus the need for a barragethe range should also be slightly increased should be faster but shooting a target at longer range would mean youd have more chances to miss due to their unguided nature much like torpedoes
explosion radius and explosion velocity both have to be buffed thats an absolute minimum change but that alone will not fix the problem rocket damage must be increased to at least such a point that unbonused nonblaster small turrets do not outdamage them on ships which actually have a rocket weapon bonus ffs

when i started playing eve a few years ago i chose the nickname that you see here a sinner because sinner is the nickname i used in all the games i played and i badly wanted to have it here as well the current owner of sinner is an alt of an most likely inactive player from the beta which makes me really sad but the most dissapointing thing is that when i went through auras tutorial is that i wasnt told about the fact that it is very important how a player should choose his nickname and here i am of course reffering to the fcs habbit of calling primaries by name in fleet battles i am primary most of the time and it spoils my enjoyment of the game since i am dead in the first 30 seconds of the battle and missing all the actionkillmails i am loosing a lot of isk this way and i think its not fair to me and other players in my situation i should have been informed about this at the beginning when it wasnt too late to create a new char
and when you accidentally dont pay the rent for the office all the bpos get locked in the impound hangar so they arent moved back when you start paying again
one more bump
i agree arazu and lachesis have the disruption bonus so they are very good tackling ships but after the speed nerf u cant speed tank it and that was pretty much the only way to tank it right now it needs its rsd bonuses back so it can kill the lock on the ships theyre tackling otherwise youre dead in a matter of seconds
when rigs were first introduced into this game the idea was would you be willing to pay for the extra ump when this patch was first announced i like the idea because i and many others were under the impression that smaller rigs would be smaller bonuses for less cost instead what were getting is cheaper ways to fit smaller ships by doing this not only are smaller ships going to be very easy to rig so much that it will be stupid not to rig them but large rigs will likely drop in price drastically too because the demand on that grouping of rigs will drop heavily when frigs and cruiser will be using a different set for much lower costthe issue i have with this patch is its removing the choice to fit rigs and replacing it with the necessity to fit rigs at such low cost per rig the choice not to fit a rig becomes as irrelevant as someone choosing not to fit their last high slot or someone who has a 6 slot tank on a geddon ultimately its removing choice and reward for choice and replacing it with common sense vs the lack there of its just another step towards cookie cutter bull gaming and thats why pvp is becoming so monotonous in todays game you get to see choices less than in the past but still some with the issue of rigging a frigate for instance its usually about a 4k ms frig going against a 6k ms frigate one shells out the cost for more umph the other chooses not to it doesnt dictate the fight but it does factor into the fightif the patch goes through as intended instead what youll see is every frig racing around at 6k ms bc to justify not spending 500k to 2 mil on 3 rigs is just lunacy and stupidity not only is this bad for diversity of game play its also bad for balance of ships if everyone is fitting rigs rather than just some it will retweak balance issues between ships youre going to see more speed more range more hp added into the game overall which is going to affect the balance between levels of ships classes while i dont ask that people support the below i do ask that everyone support the dislike of what this patch will bring its another set in the direction of cookie cutter bull pvpthe alternative which makes more sense to this is simple more expensive rigs with greater bonuses and cheaper rigs will lesser bonuses a cheap rig would typically get about 13 the bonus of a large rig but for 13 the cost what that option does better than the proposed patch is simple it provides benefits to those willing to scale cost vs reward still its essentially the middle ground bt what we have now and and the extremely ghetto proposed patchultimately the point is allow people to close the gap bt those who are rich and those who are poor but please please dont just make everyone get the same buffs for nothingfurther explanation on why this is bad currently i often choose not to rig a small or medium size ship bc i do not like the cost vs reward i knowingly make the choice to put myself at a disadvantage and force myself to go beat better equipped ships with my skill rather than my fit but when cost becomes a non factor im getting more of an advantage over someone wo really doing anything different rigs are currently equivalent to the choice between fitting ship standard faction or complex by removing this model youre removing half of what makes ships diversified and diversity is what makes pvp interesting
supported and let me add this under the proposed patch unless prices change radically from what theyre proposingto rig a frigates 3 slots will cost less than 1 tech 2 1mn mwdto rig a battle cruisers 3 slots will cost less than or equal to its t2 gunswith those cost how will virtually anyone not justify rigging their ship bye bye prized ships hello standard fits
i support the general idea that pvp ships should be more expensive to lose i dont like how easy money making has become in this game and how ccp seem to be interested in making it cheaper and more meaningless
with the current proposed rig changes it is a musthave to rig your ship no matter whatthe current rules proposed by the patch are to tight there is no room left to play aroundit is well explained in the op that notrigging is as much as an option as not using your low slots for an armor tanker  you can do that but it is completely nonsense with other words a must havea ruleset which basically enforces you to do something if you still want to be up to par is not a change for the better it removes choice and variations
supported i would be interested to see counterarguments to this proposal op does an excellent job of proving their point
not supported at the moment rig slots on medium and especially small ships are essentially useless while you can rig them its somewhat idiotic to do so also the patch should also make t2 rigs more reasonable so if you want to be able to pay more for extra umph theyll actually be an optionalso i dont see how allowing rigs on smaller ships more easily which are intended to increase diversity would do the opposite particularly if ccp rebalances them correctly like they claim they will
i like the concept behind ccps idea but i was very surprised to hear that rigs for mediumsized cruiser ships would be 20 the price of large current rigs and that rigs for smallsized frigae ships would be 4 the pricethats too aggressive scaling and will indeed produce the effect youre complaining about where fitting rigs will be mandatory according to the dev blog a frigate rig is projected to cost between 100k and 1m iskwhen i proposed sized rigs last year my suggestion as much less aggressively scaled small rigs should be 10 of the cost of large rigs and medium rigs should be something like 3040 of the cost of large rigsand perhaps even that was too aggressive perhaps medium rigs should be half cost and small rigs be 25 costi want to be able to rig my cruisers and frigates without revealing to the world the fact that im a fool with far too many isk and far too little common sense but i do agree with you that variety is highly desirable and obviously if all frigates are rigged then there is no frigatevarietyso what would be an appropriate scaling 100205 obviously isnt it my original proposal which was from last year and wasnt not thought through in terms of numbers but simply contained numbers because some numbers should be there was 1004010what about 1005020also keep in mind that caldari carebears like me already fit their passive drakes with shield tanking rigs thats not the issue a battlecruiser is almost a battleship the issue is frigates and cruisers and also destroyers for those of you who can stomach the idea of flying a combat ship with no tubes
i disagree sized rigs are leveling the playing field for those who couldnt afford to fit rigs pay more for more umph its still the case just more in line for average joe ever since rigs were introduced they should have been available for all ship sizes but logic failures and people being lazy about salvage prevented that and thus we have the current price points there were never any npc buyers to suggest a price either it sounds more like a whine than a justification because you are worried about your overpriced rigged tiny ships losing their edge if your complaint is that rigs will make pvp more cookie cutter i couldnt disagree more again people will choose rigs commensurate with their play style andor skills cant track well enough ill fit a tracking rig want to be more snipey a range rig will do more tank there are rigs for that as well this change doesnt enforce behavior it only enables it enforcement is like saying you have to fit this no matter what and there is no rule against flying naked aka no mods etcif anything it will now be more difficult to predict what you will encounter when engaging a t1 target and thinking about tactics would do eve a lot of good if your soft targets are getting a tad more hard its up to you to adjust for it
i agree yet another stupid attempt to make eve identical for everyone
not supportedyoure talking all about choice but the truth is currently you do not have the choice to fit rigs on frigates except for those who have too much moneythis change gives me and other who are always looking for iskefficient ways into pvp the choice to fit rigs on frigatesalso as has been remarked prices of bs rigs might as well rise with the change due to the higher demand for smaller sized rigs
when everyone has identical fitting everything gets boring we might as well all fly t1 ships with t1 fittings rigs were those extra effort slots anything but mandatory now everyone will rig all ships this isnt about elitist rich jerks versus poor average players a set of rigs wouldnt kill anyone finacially but it was expensive enough to warrant a decision about risk and reward now that entire aspect of the game is gone everyone has rigs people stop caring about them rigs become yet another logistic nuisance for all players
1ccps price scaling is way too agressive and combined with their idea of a salvage reactor to make t2 salvage from t1 parts will just have the same effect that the op puts forth on t2 rigs too
this whole thread is based on the premise that there is only one right combination of rigs for each ship my opinion is that this change will allow multiple equally valid combinations especially for small ships where at the cost of some million you can try different set up and even change them at a vim not supported
not supportedpresuming a cost of 2m to rig a frigate id say that fits with the idea of adding umph for more isk already rigging a t1 frigate will still cost several times the price of the hull and on a t2 frigate theyd still represent a significant investment compared to the hullcost personally i dont think rigs will be cheap enough and should scale more appropriately with hull costsif you are looking to invest more isk to get better performance there are faction deadspace and officer modules these are far more suitable for pvp as they may drop in the wreck rewarding the victorin my view the performance gap between the rich and the poor doesnt need increasing the traderdedicated mission runneretc can splash out for t2 ships rigs and fits and spice it up with factiondeadspaceofficer equipment the weekend warrior who makes isk for perhaps one hour of the three hours he plays a week is looking at fielding unrigged t1 ships with t2named fittings id say the difference there is vast enough forcing those with lives beyond the game or whose talents dont lend themselves to passive isk generation to fly subpar ships with subpar fits and a rack of empty slots somewhat detracts from the impact of skill in pvp there should be a gap but it shouldnt be the deciding factor in as many conflicts as it is
reducing prices allows greater variety for people whose current options are a not fitting rigs and b not fitting rigs reducing the price of t2 rigs falls under the same premise only opening up more options for those with the cash to fit t1 rigs all this is going alongside a rebalancing of rigs with the intent to ensure we see more use from rigs that are currently underpowered and the introduction of new rigsid say thats a rather large increase in variety both for the game and for many individual pilots options
yes its why we have t1 t2 t3 faction deadspace officer to make sure that different people have different stuff if the majority cant afford premium then the math is solidthe problem here is that rigs are no longer premium that way so theres really no middleground when it comes to giving your ship an extra kick its either millionisk t2 mods or the billionisk deadspace modsrigs were the option in between with moderate expense and a tangible rewardin a game like world of warcraft everyone can wear everything the problem is getting it ie directly depends on time spent playing in eve you can have anything off the market its beautiful because there are so many ways of earning money and so many premium items threatened by permanent loss that people actually think not only what but if they should fit somethingbulldozing the rigs takes a part of that awayi know im pretty vocal on the issue but in the end i understand ccps decision im a videogame marketing specialist i have seen ccps stats on player wealth and 00 versus empire population dumbing down eve is profitable this doesnt make me happier about the whole thing
compelttly agree supported
all i see is a rig manufacturer who doesnt want to lose money and waste all those researched now large rig bpos good try though and also rich ppls who pvp with isk
i love it when every word of someones objection just proves they didnt even read the opas for your last paragraph itll be the exact same as it is today but with people rigged speed cruisers will get more speed tank cruisers will get more tank range cruisers will get more range cap cruisers will get more cap the only difference is that you can assure yourself theyll have rigs rather than have to guess
pvp is not supposed to be isk efficient it supposed to show advantages for people willing to pay what makes it so much fun is killing those people who put way more money into their ships and still lose i took a t2 fitted absolution solo against a faction fit navy raven imagine how fun a fight it was after 10 minutes and a win for meso by your logic should i be on here screaming about the cost of faction ships and faction gear or should i just learn how to pwn the asses of those who think fit is everything
what significant investment on a frigate are you talking about itll cost more to buy 1 t2 mod for the frigate than it will to fit 3 rigs thats not investment
not everyone can make tons of billions every weekpvp should not be for rich people only and dont talk me about tackling in a t1 frig becouse nobody wanna do that foreverthis patch will be a good one there is no reason for having only large rigs
the cause of the easy money is the fact that l4s missions are more rewarding than anything else in the game thats the issue and with this patch salvage prices are going up vs more demand so it gets even more rewarding
salvage prices will fall not go up there will be tons more demand but it will be at a 125 and 15 level removing a lot of the strain on the current bs sized rigs which if price holds will stay at the same popularity hacs anc bc typically already get rigged so reducing their build cost will mean more parts left over to build more rigsinitially people will boost their purchases of rigs to rig ships they would not have in the past over the long term with ships sitting in hangers as they do already youll see the price drop bc those same people will not have to repeat buy
exactly the type of whining which brought this change upon usrigs are not mandatory now stop making everyone who is not a loser look like an elitist rich jerkcurrently the price of rigs means that you actually have a chance of getting a small but meaningful advantage from fitting them when everyone can afford them you just pay less but get much less in return
supported as much as i like the idea of going 67k per second i realize that everybody else will be also lame i would rather trust my superior skill and skills for interceptors then pay the money but if rigs were cheap of course i would have them on my crow just like everybody else
there are some very interesting views in this thread though i tend to disagree with the idea that somehow the game will become magically less when more ships are rigged in the end i think that this change will happen and that the rigs will be common and after a while cheap there will be a time when all rigs are more expensive just due to materials costs in the end the benefits to the many are large enough that the negatives will be considered acceptable losses
not supportedreadily available and cheaper rigs will increase variability in fits rather than make combat generic or monotonousfurther the new rigs will be a buff to industry as relating to several other professionfurther people will be flying ships that are more expensive than they are now in several cases more expensive ships uninsured expense means people more likely to pay ransoms and ship losses matter more aside from increasing isk sinksi think your assertion that bs sized rigs will drastically fall in price is misguided and i think anyone involved in rig production could honestly agree with that
ive yet to hear anyone say how this patch will diversify pvp more people rig ships to complement setups not to drastically change them if i have a speed setup i rig accordingly if i have a tank setup i rig accordingly it doesnt diversify ships it just makes them better at what theyre already intended to do for that player fittings diversify ships rigs enhance that diversity through the choice to pay to use them or not removing the question should i fit rigs because they cost so much removes the enhanced diversity because when everyone does it its not diversei mean if you were to tell me that oh im going to fit speed rigs on my armor tanking ship now id say ok cool but wait speed rigs hurt armor tanking oh yeah so maybe i should put shield tanking rigs oh wait thats kinda dumb maybe instead i should put more damage rigs but thats not really diversity because i can only fit so many damage buffs with falloff so its more likely im just freeing a low doing that well how about cap well i need cap but if i can 1 slot fit an injector why the  would i use 3 rig slots to even come close to thatso in the end i decide to use armor rigs on my armor tanking ship speed rigs on my speed ship etc it doesnt make you more diverse it just makes you better at what you do already thats where diversity is being hurt its just evening the playing field even more for players which is exactly what this game is not about
this blowsi was expecting a decrease in effect with decrease in size and the option to fit all sized rigs to all sized shipslarge rig  what we have nowmed rig  20  of large effectsmall  40 of large effectcan be fitted to any ship so if you still wanted to put larges on your frigate help your self if you were cheap and only wanted to fit smalls on your bb go for itthis blows big time
i dont support this its like crying about why low slot module are so cheap now i cant choose to let them empty obviously if you want to pay more than any other person to rigs your ships fit tech 2 rigits not like its remove reward for isk tech 2 rigs are like 10 to 20 times more costly than tech 1 and its actualy give more diversity in pvp do i fit tank capacitor cpu powergrid or dps rigs sure you will never use tank shield rig on an armor tank fregate but you can choice to add some dps rig or on a ships with low tank but high dps make him more resistant not only tank armor  armor rig
not supported the new change is great and i can only wonder why was it not done sooner the only legitimate issue that even remotely needs discussing is what is the correct ratio of cost between different rig sizes your solution would be a fine addition to the size system so each size class would also have different quality rigs but a horrible subsititute to the ccp plan
the alternative which makes more sense to this is simple more expensive rigs with greater bonusesi like this but isint there already t2 maybe make a t3 and even out the prices
i dont think the rig patch is a really bad idearigs overall add more diversity its not like your going to fit every bs you come across with trimarks or every cruiser you come across with polycarb rigs maybe some people do but they arent thinking when they make a setupthe level of this diversity ended up being mostly limited to t2 or bs ships because of the price not all people have billions in their pocket so they wouldnt rig anything cruiser or frigate size atm this patch however creates a much bigger market for salvaging parts which will also lead towards the rise of the price in the end this patch will make rigs more common which is a good thing because more customisation is always goodthis patch however will not lead to loads of cookie cutter setupsyou can fit every upgrade you wish in the rig slots everything from ecm boost to tank boost so what it boils down to is that its a load of modules which arent limited except for the number of how many you can fit and the calibration max which you will never reach so this means if you are not copying a setup that you really need to choose to max out the potential of your setupthe op is also comparing individual ships and we all know 1 vs 1 almost never happens in eve and if it happens it is never fair
let me know how much armor ehp you get from small trimarked rigged punishers or medium trimarked rigged ruptures because im pretty sure its less than i get out of a large trimarked rigged armageddon alreadyreducing  is stupid when the ship sizes already scale the rigs appropriately the only rigs that wont scale appropriately are speed rigs which are used exclusively on small ships already very very rarely on medium sized ships so interceptors rigged for speed will maintain the same speed as before itll just cost less instead of getting their speed nerfed which is what would happen if you scaled it since they will no longer be able to fit large rigs thatd create a situation where the ships rigged prepatch are irreplaceable and flatly superior to the ones rigged post patch basically this thread is a whine about nothing boohoo you wont be spending 50mil in rigs for a ship costing 15mil anymore or are you worried the plebes will finally be able to match your leet pvp skill ie your wallet when theyre as fast as you are the only class of ships this patch effects is interceptors everything else already scales appropriately seriously op should cry us a river then drown himself in it in game
your logic is flawed increased demand  price increase in the earlier stages more people will fit rigs to smaller ships but as time progresses the price will go up and then suddenly its not the norm anymorebesides saying that it removes diversity is pretty dumb people wont fit trimarks to frigs because it reduces the speed of the ship which is the best way to tank a frig you wont get a lot of armor hp out of it either since its  based so youre effectively reducing your tanki think itll do the excact oppposite increase diversity now you have the option to increase grid without sacrificing a lowslot and without dishing out 15mil for a grid rig this means that people will do it in order to maximize dps for bigger guns and people can fit abs with speed rigs thus making abs viable in pvpnot supported
its always been a nobrainerno one rigs t1 frigs and cruisers everyone rigs t1 bs and t2 cruisers and t2 bc the only ships where there was actually real choice as to whether to fit rigs or not were t2 frigates t1 bcthis is an improvement on the current system
first of all your an idiot who would rather talk than read the op secondly the issue is that the changes theyre making are not anywhere near the original intent of rigs rigs were about choice do i choose to fit these to my ship or do i choose to keep the price down it has so little to do with the actual buff any rig may give its about peoples decision to fit rigs in the first placetheyre removing the option and creating the mandate to fit rigs just like every other slot on the ship is basically manditory to fit ever wonder why people get laughed at for not fitting that last high slot or those 2 mid slots nobody cared if you had rigs or not because it was about choice id be all for the premise of this patch if price werent so drastically reduced but when i can fit a taranis with rigs for less cost than an ion blaster t2 then there is a huge problem it completely removes the edge people gained in the past by using rigs what next you going to argue for the drastic reduction in cost of implants because its not fair someone else can use them but not you are you going to ask for the drastic reduction in cost of titan skill books because someone else can train for it but not you are you going to argue that its unfair that someone else can tank 20x better with faction that cost a fortune so you should get that luxury too when you start making everyone the same the game gets dullever played paper rock scissors how dull would it be if you removed rock from the game
not supportedfirst off those module choices arent irrelevant certain setups may only be able to afford isk cpu power cap the setup if they leave that certain slots empty or suffice with not having max of one thing to get anotherwill people lol at those who dont fit rigs maybe or maybe they will realize that they only won the fight narrowly because of those rigs maybe it will drive the loser to purchase rigs people could laugh at a submeta 4 module setupwhat will be interesting is the rig fits some players may choose to further expand the ships specialty while others may decide to make the ship more well rounded these are the choices and variety that will be createdyou may have a price change on the large current rigs but as its components go up in price due to higher demand for higher turnover small  medium rigs the price for the large will stablize at what the market can holda 425mm railgun cost more than a 125mm railgun they have different material and time cost they also have a different turnover rate fewer pilots fly battleships than frigatesoverall your concern seems misplaced you are talking about keeping the status quo because it will keep rigs expensive and provide an edge to those with deep wallets the edge for deep wallets is in t2 equipment to include rigs and having substantial skills like appropriate rig skills to 5 that minimize any negatives you may suffer
thisnot supported
but not if they added tissue grovel and diamond to replace rock you talk about removing options in the sense of should i rig or not how about should i rig this or this or this or this ccp did mention a rebalance of underused rigs
hmmm to support or to not support ive very mixed feelings on this as it stands guess ill make my post and decide at the endfirstly id like to take issue with a couple of statements that have been made so far 1 yes some people do rig t1 cruisers and t1 frigs i happen to be one of them 2 no rigging ships is not a way to pvp through isk i may rig t1 frigs but i do so to save isk not extend my epeeni seem to have the impression that when rigging is discussed it is always assumed to be focussed around the cost for the top end rigs trimarks cccs smcs etc with these highly priced ones there are certainly good reasons not to fit them to frigates t1 or otherwise seriously how many extra armour points are you going to get from a trimark if you fit it to a frigate yuh no where near worth it at the current prices but what about other rigs lets take the rifter as my example and whack some projectile ambit extension rigs on it sure theyre still expensive and certainly ludicrously expensive when compared on cost per item as a percentage of hull cost but what does it give me well it gives me survivability andor increased dps depending on the circumstances with a pair of ambits and 200mm ac iis i can fire barrage at 10km at still hit for acceptable dps so for frig on frig encounters i am basically a hell of a lot more survivable and the 15m cost of the rigs pays itself back through keeping the same ship i proved this point to a corp mate in a brutix fit with blasters i was able to stay outside of his range and still break his tank after taking out his drones there is no way that would have happened if i was unrigged i could have still shot him from outside of his range but i wouldnt have had the dps to break himis that a case of winning through isk maybe but its not a massive amount of isk tbh  just an extra l4 for the rigsim really unhappy with the concept of salvage alchemy as well the markets have still to fully recover from the introduction of alchemy with the last expansion and i feel that this is going to lead to a large increase in salvage prices which will knock on to the cost of rigs however the supply of salvaged material is much more fluid than the supply of moon materials is so this should flatten out eventuallyoverall i think that different rig sizes with scaled levels of advantagedrawback would be the way to go without restricting hulls to certain rig sizes those that believe there is an acceptable benefit in the largestcostliest rigs can still pursue that path whereas those that dont want to risk their isk can play safe with the minor mods hell if the alchemy side of things kicks off in a sensible way we can even add t2 rigs into the mix outside of supercaps and pimped mission boatsi guess this means it gets a thumbs up
not supportedim disagree with your point that this will diversify pvp less in fact in your own wordsthat doesnt sound like there will be less diversity since youre basically admitting that ships with have exactly the same roles and functionality with and without rigs the only difference in the situation you mention is the performance of the ships not the diversityhowever having three extra slots that can now viably be used can introduce diversity by allowing ships to take on roles that were just not feasible without rigs remote repair augmentors for example can now feasibly be fitted to t1 cruisers asides from the oneiros making remote repairing on these ships a more viable than it is today many ships could fit falloffrange boosting rigs while they have trouble justifying testcs over other modules due to limited slots and module effectiveness dynamic fuel valves can push speed ships to permarun that couldnt do so previouslyi strongly disagree with your sentiment that giving people effectively more slots to fit a variety of performanceenhancing rigs to their ship is something going to reduce diversity in the absolute worstcase the slots are used to improve the ship in exactly the same role it has now so nothing has changed and in every other case more diverse fittings become feasibleso definitely thumbs down on this one
very nice we really need this
i like the idea of moving on towards implant manufacturing but i think there are a few problems along the wayfirst of all production the drugs which you suggest to be implemented are highly illegal in most empire regions and if they are produced the same way now as when they are now then this makes me wonder how they do it without making implants illegal the gasses are some uncommon its silly either they boost more gas clouds in highseclowsec or it should not be included in production corpse remains based on sp point might be a little too heavy for the server t2 implants should only be able to be produced by buying a bpc from the faction shop of said pirate faction to keep them highly priced production process remains same and they keep dropping from wrecks so you dont undercut 00 folkswhat i suggest is that implants are build up out of subassemblies just like t2 manufacturing to keep the price a bit higherper example a perception implant would exist out of bioelectronic neural link biomass read corpse high grade minerals new ram unit bioelectronical engineering processing unit build up out of mid grade minerals miniature electronic t1 salvage implant housing lowgrade mineralswith a system like this mine is just an example you get a more advanced line of production instead of the straight forward put everything togheter and watch it magicly transform to an implantskillsrather name biologic engineering into bioelectronic engineering to really point out the link of bio and electronic interfacing other than that the requirements seem good not too high not to lowin the end i support this idea but the implant production should not be as straight forward as t1 production or include any gasses or drugs
this is how it should be
i have to disagree with summoning up more gms yes it could be helpful and yes there is the rare chance that something that has been a noted bug made you lose x shipbut honestly does it really require a petition to replace a t1 or t2 ship if it get blowededed up in combat does it require a petition to report that x bug happened no i didnt read the confirmed bug list can i has ship simple answer no suck it up and just keep playing im still in personal favor that petitions should be a group effort and should cost a set isk fine that starts going up from the free single onelike you get your free petition but if that isnt answered or found a good one the next one you send in costs 10m isk and goes up x2 for every further petition that is filed if its found a reasonable bug or such then the gm should be able to clear it and youd again have 1 free petition
and yes bugs are my fault horrible me and yes although this wasnt what my petition was about it is worth petitioning about that if it shouldnt have happened it shouldnt have happenedan excellent system we should also make it that you have to pay isk as well as real money subscribe and isk to post on the forums

i dont know i kind of like the ideayes therell obviously be a small number of idiots wholl purposefully color their ships fluorescent to  people off there might even be a few people that do it to amuse themselves the color palettes if implemented should retain the basic gritty and militarianistic shades they already retain as for the tech ii problem i figure we could always keep a distinguishing color for them already implemented that cant be changed that wont be avaliable in their counterparts i especially like the idea of corporation  alliance logos if nothing else implement these for the pure novelty and shall we say inherent pride that comes with flying your flag i like it
wait where the hell is this ammoi want to shoot different types from each of my 7 guns
cool idea
i very much like the idea i think different designs on ships per individual taste fits perfectly into the capsuleers mercindividual mindset
heartily supportand to those decrying lag and server strain recall the part where hundreds of corporation logos are already being transmitted to your client by the server all the time and that the proposed information can be easily encoded in 16 bits per ship in a large fleet battle we are talk about one maybe two kb of data as the op says almost any other conceivable added gameplay feature would create more overhead than this if even this amount is unacceptable then trimming the proposal down to just the alliancecorp logos could be encoded in two bits per shipas per the client side lag just turn the feature off if you have problems many of us even with older hardware can run eve just fine with decent graphics setting 99 of the time
you got my vote its boring seeing everyone flying identical ships
i think minor customization is a good thing makes things more intresting

theres a lot of good web developers and administrators in the eve online community if ccp is having trouble finding a proper solution for their problem maybe they should share the constraints and technical details of the problem so we can help provide potential solutionspersonally i think that they should manage sessions in a database instead of cookies it would require a big database and a powerful server to run it considering the amount of readwrites this database would have to support but this would be the easiest solution in my opinionthis would also enable them to have a real unified logon type thing basically there would be a database table that would track user account settings by userid community site settings and session info when a user logs on for the first time a record is created for his userid a table would then be used to track session activity when the user logs on the last logon timestamp field would be updated then everytime the user does something such as refresh a page or post in a forum that timestamp gets updatedif the user then goes afk past the time limit lets say 1 hour then the next time the user refreshes a page the code checks that timestamp and logs the user out if his session is expired or refreshes the timer if its not there could even be a background agent running to clear expired sessions from the database every minute or sono more cookies except static cookies for some minor settings and load balancing wouldnt matter in this case since the same database would be queried or same cluster which everjust a thought it may be too complicated or too costly to do and maybe an actual web design architech could comment on this but it seems like a good idea to me

lets roleplay it for a second ehwould you buy a ship without proximity sensors and alarms in todays worldin a market where technology meets consumer demands id imagine ships would have all kinds of early warning systemsif we did have this kind of system for alerts of reds in local etc then it opens the way for having local removed while still retaining some sensors to alert you of nearby ships in a much more realistic way
yes but i believe the con of it helping afk miners and macro runners significantly outweighs the pro of it being reasonable roleplay
utter nonsense if youre playing the game you should see trouble coming before it gets there if youre macro mining or off doing dishes or vacuuming you deserve to get blowd up

way to go csmbtw it would also be nice to get a lil more thrill out of an alarm sound when attacked like the red alert computer voice in the movies whith the sound and all
altho an alarm would be kinda cool ill have to agree with oam down with macro minersbut ive got an idea maybe  only combat ships have computer warning alarms i wouldint mind this for the simple reason of making the game have a bit more of a real feeling to it local aside there could be some cool options like  warn if targeted or  enemy inbound if your in a command ship somthing that people could know by using scanners but give that o  feeling to it

i can see the drone bay hull upgrade as a rig working quite well but if the bandwidth was as a rig how would it be balanced applying the standard 10 cpu would be overpowered fielding more drones from a balance view point is like equipping more turrets or missile launchers this is why the bandwidth module would be a high slot and use a decent amount of cpu and power gridso how then would you balance that as a rig
i think it would bring alot of issues out of balance if it only will be able to be fitted on droneboats i would say supported else not

hello i had this interesting ideea earlier while watching tv i mostly just pvp but this would add more action to high sec and hopefully draw more people into the pvp part of the game and it would also please the role players i was thinking about having riots in high sec imagine this some amarr emperor or whoever makes a press conference which shows up in the news on the website and some people might be displeased with their ideeas and wanna form a riot against it a beacon lights up in certain systems or just one very reinforced node system which is connected with the news a team of random players form up for the riot warp to the beacon with banners flying and drums beating they find a structure where the emperor is hiding and start shooting it sleeperlike concord warps in to defend the structure 34 spawns spawns die structure dies emperor comes out in a capital ship and he dies too or not i didnt think about the rewards ill let someone else do thatpros   everyone can join the riot no matter of corp alliance race mission runners and other high sec dwellers can discover their pvp side and improve their abilities more people would start reading those storyline articles those afraid of being ganked in wormholes would experience sleeperlike combatcons   lagwhat do you think  did i smoke too much or is it a cool ideea 
an interesting idea id like to see roleplaying related events from ccp that actually involve something ingame perhaps related to fw somehow more diversity is always good and while this idea definitely needs refining its got potential 
edit spellingdrones were changed already do you remember when scooping them used to instantly fully recharge their shieldyeah you got the point why is that bad for drones but is good for shipswhen a ship docks it gets his shield instantly repaired it can then undock again completely healed and its free too while if you want to repair armor you must pay alotwhile at war or in 00 this can be used almost like an exploit get aggro dock when almost in armor then undock again in the meanwhile anything can happenso there are 3 options imo1 give drones back their instant shield repair2 give ships a free and instant armor repair when docked3 remove instant shield repair for docked ships
you really see an apples to apples comparison between a drone bay and a station dock drone bay  open door to an open space in your shipstation  repair facilities restaurants living quarters shops hell its a floating city even a rv park in todays world will give you an extension cord to plug in and a place to empty the latrine more than a drone bay i dont think its beyond reason that the station dock would have a place to plug in your shield recharger theyll probably even wipe the windows while they are at it
why they dont repair my armor then
oh no he did notwhen you dock up your ships is hooked on the stations power which immediately recharges your shield its made of energy and your capacitor this is the reason why they get recharged immediatelythe station doesnt repair armor because its a solid and you cant recharge it the only way you can fix it is by repairing it by replacing plates or using the nanobot technology on it at a super fast scale see armor repair modules so this takes a separate installation to do which takes money to operate if your going that deep down
you can say whatever you want nothing changetalking about game mechanics there is something wrong this is not real life nor anything real so stop say they plug the shiel recharger in and blablablaat the very least recharging the shields while docked should take some time and not instantly bump it at full maximum capacity wtf
and btw just to make it clear energy got a cost too so your point fail becouse instead of using that energy to recharge the shield it could be used to power the repairers for the armor its the very same thing
someone got burned by someone else playing station gamesits not an issueno support
just say no  to stupid ideas
yes because the size of a station power generation device is the same size as that of your capacitor if you want this you might as well go ask for passive armor regeneration
not an issue 1 for comparing docking at a station and letting a tiny combat robot into a tiny shipboard garageno support
not supported keep the diversity that makes eve great  if you think this makes shield tankers overpowered go train some shield skills and fly your own shield tanker as someone who cant even use t1 invulnerability fields i fully do not support this issue the system is fine as is 
for the curious
because we dont have enough annoying stupid names in outposts alliancecorpplayer names amiritealso this would be more troublelling than helpfull
not supported all the goonie systems would be called  city and such
jorr orestis posted this suggestion in the features and ideas discussion forum and i liked it so much that i thought it deserved to be considered by the csmcustom corporation certificatesa corp member with the proper role corporation certificate manager would be able to create corporation certificates that every corp member could then plan using the certification plannerthose certificates would automatically be public to the corp only cant make them privatea new corporation tool would be added certificates where you could create new ones and also list who has which this would not only allow corporations to make their own skill requirements but also to easily see who is certified at a glance for example a corporation could create a special pvp tackler certificate and when the time comes to select members for a special pvp operation list all the members who completed the certificate to know who can fill that roleto prevent abuse ie a corp making 100 certificates that are more or less the same as the ones currently present in the game there would have to be a limit to the maximum number of certificates a corporation can createanother feature id like to have when creating a corporation certificate is the ability to import known certificates as prerequirements for that certificate a perfect example of this would be the core competency certificate which regroups many other subcertificates in iti reallly think this idea has a lot of potential
medals arent good enough
what has this to do with medalsmedals are given when you do something good or reach a goal or something like thatcustom certificates could be nice to see who is capable to do whatnice idea
wuh medals have nothing to do with certificates so no medals are not good enough medals are extremely expensive too and they are given to members by the corp manually not automatically awarded when members meet certain requirementsmedals are awards or trophies certificates are like a diploma that certifies you have trained a defined list of skills at defined levelssure a corp can develop a tool to read every members api data and see if they meet certain skills and such but as far as i know nobody did this yet and you wouldnt be able to see it ingame using the default interface
honestly this sounds like a way to get around the cost of corp medals as cert have about the same use as medals that is to say none beyond bragging rights
if your corp gives out medals for having met certain skill requirements then they are wasting a lot of isk corp certificates wouldnt be a way around medals because medals were never meant to be used as a sort of certificate in the first place they are awards not diplomas and again there is no way other than by having a custom api tool that will list member skills to confirm that a member really has trained a certain skill at a certain level certificates would automatically be granted to members who fill their requirements which would be hard set in the game itself using a specific corporation tool and not be something written on paper on the ceos computer desklets say the corporation creates a certificate called elite tackler and uses the following for requirements interceptor v afterburners v high speed maneuvering v spaceship command v propulsion jamming v long distance jamming v signature analysis v energy emission systems vas soon as one of the corporation members is finished training all those skills at those levels a message would popup to inform the member he cam claim his new certificate once claimed the member would be listed in the corp certifications tab under elite tackler along with the date it was completedthen if the corp has to form a fleet and needs elite tacklers instead of having to ask for everyone who has list of all skills here the fleet commander can just go in that tab and see who has it at one glance
maybe include the number inside a colored circle or at least have more variety of colors
youre quite paranoid arent you that was completely unfounded
i would love to have the ingame eveonline map more like the official eve strategic maps i own that book so i rarely use the ingame map but if the ingame version was more like it i wouldthe biggest problem i see with the ingame map is that everything is always glowing glow is nice but the glows feather is sometimes so wide that you cant even tell where the center of the glow is or how large it exactly isone way to rectify this would be to have static plain circles fully filled no blur or glow with a number inside it like this guy acwdc78 suggested that would make it much clearer to viewbut regardless i think the map should be redone anyway the 3dness of the map is completely useless and serves no purpose at all for navigation who cares if a system is above or below another one we only care about how systems are connected together not how they are truly laid out in spacei think the whole map should be redone completely as a flat tactical map in the same format as the printed eve tactical maps with the exception that the tactical info would be dynamic instead of being static
well p thats not mining thats interesting p
this confused me i thought you were advocating removing concord protection from empire belts then you went on to say that concord would still maintain law in empire beltsin any case you dont seem to understand the realities of the situation the reason people dont mine much in lowsec is that its an economically moronic idea at best the rocks are only marginally better but then the miners have to split the take with the security pilots assuming they are still awake after all mining is mindnumbingly dull but watching miners mine is even moreso if you turn highsec into lowsec then miners will except for a handful of souls with more courage than profit sense simply stop mining in the secformerlyknownashigh too if this affected only hstandard highsec belts then the vast majority of minerals would come from miners mining in mission deadspaces or from recycled mission loot if it affected mission deadspaces then youd force massive numbers of mission fans out of the gameand youd still have no easy targetsif youd like to find more highsec pewpew why not advocate changing the mechanics to allow anyone with 00 or less sec status to be engaged freely in highsec its a more reasonable proposal why would concord protect lawbreakers anyway and would give you unlimited combat simply by undocking in highsec admitedly your opponents might have actual weaponry but there needs to be some compromise doesnt there
thank you very much everyonein response to becq i thought that for those corps that couldnt afford security contractors there would be some empire belts but not whole systems 23 asteroid belts out of 10 in a solar systemand the idea about not providing protection for outlaws sounds asbsolutely reasonable should be worked oni guess all im advocating for is nothing drastic a little more realism maybe alas judging from your response that undoubtedly comes from more experience its not something that can be pulled off without overwhelming the whole game mechanic it seemsthis solo wannabe pirate has to look elsewhere for other prospectsfly safeps ive been lucky enough as it is that most of the responses i got are from pvp fans not miners
because those you call pvp fans are gankersthe only way to keep a mining op safe and going is then to completely lock down a system every gate needs to be bubble camped assuming ammount of people you see in high sec and not in average 00 system those camps need then to shoot everyone coming through who isnt blue protecting the miners in the belts just wont work the ships are too fragile snipers can warp in kill some warp out and we allready have this in the game it is called 00 go there so basicly you want to change all of eve into 00 let me summarize what happens1 50 of the carebears quit 50 just move to an alliance in current 00 or one for the new 00 areas2 either you switch current empire to low true sec 00 with sov or everyone leaves it for current 00 with sov 3 result is that pirates wont be allowed to dock anywhere4 even if you can dock in an npc station only some things will be sold there and way overpriced since everyone is in alliancescorporations which also pvp to defend this 00 space everyone minedproduced will either be only for alliance usage or it will be traded directly with other alliances who have stuff you need for example they got noxcium supply you got zydrine allthough probably preferable the powerblocks will be come even larger and one powerblock will have access to all different kind of stuff needed and wars wont just go about moons anymore but also removing their ability to get certain minerals5 we dont get new playerssummarizedhalf carebears quit half adapteve will die due to lack of new playerspirates will become extinctyou seriously need to change your definition of nothing drastic

why not have permanent roids tat wont get their ore reduced significantly during the day probably ore prices would be coming crashing down but so would be all other prices then i think this would get rid of the problem of macro miners competing for roids w other players plus a miner would be able to mine to its heart content instead of wondering mindlessly in empty belts or logging off until next respawn time
bravo siri wasnt sure you were a troll until this not supported
okay i was telling someone else he was being paranoid about macro miners but now youre pushing it i think that guy was rightthe last 4 threads you posted are all things that would allow you to either macro mine or mine while being afkif you want to mine just be present in front of your computernow please stop posting those stupid suggestions
pretty much this tbhif you want to mine stuff that never vanishes mine ice
we already have lots of general drone skills this is not the type of love that drones need i would like to have a way to up my drones orbital speed but making it a skill is the wrong approach
ccps normal way of doing this would be to reduce the base speed by 20 and then introduce the skillis that what you want cos thats what youll get
i can see from most replies tat clearly u guyz r pvpers or mish runners im a miner increase drone speed means higher mining yield drones have to travel to deliver ores i would be ok getting some base speed reduced and at five getting more speed than currently and about outtracking im sur there is a way to fix tat or work around the issue
damn man youre so paranoid stop that witch hunt alreadyedit on second thought this guy just posted another thread now asking to have permanent rocks that never expire i think youre right hes kind of obvious now
very good idea support kaylan you should make a topic on this subject kaybut as far as the topic maker go get laid or mine some more leave the forms alone
eos desperately needs some love
i agree spent so much time perfecting my drone skills and now i am limited only to the ishtar buff the eos and the myrmidon such a cool name such a beautiful ship and equally useless 
there was a dev in taff last night just before the fighting really kicked off to check on lag so theyre definitely still looking at this
when an issue is repeatedly raised it is not a waste of the csms or ccps time its valuable feedback informing them that the change is not being rolled out as quickly as needed and should be a greater priorityof course if we could see more of what is being done with these issues such as updates on the testserver changes the occasional post to state that it is being worked on and devblogs that are about the development of the game which we get in my opinion too few of issues wouldnt be raised twice because wed be aware that while the problem may be complex it is being worked onthe eve community like to pester and so they should too often when we dont we find what we assumed was being worked on has been pushed back or dropped altogether nothing wrong with more communication from either side

i dont really care about walking in stations honestly there is so much more that should be worked on before such a completely random addition as station walking this is a game about flying spaceships in space
this please i would enjoy eve then as current pvp is pretty sucky let me shoot people in their face for fun
the thing is that they have to develop it they have to create enviroments for every station its like creating a whole nother game so it will take time my guess is it will be out summerwinter 2010
i hope it is never
wis was brought up during the allince tourney for those who listened in but from what i was told at the developer meet and geet in vegas was that siege warfare was the priority next on the list was addressing andor fixing the titan nurf but wis is still on the table we just have to be patient and wait and stop asking  are we there yet  
id just as soon play eve without wis that said theres some evidence to suggest that the wod mmorpg is planned for launched in 2010 and the two will share quite a lot of code do the math
i rather enjoy market pvp when invading someones space but im a  that likes to screw with peoples logistics so while this isnt a bad idea by a long stretch im not a fan also there are other more critical issues for ccp to worry aboutalso as noted above corp and alliance contracts work alright for this anyway there are tons of slots for them and really important stuff can be sold in this way without risk of outside tampering

yes i have delightfully discovered that task of saving up isk for various purposes is more fun and feels right with the multiple wallet divisions seen in the corp walletgiving each player 234 wallet divisions sounds like a very good idea

i support this topicim pretty new but its clear to me that this has been the most supported topic around since before i got here ccp i think most players realize this will take a lot of work and that other things will take a back burner while this gets done we still want it done yes i know that its not your job to simply do everything the players want a all on game mechanics and backend that we dont have to deal with or give two thoughts about however i think its clear that the support that has been given to this idea deserve at least a days worth of csm discussion after which you should devote a dev blog to explaining exactly why you are either a ignoring what seems to be an overwhelming majority of the player base at least the ones posting on the forums or b exactly how and when you intend on implementing thiscsms except the one who recently said he had words for ccp regarding poss we the players who elected you demand that you discuss this with ccp we realize you cannot force them to change anything in the game but you should be forcing this into discussion each and every chance you get to talk with them its clearly the most supported idea 60 pages between this thread and the op you didnt get elected to offer the excuses that ive read you got hired to represent the players this doesnt mean one 5 minute discussion this means keep telling ccp every time you meet with them hey the players still really want this they wont ing leave us alone about it we need to discuss this again then you can come back here and give us the notes on that meeting so we know your actually doing something to earn that trip to iceland you apparently getto the csm who said hed have words for ccp on this a page or two back guess well have to wait and find out if your actions match your words dont disappoint us or well never believe you again

i think you need to reevaluate your concept of omph for iskand take this into consideration also with the other rig changes beside sized rigsthumbs down
more people using rigs means more isk sink no matter how you cut itthis sounds like a whine from the same people who said t2 ships and mods should be artificially kept at a higher price so everyone dont fly it cause you want the advantage over scrubs
i fully support this thread im really quite confused as to why ccp did it this way  the natural solution was rigs that can be fitted to any ship with variable cost and effect  if all you need on your battleship is 5 cap recharge fit a cccsmall if they were doing the proposal i had seen somewhere of classspecific rigsie this rig can only be fit to exhumers then i could see why they were going to a fittingrestriction model but when its just done by ship size its silly and the dumbing down of t2 rigs is also the wrong move  those things are the officer mods of the rig world they are supposed to be scary expensive i dont want them any cheaper i do support the reexamination of subpar rigs and i hope they come up with some sort of implementation of all the proposals for moving rigged ships aroundespecially now that there are going to be so many more of them but i think that they made the wrong call on sized rigs
talking down to anyone who happens to disagree with you really hurts any credibility you might have otherwise had
not supported
the issue lies entirely with the categorization of shipscheap rigs for t1 frigs and t1 cruisers are ment to help newer players and do not affect the power scale too much yet drakes do not need 5x cheaper rigs or they become autoinclude ceptors do not need full rig job cheaper than single module or they become autoincludethe division should besmall t1 frigs t1 destroyersmedium t1 cruisers t2 frigates and destroyerslarge t1 bc t2 cruiserthis preserves the current ballancing as close as possible while giving new toys to new players lowering rig costs makes rigs still not automatic include but more plausible option the result is richer eve contrary to the rough draft ccp has now that spends dev time to take choices away
its not a rough draft 1 month from launch
i dont see the problem with this change and actually encourage itits not because rigs will be made more affordable and not just a luxury for the elite player that everybody will use them you gotta remember that rigs are skill intensive you pretty much need to train a different skill for each type of rig most players will probably start training them but not everybody will also i dont think rigs will all of a sudden become that affordable it will however increase the demand for salvaged materials greatlyi think rigs are great because they add a certain level of customization to ships that you cant have otherwise im welcoming this change with open arms
not supported i like the idea and would welcome the idea of being able to fit cheap rigs on cheap ships
not sure about the whole topic but i agree that the proposed material requirements for small and medium rigs are probably too low and are likely to make rigs into nobrainer options rather than at a probable cost of less than 1m each for a small polycarb or aux thruster who wouldnt rig every interceptor they ownedhowever the difference in salvage requirements arent set in stone and theres still time to tweak the numbers on the rigs and hopefully fix some of the currently broken ones
i agree with this but imo it is a good thing for them since now theres more variety personally i found rigs very sticky to deal withi think there will be alot more people happy with the patch and possibly the few that dont like change that will cry but get use to itprices change based on demand and stock while it is true the market which has already happened will go crazy for rig related stuff it also means theres more stuff to work with and a challenge after the patch
on t2 ships rigs are already mandatory for anyone that isnt ed possibly except for frigates so what this comes down to is basically adding a choice as to if you want to rig your t1 ship or not 23m may not be alot of money but on a t1 frigate which are usually only flown by newbies to whom 23m is alot of money or by old players that want a super cheap disposable ship they can loose any number of without caring adding 23m could quite possibly double the cost of loosing the shipsame applies to cruisers youre now talking roughly 12m for a set of trimarks when fitting a t1 cruiser thats quite a significant increase in price compared to what it would cost unrigged cruisers have roughly 1213 slots each on average average price for a t2 mod is about 1m some are lower some higher should balance out somewhere around there add in ship cost and youve again double the cost of loosing one what this patch will do is lower the price of t2 rigs to a possibly viable level while increasing the cost of the base materials since the use in t2 rigs will drive up the price that means that after the patch you get to choose in the isk vs efficency not only once for the rig slots but twice you have the cheap throwaway setup with no rigs the average setup not overpriced but still not at full capability with t1 rigs and the full price max performance setup with the now viable t2 rigs do you want to pay for more oomph if yes how much do you want to pay for how much oomphand finally even if im wrong somehow and rigs become mandatory on all ships youve still added more versatility each ship gets 3 more slots that they can use to fine tune their ship to whatever they want do you want to go all out with that thorax and bring its gank to the next level with dps rigs or maybe speed rigs to get in  range faster or perhaps youd like to fix its lack of buffer by fitting damage rigs and some tank in lows or by simply adding tank rigs at the same time as that is going on in the t1 tier its still mandatory to fit atleast t1 rigs in the t2t3 ship tier but you now get a real choice as to if you want to only fit t1 rigs or pay for the extra oomph and go with t2 insteadnot supported the patch as proposed is great and exactly whats needed
this is just like every other game i have ever played before the people who have played so long they like the way things are hate it when the noobs have access to similar stuff lets just play out a scenariolets say for pretend that there is only a 6 implant and no 1 or 2 etc of course it would be very expensive and only the most elite powerful or rich able to have it ccp now says they are going to release a 1  5 so now everyone can have at least a little boost to attributes of course this is awesome i would fully support that kind of patch now the new players can level up their skills lightly faster at a small cost and the old players are whining about it on the forums sound similarthis is just about the same a dumbed down item that noobs can now have boo hoo go cry to your fng mother d if it wasnt obvious i do not support this sillyness lol
there are some really good ideas here that i think would begin to address mining i especially like having the new asteroids give a wider mineral spread than they do now it might just make production a little easier both in empire and especially in 00hopefully a system like the one you propose will fix the current broken mechanics imo where in empire one of the most valuable asteroids to mine is the one that is supposed to be the least desirable making people want to seek out the better asteroids is a good thing since it will theoretically draw them out of empire and towards lowsec and 00i do feel a bit sorry for ccp on this one though a change to mining cannot be avoided but i doubt any other part of eve could have the potential ramifications as tinkering with mining could the benefit of the system proposed in this thread is that it should be easier to tweak on the fly than some of the other systems people have suggestedvic
if you add a minigame to find the good mineral spots in the roids something like finding the cosmic signatures in exploration just to a much much smaller scale then you have additionally an interesting and balanced systemso yeah
ill support any idea which makes people leave empire for a decent risk vs reward however i think that the difference between 10 to 05 shouldnt be that huge as its all protected by concord and any pirate attacking you in those systems will have a sure death but the difference between 05 and 04 should be quite big this to encourage mining in lowsec although my knowledge of mining ships is small i believe there isnt any mining ship which is can be fitted to get out when pirates come in the event that this idea is implemented such a ship should be implemented

yes but first fix the buggy killmails
indeed
now i know why all the replies to my petitions read with an indian accent
durka durp seems we have a hotshot genius in the house tonight first off when did i even mention that the bugs were the players fault i think i was talking about how players who dont read the bug list whine to get their ship back secondly i dont think you bothered to really read what i wrote about the petition spamming solution forums have their own moderation can be seen and answered to by all who have posting rights petitions are gmeyes only so the whine about zomg my can was flipped i shot at him then he blew me up or i lagged and couldnt shoot back can i has ship cant be properly madefun of by the populace instead a overworked gm has to take the time to say sorry little jimmy but thats perfectly legal in eve in as nice a way as possible or risk losing hisher jobso please take the time to read
if some players were not so selfish in petitioning every little grivoussp action in the game the gms may actually take the time to read our petitions i know a whole corporation16 failtards that after every loss they open a petition litterally every loss not to mention the ammount of vet idiots that do something stupid and think its the systems fault start crying over itpeople need to stop being so selfish over little problems and move on
quoted for truth
ironic i think i stated earlier that im not petitioning about lag im not petitioning about canflipping im not petitioning about any bugs  i dont actually have to tell you what im petitioning about its irrelevant to my proposal my proposal is actually asking the gms to do what you are not and are accusing me of not doingreading and then giving a response that actually has something to do with the petition would have stopped me in my tracks to begin withless ccp fanbois please bump
well if you dont bother to hint at what youre petitioning about then its quite idiotic of yourself to try and yell at people that they dont understand you if youre trying to bring up a point about gms not reading your petitions correctly and giving cut  paste answers perhaps its because theyve encountered that particular issue investigated it deemed whatever declaration as x and moved on eithera clear up the mysteries of whatever it is youre reportingorb stop complaining about it and move on
so is the csm going to bring this up again in a way that lets us players know wtf is going on with our dead horse
comfirming that i will vote no should this be brought up in the csmas cool as the idea is the sheer amount of work involved in realising this can not be justified by the relatively minor payoff yah poss will look slightly cooler woohoo

premise my sec status floats between 1 and 7while high sec suicide attacks with no expense are intended to bewhy shouldnt suicide ganking be like everything else in eve that is a tradeoff between good and bad sideswith the current trend you risk and lose zero because the insurance pays back the hull in full and the drops expecially miners more than cover for the t1 turrets lossfalse suicide gank an indy carrying 200m in modules with a destroyer and you lose like 10m and still earn 190m  2freigthers could be reverted to killable status again so that its still profitable to kill the 2b afk ferry boat with a loss of 1b on your parthave people have to think before they push the triggeri pay quite expensive starbase charters to the empire faction and regular fees to the owners of the stations hosting my corp offices soi can access the gallente and minmatar loyality points odd name its like they want to prize you somehow and i can even fly factional vesselsi feel more citizen in eve than in real life where i have yet to get a state limousine handed in for my own perusalcould you please point me the name of the insurance company paying for you to destroying your car every dayso you spend 2m to t1 fit a gallente cruiser and kill an hulk dropping 1619m tech i mining lasers more if tech 2 and possibly t2 mlus and t2 shields  gist shield repper 40m value a pieceits clearly a bad deal attack miners with usual drones out on aggressive for rats targetting the drones first  no sec hit use 10 sec pilots boarding a ship dropped nearby off an orca  sec hit does not matterno insurance should be removed off all the ships if anything because the suicide boats would almost all be covered and insured by the above statement id be fine with the idea of making a guy blinky for all the characters of my account so i could warp in my proper pvp ship and see who is the man
no ccp looked into this and buffed response time instead you can take away our insurance if you reset the response time changescost isnt really an issue with suicide gankings sec is considering the grind to recover it after a successful gankexample 1when i was out suicide ganking i would rarely go after anything with a cargo value of less than 200 mil assuming one has a 50 drop rate and assuming you are using a tier 2 battlecruiser what are they now 35 mil thats still a minimum 65mil profit if insurance is voided still worth doingexample 2pirate corp x is using destroyers to kill hulks mining in hisec it takes 45 dessies to be able to reliably kill 1 hulk total cost 45 mil well worth it to destroy some carebearsall that will happen if insurance is voided for concord actions is the alienation of carebears who accidently set off a smartbomb in a plex or turn their guns on a fleet memberthis hysterical whining about suicide gankers has got to stop carebears have had too many concessions over the years pay attention play smart and you wont get killed simple as
my father had an expression that went something like you made your bed now lie in itim not proposing that we allow people to play less intelligently lark if anything this will encourage more thought in the game since you wont be able to gank anything that happens across your path with a reasonable expectation of at least breaking even economicallyyoull have to actually pick your targets selectively and balance the costs versus the potential rewardsi thought that was sort of the point of eve
this is the only good idea in this thread fyi
id support this as long as my contract is applicable everywhere in eve including nullsec and wh space after all if im paying for protection i expect my body guard to be nearbythat really is a good idea thanks
i support this on the grounds that insurance companies arent going to pay you to destroy your own vehicle just because a mechanic is in a game doesnt mean it needs balanced if something changes sure if there is a glaring issue but basically you have people whining because theyre going to make one of the ways to have nonconsensual pvp involve a bit of thinking other than cheap fitting a ship
develdrin is spot on with this
hmmmmwhere do you start1 ganking in high sec is griefingperiod2 has a pvper i resent being tossed into this lot with these socalled pvpers  gankers 3 you should lose your insurance if you choose  this profession 4 high sec should be safe  we must assume that when ccp made the empires they were pretty sure that said leaders of these empires would not allow a bunch of clowns going around attacking the taxpayers  has any state or country would5 high sec was created to give breathing room to folks in game l low sec was for the wild wild west so take your profession to low sec where it is intendedto stop all this just make anybody who commits a crime  again ccp idea of a crime a target for all in high sec and any other toon they have on the accountif your yellow players can kill you concord leaves you alone if your red your dead and not allowed into high sec  even in a podthat would truly make it risk and reward tho i suspect the badss pvpers in high sec will go away and to some other game for it is they who are ruining eve with all this stuff not the carebears you so often whine about
no  do you realize how boring cp would get
i was under the impression that certain overzealous individuals had already more or less killed that area of the forum
fineas soon as l4s are moved to low sec i see that as a good compromise
full support insurance payouts for concord kills makes no sense whatsoevermake the suicide gankers work for a living for a change you whiners can still suicide gank but youll have to smartly pick your targets instead of just hitting every tom richard and harry who happens to be passing through a 05 system in an industrial or mining thereboo hoo you might have to work
now someone please wake up the csm and make them ask ccp about something that was promised as a specific fix long time ago
sure they can try realistic concord being about as effective as faction police when they turn up if they turn up if you have kept up on your payments
why on earth would concord protect you in 00 or losec they dont operate there
youre the one that suggested making them a pay for use service if i am paying them to show up when im in trouble theyd better bloody well show up regardless of where i am

ive been thinking of this for a long while the common sense factor of eve has always boggled my mind right now the tens of billions isk titans and motherships are generally unarmed in any special way theyre basically just bigger more expensive versions of the dreadnought and carrier with a doomsday firing the titan is basically locked down in that system for 10 or so minuets the motherships only real strengths in battle are triage and fighters both are immune to general electronic warfare but if a heavy interdictor get in it wont matter that you cant be slowed or your locks disrupted you cant escape until its gonewhat i wish to present to the floor is for a sort of pointdefense system that is automated for the super capitals and for the general ones as well i would seriously doubt that in a roleplayingreal life situation in this universe that the factions would not have designed their most powerful ships known to the game to be as weak as possible there are two possible ways that ill put forth to accomplish a viable point defense system for capitals the first is actual turrets already built into the ship with another ui menu via rightclick on the ship to control their firing parameters and targetacquisition guidelinesthe second possible way is a new capital modual mountable only on capitals via the normal power grid and cpu costs being astronomical on norm this modual would be activated to turn the guns on which would allow 624 or so auto cannonsblasterspulse lasers to open fire on objects targeted at you these guns would need to have a very fast and accurate tracking speed to be useful enough to destroy drones and missiles and have enough punch to scare off interceptors and other small craftboth of these choices would have the guns with unlimited ammo or with a special new type of ammo which would deplete the cargo bay of the ship they could have a range of 720 km to better defend the shipi believe that this would not only allow carriers and motherships to be more than glorified expensive logistics ships but also allow dreadnoughts and titans the chance to put up more of a fight than just sitting there taking the brunt of 100 drones etcnow a valid pointdefense is the smart bomb however the smart bombs damage your own fighters drones fleet members and even possibly yourself too theyre also only given one particular damage type and have a comparatively slow cycle time to refire the other biggest reason is that they have a maximum possible range of 5 km 6 for t2 for the larges all in all for the tldr folks super capitals should have a defensive system that allows the ship to fight off drones and missiles more effectively than what a smartbomb can bring in terms of refire rate range and damage outputfor the folks who also enjoy eye candy it could also be more than a little fun to watch as your capital ships defense systems throw bullets charges or lasers into the space around it to shoot down all sorts of little things
your point defense system is the support fleet for the super capitaltitans or motherships should never be alonenot support
this despite how titans are used in practice at times they should not be built to be capable of solo operation
yeah this is dumb no titan would ever die ever again if it could just fit multiple batteries of autocannons or pulse lasers and obliterate dictors and heavy dictors at willif you want your titan to be safer protect it with your support fleet
for a titan maybe not but for a carrier mothership hells yes they need a little boost somehow and i think this would be perfectthe second possible way is a new capital modual mountable only on capitals via the normal power grid and cpu costs being astronomical on norm this modual would be activated to turn the guns on which would allow 624 or so auto cannonsblasterspulse lasers to open fire on objects targeted at you these guns would need to have a very fast and accurate tracking speed to be useful enough to destroy drones and missiles and have enough punch to scare off interceptors and other small craft
moronicmaking titans even better suited to the role of solopwntoys is a bad idea a titan pilot flying without such a defense system called support fleet is an idiot who deserves to die twice
unless the support fleet is going to shoot down every single drone every single missilelaunching ship and every single hostile ship theres the need for a efficient way of defending oneself from the tiny buggers that a cloud of drones bring or the pain of citadel torpedoes from dreadnoughts this would be a pointdefense systemtitans arent meant to die theyre flagships of allianceswrong the defense system would be a small grade of the racial ships weapon type perhaps even the civilian version anything larger than a frigate isnt going to take worrisome damage from it and the bigger ships will have the range to stay outside of the defense systems rangeif anything just make this system for mothership and carriers then who are otherwise unarmed that would help with the issue and defenselessness that carrier and mothership pilots deal with ive seen a few major fleet fights where the primary damage on carrier killmails were drones if there wasnt a dreadnought there this idea will not grant either of the super capitals the ability to weather fleets aimed to take them down the current smartbombs arent even able to protect the ship enough let alone kill anything with em this idea is not aimed at allowing the capitals to become invincible but merely allow them to better defend against drones and missiles in the real out of game world during wwii all naval military vessels had some sort of mounted machine gun to discourage aircraft from attacking them carriers and battleships had a very refined system that had a good chance of knocking almost anything that attacked the ship downin almost all other scifi based universes the capital ships have an established pds to help defend the ships from smaller starfighter attack and in some cases even against missilesthe pointdefense system here is mainly a reasoning that if logic denotes that capital ships are more often than not armed with some sort of antifightermunition defense system that protects the ship in battle should be represented here as well
that is indeed exactly what theyre supposed to do your caps shoot the poshostile capsother huge stuff while your support fleet deal with small stuff caps and supercaps deployed alone or with insufficient support need to diesmartbombs are more then enough defense against drones juts scoop your own drones before activating or send them out of range

there is no reason whatsoever for this not to exist just fyi
supporting this
good idea i would even go further and show the clickable portrait of the player requesting the conversation much like how you see it when you view a player ships info
yknow how some people are just magnets for pirates and lowsec bombersthis wont help your chances
i support this its the most thoughtful and realistic solution to date
i honestly dont see why someone wouldnt like this idea i have done a lot of programming in the last 20yrs and i know that this rather simple and non hardware intensive idea would be a great implement for the game seeing as how corporate logos are already textured in the game it can easily be stamped on a ship so there is little problem at all in fact just take the same system eve uses to make logos for corps and use it to customize ships why this hasnt been done before i will never know and anyone that says nay to this is simply just being the devils advocate if you would rather keep your ship plain than so be it but for everyone else we would like to see this customization take place soonif it wasnt obvious before i completely endorse this idea
got my vote god knows im sick of looking at the same ship skins all the freaking time

the problem is in the addressbar aspthe worst scripting language ever to be created the only way to make an asp server work is to drastically destroy session in an attempt to regain a small percentage of system resources it cant be fixed effectively without switching to a real language and real server
the fact that you think that asp is a language is enough to call you out on not knowing what you are talking about
rofl well its a language by definition but its a scripting language that seems to be a web adapted version of vbscript which also sucks donkey dcksthing is i think ccp has a partnership with microsoft so they probably wouldnt change their system for an open source one such as php all their infrastructure is using microsoft products windows servers iis ms sql 2008 dbs and suchas i pointed out before one easy solution well easy depending from which perspective you look at it would be to manage sessions using a database instead of cookiesto me the only thing cookies are good for is to store static settings such as preferences and such not session information cookies can be copied hacked and are plain text even if the session key is encrypted but whatever for this reason alone they are bad in my opinion and shouldnt be used for anything related to securityunfortunately asp doesnt have any native way to manage sessions other than with cookies via a system called the session object php has a native session management system 
geek policeoh sorry its a jit compiler based scripting language oops i said it again dwow im an ahole but seriously you take the cake
asp is a scripting enginevbscript and jscript are languages which was used to interact with the asp enginetheres a large difference
asp is in fact a languageunfortunately unlike latin it isnt dead
rofl i laughed so hard on that one seriously though we dont care about the difference between an actual programming language and a scripting engine now please stop geeking around and get back on topic

sorry nope
nosorry theres use for having an alt accountmining  haulercyno alt for capitalstrade alt to see market details without travelingif someone is using 3 alts at the same time in a battle then i take my hat off to them for their multitasking abilities other than that theyre paying full subs for all of their alt accounts
noif someone wants to pay for multiple accounts they should be able to use all of them or as many as they can manage at one time
you failed to explain why any of those scenarios are bad theyre not howeverthat would be account sharing which is banned
lolwutthis should be goodworking as intended thats done by just about everyone in a player corp anywayand that is bad howthey are still just one person can you imagine how hard it would be to engage in pvp with three accounts at onceand why shouldnt they be able to get securitythe spam account would be useless very fast since people are quite quick with the block option with spammers making this a bannable offence wont stop it either just like isk sellers theyll come right backyes there are many more uses all equally within the eula and any other rulesets you can think of as applies to eve in fact all of the things you listed are completely within normal game mechanics610 convincing
i think youre being generous
i think not most trolls dont even bother to make it look like a real issue on first glance almost thought it was serious until i deconstructed it
so i guess then if there not bad this i guess should be a single player mmorpg because it obsoletes the need for coop gameplay

anyone whos spent a little time reading scifi will immediately recognize thisone day i decide i just absolutely need to run my dominix solo through curse i jump into doril from sendaya and guess what gate camp no problem says i i uncloak and immediately launch my 5 mimic drones they shoot off signatures on all spectrums that exactly mimic my actionsexcept for movement which is mimiced at a 45 degree angle offset on each droneif i lock a target they lock a target if i fire a gun they fire a gun obviously they do no damage this gives the people trying to lock me down 6 targets to go after allowing me valuable time to escapeof course to keep this balanced the drones are one shot dealsin more than one sense of the word the incredible amount of power required to create the exact signature of your ship means that they are rendered useless and are not recoverable also while locking them does no harm to them a single shot from a weapon immediately creates inconsistencies that allows your ships computer system to disregard the mimic and copies the information to anyone in your gang networka light drone could mimic frigate class ships a medium drone cruiserbc a heavy drone bs a fighter cap shipsadditionally the drone would be assignable this would allow a carrier or dedicated drone boat to create some severe havoc but would force them to use up valuable drone space in order to do sosupport  nosupportorimprove the idea
humm not sure what i think of that yet i like it but at the same time im worried about the consequence of such a type of drone basically you want a sort of holographic decoy drone that mimics your every move theres food for thoughts
youd need random trajectories i expect  if theyre predictable players will just memorize the patterns and shoot the right one every time on top of that i dont think your drone size to ship size conversion is the right approach  you just wind up with some frig pilot targeting them potshotting them and the drones being useless in practice i think that if you want them to be viable you need to give them hp and maybe duration or level of replicationeg do they bump as if they were real as the distinguishing characteristics drones will appear to take damage as if they were the real shipexcept in their owners drones window but when they hit their actual hp total they will die instead of mimicking actions directly id give them probably four activation options activate align and warpwhere each decoy picks a random celestial aligns and warps  subfighter decoys are destroyed upon warp activate and scatterwhere each decoy picks a random direction and heads there at its max speed activate and orbit targetpick a range all decoys attempt to orbit at that range activate and followall decoys will follow exactly the same navigational commands as the real ship except offset to form a linecloudthis will give decoy users a better list of tactical options while still being simple enough to use in a panic situation i think also be aware that this proposal will have serious effects on things like bumping and supercapital survivability consider a carrier assigning a dozen decoy fighters to a titan the titan pilot activates them and all of a sudden you have 13 nighuntackleable ships which need to have 15km sigs in order to not be obvious fakes can you imagine the pinball also given that fighters are fairly tough and titans are a lot tougher the level of firepower itd take to kill a single titan backed by a single carrier will go up dramatically and thats not considering the situation where a dozen carrier pilots put a hundred titans onto overview to save their fearless leader when he gets himself into a bad situation youd damn near fill the grid with avatars at times which cant be healthy you probably want to consider removing decoy fighters because of situations like this that said despite all the above stuff i do think this is a very cool idea and i do support it
nosupport sry gate camps are slow as is dont wana give carebears an easier time then they already have
all i read was mages in wow get mirror image not supported
station games suck i mean they really suck bumping a harrassing ship off of a station can be a complete nightmare that is intensely frustrating at the same time bumping cant be made so easy that it becomes impossible for a ship to find safety in a stationim proposing for consideration a new class of drones that would use repellers to effectively bump a ship in truth the bump would actually be a reverse thrust enacted on the ship by the repellers on the drones sort of like a reverse tractor beam this would keep drones from making reaching warp an impossibilityso i launch my 5 light repeller drones upon launch my tactical overview comes up and my mouse pointer becomes the end of an arrow drawn from the center of whatever my drones are orbiting currently my ship by manipulating the arrow in the direction i want the drones to repel an object and clicking i give the drones their angle of attack i then set them to engage the ship i want repelled and they go to work for ships that are moving this would have a sort of webifying effect however there would be angles involved that would cause the ship to deviate from its set course these angles would not move the engaged ships actual headingso a ship can still warpnot sure i explained that correctly if the chord from the nose to the tail of the ship is on the y axis the drones would have no effect that swings that chord off of that axis  im confusing myself the important point is that a ship would still be able to get to warp normally also unlike with webifiers enough drones would actually cause forward movement to be completely stopped and even reversed also incorrectly set drones would actually help the engaged ship move towards its desired goal could be useful for anyone whos ever waited for a battleship to get back to the gate after an engagement
not supported bumping is not an official offensive mechanic besides this kind of feature would allow for way too much exploiting
sounds cool but i cant imagine it being balanced well no support
on the fitting management screen it would be useful on your saved fittings for each ship to be able to right click the module and be able to view market details which would make it quicker to go down the list quickly buying each module necessary for the fitting good for those that loose lotsa ships
no objections and should be an easy implementation for a lot of functionsupported
i could support this it would make sharing fits more useful especially in a corporate environment
hell yeah i think i had seen this already before but it must have been in the features and suggestions forum anyway fully supported
you could also alter the derived faction gainslosses to compensate for that make it perfectly balanced overall total of gains equals total of losses for every action and you could even add ship kills to both standings gains and standings losses this way you could always return from any standings hole it will just take a very very long time and be potentially very very dangerous especially if you want to recover pirate faction negative standings
great idea fully support
i agree that the current curve is wrong and i agree that the new curve is better however i completely disagree when you say that the gain curve should be the same as the loss curve so that a 10 gain can counter a 10 loss completely this makes no sensestanding in eve is like reputation and should be treated as suchlets say someone has a very good reputation and is completely trusted by a corporation suddenly he makes a mistake of great consequences because he was trusted so much the first reactions will be that cant be he wouldnt do that or since we like you very much well give you another chance that means the loss of reputation would be minimalnow lets say someone has a good but low reputation with a corporation and is just starting to be trusted then he makes a huge mistake the corporation would probably say humm looks like we were wrong about this one hes not so trustworthy after all the loss in reputation would be bigger thenafter a certain point if that someone keeps on doing bad things the corporation doesnt like his reputation with them would just drop faster and fasterhowever lets say someone has a very bad reputation with a corporation and is not trusted at all because he did a lot of bad mistakes that ed them off then all of a sudden he wants to be nice and does one good thing for them the corporation will be happy but due to their lack of trust would probably say something like humm okay he did this for us but it could just be a trick lets see if he really means it this time the gain in reputation would be minimaland then if someone has a bad but not that bad reputation with a corporation decides to do something good for them the corporation would probably say well i cant say we like him that much yet but hes shown some good sides maybe we can give him a chance the gain in reputation would be slightly biggerreputation is easy to lose and not easy to gain and trust is gained over time through repetitive trustworthy actions its a known fact and it shouldnt be different in evetherefore i think the curves should be more like thisplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesthat means it would take much more time to recover from deep low standing but take much less time to lose it it would also mean that pirates choosing a life of crime by supporting evil npc corporations would have the corresponding reputation and not be just on the edge because they go up and down in standing all the time
if this was the suggestion i would be for it the current reputation grind is incredibly insane
many systems store data for which there would not be need so for example it when players after missioning dont pick up the loots and wrecks which use server capacity and make lag in system reason too little components falls from the wrecks already and loots nerfed to meta 1 crap 800 cap booster and smallbombs reprocess nerfed tooone big system where 30 players did missions and dont got the wrecks create approximately within 1 hours approximately 6000 wrecks in system and this is just one system think his intestine is needed in more hundred systems so unnecessary to store these wrecks the server store this data through 152 hoursmy ideawhen the players who got a mission the server could be store the mission spot grid  and a script would clear this areajust need a code to server which clear the grid from wrecks and new answers for agents when completed the missionlike this1 i completed your mission but i did there a little mess you may send over the cleaning units there2 i completed your mission share bounty for my fleet and you may send over the cleaning units there3 i completed your mission i want the bounty and i want to investigate personally those wrecks4 i completed your mission i want share the bounty and i want to investigate personally those wrecks
you know i actually think i have to support this i dont even mission that much or hang out around big hubs but with the addition of options from talking to your agent to keep the wrecks there or to eliminate them i just dont see why notthis also would be an awesome way to mess with ninja salvagers hehe just imagine their faces when the wrecks just vanish
signed
no way not supported theres already a 2 hours lifetime for wrecks and this is fine as it ispersonally i dont salvage with the same ship as i do missions with i have 2 thrashers one is fitted for combat and the other for salvaging 4x salvagers and 4x tractor beams i usually complete 34 missions before i switch to my salvager and go salvage all the wrecks i have bookmarked your suggestion means i would have to fit only 1 salvager and painfully salvage one wreck at a time as i go theres just no way its fine as it isand by the way wrecks in deadspace that you do not see do not create lag for you the only way objects will create lag is if the server has to send you their location because you can see them in space objects have to be within range for them to create lag for yousince nobody but you or maybe a small gang you fleeted with will be at mission locations the lag from floating mission wrecks is minimal
this
not to mention ccp always intended for salvage to be a mini profession  if you dont clean up your wrecks you can bet someone will probably scan them down and clean them up for youyoud essentially nerf an entire intended profession into nonexistence
what do you talk about  1all system checked 5 mins for wreck using a script thiswhich wreck reached the time will delete for systemi wrote in one system where use agent 30 player make 6000 wreck within one hour this is just one system if we reckon with 100 systems like this we will got 6000000 wreck within one hour 12000000 within two hour2 my suggestion was you  fit only 1 salvager and painfully salvage one wreck at a time as i go no if you dont select first or second opition at agent the wreck will still there manyou not lost anything but you can clear that area if you dont need wrecksand by the way all stored item in database eating source for server so you told stupid things and another thing the cleaning code on server always check each single wrecks of timer deleteable or not you believe it only that this cheque does not reserve a resource because of server
if i understand correctly by reading between the lines of bad english you say there would be an option when you complete a mission to either leave the wrecks there or tell the agent to send someone to clean them outi dont think this would be needed theres no benefit for the players in that change and the performance of the server wouldnt be improved in any wayyou would have a script to clear those wrecks on demand yes but there would still be a need for a background script running periodically to clear all wrecks that are older than 2 hours anyway so youre actually adding a new task on the server not removing oneand as for more records causing worse performance on the server well its debatable technically you would still have the same amount of records to delete in the end either its deleted by the periodic script that deletes wrecks older than 2 hours or its deleted by your new on demand script either way it would be the same number of delete queries in the end in fact right now the deletion of wrecks is done at a constant rate so the performance of the server is affected at a constant rate if on top of that job you add another one that players can call on demand then youre throwing that smooth constant rate out of balancei dont know how to explain it betterbottom line is more wrecks in deadspace  more lag for everyone get that out of your headstill not supported this suggestion is pointless
i dont care you support me or not if you you do not see the forest from the tree and tell different things because of the realityany who playing from old times can know much object in system produce more lag so dont speak stupid thing like this  deadspace wrecks  more lag for everyonemore objects  lagwhat do you think ccp why nerfed numbers of the drones because double objects use double server resourceswhat do you think why use ccp cleaning script  because too many object in system produce more lag with as much fewer objects can be found in the system it more playable and it less the lagwhy banned corps who made server collapses who destroyed a freighter whith some objects in deadspace  oh may be you you do not remember because your character maybe too young but old players remember and known game mechanics other thing what u said more 1 procedure to server this is not true because just half of players using this options clean their grid  the checker script half of resource will freedanother thing 152 hours not clearing all wrecks because the players produce them continuouslyalways still there over thousands wrecks
im not violently opposed to this but at the same time i dont see any good reason to support it wrecks already expire fairly quickly and the destruction of the scanandsalvage professionminor though it may be is not something i want to encourage unnecessary complication with poor gameplay effects no thanks
as a salvager by profession i would have to disagree with your proposal this is one of those things where i kind of agree with you and i kind of dont i think something must be done about the lag caused by wrecks but i dont believe i should have to slow down or stop my multi million isk job perhaps a system where the wrecks would use less memory or coding to decrease the load moreover the ccp team could invest more in hardware to help this problem out lag in general is the problem not just the wrecks mind you though wrecks can cause lag it causes far less lag than many other things in the game that could be changed in some wayanyways nice proposal and your heart is somewhat in the right place but i suggest you investigate a little more and come up with a proposal on how to confront lag by listing as much things as possible that can be altered to make lag less annoying
i am tempted to support your idea only to see kahega amielden crying and screaming in this thread but1 as it as already been stated wrecks create lag if you are on the same grid and only when loading the grid exactly as all the other static objectpeople being banned for spawning items at the gates were creating lag on that grid for easier killing and that is why they were banned they were not creating general lag drone number was reduced as they were increasing on grid lag what lag a system with 100 persons running missionsusing the market and so on is the database calls for new data not the static data like wrecks 2 it will damage the ninja salvagers while i dislike kahega whining and self aggrandizement of a scavenger activity it is a totally legitimate activity any ecosystem need scavengers3 it is not broke so dont fix it
you dont understand at all how it works there could be 300000 wrecks at a specific location in deadspace and if nobody else is around them to see them in the same grid there wont be any lag at all in the systemlag is created when the server has to update multiple clients with too much information if lets say 10 players warp to that spot where all the containers are then there would be a spike of lag because the server would have to send the location of 300000 containers 10 timesas long as nobody sees objects in space those objects will not interact with any player and therefore not create any lagtheres a big difference between server resources and network lag learn the differenceccp didnt have wrecks despawn after 2 hours just because it caused lag in fact most wrecks wont cause lag unless too many of them are in a popular area ie near stargates and asteroid belts they will however take more space in the database and that could addup overtime which is why they clean them periodicallystill wrong your logic makes no sense theres always going to be a process that clears wrecks older than 2 hours that process probably runs every few minutes if not less that means the load created by this delete request is constant every few minutes constant interval now youre adding another ondemand option to delete those wrecks instantly that means you would have the previous script still running every few minutes and overlapping it your new script that could be called anytime by players completing missions the server would pretty much be spammed by this command if you consider the number of players in the game only half like you say would be thousandsi really dont think it will happen for this very reason
because ships can self destruct in 2 structure ive had this happen to me with 2 gollems caught in 00
km is never a must its the experience you have that counts who cares what others thinkand if you try hard you can get the pod which would be proof enough
lot of the pirates dont even post their losses when someone selfdestructs does he get a loss mail if so then thats enough as he killed himself

lets make them all more interesting and tie them together with configurable dronesare the advanced drones really all that special they should and can befirst a high slot module drone reconfiguration controller or whateverthen advanced drones made from the stuff dropped in drone regionsthen plentiful stuff harvested from wormholes that is manufactured into swappable drone modules that are fairly bulky to ensure not too many are carrieda player fits the drc in a high slot pops 5 light advanced drones into his drone bay and 5 each combat modules ecm modules armor repair modules etc in his cargo hold the drones must be recalled to the bay to be reconfigured the modules are destroyed when removed in the bay but not if removed in a station fitting screen or corp hangar at a posthis creates more possibilities for drone users wormhole explorers and drone region dwellers its not unbalancing as the drone user loses modules when swapped in combat support  not supportorhelp improve the idea
so you want tech 3 drones that sounds crazy to me but i think it actually makes it into the category of so crazy it just might work it cant be done as a standalone thing but as part of a broader drone overhaul like weve been asking for for agesmaybe ill support it because this is one id like to see get to ccp see if they can come up with a cool way to do it
id love itmoar droanes
suuuuported
this sounds a lot like what i know of the old aurora system and jade constantine proposed a thread a while back to bring back a similarinspirit mechanic which has already been brought to ccps attention i like the idea but i think this thread is redundant

thumbs up those kind of improvised events are so exciting
doesnt really sound fun or good they should be more events and such but this doesnt really seem that great serpentis stealing ftw 
what he said
interesting idea but theres a lot more that needs to go into it example whats the benefit if i saw something like that id go grab a cloaky ceptor wait for whatever the boss was to die and ninjasnatch the crap outta the loot this then becomes a race to the wrecks more than anything maybe some kind of badging system maybe but then wed have to implement and badging system and yeah  bump thatrandom charley foxtrots would be pretty damn fun  particularly watching the scramble as people realize their log ships are two systems over and fawkfawkfawkfawkjumpyougiantpileofcrapwarpwarpwarpwarpnow would be entertaining
well this is just the base of the ideea id wanted you guys to elaborate more on that you could like have a fight for the loot at the end say 10 players go  do the npc stuff than they have to go against themselves for the loot have like 5 expensive new mods in the wreck each player that wins the pvp battle can only pick 1 you could have like 12 slots for saboteurs in the fleet and so on theres ways to improve this to make it really fun and rewardworthy i got a big exam in 2 days so i cant think about it more but i still thing it could turn into a great ideea
shield tanks pail to armor they need some kind of extra umpf not supported for all the reasons outlined above
because youre a tool posting with an alt so fresh the avatar pic does not show up
when drones go to low shield they can be instantly scooped and redeployedwhen a ship is at low shield it has to wait 60 s to deaggress then takes at least another 30 s waiting for session changes to be able to undock againthats the difference basically
how about just making it so the shield recharge rate while docked is like 500 the normal rate but doesnt completely recharge shields instantlyyou would need to see the level of your shields somewhere like in the fitting window so you can tell when its done but other than that it wouldnt require much development and i think it just makes sensethey could even make it so different station types have different recharge rates depending on size
yes its so much better nowsadly still bad and still not an issue please die in a burning pod 
you are an idiot and i wont even bother saying why because it has already been said so many time no support and you fail for being an idiot
look whos talking why is this stupid the fact is shields being recharged instantly when you dock at a station makes no sense make it recharge 5 or 10 times faster when docked but dont instantly recharge it like magic
seriously would it make a difference if you had to spend a whole 12min waiting for it to charge every time i dock i spend far more time there anyways there is no point and of course it should be instant anyways you are thinking about how it would be like in our time if we were in space we would have mastered and harvested energy that we could never imagine to think it wouldnt be almost instant is clearly showing a limitation on your imagination
this is silly
not supported some of the posters already make it obvious what systems will end up being named
5 or 6 years old molle dont mindhmmngngh said et as he swallowed40 virgins for nathan39s jewing everydayj lol buttes n dongsedongesnope nothing wrong at all
damn isaac every post i see you put up is always y never positive need to find a girl dont support many other issues ccp must fix first and station naming is good enough
the ccp approval is a must if that will be the case yes beats the dull alphanumeric codes which are just lazy on ccps part right
the only way i would support this is if we were submitting names to ccp to permanently change the nullsec system names to something easier to remember having each our own special name aliases for all nullsec would create such a load in the database that i dont see how this could be properly implemented
i do not support this proposal for a few reasons1 goonswarm2 goonswarm3 i hate looking around and seeing people name things that kind of ruing the overall gameplay for me i like to roleplay a bit but i get rather annoyed when i come across people with names that dont make sence or contain symbolsif this proposal was to go through it would have to have complete control over the naming system then i would probably be okay with it until then helz no
not supportedbut what about wormholes space adding sov them or whatever
that would be an awesome way to manage players would be cool if one could use a tool like find member in role in the corporate tools to see who has been issued these certificates
great idea
as long as the certs are optionaland can be dropped by the member if desired im all for it certs are bad because ccp made stupid cert requirements and because real corps already use api keys to do the same thing betterand i dont even know where these people are getting the idea that this is in any way related to medals i would expect that playermade certs would get rid of most of those problems and im sure that a lot of people will use them efficiently and well fully supported
the way i see it it would look just like the medals tab you would see a list of certificates and clicking on one would expand it to show the list of members who certified for it
useless idea not supporteduse medals or titles
reasonable things more important in the gameunnecessary
medals are expensive titles can be viewed by anyone whether incorp or not certs are a better way how is this not reasonable its not hugely important but it also shouldnt be hugely difficult i dont see any reason why this should be so far down on the list of priorities that it doesnt get supported
i dont see any good reason to support it dont need eve another unnecesarry thing when one do it sameif too expensive for you the medals go and make iskall carebear want to free stuffs work for it
youre a moron this forum is to suggest new features and make proposals for game evolution not just to fix current issueswell say this again medals are not meant to be used like certificatesif you had read the whole thread carefully you would see why we have given countless arguments to prove itnow please go troll somewhere else
troll  i think are you and you just insulting meanyway not supported stupid things
whoa there feller  methinks you oughta cool it on this potkettle syndrome youre comin down with before you start calling anyone a moron you should get your own case of dumbass cleared up first i hear they have a cream for thatwhy noti dont see proof anywhere this wuh medals have nothing to do with certificates so no medals are not good enough medals are extremely expensive too and they are given to members by the corp manually not automatically awarded when members meet certain requirements does not count as proof so much as conjecturehe brought up a legitimate point  what difference is this from medals that said  i like where this idea is going i can see how it would be useful for providing standards particularly in corps with new player focuses it would give them a tangible goal to achieve such as something like minimal retriever pilot or quick learner for learning skills i think if you took this idea to the next step and explained why it wasnt a workaround of the medal system and more of a metric to gauge member capabilities then i would support it perhaps adding a fee on to create the cert i dont see why this shouldnt be an option it seems like it would be a handy nonintrusive tool for ceos and corp members alike it would streamline skillplans quite handily
login 2  thanx sessionmedals are awardscertificates are capabilitiescompletely different things they just happened to be in the same patch get over itmany alliances and corps have external api based systems that do exactly thisall hes suggesting is that corps get this ability ingame so they can setout in a structural way the career paths their corp supports for the members it means they can point to the certs as prereq for corp rolestitlesjobspositionsdivisionsdont jump all over the guy its a 100 completely legit feature and area of needcompletely unrelated to medalsps evemail and fw first p
sorry but if too expensive for you the medals go and make isk all carebear want to free stuffs work for it sounded pretty moronic to me at the time and still does these are not constructive arguments they are attacks that were targeted at me so i respondedive explained this several times already but let me explain it againfirst of all medals were originally not meant to be used as certificates theres no mechanic in place in the game to set skill requirements for a medal its all defined in text by someone so yes you could use medals as certificates but then youd need to really trust your members when they tell you they finished a certain skill requirement because theres no way for a corp to know it except if someone in the corp develops some sort of tool that will list each members skills using their api key that means medals are not meant for thiswhat im asking is for an integrated system made just for this purpose where a certificate would have set skill requirements hard coded using the game interface and be automatically awarded to members who meet those requirementsif you think i want free stuff then just make the cert creation cost something however since its just paper in theory then it shouldnt cost anything to make as opposed to medals that use precious metals and suchyou might think medals used as certificates would be a clever thing to do but i really dont see how it would considering the costssee abovei thought it was clear enough in my original post why medals were not the solution but i guess not as far as the cost to make one i agree there could be one to make them in the first place create the cert but not to give them out since it would be automatically given
no support because youre confusing gcc and playercorporate flagging timers with local aggression timers though they seem similar they are different systems and triggercountdown for different reasons the local aggression timer aka pvp timer is what determines your ships status when you logoff or are disconnected from the game and this timer is always hidden even in highsec space
it would be very helpful and less confusing if some sort of scan log was added to the overview in such way that scanned entities which have reached a 100 signal detection were listed elliminating the clutter on the ppl and places bookmark area
well technically as long as you stay in the same system youre last discoveries will stay in the scanner window i dont see how this would really helpthe actual request should be to show bookmarks that are in the current system in the overview
thanks for your reply yes as long as you stay in the same system but ask explorers about how good this is when scanning multiple systems or wh cahins as soon as you leave the system the bookmark piles up and you get multiple 250k jumps away bookmarks in your places tab which are hard to filter for deletion in my case i rarely come to a system on which i will end up using the same scanning ship that eventually fits the purpose of the finding try a buzzard as sample not good for anything but the dedicated specialization of the modules fitted
i understand your problem but the overview is meant to show active objects only at the moment and only those which are within visible range except celestials and stations the overview needs a source showing bookmarks in the overview would be a solution as the overview could look at your bookmarks to get information however theres no tracking of things you have discovered in other systems only the current oneso the proper solution would either be to show bookmarks in the overview but that wouldnt solve your cluttered places tab issue or make the things you discover stick for as long as they exist even if they are in another system you would have to run a scan in a given system to see the things you had already discovered before
thanks for your replymaybe the overview is not the right place to put it maybe we need an uberview or sort in any case its a bit frustrating having to bookmark something that is already listed in the system scan window and finding that if you did not bookmark that site or did tried to clean the clutter in your places tab accidentally deleting something important you find out that after you come back with your specialized ship for the site or worse your team there happens to be no bookmark or any way to retrieve what youve already done
are we ever gonna get new ones think most missile users were hoping for a change in the last graphical update and what about missile bays actually showing on your ship and not just missiles magicly coming out your shipi think this needs to be adressed as the old school missile effects dont cut it anymore
oh thats been requested many many times already but i guess ccp doesnt listen or that they have some secret stuff in the works for it because nothing is done about itthe whole turret and missile effects need to be reworkedmissiles puffing out of nowhere around the ship makes no sense you see turret guns but not missile bays this sucksyou should be able to see the missile bays on a ship just like turrets and the smoke should be coming from the bays and not from the ships hulli would also love to see missile smoke trails optional for lower end systems and rocket barrages like the ones in robotech
you obviously dont fly capital ships do you
deal with it as it is no problem doesnt need changing
no i dont but it doesnt make any different even if i did i know capitals have maximum jump ranges in lightyears but you could still see those distances using a new filter on the map showing all systems within jump range in a different color for example either way the map as it is now is messy and not easy to use at all it may look nice and glowy but thats about it if it has to be in 3d then make it so you can hide everything you dont need to see and still change the stars into flat circles instead of glowy spheres of lightthe biggest problem with this map is that even when flattened you still see every distant star overlapping each other and that the glow makes some filters pretty much unusable because theres just too much feather effect
that is drasatic indeed i never realized and never wanted to have such dire consequences probably youre right considering the powerblocs modus operandi lame if you ask me but the things is a really big smile gets drawn on my face when i hear the older eve players talking about how the game used to be beforelots and lots of roaming gangs with ships that didnt usually get any bigger than a cruiser not assault ships and all the fun they used to haveso yes most probably my idea is nothing but trash material but im positive something can still be done to bring back those experiences or new ones that can refresh the game and im not talking about walking in stations because thats completely differentwe can still hope right
even if you thnk split weapons need fixingand i tend to the eris is not the ship to start with no support
it doesnt have to be just about spaceshipsanyway the problems involved in having combat in stations was talked about at the last fanfest spoon death etc check the videos it doesnt fit in neatly with eves player death system i guess you could have a holodeck style area for it although personally im not keen on arena areas in games as it lessens the penalty of player death unless you could bet on your holodeck games of course

well i just made a noob character and played with it on evemon a bit i trained this character to fly a vagabond decently full t2 with most things level 4 and i was able to achieve that with some 8m sp and about 5 monthsthen i have made him to fly a vagabond with max skills and i was able to easily put 30m sp just into flying the vagabond and maximizing it hac v med ac spec v support gunnery shields nav and all to vyou cannot say that the elite pilot will not have a considerable advantage over the normal one maybe 5075 better overall even if they have the same intellectual skillit is impossible to deny there is a strong degree of elitism in eve like someone said in 2013 new players will have so much to catch up to now the average requirement for a pvp corp is flying t2 hacsrecons sniperrr bs but in a few years the standard will be flying if not owning capital ships maybe in 2017 ppl need to be able to fly a titan to be considered into good alliancessomething must be done about that i have no idea what but it is a problem
heres my opinion to improve low sec make all space from 01 to 08 low sec only 09 and 10 will be true high sec space eve needs more danger you should be in a pvp environment everywhere you go
the last thing that needs to happen in eve is to make it more carebear friendly suicide ganking is fine how it is play smart dont fly what you cannot afford to lose
trolls who only want to abort any possible improvment or progress stfu plsyes very good idea it can be further improved by setting the prices of mods in relation to prices in a certain system for examply 10 above or below jita average price or 20 lower than rens price or something like that this will make it easier than setting price for each module

youre arguement makes about as much sense as a new player flying a battleship after 1 month sporting medium sized gear this game is about learning and stair stepping to bigger and better things its not about being handed a platter its about making your own damn foodccp has more and more catered to fast ways to equalized new players because apparently not power leveling in 10 days is a bad thing about this gameim tired of the dumbing down of game play to pander to the asshats who always whine about why they cant do something guess what its a game thats not ment to let you do everything in a day if you dont like it go find wow and pay some  to level you to 80 tomorrow god forbid in this game it might take you an extra day to run missions or rat to get the same rigs joe schmoe millionaire got faster because hes one of the lucky s with a t2 bpo i have like 0 income in this game my income comes from effort not from luck not from industry so why people think i am some rich asshat who just wants to keep the curve in his favor is beyond me i just want this game to have some uniqueness to it for a smidge longer until some of the new mmos come out then i could give a  what ccp does because capitalism will play people like me out of this product and on to something i deem better just like it has with so many vets who were there from long ago when this game required work eve was a harsh environment now its progressed into so much less god forbid some of us want it to retain its old qualities
yes because hacs costing 5 mil to rig instead of 40 is clearly a change intended to make life easier for newbies because newbies are the ones who keep a halfdozen ishtars on hand to replace losses oh wait
i do not support this patchit will decrease rigs from being high end modifications to common t1 crapwhy would anyone like to see their stuff majorly devalued i wonderalso the rig patch will remove a basis for income for small rig producers those who invested into expensive rigs get the kick in the buttthose who invested into rig manufacturing get a kick in the buttas usual ccp punishes any sort of long term planingthe only long term planning ccp will never touch is investment in t2 bposi guess lucky if ya got a good lobby at ccp editin the very least existing rig blueprints should turn into small medium and large blueprints and not just the large one  since they currently cover the complete range  that should not changebut i doubt that will happen would probably be too much effort and why bother
sadly i dont support the new rigswhy because the current rig system is perfectly fine but needs some balances the idea is that rigs are on option and that the risk of losing them should prevent them from bieng standard on every ship like factiondeadspaceofficer mods much as t2 ships were once rare and extremely expensive they now are essentially required to compete in the current pvp world because they have been made so widely available this is what would happen to rigs the same standard fits over and over using the same rigs with essentially no loss because of t1 insurancereally only balancing is needed such changes like useless rigs having their bonuses reassigned to more practical ones rigs that cost 2025 mil have their manufacturing costs lowered trimarks and cargo opts come to mind hole filling resist rigs such as em shield hardening rigs costing more than 4 milexample why pay 20 mil for a buzzard when you could fit your scanners and rigs on a heron for 300k because the buzzard protects the 35 mil in rigs you have on it with a cloak the heron has no cloak and is easy to find and kill
no because the buzzard can move around without telling hostiles that its there and assuming you have cov ops skill at more then level 2 a rigged buzzard has higher strength then a rigged heron
not supportedccp are doing the right thing here to increase diversity  op please consider the following statement the number of fitting combinations rises exponentially with the number of slots so it is a basic mathematical fact that increasing the number of used slots increases diversityyour logic seems to have mashed ship diversity and isk vs reward into the same paragraph because youve got stuck on the original concept rather than seeing that we are moving forward from there there are many ways to pay for the extra ump in the game already and by denying rigs to t1 frigates and more casual players you are harming the diversity of the game
besides that rigs have drawbacks combined with the drawbacks of some modules it would make the ships way more diverse an armor tanker will be slow as hell a speed tanker will have the ehp of a wet paper bag etcwhat i dont get in the whole rig story is why t1 ships get 3 rigs t2 get 2 rigs and t3 get 3 rigs how about t1 with 1 rig t2 with 2 rigs and t3 with 3 rigs it would make the difference bigger and that would cause more people to go out roaming in an expensive pwnboat instead of their cheap throwaway ship
because thats what the people are screaming forremember 3 years ago when you had to work for thingstoday people dont want to work for thingscan you saywow i do agree with most of op points tho
g
actually i would like thowaway ships to stay valuable as thats about the only way new pilots get in pvpdo small rigs make sence yesdoes it make sence that they are cheaper yesdoes it increase diversity yesdoes it add more content yesdoes it make game more interesting yesdoes it make life easier for me yeswill small rigs alow me to rig my destroyer and make it a badass ship and go shoot crap and get it blown up and have fun yesis this topick trying to take away all of the above from me yeswhat are the benefits of the stuff author offers what is the alternative is the tpick pure whine and trling conclusion no supportuse your brain peoples i feel that currently ai is often smarter then some people when i read topicks like this
its not ccp introducing smaller rigs that will cause more people to adopt cookiecutter setups its those setups working people already fit and fly ships with cookiecutter setups today because someone else did the math for them and it turned out some combination of modules did better in the majority of situations than another one it is inevitable that someone somewhere will do that math as it is that people will pick up on it and copy successful fits its just simpler to do this today than it was three years ago because of eft battleclinic etci agree that smaller rigs should provide a slightly smaller bonus though it makes sense in fact i hope ccp will review rigs in general and make sure that small rigs for instance have bonuses which are meaningful for frigates to have but suggesting that adding other rig sizes dumbs down eve pvp is ridiculous what is does is give small ship pilots more options
this deserves clarification so bear with meloggofski should always function as it does currently mechanically as people do from time to time genuinely lose connectionshowever the practice of continually hammering ctrlq to avoid threats in successive instances one after antoher needs to be nipped in the budthe exact number of times before message display and lockout as discussed below can be tweakedi beleive these measures will prevent the amazing dissapearances of freighters battleships jfs and orca that abound in new eden when they are under attackif someones connection really is so bad that they repeatedly lose it a score of times in a row in short succession then it really is too dangerous for them to be playing eve as far as the risk of losing ship due to no fault of thier ownif they are a ctrl qing scumbag trying to save a freighter by exploiting game mechanics then they will be limited as to the number of times they can ctrl q in a row before they are stuck out of game for 15 minutes while thier ship is popped if it has a agression timer i proposeif you lose connection or ctrlq events occurr as they do currentlyif they log back in entering the game on the same character and then ctrl  q again within the next two minutes of that logon the account gets flagged by the server as one potentially suffering connection issuesif the player then logs back in and enters the game on the same character that they did previously and then logs off or ctrl  qs within two minutes of logging on then the following happens if they attempt to logon and enter the game on that character within 15 minutes of the last ctrl  q they are presented with the messagedear pod pilot we believe you may be having issues with your neural uplink and you are having trouble maintaining a connection for your safety you will be unble to enter the game on x character for the next 15 minutes while we perform essential maintenance and diagnostics we suggest invetigate the eventuality that your connection may be damaged or inoperable in this time or make a nice cup of teaedit it doesnt have to be this message if you are more coffee person thats fine
because supporting a topic with your own alts is the done thing at the moment it seems
while i am not sure that i support this exact method of doing so i do cast general support at some kind of attempt to fix logoffskisalso since i normally try and dock immediately if my connection gets this unstable i would at least add that ctrlq in a station doesnt count towards the totalat any rate logoffski is something that definately needs to be looked at  whether it can be fixed is another mattersupport for an investigation of fixes
i found this link that officially explains the current logout mechanics logging out of the gameill quote it tooso that being said the current timer for pvp aggressed players loging off is 15 minutes before they vanish and they wont be able to warp out if they are warp scrambled their shippod can be probed down and killed while that time is still ticking so what is the problem here
its a touchy issue given ccp cant really know if someone is genuinely losing connection or exploiting emergency warp and given stopping people from logging out is farcicalthe proposal is aimed at stamping on those that routinely use ctrl  q as a get out of free jail card such as logging a freighter off 6 times in a row to avoid tacklers and any possibility of being probed outif you log back in the moment you log out it is impossible for someone to probe you out and then warp tackler to you catch you before you ewarp againunder the above proposal this no longer works as once you trip the limit your ship probably under an aggression timer at this point will be hanging around in space for 15 minutes with you being able to log inwith careful assessment by ccp of the threshold that you have to break and associated times the likelihood of this proposal making life difficult for legitimate players is so infinitesimally small it need not be considered
when you ctrl q your ship tries to perform an emergency warpif you are pointed your ship cannot ewarp if you arent pointed you ewarp 1 au awayshortly before you ewarp you are invulnerable to damage and points so your agressors have even less time to kill you than you might expectnow the important partif you had an agression timer before you pressed ctrl q your ship will dissapear from space in 15 minutes it ceases to exist in spaceif you didnt have an agression timer before you ctrl qd after landing from the ewarp your ship dissapears in approx 15 secondsif you were pointed after ctrl q and couldnt ewarp your ship still dissapears from space after 1530 seconds latency issuesthe current exploitative issue ispeople ctrl qing then immediately logging back in and ctrl qing again this second time they will have landed in a safespot due to an ewarp or if they are fast enough will still be in the original emergency warpnow bear with me still not donepeople repeatedly ctrl qyou cant catch a ship that never leaves warpif the abuser is a little slower you have a window of mere seconds to probe him out and warp a tackler to him you must point him before he ewarps againworsethere is a related exploitative aspect to thiswhen you ctrl q in mid warp when you log back in and ctrl q your destination where you will warp to on logging back in the next time you log back in is reset to be the location you were at the last time you ctrl qdsorry if thats a little muddled
according to this kb
youre not wrong but theres no way anyone could get aggro timer if he logs out after his aggro timer was reset by jumping into next system etclogoffski should be fixed this game shouldnt be up to playing around with out of character timers
could be dont know if that has been recently revised or if that is old though ccp documentation isnt the best the fact is what actually happens in space bears only passing resemblance to those times detailed in your link for the userswarping from planet to planet will get you caught warping from safespot to safespot you can still be caughtabusing ctrl q allows you to be invulnerable do you understand the issueyou cant jump through a stargate in a freighter and expect to warp to a planet or indeed a safe normally if the gate has a tackler on the othersidectrl q allows you to avoid this initial tackle or to escape it with no recourse from the attacker and then infalliably avoid being tackled again provided you keep ctrl qingperhaps you would like to dig up an interesting account by noir pilots posted a while back that details a freight that did exactly this using ctrl q 6 times in a row to escape them in a system if memory serves even a double sensor boosted covops couldnt probe out and lock the freighter before he ewarped this is post probe changes so in theory probing out a target you know is nearby with probes out should be easy especially with a freighter
as far as i know your aggro timer is reset as in it restarts every time you come in contact with a gate ie jump or with concord for pvp aggro timers only so jumping through a gate after getting pvp aggro wont allow you to instantly vanish when you logout youll still have to wait 15 minutes
kaylani think the real issue is thisif i genuinely disconnect when i reconnect my ship will warp back to the spot i left from if my attackers are still there well and good the fun resumes if not all the better for methe problem comes in if i ctrlq i ewarp away then i log in and while my ship is warping back to my attackers i ctrlq again that second ctrlq moves my ewarp start point on the system to that random spot in space where the original ewarp would have endedconsider thisfight is at point a i ctrlq and the system immediately tries to ewarp me to point b when i return to the game my ship naturally tries to return to point a however if i immediately ctrlq again the system marks point b as my start point and warps me off to point c when i log back in i get auto warped to point b with very little chance that my attacker will be there forget the agression timer  most logoffskis will refuse to fire or even lock their attackers so as to minimize their time spent in spacedoing that repeatedly simply compounds the movement of my ship essentially these players are taking advantage of the servers current inability to distingish between a ctrlq and a dropped connection not because it cant do so but because ccp has not told it to should care to the server they look exactly the same and are handled in exactly the same waylogoffski is a tactic that simply takes advantage of the way the game handles you suddenly not being there anymore
ahhhhh ok that makes sense then its basically making safe spots on the go i was under the impression that when you log back on you would finish coming out of warp before ctrlq would ewarp you somewhere else again that is indeed fubar then and should be fixedsupportedwhat should happen is this1 you come out of a jump into a known gate camp2 you press ctrlq but while you align a tackler scrambles you and destroys your ship then your pod3 you log back on in station with a rookie shipor1 you come out of a jump into a known gate camp2 you press ctrlq and manage to warp away before anyone can tackle you3 you log back on and hit ctrlq while youre still in warp4 your ship still comes out of warp unattended at the same spot you were at before the first ctrlq the gate5 the tackler wakes up this time and scrambles you before the new ewarp from the second ctrlq can activate destroys your ship then your pod6 you log back on in station with a rookie shipis that pretty much what you were asking for
intentional logoffski is to me cheatingif you got your ship into a scrap then you may lose it the game must have winners and losers and we should all be on both sides of that coin from time to time indeed without that the game would be pointlessfully supported  this is a rational and reasonable balanced approach to both real connection issues and logoffski
assuming your last post doesnt exist for a moment warping from safespot to safespot leaves you lockable for longer than continually controll qing does very few people have enough safespots to not have to cycle them fewer still have 5 safespots in every system along thier travel route and have a ship that aligns to warp fast enough that it can avoid a waiting tackler in one of thier safespots of course ctrl q makes that tackler impotent you see you cant jump through a gate into a 00 gatecamp then simply warp off you can ctrl q with no aggro if you survive long enough for your ship to warp off of dissapear from space when you log back in you can controll q again and instead of landing back at the camp you will be able to log back in at a point where there are no hostiles and then do this again and again and again until they get bored of trying to catch a target that is either always in warp or invulnerable your targets is invulnerable as he has logged off and ewarping
i edited my last post quite a bit while you were probably posting this so read it again and let me know if i understood correctly
no what i suggested was having someone unable to log in on that character after they have ctrl qd repeatedly in a short timeframewhat you suggest would acheive the same thing more or less but with the exception that someone would possibly have to spend hours before they could log back in assuming they are waiting for the camp to leaveif this proposal doesnt get any csm coverage maybe you should raise what you suggested here sometime as a separate proposal it would solve the issue i think albeit in another way
i think my suggestion would probably be easier to implement than yours though simply because all they have to do is queue the second ewarp after the first one completes instead of interrupting it midwarp to warp again
i know most people dont use the mac client but heres how it worksappleq ctrlq basically forces you to click ok on a dialog box saying youre quitting and its dangerous also in windowed mode clicking the close button is disabled so you have to tell the client  ccp that you are quittingputting things like this in the windows client wouldnt stop the issue because resourceful players would still find a way but it would stop a lot of the logofskies which i think are panic driven
with experience from other games which detect the difference between quitting and disconnects it doesnt help anything it doesnt take a degree in rocket science to pull your network cableclick on your wireless button while i fully agree logoffskis are a problem i cant possibly support this topic the only real difference this would make is screwing over the people who got some connection issues for a while it doesnt help anything against logoffski the people doing a logoffski wont be able to login for 15 minutes but their freighter is still perfectly safe it would only help against freighters with agro timer but serious if you manage to get it agro timer how on earth did you manage to not have a point on it for the time it takes to alligncorrect me if i am wrong but for 99 the logoffski issue is ctrlqing right after you jump through a gate two possible solutions i seegive people who jump through a gate a 15 minutes agro timer which goes to the normal 15 minutes when being fired upon so when you logout you got 1 minute gate cloak and if someone shoots you the next 30 seconds you get a 15 minutes agro timer and they got plenty of time to kill youalternative is stop resetting agro timer when jumping through a gate imo the better solution with as downside that they are still pretty much invulnerable when jumping from high sec to 00low sec without wardec going on you got to suicide a frig on them to get the agro and hope he jumps before he notices
dont really think that is the solution but a solution does need to be foundjust switching the aggression mechanism so that aggression to the ship even if no logged in gives a 15min timer seems like the best solution to me if you dc on a gate in a situation where youre not in danger then youll just ewarp and disappear a usual if you dc in the middle of a gate camp youll get pointed and die just as you would if you didnt log offthe current system is just far too leniant
im not sure if i should post this here or if i should report it as a bugcurrently cloaking devices shut off when they get within 2km from most objects this includes stations ships asteroids and invisible asteroid belt beacons aka the centerim not sure if this is intended as i can see an asteroid i can see a station but i cant see the center of a belt unless im 150km away from itthe problem is that its now not possible for a covop ship to warp to a belts center at 0m without being decloaked not a big deal in reality i just warp to the belt  10km which gives me a 10 chance to be decloaked by the asteroids as i exit my warp which is a way smaller chance then when i warp to 0m anyway even while i adapted to this it is just not right
decloak range is now 2500mthe ability of a centre of an asteroid belt to decloak things really should be removedin the past i have warped to the center seen there are no asteroids within 10km and still been decloaked by what is essentially an arbitrary point in space on a ships nav computerif this beacon is actually a physical object warning of asteroids in space odd given ships arent damaged warping through an asteroid belt and exit war at 0 speed then i can understand it decloakinghowever why were beacons for sleeper sites and for epheremal objects in certain sleeper sites and some known space sites altered so they didnt decloak covops from the previous position they were if this were the casesupportedthat is stop centres of asteroid belts from decloaking ships
supported  if the center of an asteroid belt is not a physical object but merely an arbitrary nav point in space it should not decloak a ship anymore than warpting to 0 on a safe spot doesif it is a physical object perhaps they should put one of those beacon lights there
supported this is stupid hidden objects or markers shouldnt decloak youwhere have you seen this exactly did i miss this from one of the recent patch notes
i actually thought decloak was 3000 the idea being you cant can flip someone while cloaked
you cant open cans and wrecks while cloaked so this wouldnt matter
i just tested it ingame and you do not get decloaked at 2500m its still 2000m
i was unaware of that thanks for the information
you sure i could swear i saw it in fairly recent patchnotes when they gave bombers the covops cloakgoes insane
i just fitted a cloak cloaked and slowly flew towards an object watching the distance indicator on the target box and i was uncloaked at 2000m not 2500m
i saw the same thing in the patch notesit sometimes does decloak you at 2500not always though in any case supported isaac
i went back 6 patch notes and couldnt find it anywhere using ctrlf in firefox to search for the text cloak can you find it and link it here then
the funny thing about the belts center is that as soon as you hit it your cloak disables while on the center you can reactivate cloak it used to give the message you cant activate your cloak because youre less than 2000m away from asteroid belt blahblah however it doesnt give you that message anymore and your cloak goes active just to deactivate again in a few seconds so it looks to me like they tried to fix it already but they missed seeing something in the code
aggression timers are still having problems here and there expiring when they shouldnt be etc etc the one major hole that i recently came accross is an feature so called by the gms and aparently the devs used by griefers what happens is this vvictim g griefer g loots a wreck belonging to v v retaliates and destroys gs ship and then docks g goes and fetches his pvp ship and systematically destroys wrecks belonging to v v waits out his aggression timer and undocks returning to business as usualg arrives not showing as aggressed to v but is still allowed to attack vits somewhat complex but if you can picture it happening the wreck shooting aggression extension is clearly backwards as the aggressor is shooting the victims property it should be reaggroing him not the victimbefore the carebear  starts getting thrown yes this happened to me yes it was a mission ransomgank but i am far from a carebeardiscuss maybe we can finally get something accomplished with the devs
that is just wacky
sounds similar to the shoot drones to keep the timer running so you can probe them out after logoutbug
definitely supported this always bugged me
although ive never personally had a problem with responses ive heard some pretty saddening firsthand stories personally the one bug i reported was responded to and corrected in only 8 hours i cant remember the guys name but hatsoff to him but anyway i support because i believe the first answer from a gm should not be copypasted nor should more than 50 of the convoas a side note hows defy doing vyanr last i knew they had it pretty rough also give de my reguards
for you vyanr please read this is quoted from my opening postfor further clarification ill retype some of what has already been discussed in the thread i am making this proposalwhinge because many of the responses ive gotten from gms in the past have been inadequate mainly due to it being in my opinion and many others a cut and past response that has been triggered by the looks of it by a keyword being used somewhere in the petitionthe response ive recieved to the last few of my petitions has had nothing to do with the actual issue ive petitioned about it would appear theyve seen a keyword assumed its about issue a and used response a to just shut me upthis last issue was significant enough to me that i got jack of that and have had it escalated if the the senior gm tells me im full of it after giving a good explanation ill leave it be if im right and i get my way even better but for either to happen he will have had to have read the petitionthis is the core of my proposalwhinge read first think about your response and then reply dont palm me off
make your petitions consise short meaningfull i never had any problems with my petitions and yes i did not have too many of them i agree with the two opinions i quoted people that make stupid petitions are to blame in developers giving bad anwers because when you have to answer 100 petitions and more then half of them are tarded i would also rive copypaste ansers
even if some wow mod was nice most of them was a way to give you metagame ability orand an avantage again people who dont use them im again thateven worse you can actualy make alot of change to ui its just badly or not explain ingame here some exemple overload  you can create a shortcut in the shortcut section remove picture and picture column in the chat window  look in the say window on the right upper corner  color you find it in the general settings you have to remove easy theme selection font sizewide  general setting section or for chat window upper right corner  in general settings to make it easier to move around windows  only stack windows if shift pressed lock windows when pinned window snap distance dont snap that stop the move around when i log problem too you can minimize windows when you dont use it usefull when you have multiple chat windows move the little picture when you lock something  a little cross called targets origin close to the left or right upper corner its hard to find because of it transparency move it around and you can move the say picture right click on the clock in the bottom left corner  toggle auto hide onoff toggle zooms onoff configure accesoriesservice and world information the overview you can change alot of thing here dont forget when you clean your cache that remove most of the setting tooi really love the eve ui probably because i play alot of gestion game ui like that is common in thesea complicate game with alot of option will alway have a complicate ui and alot of windows
why would ccp even let someone mess with there gamejust start a petition asking for the  mods you wish to seeyou are talking about real money that can be lost on somthing like thisanother suggestion would be buy ccp then they would have no risk
signed for the idea in 8 and below onlyive been considering training a widow or sin for ages i might actually get around to it for once d
damn forum ate my actual replycheck again you are insured by concord they are the ones that shell out 100 million isk to you after they blow up your ship why they give you money no one knows because ccp hasnt gotten around to changing it i supposeall this talk about carebears are dumdum headz that need to adapt and try harder is bull thanks to massive insurance payouts every ship in the game is able to be ganked into the ground before concord kills the ganker regardless of any protection they might have you arent just ganking untanked retrievers youre hitting tanked hulks top of the line industrials and freighters as soon as you die youre fully reimbursed for your troubleif youre losing more then 510 million on a gank youre a ing idiot and doin it wrong and then you get to pick up the booty and do a little danceyeah suicide ganking takes a little bit of work and i dont care if you all do it until your face turns blue you should not be paid insurance for your ships destruction because you very actively chose suicide and your career is free of this risk you speak of profits arent high enough in high sec without insurance try low sec i hear you can make better money there where you risk getting killedps miners in hi sec sucking down veldspar all day for superior profit to low sec is also borked
right on lets fix this 
are you joking or are you really that insane like i support the proposed alteration to insurance but your taking it way too far
i fully support thiscome on gankers get a cheap t1 ship gank a fully loaded and equipped hulk which are hardly insurable and get the money for their ship back the insurance company basically pays you for commiting a crimeit is not just the hulk that you lose also all the fitting and the ore that you have been mining it is not as if hulks are cheap ships or anything if it werent for the loads of miners you tough pirates wouldnt be able to get a cheap ship since the ore would get too expensiveand that said stop trash talking about carebears and eve is built on pvp if you want to pvp and shoot people up find a ship that can actually defend itselfthis is not player versus player this is player versus certain victim pvp is based on fighting people not shooting neutral industrialists who cannot defend themselves since the ship does not allow you to fit all kind of guns along with the strip minersas soon as we get a big exhumer that can fit loads of guns and missile launchers you can come and shoot us up all you want but untill that happens you should bare the consequences for your actions just as it would be in real lifepiracy is fine for me it gives another dimension to the game it shouldnt however be subsidized and insurable want to gank someone good for you you get killed by concord you go back and get the loot left behind make sure it is worth itits like a bankrobber insuring his guns and getting paid when the police takes them away
supportedyou cause sanctioned by concord then you shouldnt be rewarded and while youre at it how about removing insurance on selfdestructs too
id be fine with removing insurance on selfdestructed ships again youre making a conscious choice to destroy said property
ok please tell me where it is that your support fleet is able to intercept all the missiles and drones that attack the super capitalalso i do think that a lot of drones can shoot past the 56km range that the smart bomb gives off with this system itd be able to pick off the drones with efficient accuracy and reliability
at the point of origin unless youve seen alot of supercaps being onevolleyedalsowhat game are we discussing i thought these were the eveo forums
or four times
so basically a smartbomb that doesnt hurt your friends get out
1 support can shoot drones and fighters2 titansmotherships usually get factionoffer smartbombs they hit up to 9k3 dps wise battleshipshacsdreadscarrier fighters are worse for the super capital than any dronesand last but not least the supercapitals are not supposed to defend themself against a fleet
easy shoot the drones shoot the missile kaunching ships or if you really want to kill the missiles instead of the source fof missiles
terribad idea pds for titan could be cool if it didnt have dd but thats it
you lost all credibility right there
actually that makes moderate amount o senceshooting drones interceptors and frigs maybe they would scare off a t1 crouserreally it is 1 gun it just looks like many guns placed all over the ship to make it look col just like the dualquadriple barrel versions of normal guns they could even be made automatic and would take out drones and small  they will be rather weak another way to do this is to make a capital smartbomb twice the size of large smartbomb and more damage would be almost same thing but i think idea with guns sounds cooler same thing as smartbomb give the guns optimal same as current faction smartbombs have 910 km make it really a single gun it is visually multiple guns to make it look coolcarrier and mothrship module only one can be fitted multiples can be fitted on mothership maybe motherships need more loveso lts get t for carriers and mothershipsmaybe he does not have a whole lot of experience with capitals but idea makes sence and is worth looking into
you got my support ive always wanted to be able to identify someone by their paint job
supported it would be nice to customize things a bit
eve ships already have colors applied to them the basic textures are greyish so the blue parts of a megathron and yellow parts of a kronos are painted as they use the same texturessince there is no server load for loading corp logos theyre stored clientside all it needs it a few extra bits per ship and some slight effort from the art department to assign the appropriate spotsi dont understand why this hasnt been done already tbh every mmo out there allows to display guild logos and most of them allow you to paintdye your stuff
your need isnt everyones needyou think see the bring back old cyno effect petition for a small idea of how unpopular aesthetic deviance can be do not underestimate the players love for eves darker and more mature art otherwise wed all be playing wow or some variantseeing the beautiful ships of eve suddenly transformed into rainbowcoloured earth  beyond style childs toys one day is a horribly disgusting thought and id like to avoid itplease try as hard as you can to imagine a little thumbsdown underneath my portrait
if i whant to colour my ship into rainbow thats my problem
not if im the one who has to look at it ace
login 3 todaybahahahahawow im glad you clarified thatsome people are very special edit btw did you know you can write asp in perl also p
i would like the portrait swap process to be expanded to the entire race of a character and not just the bloodline now that in character creation the bloodline has no real game effects just plan looks and backstory i really dont see why it would matterinput please
i expect the roleplayers would hate you and that nobody else would care if you can find people who want to maybe but im not sure who would
no because while it still makes no difference in terms of mechanics im still an amarrian so having a khanid portrait and wouldnt make senseyour characters portrait appearance and whether you can live with it is one of the things you should have considered at character creation
lolwut i guess youve never been to a nullsec alliance fleet battle before sad sadeditjust looked up your charas creation relatively new the corp youve joined is new highsec mining mission runningah yes youve never actually done anything with a lot of folks before and i think youre grumbling due to bot miners stripping the belts before you can do anything
riiiight noone ever need anyone else in this game atm at any point at all
i really dont see how having an alt account is a bad thing even if you dont like how they transfer money and items that just means it goes from one character to another it all still exists no matter what there is no point for a ban something is telling me you had a bad experience with someone doing this did you get killed did you get ripped off there needs to be some reason why you think they should be banned if you ask me i think it would be more difficult to play multiple accounts than just one but who cares right it doesnt matter it doesnt ruin gameplay and it doesnt discourage teaming up with other peoplei disagree
not supportedplease play a few more months before judging a game as complex as eve
yes because were going to convince ccp to throw away tens of thousands of subscriptions because youre annoyed that some people are better at managing multiple accounts than you are boo freaking hoo
you pay you play if you pay for 3 accounts you should be able to play all 3i personally have 2 accounts this one and marek jahlar and i frequently use both at the same timeim not about to change this for you
not for me but many new players im not selfish like many players
i think its kinda selfish you want me to get rid of my alt so you can somehow play at an even level with me
so everyone can play evenly is all im saying
its about time you wake up and smell the coffee dude the grown up world doesnt work like that you have more money you get more you have more time you do more plain and simple its always been like that and its not about to change you better learn how to cope with this or youll be a very sad gamer no matter which mmorpg you play
what in eves great wide verse made you think for one micro sec that this game was anything close to fair
quit eve ive earned enough isk to pay for multiple accounts and so can you qq more noob hello kitty online adventures is more your style
no
dammit you broke my bullshtometer
i loled hard over that in eve its alowed to use as many accounts simultaniosly and you whant there are people who have 7 accounts and more thats it that is not changing
more convinving if he supported it esp if he used all his accounts and alts to support
i would almost like to agree with the ophowever the game seems to be built around the idea that youre using secondaccount altsfew things can be done alone  or in a way that is worthwile for more than one persona second account is too often simply necessary few are willing to do boring tasks with hardly any interaction for no rewardalts dont mind
if i wanted to play a game that was fair it sure has heck would not be eveif i can pay for more then one account i have 3 and have fun doing it i do then by golly i will ccp seems to have no problem taking my money if you want to change that i suggest you get a loan and buy out ccp
well i play 6 accounts in eve and all my slots are full i got miners  orca and haulers pvpers builders etc etc  i am a 1 man corps  so although i pay for all 6 accounts and can play any 4 at one time  i shouldnt be able to do soand if my prober finds a good mining site  and i log my miners to go do some roidocide i am somhow cheatingim really surprised you had the balls to even come here with that man  more than 12 of eve are somebodys alts weather they have multiaccounts or just one  i bet you have more then one toon rolled on that account your on 
covert ops are great and all but think about why so you only get a strenght boostcovert ops are meant to be unseen and be able to track down and spy on enemy movementshow can you do this when everyone within 14 are scanningi propose that the covert ops frigates get a role bonus that cloaks their probesgive them the ability to do their job cloak the probes
everything has their counter scannable probes are theirsnot supported
exactly cloaking probes would make my job too easy 
sure as if pirate probers didnt have it easy enough as it is not supported
i would support introduction of a new probe type that was cloakednot the suggestion in opif the new probes were such that only covops could use them and came with stats that neccesitated rigging a covops and having high scan skills to scan something down
i could get maybe behind this with two conditions1 they are horribly expensive2 they have far shorter lifespans than normal probes say about half as longthey would still be useful but youd have to be far more diligent in your probing to be able to recover them before the timer ran out and you lost themas for the op  no
half the lifespan of the current probes is still 30 minutes if these things ever enter the game lets give them a 12 minute lifetime then two minutes is enough for probing most of the ships out there
i constantly see fleet invitation alliance invites when i first log on or when i come back from being afk for a while no idea what they are for where they are where they are headed or if one is different from anothernow requesting information is an option but one that will sometimes get you unclear and conflicting answers if theres more than one fleet and nobody knows which one your asking about or make someone take the time out of a possible engagement to tell you that yes its important get your  out to xxx systemmy idea would solve this make a right click  show info option when you right click the fleet invitation alliance link the same as there is for every other link some of the following stuff that could be automatically shownwho is in the fleetwhat roll they have fc squad leader etcwhat they are flying specific megathron or generic battleshipwhere they are so you can see the current location of the fleetthis would answer 90 of common questions there if its all battleships you might recognize they could use some tackle in there the fc would show what alliance in region wide intel channels it is where they are is where you would have to head to so you know its not 5 regions from your current location along with all of this though there could be an option somewhere for the fc to set notes so he could include things likewhere the fleet is headed so you can just link upwhat they are doing so you know if its important or just roaming for the fun of itexpected resistance if heading for a gate camp etcwhat vent channel everyone is on so you dont have to be the 1232334th person to ask thisand with that no more questions need to be answered when fleet invitations are posted everyone will know whats going onagain i know this stuff is something someone could take the time to answer this just seems a faster and more efficient way to spread information to those just coming on than having someone answer all 7 example questions every single time someone joins up
i wouldnt mind showing what you can see in the fleet window already list of fleet members and hierarchy setup but not showing what ship everybody is flying and what role everybody has the fc should be the one telling you what is needed when he posts the fleet invitethe fleet notes is a good idea though i could see how this would be used and i like itill check the support box but know that i only partially support this
this mission is the most common storyline mission yet has the worst standings increase because it is usually completed 2 seconds after accepting the mission the isk and standings change has become minuscule the only reason to do this mission is for the implantplease remove this mission from the storyline missions
supporting my own topic
simple issueas beautiful as eve can be sometimes people just arent interested in the eyecandy whether for performance issues or perhaps and intense dislike of a particular ships model the moa is eye achingly gruesome allow us to disable complex ship models entirely replacing them with a simple cross on the screen much as bracketed objects or ratsmake it an option alongside disabling drone modelsas it is people zoom out during large fleet battles to reduce lag and the strain on their system with the option to disable ship models people will be able to operate zoomed in far closer to the actual position of thier ship but red we only use our overviews what do we care if we have to be zoomed out watching some crosses wink in and out of existence like someone doing a radiation countzoomed in you can manually fly ships and properly control transversal and approaches this isnt possible zoomed out and rather irksome for tacklers of all kindsbut surely the changes proposed would only be useful in huge fleet battles as a lag reduction feature and we dont need to manually control our ship therehave you tried having a 40 man fight in lowsec recently lag and latency related issues are very real in fw areas and have been lamented at such length on the forums i wont go over the issues here but its not just 400 a side unreinforced node fleetfights that suffer crippling lag
supportedthis would take minimal effort to implement so no real loss to ccps time constraintsthis option is available for drones why not ships as wellif you dont like it dont turn them off everyones happy
supported but with low prioritythis will help alleviate the symptoms of lag but it doesnt fix the underlying causes
the fw lag are desyncs not fps problems so lower load on your gpu wont help you there and from what people tell the fw fix works which is probably also usefull to have for pirates who fight fwers
hopefully its something that would take a morning of work by the code bonobosand priority over other issues isnt an issue at all the graphics already exist afterall as does the precedent and i assume the complicated stuff as we can disable drone modelsthe only losers would be the graphics artists if thats what they are called getting sulky but im sure they can raise spirits by making dance extra special for wis
fw and lowsec lag isnt going to magically dissapear with the next patchcan i take it you dont support this change on the grounds that it might not decrease lag in fw
you realise the fw lag thingie is allready released and you can enable it in your client while i havent tried it yet in fleet fights people reported no desyncs with it enabled with 400 in localand besides what you describe which wont get improved by this i dont see any usage for it like you say yourself you dont need to manually pilot arround your bs in a fleet fight
i support this but only if the icons the models would be replaced with would mean something not just a bunch of brackets with all the same shape like brackets nowthe shapes would change depending on the ship sizeclass and their color would match their aggression level ie red  enemy grey or green  passiveas for shapes i dont mean just concentric squares but actually different shapes
i can dig it
sounds good to me
please
yeahhehe
and also just a direct buy it option pls
you dont understand at all how it works there could be 300000 wrecks at a specific location in deadspace and if nobody else is around them to see them in the same grid there wont be any lag at all in the systemlag is created when the server has to update multiple clients with too much information if lets say 10 players warp to that spot where all the containers are then there would be a spike of lag because the server would have to send the location of 300000 containers 10 timesas long as nobody sees objects in space those objects will not interact with any player and therefore not create any lagyou talking stuppid thingsread this and stop trolling
wheres a badass dev when you need onehun that particular instance caused a server crash because there was spam of dynamic objects which could move and had many variables associated with them at a very populated area can you imagine how many players you would need to move all those shuttles mission wrecks are predominantly static and sit at completely unpopulated areaswrecks are nothing but a database entry when no one is on grid whereas any ships need processing time to run their shield recharge capacitor recharge motioncollision calculations what youre doing there is akin to comparing a pea to a elephantoh and 010 simply bad
not supported 2hours waiting is ok have an heart for the ninja salvager
no you stop talking stupid things wake up man the fact they made the server crash was not because they spawned many objects only its because they did so in a very populated area jita is a hub and theres always a ton of people going through that system they dropped shuttles around stargates and the main station where everybody always is no wonder why it crashed the server every time someone flew within the same grid as the shuttles the server had to send that pilot the location of all those objects so it 100 pilots were moving around those objects at times that means 100 updates that is what caused the server to crash everybodys been explaining this to you but you still maintain your position whos talking stupid things nowhowever again if they had dropped them in a deadspace location random bookmark where nobody ever goes nothing would have happenednow maybe your english is so bad you cant understand this but if it is so get someone who is fully billingual and have them translate properly for you
explain how this isnt a stealth nerf to ninja salvaging as a professionnot supportedif you want to decrease server load and laglatency issues in particular regions with mission hubs then space the agents out more
lets be realisticif lag was really caused by static objects just hanging in space ccp wouldnt let people anchor cans especially at stargates where they serve no useful purposethe fact is as has already been explained multiple times that unless someone is on the grid with a static object the game doesnt even bother to load it since it doesnt need itedit i fail so badly at spelling today
just give up dev they are a lost cause i dont think they will ever understand that even if we explain it 100 times more
i agree
not supportedyou didnt destroy it so no kill mail but no insurance payout either
its silly to claim that a ship destroyed during combat is not really a lossthat being said leaving it this way is ok too i enjoy the nerdrage when we create one for them
1 i say do away with kill mails all together who cares 2 self destruction is a planed mechanic of the game3 i think many people including the op  should just get togather and say they want ccp to insta warp scramble all noobs and pilots that can hurt them the second they come into local  then allow them to just fly around and pop them without any chance of them getting killed  and of course send a kill mail to all of them so they can give each other cyberbwjobs on there corps websitesplease
drones
im just sick of them
while um this probably technically isnt the correct place to post this i agree with you 100
all the whiny threads about that are lagging up the db they must be stopped
start with op
we will fre eve frums of half of the trolls and whiners people are just looking for something to whine about really annoing
troll
troll or not salvage whines are a pain in the behindsomething needs to be added when a player first undocksyou do not own anything that isnt in your cargohold can or hangar you do not own wrecks only the contents of them
this is not something that the csm would need to bring up with the developersplease use the report feature on threads and the community team will investigate
no this sounds stupid people have riots on foot and in large mobs they dont have riots in spaceships which costs millions or billions of isk
the potential for abuse of this is ridiculous not to mention youd get something like goonswarm naming every system they own bees or some crap like that so you never actually know where you really are in their spacehorrible horrible idea
this is easily resolved by ccp focusing on cosmos againhard to find pirate datacenters tag exchange agents in empire space as well as more pirate cosmos agents in the empirelowsec cosmos constellations there are already angel and guristas agents in these areasboom done
but this already is free  you can do it with titles and roles or with outofgame tools the issue here is making the interface better and doing it in such a way that you can say id someone as a dread pilot internally without giving that info to everyone external medals are just a total non sequitur this idea isnt even in the same ballpark as medals because no corp with two brain cells to its credit would ever consider using medals for this task personally i use an excel sheet id just like to have an easier way for my members to look up endorsed training plans and of keeping track of who is skilled into what than having to poll people or read through 50 api keys in evemon its not about isk because nobody spends isk on this its about saving effort and creating an easier interface because nobody will ever under any circumstances spend 510 million to tell themselves that billsmith1 is a qualified thorax pilot there is no conceivable circumstance where the medal system provides the correct approach to this problem the fact that were discussing this at all is making me lose faith in the human race actually the word youre both looking for is argument it is not a proof in any proper sense of the word but its a lot more than the pulling ideas out of the air that conjecture implies it is his statement that he feels that medals dont provide anything like the functionality that he desires  a statement that i fully agree with as it happens yes that would be exactly the point that is exactly what the op is asking for and it exactly the same reasoning he used in the first post its not like you had to draw this out from hidden depths  that was the whole idea all along i trust it how has your support
as long as there is the option to disable it from settingsill be happy
this 1000i guess ccp is catering to wow players that want to dance
login 6 i got ini too hope neverevemail upgrade is way more important and not even on the agenda it would appear
lol
this was covered in meeting 3edit yup
i will raise issue fix the forums session cookie management please
was raised by csm1the answer was to wait for the new forum
bah yes it was general fix the forums issue but i forgot contained awful cookie handling which only got worse lately btw scrap this issue but at least i know what will be my question for ccp this month d
anecdotal evidence is valid in any court or for any decision the deciders must determine if the witness is carrying some bias that taints his testimony and then weight the preponderence of anecdotes for and against the decision legalfor my background personally i like afs but mostly use amarr ones which are definitely not solomobiles much less solopwnmobilesboth your stances are correct depending on situation and skills ingame and out of the pilots t2 ships used on their designed scenarios generally murder their targets unless a specific countersetup is encountered the point stands however that from a coherent design perspective the afs are lacking somethings if you consider t2 resistence bonuses to be a bonus then hacs have 5 bonuses same with hics as do interceptors 4 normal  1 role but no resistences and interdictors 4  1 special marauders have 7 bonuses if you count role and resistences recons have 5 not counting covert cyno gen as a bonus but counting resistences exhumers have 5 including resistences but not counting fitting strips which is shared with the mining barge after all command ships have 5 in fact the only other t2 ship that carries 4 bonuses is the electronic attack shipwhich we could do a thread on arguing it is also underpowered and at least needs resistence bonusesaf may or may not be fineespecially after rockets are adjustedbut they deserve some special consideration as to whether given overall design and specifically versus their competitors in cost the interceptor they are not in fact underpowered krum
i might agree with the first part but the second no in any scientific study you look for statistically secure data anecdotes has nothing to add there since they describe a single event and i would argue that game designbalance has a lot more to gain from a scientific perspective
tortugan rockets are not fine i have flown the retribution and vengeance quite a bit and i have used both rockets and guns on my vengeances it takes a sickening amount of time to kill the most trival of targets with rockets even when they are scrammed and webbed i had 4 tech ii rocket launcher and a bcuii fit and a freaking thrasher was able to de aggress and jump through a gate before dieing sure i was in absolutely no danger of him breaking my tank but rockets are terriblesame ship vengeance with 3 unbonused lazors completely different story rockets not only have worse on paper dps but suffer from horrible explosion radius and volocity so much so that a effing battleship with a ab can speed tank some of the damagenow on topic here i agree afs could use a fourth bonus this has to be done correctly as some afs are very good ships currently i do not aggree with wolfs and jags needing a tracking bonus they already use the best tracking turret in the gameif you are having tracking problems with small autocannons slow down a littel unless your target is also using small autocannons you should be able to start hitting him before he starts hitting youas far as a 4th bonus for the retribution i think tracking would be a great bonus for it rof might make it hit a leetle too hardthe ishkur was passable even before the speed rebalance and is a amazing ship nowalso if your in a domi and you for whatever reason decide to use light drones vs a blarpy as opposed to medium drones wth are you doing valk iis travel faster then 3kms guysi have on numorous occasions jumped a solo arbitrator into a 8 man frig  af gang and came out either alive or with 45 kills if your domi cant swat them down im really at a loss

absolutly supported 100 its just wrong that neutrals get in on wars that ppl have paid good isk for
agreed 100 with pit boss read all the comments and the only people who seem to oppose are the people who dont wanna lose there alt reppers  just find that funny  if you dont wanna lose your alt repper dont interfear with the wars with him lol
here is an alt supporting for the second time if this enrages you spare a thought for all the people blocked by exploitative neutral rr alts
ops suggestion fails to prevent neutral assistance while massively nerfing rr bs gangs all the people who have wondered why a privateer might suggest such a thing should look a little harder at the ops suggestionin empire its easy enough to put the neutral alt on the other side of the station or have them warp between safes to ensure that the extra danger from having an agro timer is minimal however if youve got some idiots camping you into station and undock some rr bss to force them off the station you now have added risk because you can not rr if you decide to deagress and dockin simple terms this is a buff to the privateers and a nerf to station huggers logistics ships and rr bs gangs the op getting a buff to station camping by hijacking popular sentiment about neutral rr is truly devious you should go into politics with a mind like that supported because the number of people whove given a thumbs up without thinking makes this thread the troll of the year
yes would be a very nice d
hear hear csm so far has done a dismal job on a longest running and most publicly supported issue in the existence of eve
deough eetdoeugh eet naoooooowwww
why not just make tech 1 rigs a bit cheaper and tech 2 rigs a bit over what t1 are now say the average t1 rig was 4m id almost definitely be rigging my t1 cruisers and if i felt the need to pvp in a t1 frig id be tempted to rig it as well then just make t2 rigs reasonably priced maybe 2540m so bigger ships will make the extra investment rigging should always be a choice it shouldnt be a necessity
negative do not supportshould die in committeeccp we really need a thumbs down optionthumbs down on this issue
i like what ccp is doing with this it keeps the cost of the rigs in proportion with the cost of the ship and that last part with this rigs will not be more of a necessity than a regular module i dont see people complain having to fit modules they do complain if one module becomes mandatory that is not the issue here all i see is more options made more available it just might make a destroyer slightly useful outside of salvaging even while i doubt it ill at least try it
rigs are too expensiveesp t2patch will be goooodnot supported
no if i disconnect in the middle of a gate camp and im not warp scrambled i want to ewarp just like i would now saying you would die anyway is absurd
i meant youll die because youll get pointed and aggrod where did i mention removing ewarps
so if it is so crystal clear how would this change anything to ctrlqing when you jumped your freighter into a camp he still gets out without problems only he cant ctrlq very often to get far away in a random direction so he got to wait untill he can ctrlq a few times again or the camp is gone but his freighter will be fine
i dont think its the logg off thats brokeni think its the emg warpwhen loggin inoutinout the freighters etc never return to where they originally left the gameif an emg warp is activated for whatever reason  that emg warp should allways complete by warping back to the point it came fromthen if a players logs inout quickly the ship in game needs to warp back to gate before doing another emg warp the ship should be tacklable during this manoveursupport for a fix whatever the issue is
its a bug  needs fixing very annoying
i would like to suggest that bpcs with identical peme statistics should be able to be merged the new bpc would have identical mepe stats but would have the run limit of bpc ab if you invent 50 bpcs from identical bpos you could combine these 50 individual items into a single item in your hangar this would greatly simplify hangar and bpc managementthe only limitation would be that a merged bpc can not have a run limit higher then the built in limit for copies
supporting my own topic
i would support stacking them into a pile but merging them into a bigger bpc is not a good idea you need the single bpcs for invention
i think 90 of the backlog is created by 10 of petitionersmostly emo rage kids petetioning everytime one of there ships get poppedto add balance i would say that if you expect all petitions to be read without being preprossed or skimmed then you have to start limiting the number of petitions each player can raisehard limit of 4 petitions per month per player is wholly overkill imo and more than enough for anyoneand the more often you petition the lower priority your petitions are given in the future
not sure if a set ammount of petitions is a good idea i had to petition 6 clone losses in a month on bad jumps all with implants youre idea would result in me losing my sets twicethere should be penalties for fraudulent petition reports if youre a regular to the f12buttonthink thats the one and many of the times its a blatent lie start slapping people on the wrist with 1 day bans examples of this are the idiots that petition every loss mission runners who try to petition to have a mission reset because the mission completion trigger failed know a few who do this with ae and a few others hoping to get them reset to rerun them ninja salvaging people still petition it aggro mechanics that result in a ship loss because they are too lazy to ask how the game works the idiot petitions are endless punish the tools
if you only had 4 pets per month you probably would not have used broken jump mechs 6 times in a month  therefore reducing load on the gms until the issue was fixed
that logic is so broken because of a set ammount of petitions per month i would not clone jump knowing that i risk losing a clone and petitioning for reimbursment so you would punish those of us who once in a blue moonexpansion release hit a real problem and need to use the petition system more then 4 times poor solution to the problem it just punishes the people who actually use the system as it was intended
everyone was in the same boat as you  you are not specialif everyone did what you did there would have been approx 1 million petitions createdthe problem affected everyone everyone did not jump 6 times and require 6 petitionsyes a limit of 4 per month will stop selfish people from hoggin gm attention whether that is from mission running resets ship loss petitions  or whoops i am a spanner and lost my implant for the 6th time this month  duh

im not going to lean towards or against removing insurance for suicide ganking but i would like to say that people need to step away from the idea that theyre making things anymore realistic the entire insurance system in eve is beyond unrealistic lets compare eve ship insurance to car insurancehave so many of you not even thought about how insurance companies work in real life insurance companies in real life work by using mathematics figures and statistics to determine how much of a risk each insured person is and how much their premiums are levels of coverage deductible amounts past incidents vehicle type and a range of other variables are taken into account when an insurance company issues a policy they also issue the policies knowing that every customer will use their policy to the fullest extent ie replacing the entire vehicle or in eves case ship eve is vastly different from the real world in eve insurance isnt used to cover the cost of fixing minor damages caused to a ship nor is it used to pay for damage done to other peoples ships in eve it is almost guaranteed that the users ship will be lost if such an occurrence was true in real life only a mad man would attempt to run an insurance business there is also the matter of concord being realistic but im sure you get where im going

how can you judge something without having experience with it
thats what pvp is for ccp wouldnt ruin the dark gothic grungy coloring and atmosphere of eve even if they did consider this idea the option for hot pink ships would be the first one to hit the wastebasket color choices would probably still conform to the entirety of eve as a gaming experience meaning they wont be over the top and stupid
i wanna put flames on my vaga
although this idea is interesting but few technical issuesif you have ships painted differently and have different names of makers of them  how can you repackage them make a stack and put a sell order of like 10 of them on the market in one single sell orderif this idea goes through it would be good if in eve settings there would be an option of turning off those logosadditional colours so that the lag in fleet battle is redicedbut overall of course the idea of painting ships your way having pretty corpalliance logo and makerstamps on items would be good if those technical buts are dealt with

gentle readerstheres been a significant amount of tears shed over the years regarding salvage rights or the lack thereof and the existence of the salvaging profession employed independentlyhere is a simple change that would both address some of the missionrunners concerns while both retaining salvaging as an independent activity and reduce database bloat enable wrecks not located inside a deadspace to be scanneddown and warped tothis change would permit missionrunners who care about their wrecks to come back and salvage them while giving most independent salvagers another target in the form of abandoned wrecks left over from completed missionsit would draw away some salvagers from active missionsthe source of much tears in the community decrease database entries as they are cleared out sooner by salvagers and increase available salvage in advance the increased demand from tiered rigsit would disadvantage players who like to clear out their missions and return in a mwd ship for salvage but they already compete with independent salvagers who can easily scandown their missionsalvage ships and race to clear the wrecks i view this as a valid but very minor compromiseplease discusskrum
deadspace is already harder to probe out than regular space i believe and these complaints really dont need to be addressed  the status quo is fine
thumbs downccp is swinging the nerf bat quite a bit lately at targets that dont need nerfing the salvage mechanic works perfectly as is missioner whining and their 40 milhour income is not nearly enough to warrant any changes to the mechanic either salvage as you go along missioners or move alongi salvage as i go along get greedy and expect to get your icing licked off that bountiful cake you guys love eating

not supportedwhat you are asking for is a direct nerf to ninja salvaging ill paraphrase a gmsalvage isnt there to increase your iskhr its there to provide a mini profession for othersredsplat is being particulalry slow today
scanning abandoned wreck with the onboard scanner if so  win
not supported many people turn missions in before they start salvaging so from the mission runners side you wouldnt change muchif they want parts of my salvage fine you have to support those poor pvp folks so they can afford later to buy more ships from me 
you know you can just bookmark the wrecks turn the mission in and warp there right
deadspace is no harder to probe out than regular space and this is a suggestion to enhance salvaging not nerf ninjasalvaginghow the  do you get that idea what part of his idea would nerf the act of scanning someone down in his mission and salvaging the wrecks he leaves behindsupported though i would probably not use it in most cases
currently the maximum range of the onboard directional scanner is 14au approx i think that since its now more possible to scan down a ship on a mission in low sec or in a hidden belt directional scanner should increase in distance when the angle is reduced  much like a real world directional beam antenna increases decibels in the direction with a loss to the sides and read of said beam that directional scanning beam should also be allowed to be set to rotate around much like a real world radar system and such a display comparable to one or a 3d display could be helpful its hard to consider that this is 1940s technology i mention here and over 20k years into the future we cannot have this on a spacecraftof course the radar should not pinpoint like scan probes it should also be possible and beneficial for all players to be able to filter hits on the rader and warn with an audio tone if certain objects are detected such as probes or ships of certain types or sizes this can be beneficial not only to missioners and miners but 00 sov space defense as well perhaps this could also open a whole new realm of modules and skills to utilize them furthermore perhaps through module or skill and having worked on real world fighter aircraft myself eccm is real being scanned down or hit with a radarattenuated directional scan should be detectable again 20k years in the future and now i write of technology that has been quite efficient since the 1970s but is not seen in eve
eve online is nowhere near what the future would translate into for normal human beings
while i dont know if some of the ideas wont have really negative consequences in general i will support it for the help the directional scanner needs especially when they would decide to remove local one dayand about the audio tone soon the pirates will come whining and telling you are a carebear and maybe the audio tone isnt the best idea for sure it shouldnt be instanious when someone enters 14au distance however the current game mechanics are just terrible being forced to click the scan button every few seconds isnt skill but just bad game design
nobody said it was skill its alertness if you want to know whats lurking out in the black then you need to ping the scanner  not have ccp implement a feature to have the client ping the scanner for yoube alert or stay in highsec
note that i also put in that a scanning radar system could alert to detection of certain sized objects as wellwhen i make a suggestion its not political styled in that one group gets the oneup over another through manipulation of authorities or mechanics an audio tone and setting of directional scanners for certain conditions would be a beneficial tool to both pirates and carebears it goes from that point from being all about clicking on a button to how well thought out your parameters are and your experience in such matters i would also like to add that it appears directional scans are making a database query of sorts considering the time delay that does not appear arbitrary to see what i mean run a dscan in both crowded hub systems and empty dead end systems and notice the time difference if the day should come that local is eliminated in 00 you will have a lot of people hitting that scan button more often and that could become a major load on the cluster as all these queries are being fired off a more refinsed and automatic scanning system for directional scanning could help this issue
sometimes there is a reason that our eve future selfs cannot figure out antiquated tech that we often talk about on the forums simply it takes away from the way the game is intended to be played doing this just automates youre need to be aware of your situationi cannot support a system that reduces the need for player skills it has taken time to master the directional scanner and when an object shows up i can usually find it within 10 seconds and if its static i can get an aproximate range if any thing a directional radial sweep youre speaking of would potentially create more db calls consider every degree it sweeps it needs to make a call to get information on that single degreemil also in most fleet fights i have encountered not everyone is banging the scan button the scouts are because it is their job to tell the fc whats inbound with this automated system every player sitting at a gate bored will sit there watching their pretty little radar for the all might red dot of incoming impending doom creating even more db calls
making it easier for people to avoid pvp at all costs cant support this
i have had the pleasure of working with people who have been sent by the military into very bad parts of this world with some of the best fighting equipment coerced tax dollars could buy backed with the best training a national infrastructire could offer and every one of them will tell you contact with the enemy on these missions was the last thing we wanted if you had to use your rifle its because you or your intel screwed upso where in the rules of the game does it say that just because some other players want pvp i have to go line up to them for it avoiding the fight is just as much pvp as getting into one just because you want killmails it does not mean that i have to see that and think oh well i have to go sit here and wait for him oh i should just fly into their camp now and take it sorry but the jan bradys of eve really should just accept that people will outsmart them just as much they claim at every step that nonconsenting pvp is a part of the gam and how their intended victims should just accept tha i guess if someone builds a camp and points to the cattle car i am therefore required to climb in and take the ride no its better to vanish and hunt down those who built the camp and sent the train
welcome to internet spaceships not rl ccp said it themselves eve is a game of nonconsenting pvp directional scan and local are more then adequate if you are sitting in a belt with a neutral in local and you see a stilleto youre best bet is to gtfo better yet instead of waiting for him to show up on scan get to a safe or dock upi dont want to be rude but this is a useless idea a warning for ships on scan of a certain size or larger if a pod is in system consider it a threat he could be a scout and when he arrives in your belt his friends in ships are going to follow this idea just supports people playing semi afk in a dangerous situation they can just sit in their belt and mine crank their speaking while fornicating the a goat and when the alarm sounds run back to the pc and dock learn to use the directional scanner it is amazing you can determine general area and range to target within seconds
i am continiously amazed by people who actually defend being forced to click a button every few seconds is good game designyes i see the problem immediatly getting an audio warning when someone comes near you is not a really good solution probably but the alternative also is crappy having it work on autorepeat or something go database lag would allready help alot you would still need to watch the result of the scanner but you dont need to click a button like a stupid drone

i pretty much agree with this the fleet invite should not give more info than fleet membership but barring that this is a good idea
i support my own ideaalso the idea behind the fc notes is so he can tell people what to bring showing what they are flying is just an easy way of letting people know what the fleet makeup is my idea was that the there would be as much information as possible automatically available hey knowlege is power right but the fc notes section would have the final say over anything aboveif in the end parts get dropped andor parts get added thats just fine with me i just think there needs to be some kind of information available as long as your all for that then support thisps  the ability to edit the fc notes section should be something the actual fleet commander can give to a person so the person actually commanding the fleet can turn over the position of fc to someone with higher skills than him but still have the ability to edit this wow that sounds complicated hopefully yall understand it
jove storyline arcfrom the blogfinally as many of you have noted the complex fullerene shards are not included in these buy backs the shards will be used at a later stage for another jove related story arc so hold onto it until then when is this bit gonna happen i have been waiting 5 years now 
2017 third quarter
going to be a big expansion together with wis
wts complex fullerene shards
1m isk bo
here here  whats the word on thisbtw wtb complex fullerene shards and jove body parts  please contact me ingame
i was just kiddin with the wts i would really like the csm to ask ccp if they ever intend to do anything with the unfinished jove arc and cfs inparticulari brought and collected hundreads of the thing way back then and they have collected dust ever since  no reward was forthcoming 
in memory of t20 ccp cannot have any story line that results in any kind of item exchange between player and ccp that cannot be equally enjoyed by all playerssince complex fullerenes are mostly collected by several players doing any kind of event with them is out of the question sorry guys
just fyi cfs were given to all players and were available in rat drops for all playersso theres no issue in providing a finish to this saga
but you cannot deny that several players has spent a lot of time and money collecting them any sort of story would have to deal with a large collection of the fullerenes  otherwise it wont make sense so only the people with large numbers be able to get anything
stupid point of view imo not just carebears want to get through gatecampsanyway the raw idea is fine but it would make fleetbattles1 extra laggy2 impossible to manage at alli have no idea how such a dronetype could be implemented and no matter how i like the base idea i cannot support ops proposal
fleetbattle of 1000 people involved  6000 peoplemimics  a big hole in iceland with centre at where ccp server was untill it exploded
noone would use the drones in fleet battles instead theywoul b used solosmal gang in fleet you whant dps the drones have sigradius of the ship they mimic and not too much hp so tehy are easy to ill great proposal it makes sence since we have cloacking devices that mke you invis full suport great idea
an interesting idea if launching a whole wing is an issue though increase the size of the drone so that only the dedicated drone boats can deploy a full set of 5they are also going to need some decent ai you propose that they fly off in random vectors what if i am in my typhoon and drop 23 of this little bad boys and i being close range fit start burning at my target to rain the pain and my decoys are running off in oposite direction firing t2 torps from 20km when they have a range of 9km any pilot that is not prone to crapping his pants in a pvp situation will take a two second looks and see 1 typhoon 500m away and the rest random range
in sniper bses with 160km range you dont use drones  and most serious fleetbattles are sniper ones it might get close range if caps are involved
me sees how pos defenders will spam mimic drones so that hostile fleet lags out on warp in imagine carriers doing that also gatecampers using those drones for the same reason and to uncloak cloakers
a corp mate and i were ranting and raving over this topic for a while we came up with what we feel is a viable and intelligent solution to the issue a simple adaption of many other mmos solution to logging out a camp timerits a simple idea when you go to log out under conventional means ctrlq escquitconfirm right click windowclosewhile in windowd mode you are presented with a message informing you that you must cease all actions for 10 seconds to be succesfully logged out during that time you sit there and wait for the countdown and youre client closes during this time you are able to be aggrod thus giving a countdown if you decided to wait out the timer you would still ewarp 1m km away like normal and be probable if aggression was taken or you could react and stop the cycle and try and make a run for itthe same principle should be applied to a ship that ctrlqsdcs if this happens you break cloak and for 10 seconds any target has the ability to aggro you if you dc at a gate it is tough luck it happens to date i am down 8 ships due to dc life moves onthe idea behind the 10 second timer is if you are being chased and do have to resort to a lame ctrlq because you are a fail at getting a scout the chasing forces have 10 seconds to warp threw the system jump wait out the change delay lock and get a shot off it is really not a major affect to those that log off safely it does affect those that do choose to try and blindly run ships without a scout threw hostile territory knowing that it is virtually impossible to catch them unless in 00 with a dictorthe argument that such a change is unfair to those without a stable connection is really an example to lazyness and stupidity you should not be able to run with impunity solo threw a hostile environment use a damn scout ask a friend roll a temp alt to scout you and stop using a faulty game mechanic like a buch of tools that said it is also no major affect if you are unstable but in a safe environment by the time you log in you will not have noticed that 10 secondswhat will happen to a ship for those 10 seconds simple he will start his align as usual but if the align time to warp is less then 10 seconds he sits at speed for the remaining secondstldr 10 second camping timer when you log out youre ship sits in space for 10 seconds aligned out and when the timer is down you ewarp during said time you may recieve agression
fully supported doesnt hurt people logging off in safes but makes sure people who ctrlq to avoid a fight because they were too stupid or lazy to scout cant get away with it
thumbs down a merc corp whining about losing kills on carebears ill bet
not at all infact i have not played in three weeks to lose a kill this is just a topic that affects all pvprs be it on a small scale level or grand 00 escapades albeit that said this is more an issue for us empire dwellers that see this kind of garbage happen every day does not make it any less of an issue as many try to make others believe it is not all about the 00 and the massive fleets
logoff mechanics have changed a fair bit without anyone really noticingbefore with good skills you could catch a logoff with a single probehowever the probing system changed are logoffs catchable still
you can catch them fine its just the problem of killing them before they disappear this idea is supported
seems reasonable i may have not purposly closed my client while in my hauler hitting a hostile camp
logoffski seen it done by targets and they do it in a way that suggests it is not the first time they have done it normally a ratter in 00 gets caught by a fleet of ships when he had every opportunity to use scanner look at local  have a scout learn to play the game etc and get somewhere safe is tackled and attacked then disapears the only way that this could happen is if they intentionally log off and log in an alt on the same account eve doesnt let you have two alts on the same account online for very good reasons hence the ship which should have blown up disappears immediatly due to what i believe is an abuse of game mechanics by said player said player then also logs in and out before navigation is finished and ends up 1 mil km each time hence avoiding anyone waiting for them to log in at the point they warped toif this is not outright abuse of game mechanics and hence bannable i dont know what isthis is particuly likely in certain areas of space where certain pet corp ships with alts called something like say hef6d7 seem to repeatativly do the same pve tasks regardless of what is in local or sitting there watching them that is until they are attacked which to me isnt 100 proof of what i am suggesting but it certainly brings up even more worries about this mechanics errr usethe fix is simple if you disconnect the ship and pod remain in game and a ld flag shows up at which point they basicly become an npc with the same abilities and with skills applied ect hence you are unlikely to be killed by rats or indeed a player that awould never kill you anyway if you get connection issues but of course you will lose your piloting skill and will remain stationary and attempts to emergency warp every few seconds once a warp to 1mil km is acheived within 45 seconds the ship leaves game unless pointed this is an improvement over the current system but prevents abuse if this player tries to log in another alt they get a warning that they cannot and they need to log back in to connect to the ld alt if the player logs in and immediatly logs off they stay at the safe point ld for 30 seconds again they dont warpthis is similar to how it works in other online pvp games and i dont see why it cannot be implimented in eve
issue rmt tradingreal examplethe person behind ricdic was caught doing real money trading with over 200b isk that he stole from ebank the isk was sold for about 6000 australian dollars however only his alternative character was banned for this act the main character ricdic is not banned and is posting happily on the forums and playing the game with no penalty attached i would like for the csm to bring this issue up to ccp can one really do real money trading be caught and still be able to play like nothing happend
butthurt over losing your isk eh not supported
this is about rmt and not isk
i agree the policies around this needs to be revised by the csm
supportedsome consistency from ccp would be good but retrospectivebanning shouldnt be done either i believecertainly in future occurrences
did you lose money iceblock or are you just indignant over the horrible injustice in this situation 
i just want to clarify so i can rmt isk too without getting banned
i understand why they dont get rid of farmers then just the rmting accounts and not not isk making ones well pop haulers full of dolls and team of janitors for a long time
why would they want to get rid of farmers they are paying accounts much easier to take away bought isk now and then and still have people keep playing
unfortunately we dont know the circumstances behind why ricdic was reinstated and even if we ask ccp have a policy of not discussing individual accountsplayers which imho is correct however we can ask about the rmt banning guidelines they do employ personally id rather ask that question straight out as part of the qa session for this month tho
ebank is just one big scam waiting to happenif you choose to trust 3rd parties with your iskies dont cry to the council when you get ripped offalso council is for game related issuescouncil has no rights to decide rl penalties handed out to playersbig lols and thumbs down
how far do you want to take thisshould his name be censored for all time like the eponymous  
i agree omber however ricdic is an example where something went wrong in the banning process in my eyes what i think should be brought to attention is this not ricdic in particular he is just an example this is nothing to do with the isk nor ebank itself they are here for attention and example only the real issue is the rules and policies behind rmt if i can sell isk on my alternative account and get away with it with my main untouched and unbanned something is wrong with the rules and policies dont you think
how far do you want to take thisshould his name be censored for all time like the eponymous  this is one guy ccp is allowing rmt to be propagated on a massive scale in 00make another proposal addressing the real issues rather than a witchunt ill support that
ccp customer relation policies are not in the remit of the csm afaiucsm is for game design related issues let them concentrate there efforts in this area
they could because farmers are massively immersion breaking and thus ruining the experience for some either it is you undock in highsec to a pack of cnrs named rtyu and cnjlkh and fgriogj or because you dont bother popping haulers anymore in lowsec because the good stuff is a droplet in a sea of worthless mission itemsalso farmers are not per se paying account it seems but mostly sustaining themselves on gtcplex so banning them at worst would crash that market a bit if plex went low enough many people would resub secondary account and the prices would rise again
indeed i want to know if only alts who actually handled the rmt transaction get banned if that is the case i need to make some alts up sooni need to buy an iron lung for my non exsistant child
you have no idea how wrong you are

its a storyline mission and it gives you a good implant for 10 seconds work besides one of the missions has to give the lowest reward  why is it any worse if its this one instead of another

not to mention the opportunity for young tradersindustrialists to supply those materials to the storyline agent station at inflated costsben
linkage
i think this mission pops up more often than any other i didnt do any statistics thoughnot sure but i seem to remember it doesnt even always give you an implantmissions need to be reworked anyway especially the way payment is calculated
this i agree with and i think thats probably part of ccps grand plan for epic arcs  though i have no proof of thatbut randomly removing missions becuse they seem useless is probably not the best way to effect change
i like this mission when im whoring hands off
did i possibly overestimate the understanding of the average playermission rewards and standings changes are based off of the average completion time of a mission so any mission that allows for the gathering of resources before accepting the mission allows for a completion time of seconds rather than hoursminutes that the formula was designed for this leads to off the chart low mission rewardsstandings change
no we understand you just finewe just dont share your concern about the situation
i just did some investigating on my own and it does seem that throughout the day wormholes begin to close but i have yet to find a new wormhole that wasnt detected at an earlier point in the gameit does seem that no new exploration sites spwan after down time and after asking about it in the exploration channel they also seemed to agree that new sites dont spawn after dt which if this is true creates an unfair balance for those of us who are unable to log on shortly after dtto the person that says that they always manage to find sites this in itself doesnt mean much unless you can show that a site you havent seen pops up on the scanner from a previous time during the day for example i always log on at lunch time and scan then scan later on in the evening when i return from work there are always less sites and i have yet to find a new site that i havent found previously during the daycan ccp comment on the exploration system as to whether this is in fact the case here
i know that if youre in a wormhole when the way out collapses a new one spawns instantly id wager that this doesnt happen especially often though
definitely not often enough is it me or have you found the quality and frequency of the wormholes to be less now than before the last game patch it seems like the quality is way down
what are you talking about completed sites respawn all the time not only on downtimethe downtime respawns expired sites  those that werent found or werent completed in time
sites always respawn in a different system in the same constellation not supported
i have yet to see any evidence that the site respawns as i said even those on the exploration site dont agree that sites will spontaneously appear in a system anytime during the time after downtime if it does happen it doesnt happen enough
what evidence do you need to see it do some exploring and learn mechanics instead of posting nonsence like partially taken radar sitesif you want sites move to a less populated area sites tend to drift to rarely visited systems 56 signatures in system isnt uncommon in those and drift happens exatly because of instant respawn of completed ones
people who spend more time worrying about other people getting more stuff than them end up getting less stuff than people who just go out and do it
whs spawn in all areas of eve in areas of all securitystry lowsec there are an annoying number of wormholes there that link to both highsec easy wh space and slightly harder areasthis is really just people complaining they have to explore to get exploration content
makes sense if not rendering drones had such a positive effect on lag in fleet fights this should also be helpful assuming it can be done fairly easily fully supported

with each new graphics upgrade to the games i love i feel like im getting less and less game

youre mixing up lag and low fps or high cpu usagelag is network latency low ping and low fps is when your graphics card cant render everything fast enough because theres too much to render

seeing all these jan brady types who only go on the offensive only to add a km to their board being able to deny them a km by self destructing is only fitting after all if they want to deny you your ship for the sake of getting a km then you should have a right to deny them the km by1 being faster on the self destruct initiation and2 if they cant destroy your ship fast enough then tough luck gankers should at least be good gankers if they think they are entitled to a km

not really supporting stealth bombers are not meant for massdestruction just like small bombers in rl they go they release their few bombs and gtfo if they can thats the way it is and thats the way it should be bombers being able to deploy zoundz of bombs would be overpoweron the other hand something like heavy bombers should be quite nice new shiptypesedit i fly nemesis so i could do with some buff but i feel it would be way too much bombers got buffed recently so that now they are usable but it shouldnt be overdone imoedit2 if normal cargo capacity gets nerfed at the same time youll have my support

hey i would like to dance
i normally dont post on the eve forums but this thread made me angry for some reason so here it goeseven though ninja salvagers do indeed need to invest a lot of time and money into their profession the actual process of ninja salvaging has more or less no risk involved therefore to solve this problem there needs to be a solution that adds a little risk but doesnt shut out ninja salvagers completely ie instant aggro on salvageso i propose that deadspace mission complexes act sort of like a room that is owned by the mission runners by trespassing on the room a ninja salvager is given a certain amount of time 2 mins maybe to do whatever he wants and then after that time has elapsed the mission runners get aggro on the salvager this basically makes it so there is a risk to salvaging right under peoples noses but it is still possible it also would make salvaging jobs a bit more complicated you may have to get more than 1 person to be able to salvage a decent amount of loot before the time is up
while the current state of the system for your characters bio is probably less important to others than it is to me see
this has been complained about before and the stated policy of ccp is that increasing bio lengths would lead to exploits with no further explanation givensince they do not discuss exploits there are plans in the works to overhaul these systems and they cant come to fruition soon enough for my tastes but for now were stuck with the godawful status quo also when raising an issue for the csm you generally want to put it in the assembly hall not jita park fyi
tehy need to maek it ullegal to fit guns in highsec unless your ina mishion hub
if rockets arent fine its not your af that needs a bonus its the weapons system however if you try your unbonused lazorz versus the rockets when attacking another af i think you may consider changing your stance back when i was pirating a local would fly around in her rocket vengeance and utterly  other afs she fought just a matter of finding the right targetsas for the drones i did indeed use hobgoblin iis at the time and decided to use that example as most people dont realize valks track frigates with good skills however i have since tanked an arbitrator with a flight of valk iis in my ishkur one of the weaker tanked afs and if you dont believe that id be happy to prove it to you clarification i tanked his drones i did not pop them as the arby was friendly and i was testing a setup i would have been able to tank them as long as i had cap boosters
any af can sport a strong enough tank to tank 4 rocket launchers on a vengeance any of them its on paper dps is a measely not much over a hundred and you dont get anywhere near that due to the horrible explosion volocity rockets currently are terrible also i have no idea how your having so much success against drone boats with a small ship as i  anything frigate sized in my arbitrator enyos and ishkurs included also not sure if your aware but a thrasher sports a horrible tank compaired to a af especially if its scrammed and webbed and it takes a laughable amount of time to kill even themseriously get in a vengeance fit rocket launchers and go try to kill something beefier then a executioner then come back and tell me how it feels to try beating someone to death with limp noodlesi fly the retribution a lot its crazy survivable and does decent dps would i love a 4th bonus yes i would would i worship the dev incharge of a decision to give it a 2nd mid hell ya is it useable now yes is it worth the cost maybedo i look at ishkurs and wish i was skilled for them yup do i look at a jag and wish i could fly them yes i do 4 effing mids most the afs ishkur excluded need a little love some of them either themselves or there weapon systems rockets need love if a vengeance did 240 dps with rockets and tanked like it currently does that would be very broken if it got a good 150 dps and could actually applied taht to a webbed scrammed target it would be worth what it costs for something other then a amazing tackler and yes the vengeance with dual sariis and dual nos is a amazing heavy tackler but buffing rockets wouldnt make that better as at that point it cant fit themquit going on about your ishkur as everyone here aggrees that is the only af thats about where they should be
i suggest you contact brigita grohman if youd like to learn how to fly a vengeance  also the ishkur is good for its dps and its speed the reference i used was in regards to its tank which is regarded by most as subpar compared to the other afs
give the ret a 2nd mid
oh look everybody there is this brigita grohman who knows how to fly a vengeance when nobody else doesquick ccp hire this brigita grohman person and let himher train the remaining thousands on how to fly the vengeance since everybody else is stupid and its easier than fixing rockets
more bonuses pls
not worth trying to convince people theyd rather whine that every ship their race is underpowered until they get enough of a whineblob that ccp has to do something to avoid mass emoragequits 
wow this is still going on id have thought it would have been a done deal by now tortugan i totally see where youre coming from see earlier posts  i love af there are however 2 considerations to consider1st is design it is clearly anomalous to have one class of t2 frig excluded from being 4th bonused the question is  can you conceive of what that bonus might be without making the ship overpowered2nd is principle yes af rock and roll and bugger your granny sideways if you dont respect their authorotah just yesterday we killed 2 bs and a hic that made the age old mistake of oh its just a gang of frigs how bad can it  augh my gran noooooo but as you fly around in them theres just a little thats not quite there ive tested them all out and for some its clearer than others ishkur not so much  any of the caldari ones oh hell yesi think what was proposed earlier was a solid proposal to fill both gaps but it needs people like you and me to stand on wang et al to make sure that ccp dont take a nerf bat to our beloved shipsand sorry but that means no 2nd mid for the retri  even if it is my favourite
yes hijacking popular sentiment was my ultimate goal but wait sentiment didnt become popular until the subject was brought up and voted on  so now were in a sort of time loop according you youbut i like your argument  making the issue about who brought it up  not what the game mechanic lacks 
woohoo
but i like your reply  failing to have a sense of humour  and ingoring everything i said about the mechanic adding an agression timer will not prevent neutral rr make rr bss unable to rep each other if they want to jump  dock prevent null  low sec logistics cruisers from jumping when they are inevitably primariedadding aggression mechanics to remote buff modules has far more consequences outside of empire than inside ityou are never going to get rid of neutral alts altering fights in high sec because any mechanic that can be used by mission runners to provide remote assistance is going to be used by empire war deckersno most of the people who oppose this are aware of the wider consequences and understand that the small nerf to neutral rr in empire that is being suggested would result in a much bigger nerf elsewherefyi ive never used a neutral rr alt but if the situation arose then id have no hesitation in doing so and dont see how the proposed mechanic would stop me
it probably wont but it will make you think twice about sticking your nose into a fight that is not yours  who wants to run the risk of losing a ship if they have to wait to dock like everyone else doesmaybe its time we look into the whole rr bs thing  just like they made cloaking devices  maybe rr modules should be ship specific and hard to kit on anything but a logistics ship or impractical to use on anything but a logistics shipperfect example for this would be why did the alliance tourny ban their use in the last tourny they realized it drags pvp out and is potentially the i win buttonwhy should they get a free pass  get off the gate just like the ecm pilot does  the logistics is a ranged shipask any ecm pilot  using the ship on a gate is asking for a kick in the mouthbut i thought 00 was supposed to be the land of milk and honey once again youre making it an issue of who suggested the fix  i have never used a neutral rr alt either  and the proposed mechanic would make me think twice about using rr if i had to wait just like everyone else to redock or jump if i had aggression for trying to turn the tide of a battle 
so you agree with me that the proposal will not prevent neutral rr in empire but will affect rr bs gangs and logisticsthis is very much the point im making the issue is far more complex than simply adding aggression timers to remote buff modules if you actually do understand this then why is there no mention of it in the opthank you for pointing out the exact tactic that will be used by empire rr alts to make your suggested fix pointless if the rr alt in question doesnt have the skills to fly a dedicated logistics ship then use a buffer fit t1 logistics and simply let it die then the alt can dock up and grab a new ship for a few penniesthose are just two possible tactics but im sure theres plenty more ways to make your suggested fix utterly and totally irrelevant once again youve taken this personally instead of looking at the mechanic i was highlighting the server has no way to distinguish between a mission runner applying remote rep to their friends and a war decker applying remote rep to their friends which is a very significant fact when trying to think of alternative ways to prevent neutral rri know that your your op doesnt affect mission runners but it doesnt affect neutral rr much either because its mainly a nerf to rr bs gangsany suggestion that makes remote repping neutrals a criminal offense will hurt mission runners and any suggestion that involves adding an aggression timer fails to solve the problem of neutral rr catch 22
absolutely notzombie disposable rr  while theoretically possible  get real  whos going to do that  thats like saying i have a throw away falcon for my station camping as for making logistics work at range  i fail to see how that is a work around to a fix it will put a neutral rr at way more risk of losing his ship than he is right now hugging a station  a fast tackler will catch him with his pants down  exactly how will this hurt a mission runner  examples please
with that ability to utterly contradict yourself i go back to my original assessment that you should be a politicianare you seriously trying to say that adding an agro timer to rr modules will have more effect on neutral rr alts than rr bs gangs

hi ccp  remember me
must resist urge to beat dead horse nvm picks up stick and beats horse
csm  you were elected to represent the players  whatever your own personal opinion might be on the matters as such i think a thread which has run for 4 four years asking ccp to get onto pos fix deserves to be brought to ccp whatever the case might be furthermore said 4yearrunning request deserves more than 5 minutes of discussion or silly names like funky pos idea  and sure as hell it deserves a detailed dev blog from ccp there is no other thread on this forums that has been as widely supported and as often asked for or as long running  as the dead horse pos

please
if a csm could comment on what i have typed below i would really appreciate it im afraid to say it but the problem is actually graver than the fix being proposed can manage even if this fix goes through it wont help much why because currently probers are catching on to a technique that allows them to keep their combat probes tucked away in their cargo holds while still being able to probe players down the technique is as follows 1 use the onboard scanner to pinpoint the location of a player to within an au since no probes are used the prey will not suspect hes being probed2 once the prober has the location pinpointed he could now launch the combat probes for just about 5 seconds get a result and get a 100 warpable hit probes only remain in space for that long3 warp to target and bust missionbasically combat probes only have one function at the moment to give the prober a bookmark to warp to the rest of the process can be accomplished by the onboard scanner what this means to the prey is that if he wants to detect the probes he will need to press the onboard scanner every 5 seconds even if this fix manages to be implemented youll still have to press the button 540 times for a mission lasting you 45 minutes there is little to no reason to use combat probes to probe the onboard scanner does the same job and is silent this is just really stupid mechanics i would appreciate it if a csm could bring this up to ccps attention since this is destroying the possibility of running missions in low sec once the mission has been probed down the chances of a mission runner completing the mission dwindle significantlyi started a thread on this herecombat probes  directional scanner  overpoweredfeel free to check it out and comment on any case i support this thread regardless good luck and thanks for reading

faction gear is too expensive especially deadspace the bump everything 5 meta levels patch is going to be awesome
hint this is more along the lines of keeping deadspace modules at the exact same price but having varying sizes with larger sizes tending to cost more  oh wait looks at deadspace frigate mwd looks at deadspace cruiser mwd its already implemented 1mn microwarpdrives are turning eve into wow since frigate pilots pay less to fit deadspace mwd than cruiser and battleship pilots
that actually has a lot more to do with demand ccp is bypassing demand by affecting build cost with rigs i mean say small rigs were 10x more popular after patch if theyre implemented at 200k build cost theyre only going to cost 2 mil by comparison if ccp were to half the about of small gisti shield boosters dropped theyre price would go through the roof and since they already run at 700 mil a pop thats significant btw small gisti boosters are already in heavy demand which is why their cost is so much greater than most small faction loot
i was referring to the esp t2 bit  i can sort of see the way they did sized rigsdisagree with it but understand it but the move to make t2 rigs cheaper is just fundamentally dumb imo t2 rigs are the equivalent of deadspace gear  theyre supposed to be luxury goods that are only really costeffective choices on mission ships and supercaps making them cheaper just defeats the purpose
not supportedyou seem to be completely missing the point youre right that rigs are supposed to allow you to add extra power to a ship in exchange for an additional investment perfectly correct but why the hell should rigs cost the same across all ship sizes only a twit with more money than sense or someone entering a restricted tournament like the alliance tournaments would rig any t1 ship smaller than a battlecruiser because a single rig would cost several times the value of the damned hull thats just silly yes i admit the new price scaling is a bit surprising but to my mind rigs have always been badly overpriced anyway and from a purely fluffcommon sense perspective its frankly ridiculous that rigs cost the same for all ship sizes why would a kit designed to modify your ships entire hull cost the same regardless of whether its put on a t1 frigate or a titan
not supportedon the whole pvp gains from it and if those oldies wanna play with expensive gear there is plenty of that left
something does need to be done about this we tried to get a hulk a few nights back and the jerk just insta warped off as our interdictors were in warp thats pretty lamehe had an alt in a covert ops there to watch until we left i dont think this is what ccp had in mind when they created the disconnect rules i support this thread wholeheartedly
im not going to mark this thread supported but i do think the issue needs to be fixed i just dont think the ops idea is the correct fix personally i favor the fix suggested by another posted bloody eve forums not showing full discussion on reply when you log back in after ewarping off you should always return to the original point you ewarped off from now there is another problem with this i see though so the person logs back on and ctrlqs on their way back to their original position assuming we use this fix now they hit their original position but it doesnt matter as they just ewarp off again proposal 1 5 second time window after coming out of warp where you dont ewarp and you arent invulnerable its a short time so youd have to be fast on the lock and scram but the advantage is that hell come back to the same spot some honest bad connections might get caught in this but i dont think that many especially once people know this rule and learn to be careful about logging back in right away on a bad connectionproposal 2 you ewarp off like normal this still favors the loggofskis but at least this way you know the person is going to stay within 1au of your position and no matter what they will always be returning to the place they warped off from this would increase your odds of probing them down you know about where theyll be and wont allow them to completely escape they can log off and on as much as they want but theyll always be coming back to your spotpersonally i think im in favor of 2 if its an honest disconnect they can stay gone for a few hours and come back after the gatecamp leaves sorry to interrupt your eve time if its a loggofski or a macro they may be safe but it helps your odds a lot middle of the roadeveryone but loggofskis are happy idea
hell im more than happy to just see the issue getting some csm airtime and a memo landing on some overtasked devs deski of course like my soloution and i think it would work but i am gladly supporting others that have cropped up that i think might be better simpler fixes
makes sense
lets fix sentry aggro first
make mining more interactive you shouldnt be able to afk mine the same way you cant afk pvp this would sort out the macros and and then the supply and demand would be back in the hands of the players and not the npcs if they dont remove the possibility of macros then they may as well remove high sec mining from the game completely sorry for making this a macro flame didnt mean to insult the ppl who macro its just that they are the root of all our problems at the end of the day missions are fun and mining is not that is why mining should be more profitable
i would support this provided that you mean stacking them not merely merging the runs in a single bpc as darius said
this would defeat the purpose that invention serves invention requires you to install essentially daily jobs to continue production with ability to merge bpcs you can just merge bpcs into a few 30 day jobs like t2 bpo owners do then go away for few weeksnot supported for this reason
i dont think the games database supports building piles of bpcs and that wont be an easy thing to fix the only way i would favour merging copies otherwise would be to have a mergesplit copies science job that takes maybe half as long as making those copies from a bpo would subject to all the same limits let inventors fix screwups in their runs but dont give people instant changes or anything like that
after logging 50000 mouse clicks unlockinglocking bposi have one bug it wont lock no matter how many votes i put throughtso i tell a gmthe gm tells me how to votei think i know after doing 2000 times i wouldnt have asked them to look at the issue otherwise

ui modding supporteda modding community can adapt much faster to player needs than ccp or any game company ever couldif ccp have to implement ui modifications first they would have to survey the actual ui needs of the community than each idea would have to go through a lengthy decision chain internal testing bug fixing after that it has to be patched to the test server client and if it goes right to tq client having the best ui design team in the world wouldnt make this process much fasteron the other hand if they implemented costumisable ui support in a simple language like lua a small team or a single enthusiast can create an addon test it with some friends and release it if theres a bug theres no long corporate decision chain to go through no patching to worry about after fixing the code you can release it right awayin the long run creating a proper moddable ui would be much less time consuming and produce much better results than ccp playing hitormiss if you want precedent just look at wow look around on modding sites like curse gaming and ask yourself if ccp could create such diverse ui content by itself
the op of the dead horse had a couple of ideas when he created the dead horse from that has come 2 ideas that people in that thread want1 make the pos look right modulation or using plex or mission pos stuff  walls barriers elevators make the pos look like better than a stick with mods floating around it2 is all about pos funcanality having the pos upgradable to make it feel more of a miny station additionally have new moduals and things that can increase the usefullnes of the pos i know that the most popular of the ideas is the first one almost anyone that has seen or works with a pos thinks they look like crap and contray to our wonderful csm who thinks that the looks of the game doent matter i would suggest they go play a space mud i want my game to look good and at one point ccp said that it was very important to them for some reason the decided looking good was only for spaceship and not the posi would like to have the 2 ideas brought up separatly and see if we can get any kind of answer to either
then lets make sure that everyone knows that diedra vaal not only an imbecile but also a sell out  since it is not a job of csm to present their opinions or notions likes or dislikes but those of the electing public what kind of a moron would even say that i mean seriously if any sensible person takes more than 60 seconds to think about that csms statement they would see that they are clearly not there for the players whatever individual csms personal agenda might be  the reason why they were elected was to represent the bloody public the public in this case are the players one might hate the idea or have unfavorable opinions on it but one still must bring it to ccp if the damn public demands it no otherwise it clearly shows that the csm in question discredited themselves since they choose not to represent those who voted for them and hence are an utter tosserplacing a dead horse where it belongs on the front page ccp devs should be ashamed of themselves and some csms too i think a tripy trip to iceland went to some of their little headsreaffirming that csm are there to represent what electorate wants not only their own opinions on the matter also i might actually enter into csm campaign since some of the ers are really ing me off  and would run on two issuesissue one pos  fix fix fix itissue two csm  no confidence vote  to make it possible to kick the csms out of the office if certain amount of support garnered in particular related to cases where csm in question feels that their opinion on the matter outweighs the thousand other opinions  in other words if csm is a prick
i see a whole lot rabble hereso heres where we are standingccp can not justify ripping out the whole pos system to implement it in a modular style it will take a lot of time labour and considerable amounts of pain when the poses we have on tq has to be converted to the new onesso a full reimplementation is out of the pictureccp did agree to looking into the possibility of using this idea for personal anchorable structuresi see a whole lot of waah this isnt good enough raise this to ccp until they agree entirelybut what exactly should ccp say in order to make you happy that is pretty unclear
i would love to see this idea happen it would add an intresting aspect to the game
1 the insurance company is not concord not all corporations abide by the law in eve the insurance company is clearly a neutral entity who doesnt care who is paying them so long as they get paid and they most likely make a profit since an insured carebear ship is very unlikely to die 2 making a real life to eve comparison is silly law abiding citizen and all are you pretending to be a guy who wakes up and goes to work and makes money then comes home and watches tv and goes to sleep and does it again but in space do you want the life of a pod pilot to be comparable to the life of an average citizen in real life its a silly thing furthermore real insurance companies would they insure you for hunting pirates player or npc no no they would not you may think of npc pirates as resources but by your logic youre taking far too much risk intentionally fighting dozens of battleships is about as bad as intentionally getting concord on you the silly nonrealistic eve mechanic of invincible npcs that kill anyone who shoots is the only thing that changes this so if you want realism 1 no insurance for anything except highsec mining or hauling any combat is noninsurable pvp or pve 2 higher taxes for empire protection no npc pirates of any kind in highsec how can concord  faction police destroy any player yet ignore the massive fields of farmable npcs unrealistic nerf it 3 slower concord response concord could not instantly warp in and save the day and would not be invincible it would be possible to escape concord it would be possible to kill concord although youd of course be wanted and pursued the life of a criminal realistic and not a one shot you die instantly 4 all ships would be slowed down exponentially faster than light travel nonsense it should take hours to cross a solar systems because ftl travel is unrealistic the same for communication it should take hours to send someone a message 5 you should actually have to spend time reading long boring manuals to learn skills autotraining is unrealistic 6 you should have a 9999 chance of never becoming a pod pilot and instead being a mindless npc on a planet somewhere who probably works at a burger king see where im going with this eve is unrealistic intentionally so unrealistic things make the game fun insurance is a game mechanic not a real insurance company if it was real youd have to spend months arguing in court that you deserve the payment youre guaranteed by contract only to get half as much as you deserve concord would not be instant youd probably not be a pod pilot youd spend years to move from one system to the next there would be no highsec pve and highsec mining would require you to get government approval to harvest the resources but eve is not life on earth its silly to think space inhabited by immortal pod pilots is going to function like a 20th century western suburb
supported insurance sucks whats the point of pvp when there is little to no isk risk to doing it
i agree i can honestly lose about 4bs a day for a week and still really not feel the wallet pain because of insuranceas it stands i fly faction fit and that is still pretty cheap current claymore setup costs 700m i went from 45m to 700m in a week of mission running was sick from work p a normal schedual of isk whoring for me would take about 225 weeks of slack mission running to fit a 700m isk shipthe risk is just not there any more the only risk is really in t2 ships and that said making 150m on a sunday afternoon is not that hard
nerf concord about 5 times over and then sure after the last concord boost not a chance
thisso no
not to support suicide ganking but from a logical standpoint the insurance company  concord not all factions and corporations work together just because theyre npcs so really the only question is how much risk a pilot is to insure and if were going to go that route any pvpers will have insurance voided for engaging in combat pve mission runners same thing anyone who jumps into lowsec or 00 yep a miner who kills a few rat frigates in a belt risked his ship no insurance if you try to compare a pod pilot to a normal person youd have to assume theyd be in prison for life theyd kill thousands of crew by killing a single battleship but really pod pilots are above the law only concord polices them effectively and since concord isnt the insurance company and concord jurisdiction only covers pod pilots ie they cant arrest corporations who indirectly support criminals well you get the idea basically imagine youre insuring your car except youre an immortal who is above the law and youre insuring a spaceship that could wipe out a moderately sized city on a whim also you can probably afford to buy your own city and blow it up just because you can do you really think a mundane car insurance company is going to have the same policy as a company that insures spaceships to be used in combat with other spaceships and again low sec status means concord and faction police dont like you if youll check the mails pend insurance company is the name not concord insurance
mmmmmm wasnt comparing insurance in rl with every scenario eve has to offer ffs as far as insurance gos anyway you would be wrong as insurance is based on risk and if the element of risk is sooooo great the co wont insure ie self destruct and loss of a ship through criminal acts
 solution is resourcefriendly needing only 15bit of information per ship from the serverwhat if you have a slow computeri myself like this ida but my computers slow as 
maybe the mission runners should salvage before they leave not after salvaging mechanics are fine its just the people who think its reasonable to abandon their salvage and have it still there waiting for them later who need to adjust to reality
oh man my bad i was replying to another post that i though was in assembly hall but plainly wasnt this means that somewhere i have waxed lyrical the praises of someones idea when i intended to post what is above tabbed browsing full of pitfalls for the drunk or simply stupid
you are aware that mazilliu was just being sarcastic right
if it can be permanently turned off maybe not everyone is a miner and wants an annoying sound to play every time they get shot
agreed you do realize that after the eve wormhole closed the settler civilizations collapsed into the stone age for a few thousand years right
i dont know about that im ex military myself every time we went out we were hoping this was the time the enemy would actually show some guts and do something most professional warriors i knew longed for a real battle instead of mile after file if presence patrolsoh well maybe were different in the infantry
while im willing to agree that the audio alert is a bit over the top i think that having a sweeping realtime directional radar is something the game needs not only is it closer to reallife but it could potentially cut down on the constant database calls i dont agree that the status quo is good enough in order for the game to evolve some of these nascent flaws should be fixed the scanning system is pretty much the same as it was when the game was still in beta ccp improved the graphics and the ui i remember when the game used to have some 3d scanner thingie but i think it only used to work for ships in the immediate vicinity ccp dumped it because it wasnt very useful when the overview provided better informationat any rate i give this idea a thumbs up
i can support youre statement fully it is an arduous and meaningless drone task but to automate the scanner is not the solution atleast not the proposed extenti would agree with being able to use the same directional scanner but have it auto run every 24 seconds the player of course would still be required to watch the scanner window for contacts and not rely on a voice telling them not pro automating any task other then an auto repeat for the scanner button
redsplatthis thats been bugging me all day congrats you have managed to grief mewhybecause whilst you may gank someone tonight be that someone looking for a fight or an afkbot miner or a noob that is the player you have met in one way or the otherwhome you have not met yet perhaps as they might make an error or may never meet are those who are engaged in pvp with you before they even undockyes yes i know people say you dont want to get blown up the best way is not to undockbut really when i go into dangerous places i do all of the intel work first before i leave and keep it going during the trip the protocols themselves are draining to say the least but interesting captivating and can be exciting too without firing a shot because a miner hauler or an explorer already pvps but the goal is not to tank and spank its to evade escape avoid what that player plots a course stays aware keeps an eye out for scouts changes course abruptly and all the other tricks they are actually engaged in pvpsure if i step into a boxing ring with gloves on i expect to hit and be hit but is this game strictly a boxing match i can understand that some people get so much of their experience and self esteem tied up in dealing and taking damage that it might bother them to consider another way its like a political party hack who never admits that their candidate was wrong this weekend you might kill a hauler and that will be all you know because you might have caught him off guard or perhaps his ip connection stinks or his kids distracted him what you dont know is that he might have already dissed you twenty times and will diss you twenty more times before he moves on all those other things that dont involve how well your armor resists or how well your guns hit you may be failing at or maybe your scouts are who knows my suggestions for the improvement of directional scanning have nothing to do with making it easier to avoid pvp at all costs hello that is how some people pvp you may have a gripe about someone who simply stays in highsec but even carebears have to compete with each other for belts and business in fact i think being able to increase the range of a dscanner by narrowing the beam would be quite the tool for people on the hunt when i think of improvements i think of everybody because whats good for my opponent can be good for me too and for everybody
well agrued and reasoned it rather interesting i suport direcional need some tweaking
the thing is the real world doesnt have to put up with server lag id support changes to the directional scannereg longer ranges at narrower angles like you said but autoscan is just not possible and the devs have said this before
at the moment webbers have a positive effect they massively increase the ability of a ship to get into warp a freighter with a rapierhuginn in support can get into warp in less than 3 seconds instead of the normal 37s max with v 73s max with 0in realistic terms yes i know its a game a freighter would not benefit from being slowed down and currently they warp so fast that they often enter warp side waysin addition in pvp a target may get away just because the webber got lock milliseconds before a warp disruptorfield could take effecti propose a change to webbers instead of reducing max speed it should affect either propulsion strength hidden value so it takes longer to accelerate andor inertia modifier this would make webbers do what they were intended without the positive effectships should still have to reach 75 max speed to warp they should just align slower andor accelerate slower to balance it it could also reduce max speed but not to the amount it is currently doingprosfixes the broken game mechanicmakes webbers more usefulremoves freighter blitzkrieg jumpingconsmakes webbers into miniwarp disruptors by delaying alignment and reducing accelerationremoves freighter blitzkrieg jumping
i dont think that webbing freighters is that terrible a mechanic and i dont think that your fixes would actually work propulsion strength isnt implemented and changing the inertia modifier wont actually web people in any sort of way anyone would recognize if this is a problem change the align mechanics not the webs
in realistic terms a stasis webifier is curving spacetime so that an objects actual velocity remains the same but its relative velocity is lowered tldr assuming its going to work like throwing a net on someone to slow them down is a bit silly as warp is also an effect of altering spacetime one would assume the two would have some effects intended or otherwise on each other why shouldnt there be a way to assist slower gang mates getting into warp
um no support you would nerf the ability for freighters and orcas from getting into lownull sec at all and if you seriously cannot contend with onetwo dudes webifying the freighter kill the dude shocking also your change wouldnt happenisaac
rofl no the slower the ships go the more they can benefit from their agility thus the tighter their turning circle becomesput it simply  orbit a can in an interceptor at 500m on full base speed you have more ability to make use your agility so you stay relatively close pop your micro warp drive on or heavens forbid overload it your agility remains the same but its insufficient to keep a tight turning circle at high speed also dont forget about inertia all thats happening with the big boys is theyre able to align on a penny turning like theyre on caterpillar tracks travelling in opposing directions instead of travelling aroung a planet at speed with front wheel steeringyes it may seem silly but in effect its literally exactly what is happening
they are freighters in an ideal world they shoul have to be vulnerable and to be escorted along trade routesi dont support ops ideai do support changing webs to massively decrease acceleration but not max speedif anyone cant understand how that would effect the game then get your head out of the sand
escortedlike with frigates and recon ships
of course as scoutsbut furtherlike with a fleet prepared to duke it out with a gatecamp to get the freighter through safely or hold down each gate ahead and behind on the jump route and actually protect the freighter as opposed to using scouts and silly stasis web mechanics to instawarps your freighter sideways across the galaxy
are you saying your gate camp cant kill a huginn or a kestrel or target a freighter in those three seconds its not like hes fitting stabs after all
haha oh yeah id like wis now not in 2017
might as well support my own topic
yes please
i disagree dav i think the csm exists to bridge the gap between player base and ccp not focus exclusively on gameplay issues which this arguably is by the wayand as it is as obvious as ebank was a bit of a scam i agree with the original poster in the matter of harsher punishments for rmt
all parts of the game are part of csm purview if you need an example look how the csm was involved in both the pos exploit and the alliance disbanding thing however in both those cases ccp requested to discuss them with the csmas part of our trip to iceland there is a day before we start discussing raised issues used for information and general discussion between csm and ccp in the past it has been used to brief csm on the pos exploit situation the apocrypha expansion how gms go abou ttheir roles within the petition system and a new qa testing system they were looking to implementid be more than happy to formally ask ccp to spend part of that day on rmt and its consequences if they are interested in hearing the csm thoughts on it personally i think that would be a better avenue for discussion on this topic as a simple we want moar people banz0red issue would not really help us to understand why there seems to be a flexible banning system for rmt nor would we be able to understand the background behind why that system exists and in what circumstances it is appliedif that is cool with you guys im happy to bring the question up at csm level and if those guys agree we can ask for the info session
i think it would be good if rmting doesnt just result in the actual rmting account being banned but also all other accounts held by that same personthe problem is how can ccp determine that the same person is behind two accounts with absolute certainty so that innocents dont get their accounts banned because they look like alts of the criminal
i think you definitly should do that omber to clarify what the policies are and how and to what degree they are enforcedfirst thing one could do is check the name and addresse of the rmt account and ban all accounts that match kind of obvious i would think p
i love you

not an fw player and dont even bother following it but i read about this in the warfare forum why is it players should even have to put up threads like this ccp creates a major upgrade in the game and then when thousands of players get into it they screw it up majorly and act like it doesnt matter it matters fix this before it goes any further ccp the people earned the medal whether they met the arbitrary date you pulled out of your  or not
what kaylan said
i concur with kaylan as well
not trying to say you cant voice your opinion but with all nonsupports i had let this thing slide off onto the second page it was well on its way to the graveyard when you decided to bring it back for some reason tip if its a bad idea and is on its way to obscurity best to just let it keep heading that waythanks for takng the time to read the idea though
the they should make bumping proper meckanick and give bumping a revamp a domi that crashes into you at 1000 ms should scratch your shield
5 words 4 numbers jita 44 station undock
an update making it so that it would be possible to veiw the actual isk amount of insurance along with insurance level platinum ect would be usefull the price you pay for a ship at a particular moment in time influences the amount insurance costspays out being able to see that would be usefullon a related note the ability to veiw how much you payed for an item would be very usefull as well i like many i think have one main station with a lot of items and knowing how much you payed for an item a month ago without putting it into a note is impossible trading would be a lot easier if i knew if i was making a profit off this old item or if it was actually worth less now
id support the insurance mails having isk figures in them as for how much you paid for an item go into your transaction history and search for the item type adding it as actual info on the item is just completely impractical and as a word of advice on your trading  once youve bought it it doesnt matter what you paid thats a sunk cost your goal is just to sell it for as much as you can
you dont offer a single reason as to why though so no
yeah this basically its my favourite storyline
the op is suggesting that people shouldnt be required to log on to eve at 4 am as soon as down time ends
thanks for the support uronksur im glad you understand what im talking about rather than diverting the issue
yeah i know i get it from my own scanning experiences i just fail to see a problem last night i hit a new system dropped a deepspace probe two signatures and an anomaly this was 910pm cst 8 or so hours till server down thats hardly logging in just as the server comes up with 23rds of the day gone i have plenty of new stuff to find
id so go for that

you have a point the sp requirements make joining a good corp nearly impossible for new players of course unfortunately ccp cant do anything about that
so wheres my cool cyno effects huh huh
i never said vengeances were bad bud i said a rocket vengeances dps is blatently terrible vengeances are awesome just fit 3 guns on them your flavor blaster lazors autocannons you will kill stuff faster once rockets are fixed i doubt ill fly much else unless money is tight and if it got a 4th bonus lets hope for balances sake its not another tank bonus

foolish bob you sexually assaulted my jaguar a few weeks ago in 00 
1 agreed that it will not prevent neutral rr that is not the purpose of the proposed change rather it means that neutral rr has consequences ie you cannot just jumpdockundock etc with impunity  after you start repping and involve yourself in a fight it commits you for a time2 i see no problem with rr bs gangs needing to wait out an aggro timer before jumping3 stay far out from the fights and aligned to a ssthats fine a t1 logistics will instapop if any good bs pilot shot it  and not rep enough to meaningfully influence the fightcan you elaborate on this how would people remote repping a friend in a mission be significantly harmed by not being able to dockjumped for a minute
articulated my thoughts precisely supported
irrespective of it being a problem or not it is a massive change in game mechanics that needs looked at in its own right and not something that can be blithely ignored as a minor consequence of nerfing neutral rr 60 seconds is a long time if youre being pounded by an enemy fleet and have got no rrthey wont be i mentioned mission runners in the context of finding alternatives to the aggression timer solutionthe problem is one of neutral rr being invulnerable so there may be a solution involving rr becoming an aggressive act unless you are in fleet or some other device however ive not managed to think of anything satisfactory that would cure the neutral rr problem without having knock on consequences elsewherei support the idea of removing the neutral rr i win docking button but the exact mechanic and consequences need more thought
how is it a massive changeit wouldnt be a new change as far as i can tell aggro flagging has been around for a long timethe only thing massive about it is now it applies to players who are providing rr support whereas before it didntthe effects are well understood everyone needs to adjust accordinglyim thinking you have a fleet of rr alts that you dont want nerfed
i was completely lost in the beginning of my eve career i didnt skill train i didnt use the free implants from the n00b missions i didnt even mission i made all my initial isj by ratting in hisec belts and i only started missioning after getting my thrasher but the thrasher proved to be the one ship that at that low level could really do all i wanted i could go ratting in losec and with t2 arties and t2 ammo and sensor boosters and an ab could orbit cruiser rats at 40kms and could salvage the rest no problemthe wake up call came as soon as i started playing against real players or higher level missions the thrasher got thrashedwith an alt i eventually tried a coercer and promptly ran out of cap and then a catalyst and ran out of grid the cormorant makes a good salvager as it has a larger bay than the thrasher but thats about itthe destroyers need to be in all aspects between frigates and cruisers they need one less turret and one more midlow slot there were there is currently only two they need to lose the 25 rof penalty and they need the sig radius reduced a bit a t2 combat version would be nice as well
i like the idea of dropping the rof penalty while dropping to 6 guns and gaining another lowmid slot that also takes care of the fitting problem on the catalyst i would however prefer a 3rd mid slot to a 4th low slot as that gives you the option to fit a web or cap booster to power a repper in the lowsthe main problem i see with destroyers though is the ease with which they die lowering the sig radius will help a lot against larger ships but iirc they got left behind back when all ships got a significant hp buff bring their ehp up 2025 so they actually have more tank than say a cov opsi also really like the idea of adding a tier 2 variant as well as a t2 version that is meant as a t2 anti frig platform instead of a bubbler

nothing to make it easier for carebears real carebears dont go into the dangerous places anyway thats why they are carebearsbut those who want to go for exploring and the extra benefit of a risky mission need better tools it would not be good to see the directional scanner go and hope this is not the case but it takes patience to use that and since the missions are always the same old fly around and fight for 3045 minutes the pirate or ganker has all the time he needs from this point the laws of economics  which is why missioning in lowsec is breaking under this  take over yes even if low sec missions are boosted or lvl 4 moved to lowsec losing more isk worth of ship running them and the lost time of not being able to complete them will drive off even the most motivated noncarebear as he runs out of money there is also the option of loading the mids with eccm kiters using drone boats or missiles might get away with that if every mission was warp to something other than zero which is not the case with deadspaces otherwise it wont be possible to survive that mission without hardeners or having more than 6m skill points i know the other snide remark is well just dont go alone that really means well get divorced quit your job get rid of your kids and live in your mothers basement and play eve for 20 hours a day with others just like you even a faction warfare fleet takes more time to organize than that what most people have time to play this game daily perhaps we need more exploration survey hacking and courier missions too that dont require a long stay in the first place thumbs up

if i might point out that this solution while being the simplest it implement would in effect dumb down mining negativelyif the original suggestion was adopted i myself would prefer to have multiple ore veins an asteroid as apposed to all minerals possible out of an ore refine as the former requires that a miner make a choice about which crystal to use and which vein ore to mineideally a survey scanner would be adjusted perhaps through focused  area scripts so that it could scan an individual targeted asteroid and listed the ores available which can then be separately targeted for mining a bit like station service icons that can only be targeted through the survey result screenif you didnt scan a roid then the miners just grab a random chunk of ore which happens to be in a roid with the likely inefficiency received if you happen to be using the wrong crystalalternatively you could introduce standard t1t2 mining crystals that just give a basicaverage bonus to any ore so that you can still strip mine belts if you wish grabbing random ores each cycle until all deposits are goneadmittedly mining specific ships may need to get their midslots adjusted to accommodate a survey scanner which may end up being mandatory on these ships but thats a fine tune idea for development

somehow this was brought and voted on by the csm yet this thread itself doesnt even have close to 50 supportnot wanted
a whole lot of waah what you mean the first csm your csm didnt bring this idea to ccp through the proper channels and discussion like you said you would you mean how it was promised that it would go to the ccp meetings and was forgotten how about how it didnt even get on the list the 2nd time and you guys made a bunch of lame excuses and said you talking about it for like 5 min outside of the official discussions what about the crap name it was given and the crap the csm thought we wanted did you guys even read the op judging form the info in the wiki you didntthis idea is only 4 months younger then you are and has huge support i dont think asking ccp to do it regardless of the work involved is out of the question and if ccp disagrees then fine how about telling us why its out of the question not a 3 word its to hard from csm on ccps behalf i would have left the idea alone if the csm took it to ccp in official channels in the meetings with ccp in iceland that would have been it for me but the crap you guys pulled didnt represent this idea the way it should have and this topic wont go away till ccp acknowledges it and gives a response or eveonline closes its doors
lv you have broken promises when you were a csm on this issue you tried but you did not do your utmost some of it might have been the nda with which ccp pretty much controls the csm some of it may have been the dontrockthe boat attitude you have adopted once ccp told you no after csm  i would say misrepresented  the issues community has with the pos whatever the case may be water under the bridge now to answer the sensible question  since i see you seem to really want to obfuscate the issue  you learn quickly yonginbut what exactly should ccp say in order to make you happy that is pretty unclear1 when csm brought a 4yearrunning at the time 3yearrunning issue to ccp they should have presented it as what it was a pos upgrade and overhaul a comprehensive one not a funky pos idea on which ccp and csm barely spent any time  as we now know and were not told at the time 2 taking into account the sheer length of time the request has been standing csm should have pushed for a comprehensive developer blog on the issue when we had the massive qa session on forums  by ccp zulupark barely touched itto summarize for those who would wish to cover their arse and say things are not cleara comprehensive developer blog taking into account the 4 years worth of discussions on the pos improvement do not have to take it all in  you know it might be too much of work for ccp and csm  but most salient points would be enough a blog that will cover and show appropriate respect for the community that has been begging and crying for this change to the way pos system currently works we do not want the pos to be the ugly step child that ccp barely acknowledges it has been way too many years that this has been going on this blog should clearly take into account most supported suggestion outline a course of action or course of possible action it should explain in no uncertain terms the work that will go into implementing the requested changes and tell the players if ccp actually devoted any time other than maybe 8 manhours to the feasibility study on this thing clear enough yesnoi know the blog would have to be huge but i am sure ccp zulupark can manage it
just a few comments on this1 i like the idea i think its great i always have2 ccp while much more flexible now is still a slave to its art department this means that anything that involves major art assets like this is asking for are only put into consideration as part of a major patchexpansion that consideration is then looked at as to how important it is relative to everything else they want to do3 wis is completely separate and not part of the overall pool of things to consider4 as has been previously mentioned in here in the past ccp has considered sov overhaul mining revamp lowsec revamp bountyhuntingmerc system wormholest3 as more important major items than a pos overhaul5 also as already mentioned because this was raised with ccp already and did not have a conclusion csm automatically discuss it again with ccp in our trip to iceland as part of a review of previous issues it does not need to be raised again6 part of this proposal was being looked at to be included in personal player habitats that is still on the drawing boardso from here all i can do is say that csm can question the importance of this overhaul in relation to all the other things ccp want to do and possibly bump it up the timeline of when it would be implemented that will happen its just a question of where in the pipeline it ends up after that discussion
it did go to the ccp meetings it did go through the proper channels unless you can prove that it didnt i suggest that you stop making such outrageous claims how about it didthat you need to talk to jade about but really the ccp guys knew about this proposal waaaay before the csm was even createdthe current csm not the original launch csm how can a name change anything about that nice argument but flawed due to the fact that i created this character as an alt character quite a bit after i started eve that was done due to the oversight by the secretary it wasnt taken to iceland sadly
ok so when is this going to happen in other words when will you be talking to ccp about the pos overhaul again and while you at it you should explain to them the degree of frustration many of us are experiencing with the pos  especially when we see it being ignored year after year after year after year although csm does assure us that everything is ok and ccp knows perhaps a developer should address the four years of pent up frustration with a blog to which we can point which we can examine with which we can argue  you know in case they will treat us like idiots and say thing like we do not have art but we point to the l4 missions and poss there and say yes you do sir
i dont blame you personally but the csm as a whole the only reason i direct anything towards you is because at the time you were the major csm member supporting this ideaand despite the fact that you feel this has been raised the fact that people are still signing this post and the other 2 says that others on the forums agree with me that this needs to go back to ccp and be if anything pushed againmy replies in bold
cool then you gave a thumbs up i do understand this completely and while i do understand it i have to say trinity apoc both got huge gfx and art changes i dont think its asking to much for them to make new models for this seeing as almost everything else in game has new modelsi agree that saying we want this over wis doesnt change anything i also understand that it has its own set of devs and doesnt effect the rest of eve development at this point when considering priority i think ccp might consider what the player base is asking for the most and most consistently sov being up this winter this would make a nice summer expansion for next year or even next winter doesnt really matter when it happens poss have been the same since poss came out for the most part sure they added arrays and the like but thats not an update but an addon i myself and many others believe its time for poss to get some love too i myself disagree with that as to many others who feel that the idea was misrepresented and not shown any consideration or even studied properlyin addition i havent seen any other posts in the iceland meetings about this idea aside from funky pos idea and that was a joke of a job done by the first csm i will admit i am pushing this idea very hard but thats only because its the only great idea for pos revamp and bar myself or someone else writing one better ill support the one that fits the bill the best what we want is meaningful pos reform poss that work well are easy to use dont look like junk in space this idea fits the bill so its pushed propose a better one or have ccp clue us in on what they are doing about the issue and the subject can droppushing pos reform is something a majority of the players that use poss is interested in and anything you or the current csm can do to push that cause will make a lot of pos managers and techs very happy keep in mind that poss even if they dont control sov after the winter expantion are still the logistical backbone of every major alliance and any corp hoping to build t3 and profitable t2 itemssomething that effects the eve markets and game in general so much really should be considered a fairly high priority just because it works doesnt mean leave it as is its 12 broken and buged to death time to step up and fix it

just to be clear mostly for the guys quoting me i completely agree that this is an important thing poss are unwieldy ugly and a pita im more than happy to push a pos revamp as part of the expansion post november but other csm delegates may think other things are more important thats their prerogativepersonally im of the opinion that since ccp are already looking at sov  00 a pos revamp would already be in the pipeline for an expansionpatch depending on the outcome of the sov00 expansion pushing this as an option for that revamp in part or in whole would be better timed now than it was previously
i support the cause
define a criminal act something the amarr empire declares is illegal what if the insurance company does not agree with amarrian law laws vary from empire to empire various items are legalillegal at different levels something that concord declares is illegal not all corporations have good standing with concord this is not real life law will not be universally agreed on as for risk fighting armed gangs of criminals alone in deadspace seems a bit risky no so why should pve get insurance and again eve is not reality insurance is a game mechanic not a business say that with me game mechanic game mechanic game mechanic you know like shooting energy across space with an energy transfer and creating more than you sent violating the laws of thermodynamics or never needing fuel for subcapitals or faster than light travel or implants which somehow effect the integrity of your ship or oh invincible npcs which have a 100 chance to kill whoever attacks you people treat suicide ganking like its self destructing ones ship to make a kill logically it should not be this way its only suicide because people whine so hard that they need invincible npcs who never fail to protect themand you have invincible npcs which kill anyone who shoots you and yet youre still whining that the other guy without the army of invincible npcs is at the advantage do you have any idea how pathetic that is yeah yeah their ship is cheap etc etc etc i get it but if you get killed in a matter of seconds to an insurance fraud fitted tech1 ship methinks youve done something wrong maybe just maybe when a gang of thoraxes warps into an asteroid belt you should warp out for a real life comparison lets say you see a group of people screaming and waving guns do you a leave b sit there and say there are laws here nothing can go wrong  for all the whines about realism no one addresses how overpowered the police are when they arrive in seconds and never fail to punish the suspect so ill echo someone else remove insurance for concord but make concord slower escapable fallible destructable etc highsec is not meant to be safe only a bit safer
it doesnt matter either way to be honest because some of us have figured out how to make high sec a very dangerous place for anyone who resides there with current high sec mechanics
no i only support the complete removal of insurance leave as is or get rid of it completely just to shake things up a littlebut seriously no
im sorry but the statement that the insurance company  concord is completely untrue insurance is payed out by the company called secure commerce comission and that corporation is in fact a member of the faction called concord assembly just right click on an insurance evemail and select show info and you will see that this is the case
incident description1 assume highsec space the attacker and the defender are corp mates2 the attacker is actually a traitorgriefer and starts shooting the defenders ship3 the attacker gets repair support from a different outofcorp character in a logistic ship 4 the defender can only attack the logistic ship by breaking the law and triggering concord punishment even though the support is involved in the fight by repairing the attacker5 the defender losesargumentsthe problem i would like to highlight is that the supporter could only be attacked by clicking yes on the concord notification and that means getting destroyed one way or the other even in low security systems still you lose securing standings by attacking the supporter although the support is directly involved into the fight by repairing the attacker he does not have to commit to it ie he cannot be attacked the csm has stated before that they acknowledge the principle where the remote support must commit to the fight in the same way a shooting attacker does without destroying the support ship first there is realistically no other way such battle against a traitor can be won to give a very real life example this would be like banning you from shooting the driver of a car where the front passenger is firing on you with a machineguni actually believe this incident should be considered an exploit since it can be compared to the following gank exploit used in the past1 the attacker starts supporting remote repairing shield transferring  the defender2 the attacker then shoots anything law protected another player station mission gate  3 the attacker gets destroyed by concord yes but4 the defender being supported gets destroyed as well since the support act of the attacker made him an instant enemy for concordit is hard to understand that it used to work this way but it does not work the other way around to the present day in the latter case supporting implies inheritance of the aggression flag to the supported whereas in the first case supporting does not imply inheritance of the aggression flag to the supporter i am sorry but that just does not make sense you probably think hey but they are corp mates so no aggression is involved that could be inherited in the first place well come to that in possible solutions as that is just a minor technical issuewhat i would like to point out is that i accept corporate treason is a valid game tactics following the sandbox paradigm and of course the ceos or hros of corporations be it highsec or established in 00 need to screen new applications strictly nonetheless once the traitor shows his real face he and his outofcorp support should have to commit to the fight and face the consequences of that in the same way the attacker doespossible solutionsas it is today every character supporting an attacker by any means remote armor repair shield transfer energy transfer tracking link etc inherits the aggression flag now i acknowledged further up that no aggression is involved when two corp mate fight thus some aggression needs to be introduced here yet being suppressed by the fact that attacker and defender share a corporation any other pilot inheriting that flag would not be covered and hence the aggression would be visible of course not in a way that concord would interveneplease do note that i wrote this knowing that my losses caused by an incident of this sort will not reimbursed and i invested my time which i paid for to play eve to gain nothing at all because my money was all in my ship i know this issue is a highsecyoung corp problem but i will not engage in any discussions that the current system is fine since that can only be argued by the current abusers of it any feedback on where i missed possible exploits or downsides of the solution is highly welcome
never fly more than you can afford to loseas to the rest get a better corp
shooting corpmates is legal and rring someone who is doing nothing wrong will not give you an aggression timer i dont see any plausible fix to this mechanic be more careful with your applicants
i am sorry i was talking about real money not isk by that i meant that i am losing my time here writting proposals to get the kind of responses like yours is i would like to ask you to stay on topic and post feedback to the solution i suggested
then make a proposal that is less whine deal with the fact that you got killed and pick better next time
in my opinion ankhra is pointing out a real flaw in rr mechanics since he referred to that one exploit in his op and given a number of past csm issues 1 2 3 we know that in the past already a lot of the rr logic needed to be adjusted in terms of aggression and other penaltiesif you subtract the whining about his personal loss i think it is valid to demand that the remote repper needs to commit to the fight in the way that he becomes shootable by the defending corpmatehershel  if the attacker does nothing wrong by shooting his corp mate no wrong is done either when  including the suggested fix  the repper starts flashing to the defender if the defender is fine with being shot at he will not exploit the fire clearance on the remote repperand given that the remote repper actively enters into the fight different to the exploit mentioned this fix is not exploitablei will take this to the csm assembly
i hope that the result from csm meeting will be positive to fix the issue where people counting in the dinamic of fight are pretending that their involment in fight is nonexistant and the reality is sadly different

the exact reason it shouldnt be
currently there is a technique being used in low sec to probe mission runners which circumvents the steps required to properly probe someone down combat probes are supposed to be used to probe ships this isnt the case players are learning to use the directional onboard scanner to probe ships to within 1 au why because using the directional scanner does not send any alerts that a ship is being probed and it can be just as accurate as using combat probes themselves once a ship has been probed with the directional scanner the player only needs a warpable 100 hit to warp to the target this is the only reason combat probes are needed and this for only around 6 secondswhat this means is that if i am missionrunning in low sec with a neutral in the system even if i am alert spamming the scan button every 30 to 60 seconds my chances of detecting any combat probes in space are slim to none i will say that i am usually aligned to station in case my mission does get busted but my concern is once the mission is busted profitability hits the floor in low sec there should definitely be more risk than high sec but the new probing system has decreased the profit or rather the profitability of low sec substantiallyask yourself this is using the directional scanner to probe players down an intended game mechanic should the combat probes primary function be to simply spit out a bookmark should a low sec mission runner be expected to spam a button and sort through results every 5 seconds to increase his chance of survivability in low sec does this sound like intended game mechanicsthis is not an issue of my ship being destroyed or being podded i expect this to happen every now and again however this is an issue of being able not just to survive in low sec but also make a better living there than in high sec since the directional scanner is no longer effective for a mission runner my pve ship spends more time docked which means zero earning potential in low sec as an example think of the following scenariofor a 45minute mission in low sec and near a celestial object since most missions occur near celestial bodies and with even one neutral in the system it would require a mission runner to smash the scan button and go over results 12  45  540 times in addition to the pilot having to micromanage his ship i ask that any csm reading this brings this issue up to ccps attentioni have created a thread in eve general discussion forum if you would like to read further click herethanks for readingedit corrected grammatical errors
welcome to directional scanner operation 101 working as intended
it bites of course but im not sure what you can really expect if you cant secure the system youre missioning in an insecure system have fun with that
this has been functioning correctly for as long as i can remember i believe it is working the way it was intended
login attempt 3 workedcurrently the minutes of meetings are not being released ontimethe csm can not function if the users submitting proposals and participating are not informed of the results of meetings in a timely fashionthis lag is creating problemsthere needs to be a limit set on this delay so users can know when to expect minutesif the securtary cant handle it then someone needs to be appointed who has the time for the job
id like to see it be faster but you cant expect hard limits on this  rl intervenes ndas intervene and random assorted crap comes up if meissa is the bottleneck here then replacing him as secretary might be the solution i dont know but its entirely believable that the problem is somewhere the csm has no control over
believe it or not eve players often have lives i know silly isnt it how they think familys are more important than internet spaceship and real money actually matters
perhaps using a freighter as an example was a bad idea this proposal is not about freighters its about a game mechanicif propulsion strength is not used then a webber should affect inertia modifier insteada poster above said that slower ships should turn quicker that poster has forgotten the rules of momentum and inertia also centrifugal forces within a structure something that is a mile long weighs 820 million kg and rotates at 120 degrees a second or 20rpm is going to create massives amount of force and use even more energy to do sothe webber in this case creates energy from nothing instead doing its job which is slowing something downedit effectively what i am saying is webbers should not affect alignment time in a beneficial way whether it is the change of direction or acceleration up to speed
we are getting off topic here drop me an evemail sometime
me gives this a little nudge to see who else is interested
supporting because you are on the right track but you dont quite have the right idea 10 seconds is not enough time to make the slightest bit of difference in stopping logoffskies my idea that i have been pushing for years now is that when you try to log off you ewarp to a safe spot and have to camp there for 2 minutes before your ship vanishes you can choose to disconnect and leave the computer early if you want and feel safe but your ship stays put for 2 minutes where it can be probed out and killed if you dont want to take that chance then sit there for the 2 minutes and fight back or try to run if someone finds you im sick and tired of chicken  hostiles just hitting ctrlq the moment they realize that juicy ratter they thought they were going to gank has friends who are coming after him or worse yet entire chicken  fleets logging off when the gates are bubbled and they know they are boned
this would be great 
bah wrong meeting 
bah someone pointed me here for 4 wrong meeting
will definitely supportif nothing else the complete lack of any other assault frigates in almost any fleet i encounter friendly or hostile gives a strong hint that something is wrong
i want my railsniperharpy to be able to alpha pods or at least get the top damage on them
im new here but all the vets seem to talk smack about pos functionality and this seems to address a lot of what i hear
good ideas deserve support
this is needed
and you fail to see the pointit is about balance not economic issues i know how the economy functions very well it is what i do as i have pointed out many times already for the complexities involved in manufacturing the stuff t2 should far surpass faction which can be made simply by running one yes two level 4 mission and supplying a handful of t1 ammoand this can be done in the amount of time it takes to blitz one level 4 mission the production of the ammo is instantaneouseconomically im withdrawing from the argument there t2 ammo is economically viable and indeed more profitable than faction depending on how you value your lp i am only concerned with the stacking nerfs that make most t2 ammo utterly unusableyeah resurrecting a thread that the csms still refuse to take a look at
back to the top though ccp really dont seem to care
all this supportand none of you actually went to the center of a belt to look aroundhint set your overview to show all there is a shoebox sized beacon floating in space im guessing about 2000m away from you select it and look at and youll see its a real objectthe same beacons are at the end of every accel gate and at the warp in of every exploration sitewhile i agree that only substantial objects should decloak you its not a bug
bump for great justicealso why not just go on an aggro fixing binge and fix everything thats currently wrong with aggro timers at present
like showing them for example
not supported
supported some events currently do not refresh the aggression timer visually but internally the timer has been reset this is just wrong if the internal timer says im gonna be flagged for 15 minutes my onscreen timer should reflect thatit says so clearly in the wiki too in a big red boxi think this should be changed
lol this actually explains an entire war
topics are brought to the csm based on if csm members want to discuss them nothing else support is intended as a straw poll of the public on an issue  your support is only directly relevant to the actual csm election a lot of the reason for the low support percentage is because of the assembly hall support mechanic  a thread with debate looks a whole lot like a thread with low support from the outside i support this proposal wholeheartedlyto the point where i ran two csm campaigns with this at the centre of them but this post will go onto the frontpage stats as if i didnt
anything that brings life back to the black opsotherwise theyre a rather useless ship by most opinions
supportedi have no problem with suicide ganking a ship in high sec not my cup of tea but i dont think they should get an insurance payout either
criminal act as defined by the game mechanics shooting a neutral target in high security space for example
just create the mechanics for playerscorporations to handle insurance themselvesjust create an item that acts as a policy that represents the object directly and that each person involved holds that automatically transfers a set amount of isk from the insured to the insurer on a time frame agreed upon by both parties and pays out upon destruction automatically as well maybe even create additional values concerning losses in low sec null sec wh space piracy mining pveing etc that effect the ratesthe policy will always show the date created the object insured and its owner any special conditions cost and payout if the object is traded sold or destroyed an email is generated and sent to both parties describing the event and the policy either pays out and vanishes or just vanishesthe rest of the mechanics are in place to keep track of the insurance records of your clients by simply using the notes section in a players biofile 13 the current insurance almost entirely only keep the current insurance model for players that have the sp boost as to buffer there losses a bit
your error is forgiven no the above idea is not a nerf of ninjasalvaging all it would do is reduce the number of pilots who intrude on missions solely for the salvagebecause they would have another option if you wanted to do it for the sweet sweet tears then nothing would change the idea is for the core scan probes to pick up wrecks not the directional scannerthe idea would actually increase the danger for pilots who turn in their missions and then go back to salvage thats a disadvantage from the perspective of those pilots  its an advantage from the ns perspective i think in the balance the change is worth it for the potential to reduce mission intrusions limiting it to those who harvest tears primarilykrum
sounds cool to me
i suppose my objection here is that you all seem to be trying to balance the game for the vanishingly unlikely case of genuine combat between corpmates involving outofcorp rr instead of the normal state of affairs the other 9999 of the time your solution will cause more problems than it solves even if it does solve this problem
in corp fights between corpmates can serve multiple genuine purpose as corpmates testing their fittings see if it works with different scenarios logistic support is part of the game and each side either willingly or unwillingly high sec low sec 00 can fight according to different mechanics and conditions every side either if they want to fight or not should have a chance to fight back that is fair to either side but to use this non aggresion way with out of corp support that puts a player with a no win situation basically he has a chance to fight back because the mechanics at the moment in this situation puts the person using the tactic in a 100 win situation with the person being attacked with 0 to win and no way to fight back in a fair fight puts an imbalance and favors one side over the other and is simply wrong anyone who is against such change is most likely a person using the method
nopay attention or die
its not a ui designers job to tell you how to play the game thats the job of the forumers and occasionally the balance team and gms its a ui designers job to make it easy for you to play the game however you want this game isnt hardcore because the notification systems are crap its hardcore because you can actually lose your ship for real trying to make this a pvp game by making a crap interface is unnecessary and foolish  game mechanics should be telling me how to play not a godawful interface
this or should is say tat op even has a macro miner name this is better than turning titans into monster trucks
as much as i would love to see this change and that i also find the current system a bit abusive i doubt it will ever change in your favor it will not for the simple reason that theres too many people benefiting from this at the momenti seriously doubt that ccp actually intended us to spam the scan button every few seconds in order to find probes but then ccp is not doing anything toc hange that so it must not be that important to themanyway 15 is supposed to include some fixes to probing and hopefully some tweaking as well maybe they will do something about this
the only thing that is wrong with the current system is the lag that keeps us from scanning you without getting aggro versus ccp again
just to clear up some misconceptions you seem to be havingthe directional scanner has always been used to find ships probing is an additional step required if the target ship is in mission ds or safe spotany ship at a celestial location starplanetmoonbeltstationgate can be found exclusivelly by d scanner and it has allways been this waywhat has changed is that probes can be positioned arbitarilly in system whereas previously they could only be dropped at celestials or bookmarks  which were difficult to produce near a random mission locationmission runners allways were scanned out with the d scanner before probing changes but it was usually impossible to get a probe close first time due to lack of warpable point near the targetnowhere is it stated that probes must be used to find ships probes are and allways were a last resort for finding ships ie those in mission dsscanning with the ds is nowhere near as accurate or easy as using probesit takes considerable skill to get probes into the right location on the map just from dscanner results to within 1 auas a hunter you must identify both the distance and direction of the target ship in space view from a known locationthen you have to go to the system map and corelate the space view direction and range to a xyz position in the system map in order to do this you need to reconcile the positions of the planetsgates etc with what you see in space viewthe dropping of probes is an estimated guess at best and getting it right to within 1au would take considerable experience and skillin fact in most cases i dought a range of less than 4au is used for the initial ping on the targetscanning out to a range just below the range to the closest celestial and listing results by range  closest first  will identify any probes at the top of the scanner results  enableing a much faster 5 sec if you want ping timeyou will need to salvage  destroy wrecks in multi room missions for this to workdoing any kind of activity in low sec  running  mining  rattin  exploration  requires either evasion or force to deal with other playersconsidering that solo miningrattin or anamoly expo will result 99 of the time in the loss of your ship  i think mission runners have it easy by comparisonit is always possible to go to another agent and get a different mission to do while the pirate gets bored waiting for you to return to your mission
yes thats exactly what the d scanner is for finding other shipscombat probes spit out bookmarks or provide direct warps yes thats what they have allways done even in previos incarnationsthe results list thing is being attented to by the csm as you well knowall game mechs seem to be in order yes whether they should be changed is debatablefind quiter low secif your running for a highly profitable agent expect competitionrun missions in gangs for protection in numbersthe results list issue is allready on the csm list of thing to bring to ccp attentionas you have previously posted in that thread before the op of this post i guess you allready know thisso why this thread 
ifs funny how the only ones who have anything against this proposal are the ones benefiting from this loophole
there is no loopholedscanner remains unchangedprobes got a buff which makes them easier to use on specific locations of space however identifiedi support the probes checkable issue for which there is a thread which doesnt insinuate issue with the dscannerlow sec is supposed to be dangerous its not supposed to be 2x iskperhour highsec for whoever chooses to go there
this is how the d scanner is supposed to be usedplease think about playing another game if you dislike pvp
loophole the directional scanner is clearly designed for identifying objects and ships in space the direction and distance i mean directional is in the name it has a distance modification tool right there in the interface what loophole
lol what kind of problems are being caused exactlyyou will survive waiting
service with a smile
the rule for the control tower is always one big problem i have had one idea and i hope its will be possible to use them without make a lot of modification in the game playthe idea its the possibility to create some group of user in this group you can put the character or corporation or allianceif you are in this group you have the full right and the module that use this ruleexemple i create one group my farmer inside i put farmer x characterfarmer y charactercorp the farmer corporationin the control tower management i use this group for the right on the corporate hangarall people of this group have the full acces at this corporate hangar with a new space inside with the name of the group
this isnt the only thing they need to do with posesgod knows but something in this vein would be a useful part of the change supported
yes please make it more simple i support this
i would really like it if the texture and model for the combat version of each races command ship had its texture and model changed to resemble that of the teir 2 version of the battlecruiser i know there are many out there that agree with me so lets see what kind of support we can get in here
um no make a t2 tier 2 instead thanks
and what do you suggest as a role for this new possible tech 2 ship the problem is is that there is no new real possible role imo
i can think of half a dozen that have been proposed over the years and thats just what ive seen besides what you propose is unnecessary and you cant really find a tiertype matchup for gallente the fleet would be tier 2eos and myrmidon are drone boats for caldari the field would be tier 2drake and nighthawk are missile boats and amarrminmatar have no obvious matchupdamnationclaymore pretty much have to be tier 1 but absolutionsleipnir are also closer to the tier 1 than the tier 2 besides this would be a fairly noticeable mechanical change too  the 510 mil difference is actually noticeable unlike the covops changes a while back not supported
well surprisingly the game has changed a bit over the years so why dont you recall what these were as they may not be applicable anymorealso how is the absolution and sleipnir closer to teir 1 than teir 2 nanocane resembles the sleipnir and the absolution is extremely similiar to the harbinger
personally i think having a concord ships spawning for every entity that is hit with a smartbomb hits etc to be a waste of time in fact having concord ships is a waste of timereplace them with the faction navy and relegate concord to station sweeping make the appropriate storyline changes etc instead of having 10000 ships appear to instantly blast someone have the faction navy appear gradually might be easier on servers too let ships able to warp away from nonscrambling faction navy ships let them suicide bomb in exchange for voiding their insurance giving them a criminal counter and standing hit give the players a change to be the police
all in favor of a free for all on nubs and carebares support this thread
voiding my ship insurance wont matter if i dont lose my ship youre trying to turn concord into a set of gate guns not supported
let the gank begin pirates i can smell rocket fuel in every system with that change let them gradually appear mwuahah i can see a big flaw therei cant see how i can support this even if the insurrance is voided unless they void the insurrance and have to pay for the loss of the other ship they gankedthen yeah sureafaik thats what the police and justice do anywy they charge you for whatever you destroyed
i can see it happen as long as the faction navy always has time to prepare for your arrival on the gates and get sleeper ai hell give them sleeper guns as well kidding oh and they warp after you like concord i think they should be unbeatable but theyll be unbeatable in that whenever you kill a number of their ships a bigger number warps in to reinforce the defense party this happens continuously until the pirate or pirate gang can no longer deal with the faction police which would probably always happen after the second wave of ships warps in make it something like 10 battleships or mix it up i dont care also give the faction fleets web and ewar ships youd have to be really ing dedicated to get 2 or 3 jumps into high sec if faction navies got a big buff
i think not
hersch you cant avoid the faction navy with a gcc long enough to wait it outunless you fancy warping through safes until downtime hits
so the proposal is basically to eliminate insurance no biggie and also to eliminate high sec i predict a bit of resistance to the latter
downtime you warp to a safe or two to wait out the timer and then dock wait 15 minutes for the gcc to clear and youre good to go its a bit more annoying than lowsec but hardly lethal
op was complaining about freighters breaking through gate camps that trick only works if nobody puts a point on the freighter and if nobody kills the webber if your gate camp cant do one of those two things you deserve to get bypassed if the freighter was capable of doing this stuff solo then id agree that there was a problem and be all over trying to get it fixed but the thing is it cant and given the practical limits on webbing freighters into warp i dont believe there are any problems with the mechanic its like theyre encouraging team play in a mmo
webs already affect the agilityand it takes exactly the same time to warp if youre webbed all the time webbed before you started aligningthe positive effect comes in when you align at normal agility for the first couple seconds easily reaching about 1020 of your max speed and you are webbed thenthis means that for example if a freighter max speed is 100 ms just for easier calculationsit starts aligning and reaches lets say 15ms after first 3 secondsnow it is double webbed first web takes the max speed down to 40 ms second web decreases it further to about 20 ms but youre still at 15 ms so you have just reached your 75 of max speed  hence you warpthe problem in here is that the max speed value reduction is instant and the actual speed drops over timeto fix the insta warp mechanic the web max speed change would have to be over time not instant but that would make webs even weaker than they are now
the title of this topic will no doubt make many curious and i dont doubt there will be a debate about this however im proposing a way to give armor a passive regenerative trait like shieldsim proposing regenerative ablative armor plating which has its basis in both scifi and real life currently as things stand the main difference between armor and shield tanking is that shield tanking you have your primary defense after thats gone you have two layers of buffer to get out if you need to which can be setup passively on the flip side with armor tanking you have one layer of buffer before you get to your primary defense and when its gone you have a very small buffer to get out at that point and currently there is no means for a true passive defense with it now ablative armor works through a process of ablation ablation is defined as the removal of material from the surface of an object by vaporization chipping or other erosive processes and is currently used in a few military applications as well as in the space program its extremely useful although can be very heavy in various applications making speed and maneuvering difficult so it is something that can be done and is being done currently the only part that makes this more scifi is that currently we do not have the technology to make it regenerative think of it working like skin cells as old ones fall away from the body the body regenerates more to replace the ones lost only its fullerene an allotrope of carbon even more durable than diamond armor however thousands of years into the future that is eve im sure we would have a way to make it worknow stepping away from the real life and into game terms this module would allow armor to recharge like shields along with a low resistance boost but would be offset by increasing the weight and lowering the agility of this ship equiped with it doing it this way requires an additional skill to train and an equiped module to boot its not a natural regen like shields are the balance with this comes with the weight increase and the agility decrease making it easier to hit in the same way shield boosting items increase signature radius plus the regen rate would be around 6675 of what the max regen of shields would be with maxed out skillsfor exampleregenerative ablative armor i  this module gives a passive repair trait similar to shields to armor plating and a low boost to armor resistances at the expense of increased mass and lowered agility 5 to all armor resists and gives recharge rate to armor to a max of 23 to 34 of what shield regen would be with maxed out skills 10 mass increase and 10 agilitycan only fit one per shipuses new skill  regenerative armor systems 5 recharge rate per lvl this allows a passive recharge rate to armor similar to shields and has pluses and minuses in line with shields with an armor based twist allowing armor tankers the same benefits as shield tankers in being able to have both true active and true passive tanks along with this we can include modules that help with armor repairing and boosting in the same way that shields havefor exampleablative armor matrix i  increases armor repair rate while lowering maximum armor cap 25 repair rate 15 armor hp based off of shield flux coil iablative armor reenforcement i  diverts power from the ships engines to increase the armor repair rate 20 repair rate 35 velocity based off of shield power relay iablative armor accelerator i  improves repair armor repair rate 10 repair rate based off of shield recharger ii want to open the floor for people to share there opinions and any other ideas to go along with this ive spent a few years looking into this and thought it was time to bring it up and see what people think and maybe have something new brought to this wonderful playground that is eve
actually if the armor repair modules are based on nanites you dont even need to stretch the technology very far it would just need a change that as a base line all ships have an xfactor armor regeneration like shields the active armor boosting would then be an increasing multiplicative effect while actively tankingthen you could make other modules like you suggest that parallel the passive shield tanking for armor tankingfor the other issue that you mention where you have for shield tanking and 2 layers after tanking layer there should just be an option for shields  armor  structure or armor  emergency shielding  structure let us choose which gets used first armor or shields
doesnt make fluff sensearmor gets repaired when you repair it not just from sitting still doesnt make gameplay sense and itll never be an interesting fitting option not supported
in case you didnt notice cause it looks like you didnt take something very importantarmor tanker  use med for ewar or something that could help him in pvp and low for defenseshield tanker  use med for defense so that leaves less ewar which means less effective in pvp possible but very poorthat should be a good balance anyway so this idea is not supported armor tanking shouldnt regen imo because of thatand in other words since its that case let shield resist passively only since there numbers are already low anyway if you ask me ccp should increase shield defence since shield tankers cant use ewar effectivelyof course not with every setup or ship im awarre of that
i realize this sounds like a skewed idea at firstbut take a look at ccps own stance on shieldswe dont have big fancy energy bubbles being powered by the capacitorwe have big nasty clouds of nanobots taking one for the teamthe passive regeneration on shields is the capacitor being channeled without your attention into replenishing that cloudall passive armor would have to do is casually recharge the nanobots that wander your hull repairing it when you use active reppers
not supported in general it is easier to get higher resists on armor than on shields that compensates for the missing rechargeyour suggestion would break that balance
im sure you can make it work with the eve fiction but i would like to keep shields and armor clearly different the only reason for this is that i would like to have clearly different styles of gameplay available you idea adds more options in a way but at the same time you water down existing differences since you just copy existing mechanics there might be rl reaons for doing this but i dont put much value on this type or argumentation this is a game and it would be nice if these things are mainly considered from gameplay perspective im not claiming this couldnt be balanced right or would ruin the game but like different weapon systems shields and armor should clearly work in different ways just for gameplay reasons
and we should not forget shield recharge is working on armor tanks aswellthere are even some shield tanked setups for eg myrm which easily can compete with the active armor tank you can get on it 700 dps
wtf armor tanking is already superior to shield tank and you ask to boost it even more
that article is very badly written imho and as far as i can tell written by one of the isd members who has more imagination than sense for realismon the opi think this could be interesting but a possibility of horrendously overpowering armor buffer tanks come looking around the corner with this implementation so no support
v
no armor and shield tanks are supposed to be different
wow no need to even undock spy alts anymore
ccp has done alot to buff the reconcloaky fleets but they left out the ability for high leadership skill folks to have a good impact on these fleets i guess technically you could sneak a vulture deep into someones backyard to support a stealth fleetbut youd be awfully silly to do somy proposal is to commission a new command ship the long range reconnaisance command ship lurks lightly tanked with light offensive power and the ability to fit a covops cloak ii the lrrcs can fit up to two gang modsadditionally the lrrcs can be equipped with a new module1 the command link extender this high slot module allows the lrrcs equipped with it to extend its command bonuses a number of jumps equal to the lrrcs pilots command ship skill level the bonuses will only effect one other system which is determined by the highest sensor strength gang ship outside of the lrrcs piots system but within the cle range up to 3 command link extenders can be fitted to a lrrcsthe lrrcs would utilize the model of the tier 1 battle cruiser one of the other two cs would be redesignated in the tier 2 bc modeloh and no im not suggesting the gang mods should be abe to be used while cloaked traditional not cloaked not warping rules pertain
tldr please put republic fleet target painters into minmatar lp storesreasoningminmatar lp stores are sadly lacking in decent modules empire factions tend to have a selection of best of breed modules in their respective lp stores amarr has armor tanking modules like hardeners and reppers to match the best faction nondeadspace or officer ones like sansha and blood gallente have sensor boosters and tracking computers to match shadow serpentis and they also have arguably the best webber the gallente navy stasis web caldari has shield mods that match dread guristas minmatar have speed mods that match domination each empire faction also has naturally the best version of their primary weapons system amarr  lasers gallente  hybrids caldari  missiles minmatar  projectilesspeed mods havent exactly been popular recently with the errr rebalancing so while republic fleet overdrives afterburners and microwarpdrives are still best of breed eg the same as domination ones theyre a very low demand item domination drops seem to be sufficient to satisfy demand and keep prices low enough to make buying these items with loyalty points unappealing for all but hardcore minmatar roleplayers target painters had long been the lolfit ew with the recent missile changes theyre now actually useful or at least more useful in some situations than other potential midslot items theyre far from overpowered but at least theres a niche for them however the best named painter pwnage has twothirds the cap use and cpu requirement of the t2 painter for the exact same stats the only reason that theres demand for a t2 painter is for ships where fitting isnt an issue and because pwnage drops are pretty rare hence quite pricysince target painting is considered the minmatar ew would it not be logical to give minmatar lp stores a faction painter the stats neednt be excessive to ensure theres demand maybe a 40 or 425 signature bonus compared to a 375 bonus for t2

good point would be nice to get a bit more variety put into each store i may be suffering from a case of the grass is always greener howeverso for approximately 20 million isk worth of lp tags and isk you get a target painter that stacks up the following wayvariant cpu grid effectt1 20 1 3125t2 24 1 375pwnage 16 1 375rf 25 1 32pardon me if im not immediately overwhelmed
youve assumed signature focusing v with all the modules except the soontobeavailable faction module where youve assumed 0 the t2 and pwnage each have an effect of 30 before taking skills into account while the proposed rf module has a 32 effect that means that t2 and pwnage have a skill level 5 effect of 375 while the rf mod has a skill level 5 effect of 40 not drastic but certainly better  which is on par with just about all faction modules

you have to loot at it from ccps perspective not doing anything doesnt do any harm to them doing something means effort and risk of angry threadnoughts from goon style leaders bad press and potential firing of ccp employeeswhy take the risk us players are interested only in one thing  griefing and if theres a chance to grief some ccp employees then it will be taken i wouldnt mind bringing down the guy who crippled eve pvp with nanonerf patch
ive wanted to see decoy drones for a long timeand for everyone else how would they cause any more lag than deploying 5 regular drones does nowits not asking to be able to field 500 decoys each
i like this quite a bit hence the supporti would prefer a slightly different angle however  i would not take the route of drones maybe but perhaps something entirely differentpicture a 5th subsystem type which enables a t3 cruiser to fit a high slot item called something along the lines of a virtual imager im picking a t3 cruiser since enabling it for all ship classes could easily become overpoweredthe virtual imager does pretty much what your drones idea does it fakes visual and scanner signals leading to replicating what is one target into a set of targets of which only one is realgreat as a strategic tool for a fleet
thats a pretty big assumption right there i expect in a snipe fleet fight where other drones are less useful due to range and logistics drones are overwhelmed by alpha damage these mimics would be pretty popular and make the lag horrificnot supported
a week or two ago i started a topic in features and ideas about a potential balanced mechanic that could improve 00 quite a bit feedback was overwhelmingly positive but the thread got buried a bit here is the idea with a few edits ideascriticisms are always welcome most people agree that local in its present forum is inadequate but at the same time the removal of local would lead to at the least spamming of dscanner every 5 seconds shredding the servers here i will present an interesting idea that nerfs the ratter bots but allows nonafk players a good degree of securitylocal would be set to delayed mode like it is currently in wormhole space in addition a new scanning mechanic would be introducednew probesubspace beacon uplinkvolume 1 m3would be used in the current core probe launcherafter launching a probe the player would have a small graph appear on the ui the graph would be scrolling at a certain speed and would display the background noise of subspace beacons naturally because of deepspace interferences the graph would have background noise and the change on the graph due to background noise would be random therefore any vibrations could conceivably be due to natural forces however if a large blob entered system there would be a huge jump on the graph showing the new activity in subspace the amount of jump would be somewhat in proportion to the number of players in the system so for instance a large blob would be unmistakable but would also allow a covert ops pilot the ability to slip though unnoticed due to the combination of randomness and the other players subspace signalsone player entering system would give a bump to the receiver but for someone to make sure that it was not due to random variations they would have to wait some time longer to gather more informationshameless hotlink of a rough descrition of how the scanner would functionplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesthis mechanic fixes the local problem currently while at the same time allows for a degree of security while also allowing scouts in covert ops the ability to scout and stalk large blobs without thier information glaring in localcovert ops ship types would have a smaller impact on the subspace signal here is what i propose should be the effectcovops frig 25 impactforce recon cruiser 6 impactblack ops 1 impact may make it usefull for once
improve scanning to be a fully passive function yesremove local no since improving scanning to be passive function would  local in all regards other than the nice little channel
support removing local or more specifically delaying it but not replacing it with another passive and night infalliable intel toollove random nature of scaner proposed presumably larger ships give greater blips at a given range from probe than others
read his proposla carefullyhis scanner s not omniscient and hence nothing like local
supported for setting local to recent speakers mode and proposing a creative improvement to scanning suggestion  in addition to scanning improvements the ability to see outside a station from inside a station is also probably needed to accompany the change to local
this seems like a good idea you have there but i would still like to see where are they when they enter the system with todays technology anyway like a sonar ie you have a pretty good idea where the object is if that little feature can be implemented on top of yours you got my vote on this one
currently the local channel serves the following purposes tells you who is in the system with you tells you the standing and criminal flag status of everyone allows everybody in the same system to communicate instantly watch for incoming threats based on standing and criminal flag status watch for incoming friendliesnow if we compare this with the proposed solution tells you who is in the system with you  no tells you the standing and criminal flag status of everyone no allows everybody in the same system to communicate instantly yes watch for incoming threats based on standing and criminal flag status no watch for incoming friendlies nothe proposed system will only give you a rough idea on the number of pilots in a system but in order to find more information you will need to dock in each station if any to see who is docked and use combat scanner probes  directional scanner to find who is in space and what their standing is because this system would be too dependent on having a prober at all times in the system with you im strongly against it that would just make it way too easy for pirate gangs to surprise targets in the system without them ever knowing they were even in the systemfor the ones who think that knowing who is in local is not realistic well put it this way every ship had to jump through a stargate to get to the system unless they jumped in using a cyno field that means the stargate would have logs of everybody who jumped in and jumped out logs which anyone entering the system could accessthere is no stargate in wormhole space so it makes sense that you cant see anyone in the local communication channel until they speak since theres no logs to know who jumped in and who jumped outthey could ships that used a cyno field to jump in a system not appear in local until they break silence but anything more than that would break the game in my opinionso basically if you used a stargate to go in a system you will appear in local automatically no change if you used a cynosural field to jump in a system you will only appear in local if you break silence if youre in a wormhole no stargate you will only appear in local if you break silence no change

another bump i know destroyers are small ships and noone cares on them as they arent important butby the way i got advanced weapon upgrades and ftting destroyers is still horrible still every destroyer except thrasher sucks a 3 powergreed implant and advanced weapon upgrades 4 dont seem solve fitting problems on destroyers still they cant have any tank at least i can now fit guns properly wonder if situation will change with the rig patch the sad fact is there isno reason to fly a destroyer it had absolutely no advantage in front of a cheap t1 crouser not even in killing frigates and i agree we should get a t2 version of destroyer that is oriented towards combat supression of assautships and septors
destroyers are supposed to be frigate killers indeed but not t2 frigate killers therefore i dont agree with the op however i do agree that we need a specialised t2 frigate killer with a destroyer hull so i am for a new t2 destroyer leave the t1 theyre fine as they are right now something needs to be done so you have my support

i would love to see this implemented just a few extra divisions would be very handy if ccp also made it so that when you buy something from the marketcontract it takes money from only one division it could help people avoid getting scammed when they click without paying attention checkingsavings account in essencevic
come on guys lets try and keep this on the front page and get those votes in still the best idea since 2006
as it stands the npcs guarding the plexes in fw are severely unbalancedon the minnieamarr front i can speedtank all amarr plexes in a t1 ship because almost all amarr ships are turret based and they just cant hit anything meanwhile the minmatar spawns especially the elites deal heavy damage with their torps and targetpainter combo and are near impossible to tankon the gallentecaldari front the gallente ships suck most of them have blasters and are easily kited and kept out of range plus they suffer from the same hitting problems as the amarr turret ships caldari npcs have missiles which are a lot harder to speedtank but the worst part is their unbalanced jamming they can easily permajam several people at once and since npc ewar doesnt take sensor strength into account there is no way to defend against themwith the fw overhaul coming up ccp should put the fw npcs into review as well

sure why not and then can we get one that is inbetween the inbetween and maybe one that is inbetween the inbetween that is bigger than the other onewhat kind of idiot suggestion is thishow about we get a completely different hauler for each m3 out there stop being lazy peopleoh wait wait can i get a hauler that can jump without a cyno be unlockable have a dd on it rapidly generates isk when i afk makes me invisible in localget a grip people there are more important things that need to be addressed than some smaller than a normal freighter but bigger than an orca garbage
totally disagreefor a few year old vets with 2 accounts both having marauders grinding lvl 4 missions it might be a matter of should i spend 45mill extra on rigs or notfor however another rather large portion of the player base the more casually orientated crowd the question is instead should i spend 45mill ow wait dont actually have that much money to waste nvmfor us the current rigging system does not give options in fact it takes about every single choice i have away because i cant use ccc rigs i have to fill my med slots with cap recharges to become capstable because i cant use damage rigs i have to fill my low slots with heat sinks or gyrostabs to deal ganky damagei would love access to ccc rigs for a decent price so that when fitting my bc i can actually make the choice if i want to use ccc rigs so i can free a med slot for an afterburner or maybe a tracking computer wait even a web could work or i could decide for some armor rigs so i can free up a lowslot and maybe fit a heatsink or keep as it is and benefit from an increased tank maybe ill even go for some weapon rigs to increase my optimal or my damageyou say this system removes choice i say it adds hundredsthe only thing that will come from the change youre suggesting is that richer players will have even more advantages over those that do not spend 16 hours a day grinding iskwhat this patch will do is introduce a more reasonable spending limit on ships it will make it so that you can only spend 10mill on a frigate before it reaches around its max performanceexactly the same as you can only have so many sps dedicated to flying frigates before it reaches its max performancethis patch will not remove choices it will add tons of choices instead of wondering only about what modules to fit you also have to wonder about rigs and how the 2 interactall this patch will do is even out the playing field so that newer poorer players can also enjoy flying rigged drakes into lvl 4 missions so that they also get the joy of flying those 6kms frigates in pvpand for the older richer players it will only make it so that theyll have to spend less time grinding isk and can spend more time doing what they enjoy because the rigs they buy are cheapereverybody wins save for the players that win fights not by skill intelligence or tactics but instead by spending insane amounts of isk on their ships
agreeing with this and not supported
actually the option i gave provides a chance for the less wealthy to close the gap without making everyone equal my system essentially implements meta levels to the system rather than sizes that skew cost want better performance fine pay for it want to just boost your ship a bit fine too but dont cheapen the work of some for the sake of othersi have never understood this casual player arguement im a casual player i dont expect to be as wealthy as some moms basement dweller who plays eve 16 hrs a day what es me off is people who want the easy road to life bc they cant figure out how to make things work faster half the nay arguments in this thread remind me of a thread a while back about 00 income from ratting people were constantly saying 2030 mil an hr is the limit yet i could go out there in a standard t2 hac with a hauler on standby in a station and pull in much closer to 60 mil an hr is it my fault for understanding how to utilize my time to the full benefit over someone whod rather go out there and do it the wrong wayive got alts in newer corps ive got spies in alliances the truth is the guys who complain about being causal players are really the guys who are a too young to know better people who prolly shouldnt be in a battle cruiser less not a rigged ship or b people to stupid or lazy to play this game effectively
i support his first message
i see where youre coming frombut imho youre coming from the totally wrong directionim not saying that your tiered rigs are a bad idea in fact had it not been a replacement for the sized rigs idea i would have definitely supported itbut what exactly is wrong with the sized rigs idea whats so bad about giving poorer players the option to fly the same quality frigates as you canmaking 60mill an hour you can still field rigged t2 equipped bs for pvp while i can not as theyre simply way too expensive you can still field rigged t2 command ships which i cant maybe you can even field carriers or even better i dont know i sure cantwhats so horribly wrong with allowing me to field the same quality frigate as you can why does your frigate have to be better just because you have found a perfect way to rat its not my fault either that i dont have access to your method of rattingi dont want the easy way i dont want t2 fit rigged sleipnirs appearing instead of reapers when i dock in my podi just dont want to have to own a marauder hac cs or whatever and grind rats missions or whatever to be able to field a competitive frigate i want to be able to field a good ship in pvp after 23 months of playing not just throwaway ships for me to learn in until i manage your 60millhr technique after 2 years of playing before i can field a well fit frigatenotice how i said frigate every time i totally agree that its not fair that those who go around wasting time and following cookie cutters not earn the same as people who went out and managed to get real information and tactics first hand and as such should not be able to fit and field expensive ships such as bs cs dreads carriers etcbut were talking about frigates and cruisers here every time i hear pro pvpers talking about newbies they say that you can join from day 1 in a tackling frigate helping out but now that this patch is on the horizon enabling those very same newbies to field more properly fit frigates that can potentially match those of more experienced players we get complaintsplease explain what is wrong with somebody thats at the stage hes doing lvl 3 missions in a bc is able to field a rigged frigate in pvp and im not talking about any kind of diminished meta rigs im talking about full blown rigsfor the coming months i wont be able to field properly fit hacs bs recons etc and probably for the coming year cs carriers andor dreads but id like to be able to field a properly fit and rigged frigate by now

you didnt even mention the worst of the bunch  the blood ships i want them to be awesome but theyre just not heres how i think the five factions lay outsanshas perfect asis needs no changes serpentis just fine needs no changes angels bonuses are okay but ships are a bit weak needs a small buff of some varietyextra turrets increased speedreduced mass somethingguristas the rattlesnake is just a raven with a crappy third bonus nobody uses and its basically the same for the gila and worm id like to see these changed into ships with a role ecmblaster or maybe ecmrail seems a natural option to me  give dps ecm strength and either range or tracking blood worst of the bunch three bonuses with absolutely nothing in common i dont think its actually possible to make a coherent ship out of the blood vessels these days its hard to fix this while keeping true to the blood faction  the best i can come up with is to make the ships base bonus be that it uses the old rules for nossing where relative cap levels dont matter expensive faction ships can be awesome like that without wrecking the game and it gives you a reason to fit a couple nos on your ship and fill the rest with lasery death oh yeah and change the laser bonus away from cap use and to dps maybe even rof to make nosusers even happier leave the web bonus or maybe improve upon itto 30level say you take the bhaalgorn from being a billionisk neuting support ship that cant actually fight to being a ship that does battleship dps steals 20 or 30 cap a second under the old rules and can hold enemies down to leech off of and kill at range with these changes i think the blood and gurista failboats become viable solo ships while keeping a role in smaller gangs as well obviously no faction bs is ever going to do well in fleet combat but i think that these would make them work a whole lot better at the roles where they can actually be used reasonably but yeah supporting some kind of change for sure

the suggested change does not impact incorp fight
i agree with your assumption that the case is less likely though hardly 001 to happen than normal incorp fights does that mean we have to ignore the fact does that mean that all of us have to count on the possibility that any corp member can use outofcorp rr to put us in a no win situation you are suggesting to ignore this unlikely incident in favor of what what is in your opinion worth fixing more in the 9999 cases as you sate than what i proposed in the 001 deparmenti cannot acknowledge your assumption that solving the problem will cause more problems of its own unless you can prove that statement or perhaps you would not mind giving any example of a problem the solution would have caused were it implemented
we are not discussing my ship loss but my proposal to change game mechanics
exlegion confirmed here that it is indeed easy to survive missioning in lowsec without pressing the scan button 12 times per minute i think we can safely assume this issue is settled thank you all for your time and patience
the loophole that lets you bypass the time it would take to localize a target using only combat probes so the target cant see you coming as you are narrowing the strength of the probes to get a lockthe loophole that allows you to pretty much drop 4 probes dead on a target using the directional scanner and get a 100 hit almost instantlythat loopholei know its proper usage of the current game mechanics but thats the problem its pretty much rendering the whole scanner probe concept useless the minigame that probing is has no point if all you use it for is to get a warpable bookmark and that you dont actually have to search for the target what im saying is that probing is supposed to be hard and its supposed to take some time probing has never been supposed to be used like a radar would be used but when used in combination with the directional scanner thats exactly what it becomesas for lowsec space supposed to be dangerous well if you go back several years when eve first started a safe spot was truly a safe spot and knowing how to find someone in space was actually much more work its only afterward that this changed so it could change againits just become way too easy to get a scan lock on an unsuspecting target now with the way the probing system and directional scanner work something has to change it just has to its not balanced at all at the momentlike most people i like pvp but only if i can have some level of control over it having little to no way to see in advance that youre about to be jumped by someone really sucks even if you spam that directional scanner scan button every second you still wont see probes coming when they are used that way what the hell can you do against this nothing right now this system is being abused a bit too muchyou have to remember that this is first and foremost a game and a game is meant to be fun to play when only one side is having all the fun referring to probe gankers and pretty much dictates how the game is played theres no fun anymorebefore the probing mechanics were implemented lowsec and nullsec was very interesting even for the ones who were more casual players or wanted to do more than just pvpingin case you wonder how i can say all this when my character is so young well lookup ehxo in the game that used to be my character and i sold it a few years ago i played eve when it first started for a little more than 1 year starting in open beta and it was a whole different ballgame back then you had no probing then and you only had some basic form of the directional scanner for some reason life in lowsec was a lot more fun in some aspect because of it i was also in a pirate corp m3g4 and i can tell you it was a lot harder to be a pirate back then than it is todayanyway all im saying is that the current way scanning has been implemented needs to be revised so that its a bit more balanced the prey has to have some way to detect the predator before it strikes if then the predator outsmarts or outplays the prey so be it but the prey should still have a chancejust look at nature as an example if a cat always had a 100 chance of killing a mouse whenever it wants to there would just be a lot of fat cats around and no mice left
thats just silly man anyone what hasnt been using the directional scanner to assist with probing old probes or new probes has been selfnerfing the directional scanner has always been one of the least understood tools in the game by the masses and one of the most powerful tools of the seasoned pilots it took me about a year of flying to figure out exactly how useful the scanner could be and in how many different situations i could use it for those of you who seem to be just figuring out what that scanner thing is for congratulations welcome to the next level of piloting yes its always been this way and yes youve been missing out before now hell ive found ships before using only the directional scanner when i was fortunate enough to end up close enough to do so like justoffthegrid gate safes
i never said the directional scanner was not used the way it was intended im saying that with the addition of combat scanner probes on top of it its become too good of a tool either do one or the other but dont do both that is sillysee the last quote in my previous post for more arguments
myra2007i expect players like you to try and discredit players whose style of play you dont agree with or even dislike but i will ask you to stop slandering me or try and keep it to a minimum at least my problem isnt dying in low sec i expect to die in low sec the problem is profitability in low sec with the current mechanics im having to press a button and go over results every 5 seconds so that my mission deadspace doesnt get intruded on yes i align yes i drop cans to uncloak intruders i believe i mention this in the op above did you even read it my point is that once my mission is busted the ball is on the pirates courtside choosing to spam a button every 5 seconds is stupidity you know it but you dont want this changed because you benefit from this i dont expect you to change your mind but to the rest of the readers what i say is the following1 unless youre spamming the scan button and reading results every 5 seconds you will miss combat probes scanning you down2 once your mission is busted in low sec there are procedures that can still offer you some safety but once your mission is busted expect to make zero isk for quite a while nothing short from your own blob will change this3 at the moment there is no compromise in low sec if you choose to be safe in low sec expect to make very low isk no other options on the slider thats itbefore the probe changes alert players at least had a chance to pick up combat probes on the directional scanner that would allow them to save their mission deadspaces protecting your deadspace makes the difference whether you will be successful in low sec or not
i just dont agree with you im not primarily a pvp pilot but i fly almost exclusively outside of empire spce with my corp mates were not in an alliance so we get hunted pretty consistently by alliances roving gangs etc we have none of the epic gamebreaking problems that are being discussed here supplimenting scan probes with good positioning via the directional scanner was standard practice 2 years ago with the old probes and its still standard practice now how is it that my corp mates and i dont have these problems i assure you that the probes and directional scanners dont work any differently when we are hunted than when others are hunted if the tools are the same it must be the techniquei commend the mission runners who have ventured out of high sec good for them i seriously hope they continue the journey i highly advise them to hook up with a corp that knows how to survive outside of highsec and can teach them the ropes this isnt a mechanics issue this is a knowledge and skills issue
and this is relevant because  the fact you havent had those issues may mean youre just being lucky so farexactly it was standard practice 2 years ago probing has been changed a lot since but the directional scanner has not it was fine then its not anymorethen please ho mighty player show us how it should be done if you have a technique we dont know why not share it instead of sending us away like that is there a trick we dont know or what if so what is it
not supportedscanning is only one of the ways mission runners can avoid losing ships in missions local scouts aligning your ship to get out multi gate missions dropping a can leaving a scout on your in gate ss and cloaks all combine to make you very safe if you choose to do soyou have the option given to you by ccp if you wish to be 100 safe of taking less reward and running missions in high sec
im not trying to be high and mighty im trying to help when we take a new member into our corp it takes a few weeks to a few months for them to really get a grip on the methods of operation that keep ships alive in hostile space far less time than it originally took me to learn thats one of the things i love about this game the depth of the learning that is sometimes neccessary to master a nuance its also one of the reasons i speak out against suggestions to put training wheels on our spaceships i dont want eve easyfied that would get boring fast i didnt learn to stay alive in hostile systems from a forum i learned by flying with a good group of pilots in hostile space and learning from them i cant teach it on a forum theory vs application this is why i recommended in my last post that the pilots who are having trouble with this join a good corp that is already successful in lowsec or 00 operations its the way to learn
santiagomy concern isnt just staying alive in low sec ive already said it numerous times but we keep going in circles i not only want to extend my survivability in low sec i want to profit in low secyes i can align and warp out when my mission is probed downyes i can drop cans to detect pirates once my mission is probed downyes i can remain docked or go fight the pirates by bringing a bigger blobyes i can wait until they leave by staying neatly docked upbut what can i do in order to protect my mission deadspace location from being discovered by players using dscan to probe me yes i can dock every time a neutral is in the area yes i can fight them yes i can do other things but im still not making isk with my ship docked up because there is a neutral in the system and i dont know if hes scanning me or not yes this has happened to me a few times already twice last week aloneso please tell me how i can remain profitable with even one neutral in the system
it is true that low sec missioning needs some balancing to make the reward worth the risk but perhaps this is not the best way to go about itwhat to change about it i havnt the first idea
youre not helping at all so far you still havent answered my questions what are the techniques youre using that make you quasi impervious to probe gankers keeping it a secret just because you had to learn it the hard way is extremely selfish on your part you keep saying no that you dont need it because you know how to counter this issue but you dont say how you do it how is this a valid argument
thanks marlona sky its comforting to see you recognize there is a problem even if we may not have a solution for it its certainly a break from the usual spam of stop being lazy1 greedy carebear1 go back to hi sec lulz1anyway its nice to see some people recognize and understand what it is im trying to say even though some times im not that clear i admit 
hicurrent km system if you had engaged a hostile in anyway you get on the kill mailthis forces many people who want to up their kb stats to spam 1 gun at every target in the overview instead of focus fire just so that their presence is clear the people who follow primaries will only be on 23 targets and will miss on many simply because theyre focusedpilots who fly logistics and support ships will not get on the kill mails which discourages many people to fly thempilots who want to show their presence have to waste time placing a shot on every ship on the grid instead of focus fire imagine when a whole gang goes like thatit is unfair that logistics who saved people or 4 ceptors which decloaced a ship dont show on km because someone alphad it while they tackle something elsesolution make km apply for every nonfriendly on grid or if that makes it a problem with neuts for every member of the engaging fleet on grid if there are 2 fleets then both get the kmedit to clarify things i do not mean that everyonereceive the killmail i mean that everyone be shown on the kill mail same way bounties from rats on the gates go to everyone in the fleet
no just no if your in logistics and want on the km just fit warriors and be done with it
issues that have already been discussed are being rehashed for a week or 2 afterthe csm may have dealt with the issue already however the community has no knowledge of the outcomesthis lag eats into the next meeting where the same issues come up without any progress due to the community being left behindwith timely minutes a week or 2 wouldnt be wasted with oh weve talked about that already
i know its hard to not submit to reflex but try not to treat this place as the pl internal forums hmkay
look at who is on the csm you guys act suprised csm so far has been nothing but a joke maybe things will change when they have someone in there that is not only concerded about how things can benifit their selfcorpalliancepower blocklaziest csm so far cd
well the radar thingie is an interesting aproachtogether with a removal of local it could boost pvp to a new dimensionnow recon ships would become a realy usefull toy as you need to send out active elekromagnetic waves to scan for threads it also means you are detectable to that threads visa versa if one doesnt send out active waves he doesnt know whats arround him but makes him undetectable at long ranges out of visiblei could imagine a system like thisclose range visual up to 500kmeverything like it is now using just optical sensors and passive detectors detecting the normal electromagnetical and infrared pollution an active ship gives away med range 5005000kmno passive detection of ships without special ir or em sensor banks could be standard build ins for recons as bonus other with extra modules long range 5000km14auactive sensoring needed for scanning the area what means if you dont send out active waves you are blind to the spot except for the signals that are send out from other ships if they use active scannersnow what you get at long ranges is different for 2 situationspassive the ship detects radiation from other ships but all you get is the direction the strenght and the type ladar radar etc for the races but no distance strenght isnt an indicator as different ships  setups have different senosr strenghtactive you get a good indication of the sourrounding meaning u get a direction and distance and also a massindex from the other ships but no race as long as they dont send active signals out them selfextra recon ship passive ability to pin down enemy ships when they send active wavesu need 2 recons in an angle greater then 5UFFFD of the outgoing waves to locate the other ship passive no probes the greater the angle towards 120130UFFFD is the more acurate the triometric scan will be greater then 120UFFFD it will lower the acuracy until it is allmost impossible at 175UFFFD again getting just in on a line againcommunications like chat and getting other informations from other players in system generates some detectable noise too as using radio even if it is not hackable generates em potulion toowhat u could get is without a local no chance to per se say a system is empty as long as the enemy holds discipline in staying quiet recons could get a realy important function in locating and pinning fleetsenemy ships cat and mouse games between fleets  covered camps no one expects as the stay quiet finaly usefull situations for those passive and automatic targeting systems increasing range for loging targets in close to med range situations etc ways for pirates to sneak to the carebear he is the one searching for rats wich he might need to locate by active searching first ways for carebear to stay quiet and try to avoid bypass the pirates signal disturber probes producing wrong signatures and targets so you produce multiple signatures to hide between them wich you could fire in different directions at different ranges maybe randomizedwell after all it sounds for me way more interesting then many of you might imagine that are so used to local and flying to belts station gates to find other ships

yeah pretty much sums it up in what i changed what you said toccp can you change it so i pvp mission mine market stuff with me only having to log in and autoplay the game pleasepathetic suggestion at the least do the rest of us a favor and stop telling us your ideas
even as a laser user thumbs up
the harbyproph and clonecane have three bonuses between them all three of which appear on the absosleip in that regard theyre both fairly close to each t1 version however the ones on the t1 ship skill  ie the ones that always operate at full strength  are the ones from the tier 1 hull the absolution has a locked 25 resist bonus but a variable 525 dps bonus in that regard its more like a prophecy than a harbinger i admit it wouldnt be much of a stretch to change the model for those two but if i had to pick a hull without changing the current stats its be tier 1 in both cases as for proposals for t2 tier 2 bcs the most common i can recall is an allinone exploration ship this has sort of been supplanted by tech 3 but it might still work a quick eve search of fi shows ideas for t2 tier 2 bcs that can nerf inbound rr on the target command extra pos guns boost fleet resists and thats just on the first page and of course in the time between my last post and this one someone proposed a gangbonusatdistance ship for this slot im not a huge fan of most of these but this is an oftrequested ship class and there has been a hell of a lot of ideas thrown around for it over the years you do not need to reassign hulls in order to get t2 variants of those ships you just need to pick the leastcrazy idea on fi and go forward with it
stop looking at the ship class and determining how it operates by looking at its t1 bonuses look how each of those ships is piloted and then tell me they resemble the t1 version this game isnt played on eft for a reason
mayhaps you should learn a bit about the ships models and their cosmetic interactions before making a purely cosmetic proposalhint look at the astarte and look at the myrmidon
theyre flown more like the tier2 because as far as i can tell there arent a whole lot of people who fly prophecies and cyclones at all to compare them to that doesnt imply that the model ought to be changed
ok so 1 out of 4 does not directly apply
the prophecy is a tanking boat unlike the harbinger which is a gank boat the cyclone is much more of a tanking boat like the claymore than that of the hurricane also the hurricane like the sleipnir tends to be somewhat speed fitted while have much more gank how are you not seeing this
a theoretically defeatable concord would eliminate hisecplease do explain
read the op nothing theoretical about it
not supported it is fine as isi think the last thing we want to see again is people farming police
concord is stupid sleeper ai would help a bit but since it doesnt learn from previous encounters also not really so if there is a way to defeat concord it would soon be trivial to copy that way and concord becomes pointless
no thanks
 nevermind
the role of statis webifiers is to slow down a moving target so it becomes easier to track or just so you can stay in range better if a target is already at maximum velocity and you web them what would be the point if all it does is reduce their acceleration speedin order to make this work the way you intended the web would have to do two things1 reduce the max velocity of the target ship by a certain percentage2 proportionally reduce the inertia modifier of that ship so that it takes as much time for it to attain 75 of that new max speed as it would have if the ship wasnt webbedorcompletely change the way the time to warp value is calculated now hear me out i am a big fan of battlestar galactica the new series and in it ships have to spool their ftl drives in order to jump ccp could apply that sort of mechanic to eve online ships as well each ship would have a base attribute visible in ship info windows defining how much time it takes for its warp drive engines to spool up or warm up to the point they can warp pilots would have the option to prespool their warp engines which would build up heat over time or spool just before they warpthe time to warp calculation would then only take into account that value unless the ship has a velocity in that case the current mechanic would be applied where in order to warp you have be aligned pointing at a destination and that if youre moving at a certain speed it will take more time to turn towards that destination however if you were already pointing and spooled you could warp instantly much like you can now if youre already aligned
this is one area of the game that is already very well balanced and requires absolutely no change not supported
i dont know any real problems with armor tanks which in fact make up most of the games strongest tanksnot supported theres no need for this change
if your posting the fleet invite in your corpallianceintel channel and your spys are that deep in already then your probably answering their questions when they ask what the fleet is for im just helping you by automating the process if your that paranoid of who is on your side and who isnt in your own alliance channel though then leave the fc notes blank the way i figure is all this is optional if you dont want to give information then you dont have towhat would you be doing posting fleet invites in unsecure channels though
you can fit a cloaky ship with a gang link bonus now  all t3 ships have that capability and while i find the idea of gang links working at range to be pretty cool i dont think that its a good idea for a new ship class
there is already a mid slot module to allow fitting more gang links
argh i replied but the forums ate my post fix it ccpanyway oops on the skill bonus i stupidly used eft to grab the values the bonus looks inline with the upward trend that last few extra percent costing a lot more than previous steps i still think the minny lp store is kinda budget though
i think that a upgrade to the current ship movment system would be a great idea especially for frigs and interceptors a joystick control would be a huge improvement would make the ship easer to handle and make them move effective in any combat setting especially when you need to get a point on something or someone
thiseve is not a sim game eve is a strategy game but instead of controlling the whole zerg you get one ship in the zerg time to make that ship count
well in my opinon us luzers that play eve just want to socalise more i suk at spelling and its kinda hard to do that by just typing you get to know a person alot more by meting them in person than watching a chat channel im not saying it should be anything like second life cuz it suks but just to add a new experence into eve and a new way to apreicate the vastness of it again i suk at spelling
why is it that we can shoot through anything this game i think asteroids and other objects should be able to be used as cover meaning your bullets from your autocannons will not go through solid rock instead they would just bounce off and make things more realistic
youd break the servers destroy most common tactics ruin the tracking formulas and force players to turn this into a flight sim game instead of a strategybased game no thanks

here are the downsides1 alliances get to minimize their enemies you can pick just one of the fw militia entities to pick on and dont have to worry about reinforcements or npc attacks in the other militias area easy mode for alliances2 alliances shouldnt interfere in fw theyre simply too much coordinated logistically and there isnt a balancing force in the current fw setup just imagine the chaos of current fw versus a well organized force of capitals of a massive alliance also low sec should not be incentivized for alliances like 00 is because there needs to be a no mans land for small corps and gangs to roam for pvp without huge gate camps protecting these new sovereign spaces this will happen even if they cant secure plexes because its just as beneficial if you can block opposition pirates and nonaligned being opposition as well from entering your spacethe upsides for alliances significantly outweigh the downsides with this idea if youre going to allow alliances into fw at the very least they should not be able to pick and choose who their enemies are either youre all in and lose access to all opposing faction space or you stay neutral
as someone with a freighter orca transports and t1 haulers i see absolutely no need for a mini freighter to fill a nonexistent gap what we have already does the job well enough all of the complaints i have seen so far about the orca is that they dont want to train the mining skills i sympathize but the train is really not that long and a little diversity is not a bad thingif we need anything it would be a way to haul rigged battleships around and there have already been several clever suggestions for ways to make our current ships fill those needs modules that convert cargo hold to ship maintenance array capacity for both the orca and freighterjfvic
ok here we go an need to spell things out for those that cant keep upwhat the complaintissue was an observation that the progression for ships with cargo space was ass backwards1001000 m3  normal ships cruisers and battleships100010000 m3  industrial ships750k  1m m3  freighters300k  500k m3  jump freighters but also have a jump drivenow out in left field under mining command ships we have the orca60k  120k m3  orca mining command shipok now look at the lower limit progression100 1000 750k wtf we are missing a base level ship for 2 orders of magnitude to get one of the orders out of a different ship progression path the orca we need a crap ton 24 months worth or training just to make up for ccps lack of vision on transportation and shippingis that clear enough
so basically the only reason you want a lightfreighter is because you want it for progressionrightisaacps no support
no the reason is that there is no medium sized ship for hauling good around we have massive freighters and small industrials thats like saying that we do not need cruisers cause we anyway have frigates and battleships do you you pilot crousers probably you do why aguments against this proposal do not have any legitimate basis full support
im need to transfer 160k m3 on 14 jumps what can i dosigned
i for one support the idea of having something a little more usefuleven though there is the orca it cant fit a battleship repackaged or rigged which to me in a lot of peoples minds is one of the best values for needing to have a minifreighteroversized transport the orca falls short in both regardsthe jf still cant pilot a rigged ship and is insanely expensive neither can the freighters themselves tbhthough i support the idea in general i dont think we need a new ship to do this increase the ship maint bay to carry 500k m3 and the cargo to be able to carry a minimum of 5055k m3if it does with proper skill scratch this neither are outrageous increases and maybe with its low slot availability this can also be acheived with expanders
the problem is rigs were ment to define differences in ships they were advantage at a cost there is nothing that says a rigged ship will always beat a non rigged ship the problem is if you let this one go just like weve let so many others go in the past then its one more step towards making everyone equal for no costthis game was built on cost vs reward risk vs reward you drop the price on rigs you remove risk the lower the risk in game the less fun it is for everyone i always loved the quote in the incredible that said when everyone becomes special nobody is this is a step away from uniqueness its also a step away from competition to have the best stuff both of those things are what drive this game this game is the competition to be the best at whatever cost for some that means hours played for some that means blobbing for some that means griefing for hours on end or scamming or whatever its supposed to be hard its supposed to be demanding thats what motivates people to do betteri just do not like removing aspirations from the game and removing rig cost for frigates and cruisers in the manner in which they are choosing is doing just that
oh yaay never change anyone who disagrees with my idea or wants some part of this game to be more accessible in some way is just stupid or lazynot supported tech 1 rigs should be relatively cheap such that a little more money can grant you a little extra performance out of your ship relative to its size tech 2 rigs are for the people who want to spend the big bucks minmaxing their ship
a goon telling me about stupidity
no one fits t2 rigs anyway is 100x the cost isk or salvage components for a 5 increase worth it i think not the only issue i may have with these is new smaller rigs will be if there not available like the existing rigs ccp will have to seed the market with 250k x how many of the new rigs if this doesnt happen theyll become just like the old t2 bpos ie dam i wasnt on the day of release and now i cant get any of them
they were now they become increased options instead it is like they add yet another layer of slots where you now can realistically modify even a frig and how do you get it to become a step away from uniqueness one sold gtc would make any type of rig available for anyone even in the good ol days with rebalanced and perhaps even new rigs there will be an increase in diversity between ships suddenly you have more ways to address a role now how is that bad i could afford rigs before so for me its no different except that i might meet a greater variation of ships and i consider that funalso i have to admit the goon has a point
not an issue  bpos will be for sale just like the present rigs
actually lower tech ship should get always more rig slots with reasonable logic salvage is supposed to be floating junk in space you just gather useful partsyou put together this junk and add some positive effects on your ship it shouldnt cost much at allgeneral idea should be that you can put rigs in your rifter or kestrel without worrying too much about costbattleship costs 50100mil frigate costs 10100k rig prices should follow similar scale by all logicthis rig patch will be great and shouldve been done ages ago
let me breakdown your arguments for youless difference in ships due to everyone having rigsdid i miss the patch note saying they removed all rigs save for 1 last time i checked there were 78 rigs total with about 25 or so useful onesso in the case of frigates and cruisers we got from almost every single ship with no rigs to almost every single ship with one of possible 25 rigs doesnt that make for more differencesless riskreward well currently paying 45 million isk to make a frigate slightly better  as you said rigs arent autowin but instead a small advantage  seems like a pretty darn messed up riskreward mechanism so unless youre mistaken about rigs not being such a huge factor this argument holds no value and in the case that rigs are a huge factor then this patch only evens the playing field giving newer players a chance as wellremoves the motivation to improveyou remember that immense feeling of despair when you made your first skill plan to get into that awesome ship you really liked with a perfect fit and realised it would take you over a year to get there you remember that same feeling of despair when you were flying your first cruiser gawking over battleships hacs and carries and thinking how the hell you were ever going to afford thatthats not motivating at all long term goals dont motivate short term goals do moving from no rigs to small rigs is a short term goal moving from small to medium another short term goal moving from no rigs to normal rigs is not this will instead add a lot of motivation to do better instead of goals attainable only by those with years of experience and billions of isk rigs will become goals attainable by all players rigs on a frig will still make it 10 times as expensive its still a risk and an investment but now it will become a realistic risk and investmentjust because 5mill for a t1 frig is nothing to you doesnt mean that its nothing to everyone its definitely a small amount but by no means something id personally throw away on a whim thats not even speaking about cruisers totalling 25mill which id say are already on the expensive side for a ship youre expecting to lose in pvp
seems like rigs are going to be like t1 named modsboring before you go and make even more ships harder to move without physically being in them how about making them available to being removed and added when necessary

faction ships need loveiirc t1 got boosted to close the gap to t2 faction ships did not inherihit the boost from the t1 hull and were supposed to be looked at lateri dont hink this ever happened for older faction ships  although some of the newer additions might be okfaction ship overhaul gets my vote
these desperately need a rebalance especially the ashimmu
this is an excellent idea so good in fact that ccp will never implement it
this is simple effective and should have been implemented a long time ago
it is as simple as this the ui is likely the number 1 issue preventing this game from reaching a wider audience the ui is the source of the most universal complaints from the userbase however the suggestions on how to fix are severally polarized and inconsistent the only way i can think of to address this is to adopt a player modifiable interface
i support this with 2 caveats1 only addons which are available to all players should be permitted2 there should be some kind of review process to make sure that gamebreaking wall hack style changes arent introducededit and 3 that ccp should have the right to incorporate any addons into the main client
sounds as a nice idea but high sec wont be high sec anylonger all carebears small miningindustrial corps can become easy wt for new black ops exploiting corproom around the victims area of interest in many different systems at the same time hotdrop on the victim kill with approval after taking out a few freighters some hulks etc propose that the victimized corp pay for protection and you have a sure income i have started training up my black ops skills now pirating without getting punished for it sure thing
notheres already too much hi sec this and that in eve
around covert jump hauling well not really something that should be a concern its so easy to use an hauling alt so the covert stuff wont have any benefit unless if in war or going directly tofrom low00 sec then its okay anyway it wont make any impact on trading in general imobut you really have to study these pages
ok on the topic of tactics first there has to be a ship equiped with a covert ops cyno for the ship to bypass the gate  an effective camp will pop said ship in seconds  so the point of ships bypassing pinch points hear is not a validoffensive tactics  for the force with black ops  well one of the oldest tactics known the pincer move this could  if done right  be a deverstating move on the side of the attacking force stoping the campers retreat through a gate yes this tactic could be used already but with little option than to find alt routs  if any exist  to perform such a tactic the black ops is the ship for the job  after all it is a specialist ship for the above reasons and plenty more i stand by my vote of let the black ops have the ability to cyno jump into high sec systems  like said else where 08 sec systems would be goodwhy should there be aspects of the game that can only be lerned  used in low  00 sec systems 
well a covert recon also nearly just slip through all gate camps its what i do today in my blokade runner and in my recons and covert ops you just fit a covert cyno on a cloaked covert and call in the rest of the covert gang including the black opscovert and black ops do circumvent all gate camping especially in high sechow would you make a tight gate camp in high sec with no bubbles what so everbesides the ship lighting the covert cyno can be an alt thats just joining the fleettaking the original critic from csm suggestion around alt in warfare over to black ops usenolet black ops get popular in pvp in 00 and then lets talk again just because it hasnt been popular in 00 i think its wrong to try to get this going by taking it to high sec let do it in 00 first and by alll means lets use it for popping pirates in low sec when the tide has turned and ccp has made the needed change to black ops it will find it niche usebtw there are many many aspects in eve you have to do in low sec00 moon mining attacking whom you want build capitals light a cyno etc high sec is  well  high secin fact a redeemer has the exact same dps as a an apoc range is just shorter

if insurance was actually removed i would probably start suicide ganking what you forget is that money is not the reason for the ganks that you guys complain about so muchhigh sec is not meant to be completely safe and suicide ganks already are rare ive sat afk in high sec many a time with very expensive ships with some expensive modules and never gotten ganked ive also only ever seen suicide ganks happen when i was involved if this were a systemic threat to high sec commerce and mining it would be a lot more commonas someone who runs plexes and sometimes flies cargo worth 200 mil through high sec i really dont even have a problem using autopilot id probably be ganked eventually if i were consistently that careless but you can still play the law of averages and come out well aheadjust dont be totally oblivious to whats happening around you if something weird starts to happen in your belt leave common sense will always be a better protector than concord
rat bounties are allready nerfed in missions compared to 00this does not need to be looked at againthere is little risk ratting in 0 when you have intel channels and are surrounded by blue and can warp to possafe and cloak when neutralhostile in local

i support the idea however i think it would be more wise with the overall cost of eve going up ingame that it shouldnt be limited to just one faucet even democracy when the cost of living goes up eventually there is a earnings increasei think it should be added into all ways to make isk tbhie  missions ratting empire to nullsec npc buysell orders possibly even a higher success on inventionthumbs up
i propose that rather than a single definitive assailable structure being the endall beall of 00 sovereignty sovereignty should be a relatively accurate representation of how much influence an alliance holds over a certain tract of space this could be accomplished in the following wayhave sovereignty represent a general confidence level that an npc population represented as simple statistics without any actual physical presence needed has in an alliances ability to protect them from harm the construction by an alliance of a few initial settlement structures revolving around the planets in a system could trigger the influx of settlers into the various planets of a system as time passes the confidence level would raise and more settlers would inhabit the planets of a system this confidence level could be assailed by hostile pilots by making assaults directly on the planetary structures on some of the moonbased industrial complexes or on settler built defenses to be explained laterthese settlers would pay taxes to the controlling alliance which would directly scale with the number of settlers in the system which in a sense is the sovereignty level of that system and overtime could provide more dynamic benefits such as the production and sale of unique ships and modules in systems with player owned stations a source for missions that would have a unique 00 flavor and they could even provide a novel defense force in the form of friendly npcs that could protect the planet against invadersthe system i envision could look something like thissov 1 build a planetary inhabiting module pim in at least one planet in a system this triggers the start of sov 1 gradually settlers begin inhabiting the planets that have this pim structure the more pims in the system at a max of one for every planet the faster the overall system population rises one important aspect of this is that the population growth has to be predictable based on the number of planets in a system so as to make managing multiple systems easier for an alliance as the population rises gradually simple defenses like orbital defense guns and npc frigates and cruisers can develop around the planets once a certain threshold is reached say 60 million inhabitantssov 2 sov 2 enables an alliance to build terraforming module for their planets increasing the population cap of the planet at this sov level the population begins to settle down and offer missions for the home alliance these missions come from a set of missions that are specifically created for sov related agents and are in no way region specific as well as increased defensive npc battleships and larger caliber guns and industrial benefits offering assistance in moon pos maintenance such as a reduction in fuel costs at another population threshold 600 million sov 3 is reachedsov 3 this would be another gradual step up in the industrial and defensive benefits of the settling population better missions better industrial rewards more npc planet protection etc sov 4 this would rely on a certain population in the billions that would only be achievable at a constellation level across multiple systems much the way const sov works now except not station dependent sov 4 populations could be more resilient to confidence declines explained later as they have developed a long standing interrelationship with their host alliance i would like to see the removal of mysteriously invincible structures that exist with current sov 4 mechanics and instead concentrate on it simply being a more difficult path to uproot the infrastructure in the form of settlements in such welldeveloped systems
of course thus far this has seemed pretty onesided in favor of the defender while there should be a definite advantage for wanting to put the effort into holding 00 space it should not be a fortress that is unassailable to anything but the largest of capital fleets that is why i want to see a system where the potential damage an assailing force can do is scalable with the size of that forcethe confidence in alliance protection is the ultimate thing that an assailing force wants to destroy a small gang could assault some of the moon based more lightly defended industrial structures which would have a minor negative impact on settler confidence as well as causing some financial damage to the defending alliance a massive fleet could directly assault the planets themselves causing a markedly larger impact on settler confidence as confidence goes down settlers abandon the system this essentially makes sovereignty a dynamic tugifwar rather than set of hard artificial levels of representation however concrete levels at some of the milestones would still exist sov levels 123 and 4 so that both the attacking forces and defending alliance has a clear gauge on their current standing the intent is not for a small roaming gang of hacs to be able to cripple alliance infrastructure in backwater systems that are not scouted 24 hours a day such a gang could knock a few points off the confidence level in a region by going around and hunting settler npcs and less defended structures which would succeed in hurting the finances of the defending alliance a bit but it would take a concentrated effort over time to have a more drastic effect such as lowering the sovereignty level of a system eventually i think it would be interesting to see player kills also contribute to settler confidence so by killing a member of the defending alliance confidence goes down if the defending alliance successfully defends a structure or system confidence goes up the details would have to be worked out for such a system thoughthe advantages of this type of system are many incentivizes 00 space holding by providing 00 exclusive benefits special missions and items offered by settlers and creating a dynamic building over time infrastructure base makes 00 space more interesting and flexible as it is aside from the occasional gatecamp or ratter 00 space is a barren desolate place seeing some activity in the form of npc settlers around planets dynamic structures built in systems and the ability for less valuable systems resourcewise to be made valuable by space holding alliances would be a great boost to the overall attractiveness of 00 space utilizes existing alliance infrastructure by allowing settelers to make use of moon mining poses and player owned stations for selling their goods on the market allows for both small gangs and large alliances to assault defended space with scalable degrees of impact increases the range of options for both attack and defense evolving 00 warefare beyond attackdefend the pos allows for more vibrant player driven stories and better represents the epic scale that 00 warfare should involvethank you for taking the time to read all of this commentssuggestionscriticisms are all welcome
i like it though it needs some building expanding the basic idea i think is worthy of a big fat old support good idea chap
as with every sov revamp thread this is clearly a first draft it needs work before ccp can even think of implementing it however its certainly one of the more interesting first drafts ive seen in a while you seem to have addressed all the usual issues fairly cleanly and if its done right itd be easier to understand and easier to get into than the current system i like this a lot
this is similar to some thoughts ive posted before as well but goes a bit further by making planet populations automate as do improvements to the systemsbluntly i dont think automation of the process is the wise way to go as it cuts out the actions of the sovholding alliance as economic entitiesbetter would be to make planetary populations be trade goods sourced from empire and employed in specific planetary structures that produce sov points over time or materialsgoods of use if youd rather use your colonists in other ways rather than automatically causing targets to appear in a system sov would permit useful structures defense offense and economic to be anchored by the spaceholding alliance that said i could see a model in which probeable civilian structures are automatically seeded as exploration sites in a system and attacking those becomes one of the means to reduce sov points for attackers as would taking out npc convoys and the like in many ways i think the future of sovreignty could and should be looked at as a minigame similar to managing your cities in colonizationonly instead of the mothercountry sending invincible elite troops to smash you flat some other spaceholding alliance eventually does that for you colonization in short was all about generating advancement points recruiting bonus people and harvesting raw materials to be either sold in the distant market or refined to a finished good and then soldso in general i support this ideakrum
i think this idea is worth developing it has something for everyone
looks like a pretty good first draft
supporting the draft idea as worth developmentconsideration
i hereby support this
this was suggested in the past a few times most of the time people didnt see a point in moving from one grind bottleneck to another grind bottleneckpersonally i think the idea would have merit if it incorporated restricting immigration to exotic dancers
as a first draft i support the idea
prespeed nerf we had ridiculous speeds without counters after patch we have insanely slower speeds and more counters to that speedi think weve seen the bad of speed gone forever i would like to bring back some of the speed we once saw thoughchanges below are an attempt to get cruiser closer to the 35005000 speeds if fully fit for speed with the vaga hitting maybe a slightly higher end fully faction fit and snakedthese same changes should give frigates high ends around 89k speeds if fully fit implanted and set for speeddoing this would be a good middle ground for speed freaks and provide a ground between speed and range setups where as right now almost always range wins with the exception of rr platformsthere are also more counters to speed now than before most begrudgingly the mwd turn off switch that is just disastrous for speed setups lets face it only a  would fit a mwd and ab and then hed be laughed at for dieing anyways snakesthere is no reason they give so little buff for their intended purpose return snakes to a mid point level from where they are to where they weremwdskeep the capacitor changes in but add some distinction in speed between metasship massincrease all tank cruiserbs types mass by 5 reduce all speed cruiserbs types mass by 5ship skillsrecalibrate ships meant for speed to get speed geared bonuses such as agility tracking scrambling falloffs and remove their ability dish out higher dpsfrigatesboost all frigate speeds by 10 basethese types of changes should bring speed back to some extent while not overpowering it like before where mass and massive stacking bonuses made cruiser hit 1325k speeds in short give us back some speed
i want to note that i was one of the most adamant supporters of speed nerfing but even i knew from day one they went way overboard with the changes
speeds are pretty fine now also these suggestions above put together would mess everything up pretty bad especially cruiser speeds are very fine now not supported
a vaga pilot can already hit 67k on overload what do you want moreand my not fully speed fitted fleet scythe 3nanofiber ii easily hits 3ksyour point was againoh and yes not supported
the upcoming new rig types will add a lot of umpf for slight speed  agility and very decent tankbuffer changes then add the upcoming fw lp changes3 frigates again
alright just the title says why hasnt the insurance company come to a point in their history of payouts to numerous pod pilots to actually give more accurate payouts and sorry if this has already been brought up i rarely read this forum nor do i have the time to repeatedly search for a thread id probably never findissuestech 1  obviously many of these ships worth insuring have a payout that actually lowers the cost of the insurance in the first placetech 2  obviously many of these ships are insuring for the value of the cost to build not the market value of the ship which in rl it is generally what it would take to get a new one even if you make the cost of insuring a t2 version of a ship more it is still worth doing in my opinion most people drop some serious cash on these beautiestech 3  to be honest on a modifiblemsp ship there isnt really any way i can see this being very possible at least at the momentand for all of them maybe a biyearly update of the average cost in empire it would take to buy a new one taken randomly twice a year to prevent players hiking prices up of course it would be interesting to see one day the insurance company adverting more competitive tech 2 insurance available and more over as all things in eve have pretty much gotten more expensive this could lighten the load some players are taking on now there isnt really an increase in ways to make more isk just more ways to spend it quicker
supporting myself
ive come to notice that in eve there is a capital ship for almost every type of ship in the game capital cargo ships capital mining support ships capital combat ships even capital drone carriersso my question is why not add a capital mining ship to the game say a eight highslot strip mining ship with a 500m3 drone bay with 10x or even 15x drone control abilitythis way it would be the ultimate mining ship enough drones to defend itself and superior mining capabilities that are limited only by its lownullsec restriction a ship like this could make lownullsec space a lot more valuable to hold as an alliance could hold the space a lot easier as it can mine itself a new fleet much more quickly and of course it has no abilities like the rorqual making its use still valuablejust a thought edit  upgrading to proposal please vote if you have not as of yet
i think just making a large mining drone would solve your issue tbh and giving a orcarorq a larger drone abilitybay but only the higher bandwidth than normal to run a heavy mining drone there isnt really any need to increase the number of pve capital ships even more
that ship wouldnt stay pve for long i can only imagine the pirate gloatwine threads that would spawn i actually like that idea
sometimes when you see big corporations and alliances slave at harvesting resources at the expense of fun i wonder when the time will come when we can harvest moons for raw resourcesor heck just stick a factory on a moon and it will churn out ships once done the moons gone our fleet ate a moon
carrier with mining drones ii is already really decentand maybe talk to chribba how well suited titans and dreads are for mining 
low sec profitability has nothing to do with this so called loophole in fact by discouraging people to enter lowsec it if anything increases profitability due to supply and demand people less likely to enter lowsec means few plex runners less competition the problem is that low sec profitability is minuscule at best not that its easy for people to scan out your mission but thats for a different threadnot supported
ok youre not going to get my support but im definitely not going to flame you for calling into question the profitability of lowsec i will however suggest to you that the scanning mechanics may not be the problemits supposed to be dangerous in order to circumvent this you bring more people in to support you when you do this however your profit margin lowers however in what way do you think that this situation of losing profit would change if probes were changed so that they were required to be in space close to you longerwhat youre asking for is that the directional scanner be nerfed in order to fit better with the new scanprobe mechanics so what would happen if the numbers were changed so that it required say 60 seconds to scan a ship down with probesthe ganker drops his probes and begins scanning you are spamming on the directional scanner and as soon as the probes get within 14 au of you you warp off to the station safe spot etcfrom here you are in exactly the same boat except you have saved the mission site you still are experiencing the same profit loss however you still have to wait for the ganker to leave or kill himherthem all they have to do is wait as soon as you go back to the site if the ganker is still active they will find you before you could possibly have a chance to finish the missionso youve saved the site and you could potentially do it later and get the reward and not lose standing with your agent but you still have to either wait leave or kill almost nothing has changedso all said and done i do see where youre coming from in that the riskreward ratio for lowsec seems skewed ore not really worth it crappy rats etc but i dont believe that a nerf of the directional scanner is the way to fix it a change like this would affect everyone negatively not just lowsec mission runners trying to come up with a suggestion to increase the profitability of lowsec is good in my book but changing this mechanic around will solve nothing because its not the root of the issue and even if it was changed to what you propose nothing would change
commanderdata211i havent done a good job explaining how changing the probing mechanics would improve profitability but in a nutshell here it ispreapocrypha  i could mission in low sec even when neutrals and pirates were in the system why because i had a window of at least 3060 seconds to detect probes i had a better chance at detecting them if there were no probes in sight i could continue with my missionpostapocrypha  even with one neutral in system i have to dock my pve ship ie the profit earner and do something else because i have no idea whether that neutral is probing me or not what i do afterwards is irrelevant whether its go fight go dock go twiddle my thumbs go blob it doesnt matter one neutral in my system means stop earning isk and no other safety measure will help this situationin order to use my directional scanner properly i would need to be bashing it every 5 seconds its just physically impossible considering i have to read the results and micromanage the ship all at the same time id probably last 10 minutes before having to quit for the daypeople keep suggesting drop a can at warpin stay aligned which is very good advice to try and keep my ship alive but does nothing more once my deadspace is discovered my profits hit the floor
as i explained in my previous response it takes time to learn these things when we train a new pilot i expect several weeks to several months of learning to take place before they are able to function comfortably in a hostile area i could no more teach all of this via forum post than i could write a few paragraphs on archery and expect someone to read them and go hit bullseyes with a bow and arrow this is why i would again recommend that pilots having trouble operating outside of highsec join a good group that is already successful in low or null sec obviously one of these groups has adapted to the environment in which they thrive and have lessons to teach making a couple assumptions which i hate to do it seems that those endorsing this scanner nerf are attacking the wrong problem and using unwise techniques in dangerous space by attacking the wrong problem i mean its not the scanner or the probes that are broken theres a pretty good arguement that lowsec isnt really worth the time or effort i personally skip through low sec rather quickly and spend my time in 00 others have already made this point in this thread by using unwise techniques i mean  flying solo while hunted by groups expecting to continue churning isk while being hunted continuing to churn isk while being hunted instead of reacting to the hunters flying pure pve fit ships in a hostile areawhile i couldnt possibly train a pilot to thrive in hostile space on the forum i can tell you that we dont use any of the unwise techniques i just listed refusing to adapt to a hostile space by changing methods is like refusing to buy bug repellent when hiking in a jungle because normally you hike in the city and you dont have to take that extra precaution so you shouldnt have to do it in the jungle its not the mosquitos fault if said hiker gets eaten up and we certainly shouldnt nerf the wind for carrying the scent of dumb hiker to the mosquito
the expectation that you can maintain 100 profitable activities while operating solo and being hunted is a false and unrealistic expectation in my experience unrealistic expectations are one of the main causes of human frustration
maybe we need a module that informs us we are being scanned with an exception being made for covert ops scans which either cant be detected or have a much greater chance of being undetected
so what this really comes down to is that preapocrypha probes gave you the ability to ascertain the motives of neutrals in local in advance of them actually arriving in missionsin both the pre and postapocrypha world if someone comes into local and tries to scan you down you need to dock until theyre gone the difference is that preapocrypha if someone in local wasnt scanning you then you could usually determine this whereas now the majority of the scanning happens in a way that doesnt show up on your own directional scanner and thus you get little or no advance warningand youre not worried about losing your ship as such youre trying to protect the location of your mission by warping out when the probing starts once someone appears in the mission youre happy enough about warping out to save your mission ship but at that point they already have a 100 hit on the location which they wouldnt have got if you had known to warp out two minutes earlieris this understanding rightif so im not sure that having your site discovered is as big a deal as you seem to think regardless of whether the prober gets a warpable hit the first time round or not youll need to stay docked up while theyre in system and youre safe when theyre gone the only distinction and i dont know how relevant this is is that the prober could leave the system and trade the bookmark to another player who could then enter your system and warp straight to your missionbut since you seem to be not worried about losing your ship to something like this and since you need to dock if people who are hunting you are in your system anyway im not sure how this changes things besides its not like you could guarantee you warped out before they had a fix on your location preapocrypha anyway
i have written a guide on the technique that being talked about in the op see the link in my signature for more detailsi still thinks it sucks that there is pretty much no possible defense to counter this technique but at least now youll know how its done so you can get some payback
you anwsered your own question  to be profitable in low sec you need to be in a blob so you can spank local piratesif you absolutelly insist on doing it solo  make sure you fit eccm to your shipscan strength  sig radius  sensor strengthby increasing sensor strength you reduce the ability of a pirate to get a 100 hit on you when they do launch probesif you go to low in a maurader with a big fat sig and no sensor stength  dont be surprised if the pirates get a 100 hit on you first time
oh and since i forgot to actually reply to the op earlieras soon as the apocrypha scanning system was announced i was pleased that finally knowledge of where someone was in the system could be integrated into scanning so that you could tell your probes to focus on a particular area if you knew where the area was i considered this a deliberate and fundamental element of the system and never considered that someone might consider it a loopholein response to your second pair of questions yes and yes in my opinion the dscanner has always been the tool of choice to locate someone in a system the only time you ever resort to probes is when you determine someones location to away from celestial objects  in which case the sole purpose of the scanner probes is to generate a warpable hit to a location that you already know of but otherwise have no way to get to this is in fact exactly what was happening before but because it was impossible to integrate your knowledge of a players location into the scanning system short of trying to drop a probe as close to that player as possible the probing took longer and was more chancebasedi do sympathise with your side of the coin though  i think that the situational intelligence system does need a bit on an overhaul rather than pinging the directional scanner ever few seconds this has been talked about in relation to putting local in delayed mode in kspace at which point some kind of changes to scanningearly warning systems would be a good idea and when this is addressed it should make your situation much better too
loophole or not i think everybody can agree having to click a button every 4 seconds and roll the results in a scrolled text area does not make much sense some automation or advanced filtering will not make lowsec afk missioning possible or make anything easier for anybody an operator is still required attention is still needed

or you could simply create a channel specifically to issue fleet orders
if your fleet members are so insecure about themselves that they dont want to do what needs to be done to create an effective fleet thats your own damn problem for not hanging out with good peoplenevertheless if this could somehow be implemented properly it would be a cool feature to see everyone involved in the fight unfortunately given the complexity of the game i just dont think its feasible too often youll be in a situation where youre involved in a fight fighting on the same side as neutrals or even reds and the system would have no real way of telling whats what cool idea yes but not possible to implement effectively
makes sence noconclusion make support vessels get killmails
this really
op edited to explain the idea better
still no minutes
how about a simple solutionscanner button is removed instead it is constantly active scanning angels remain the samethis way there is no more mindless spamming the scan button but nothing changes to the human skill of scanning down stuffand the scanner does need a lot of tweaking but not in a direction that discourages pvp
good
less clicks is allways a good thing
not supportedmanaging your weapons is something that you need to doyou need to remember to cycle the cap booster after it reloads you need to remember to turn off your mwd once youve burned to the target you need to toggle heat at the right time you need to manage capacitor orbit range etcwhy should you not have to also reengage weapons after they reloadhowever if this does make it to the game heres how it should be donereload becomes like a cycle it has a visible activation timer and you can click on the weapon in midreload for it not to cycle another time so for it to stop shooting after the reload
in options of the game let us tweak the client 1 you will type in ranges that appear when you click warp toorbit at keep at range2 in client options you can enter speshial mode where you can change colours fonts font sizes on every button and change relative scale of every button3 you can moove around buttons in menu whyperson a pilots a interseptor the first thing he whant to come up when he clicks on a object is orbit not aproach person b pilots a longrange ship with limited tracking and whants the first thing from the top to be keep at range with his optimal at the top you will not be able to setup macroes or significantly change interface in order to gain advantagewoul be nice to be able to make simple commands using inbuild editor such as if the angular velosty is over traking of my guns the line in the overview with the tracking turns redif target is in my faloff it is shown yello if it is in my optimal is had a green tag if target is warp scrambling me a big red blinky tag appears next to it those are just examples of interface adjustments and simple tweaks all commands should be limited to interface and not perform any actions in game like when my cargo is full drop a jetcan will not work script modules could be sold ingame by players for isk would be cool as they only work when you log in and cannot perfor any actions other then changing colour of buttons and other stuff they cant be malisios any script can be disabled before logging in from the menu so before it takes effect if user does not like it
not supported for the following reasons1 most people wouldnt bother to customise the ui2 in a welldesigned ui people shouldnt need the level of customisation youre asking for3 it would involve ccp designing a whole new easytouse ui just to allow a few people to make the original ui a little bit better suited to them id rather have one decent ui for everybody3 we still cant set the text size above 12pt or change the font and people have been asking for that for years4 for menus it would be better and easier for ccp to implement a sensible menu ordering where all options are easy to find 
support it
if ccp do this you can bet the claymore will end up in the hurricane hull

thank you dierdrawe look forward to reading them
for the most part when i mission i have a simple policy when i see a another ship which is not mine enter i ether shoot the wrecks destroying them or warp away from the deadspace leaving the mission rats to attack the salvager most of the time i just destroy the wrecks in a scorched earth policy that all mission runners should adopt when dealing with salvage theives
if i remember this right 1 of my old buddies here told me that it was like that on the first moments in evethey didnt like it or something cause they changed it but i would have to admit it would be nicewhat could be nicer is if you hide behind an asteroid you dont see the ship nor the square thingy around the ship on your main view so a whole fleet could hide behind it and you wouldnt even know it

harpy doesnt need any sort of tracking bonuses i hit interceptors just fine with blasters and even rails i wouldnt mind seeing seeing some of the other proposed hac bonuses transfering down a resist bonus on my blarpy would certainly boost my confidence in survivalwhat i would really agree with is a role bonus for something like 5 bonus to afterburner speed or something per level assault ships are one of the only cases were afterburners make sense to use and a 200300ms boost to assault ship speed with ab would be helpful without being over the top

why must we once again have to do this threadif rockets are still supposed to be that secondary weapon system of their description then at least fix the bonuses on the ships that have been bludgeoned into using them so they are effective from themkrum
low base dpsexcessive fitting requirementshawk having less dps than a kestrelrequire a web and a nonabing target to do full damage in contradiction with the tendency to fit abs on frigates for frigates not to have room for webs and for frigates to be a favoured solo platformit would be fine it it was tricky to deal full damage with rockets but the base damage was good as is the case with torps but rockets have the worst of both worlds  crappy base damage that is far to easily mitigated
im bringing this up next meeting
missiles in general are good rockets suckis it the 4pg or 17cpu both base of a t2 rocket launcher thatt you think is excessive problem is mainly imo the crap dps
all missiles need some serious examinationever since the titanic missile changes 3 years ago theyve become a terribly subpar damage system relegating ships that rely on them to the back burner and pve contentincrease the explosion velocity on all missiles to be equal or greater to the afterburner velocity of their intended targets ie rockets should have an explosion velocity equal to an overdrive equipped frigate on afterburner about 12001500 meterssec the radius should be adjusted by type javelinsprecision having very small radii putting more hurt on small things furyrage having a larger radius and slower exp velocity to damage larger targetsprecisions should hurt smaller targets than their class cruise intended for cruisersbc rather than bs javelins should fly 2x as far as their t1 counterparts rage should put considerable pain on ships larger than their class heavies not doing so well against cruisers but smacking bcbs almost as hard as a cruise where fury should possibly have a splash damage effect but fly 12 as far as t1all nerfs should be removed from t2 missiles and all t2 ammos to bring them into line with faction ammos
no t2 ammo is great the way it isexplosion velocity should be lower than the base speed of the target ship class because turret ships need to fit a web so missiles ships should also need to and because ab is specifically meant to let you speed tank a bunch of damage and it should also work against missile ships

not supportedits like regular war and the attacking faction doesnt risk faction hitthat means they would be able to move trough highsec attacking any war targets around and would be not restricted as minmatar miltia isits like privateers would demand to lower they wardeclaration fees so they would have more war targets to shootif someones wants wardec he should pay for it and dont ask for game changes or create an expeditionary corporation that would join a militia
i can see the benefits to your organistation cosmo but to the militia it would not seem as benficial to give you access to 2000 wartargets and not have any downsides i can arleady tell the way this thread is going so i do not wish to start a troll or any little bikering arugments with snipes and not so whity retorts but all im seeing while i read and think upon this is the amarr militia saying no and the minmitar militia saying yes yes yes so i regret to say i do not support this idea on your side of the fence this idea is actually pretty good and well thought out but on the other side its actually insulting the intellegence of alot of people
not supportedfirst we dont wanna big alliances in fwsecond worst thing in fw the neutrals who just interfere the real fw soldiersneutral wardeck for a fw corp this is ridiculousif want to shot in fw go and join to militia
while i like the idea and agree with evandas post about supporting anything that would give us shooting rights against the largest block of amarrian loyalists in the game i agree with micia and rodjs concerns about this implementation that is avoiding war with your chosen enemys partner is a very strong advantage both militarily and economically and lacking automatic standings of some sort with the quasifriendly militia is a recipe for organizational disasterthe second problem could be ignored but at the very least i think it would be reasonable to assume that when a podpilot alliance which in gameworld terms represents a significant hostile force declares war on an empire that empires ally would join in its defenseconceptually though i support this but given ccps total lack of anything resembling interest in including rp alliances in the war which is either completely off the table or soontm to be worked on depending on which dev is answering i dont see them paying any more attention to this
i agree the orca is way out of the training path if you suddenly had to train manufacturing skills to get a ship inbetween a frigate and a battlecruiser does that make sense not to me it doesnti think the orca is trying too hard to fill a niche it shouldnt have to fill in my opinion create a new ship for the middle ground in hauling and if needed remove the shipmoving ability from the orca

i and others believe that ccp slightly overcooked the web balance especially in the case of the minmatar recons while a balance was needed as 90 at 40km was a bit much the current state of webs in this case along with the rebalance of speed in the game has significantly reduced the ability of the rapierhuginn to act properly as force multipliers not to mention the hyena urrrrgthose who fly any of the three listed ships are fully aware of how slow the recons have become and the general meh of the hyena as all 3 are designed to dictate engagement range andor act as a multisupport webbing platform for a gangfleet it would seem the max web speed reduction of 60 is simply not quite righti would suggest as with other ewar that webs be left as is for ships without a bonus ie60 speed reductionbut perhaps introduce a 255 bonus per level to web strength for both minmatar recons and the hyenamathwise based on base 60 with best case 5level this would work out to approxreconeaf i63 web strengthreconeaf ii66 web strengthreconeaf iii69 web strengthreconeaf iv72 web strengthreconeaf v75 web strengthat recon veaf v this would go a long way towards correctly rebalancing these shipsthank you for your attentioneditedited for clarityeditfor further clarity this proposal is not a replacement for existing web range bonus it is to make the web range bonus have a real pointwhich is lacking in its current form it can be implemented as an additional bonus best case to make up for ccps overcooking things or reduce the awesome and feared painter bonus so others will not whine ooo unfair third bonus while enjoying td neuts damps scrams and jams that actually mean something useful to the average competent combat pilot 
oh yeah i support this
only if these can not be jetissoned into space can mining is fine the way it is but to allow lockingsecure cans bigger than gsc will make mining in high sec even easier
it wont make it easier to mine in high sec as u still would need to empty a section like 5km5km of roids and then its not even worth the effort to do so especially if u already got a corpmatefriendalt with a hauler helping you out

the entire can system is crap and needs a lot more work than just this still supported
yes very good ideai was thinking the same thing people should be able to have a new chance to remap if they screw upwe all can screw upnothing happens if ppl remap more frequently this wont be an abusethey dont gain anything extraso this cant obviously be called an abusehe has the right to shift some of this attributes to another waythis is just about frequencywhat happens if he shifts more frequentlynothingwho would care noone cos none will be offended by thisthere may be a limit like once in a month but imagine ppl are remapping everyweekso what it wouldnot matter since most of the skills leaning time are shorter than a weekyou wont be ale to remap for every skill train for it to be called an abuse i totally agree this is a great ideawe should be able buy a remap to like 510 directly via account management or should be available to same price with an item like plexccp please read this
this different ships fittings ammo types need different orbit ranges too its a pain to change it every time or alternatively having to take a lucky pick from the default hoping to get something close to usefull
you are limiting the ability of this ship to just pvp and this is a bit one track what about faction wars or even just corp wars in high sec systems  yes the mentioned have pvp aspects but its not just pvp combat  pvp is not the be all and end all of this game just the role you may want to play  this could realy make faction wars intresting effective camps in high sec you mean you dont know already well im not guna give you hints on that front at the end of the day the ship needs to be used more  at least thats what im hearing  and changing the abilities like with high sec cynos would add a new lease of life to the ship and im all for thatyes i know there are many many aspects in eve you have to do in low sec  00 my question was why like what was said at the begining of the thread  covert cynos already ignore cyno jammers and cannot be easily detected dont show up system wide on overview so what is preventing pilots from using covert portals in high sec empire space my vote is still yes to this idea my opinion has been posted and my mind made up
we have more and more players which means more sell orders the effect isit is getting harder and harder to sell or buy anything  if you put something for sell order now it is gone in 100s of other sell orders in around 20minuts it is not only hard to sell product but also find what you looking forthe solution for that create subdivisions in sell orders for example one sudivision for capitalssupercapt3fraction ships  another one for modules  another one for non capitalssupercapst3fraction ships  another one for services freighter transport creating corporations  lotteries  pos fueling etcmaybe additional one or two representing similar productsthat way it will make findingselling stuff much more easier

nice straw man whos complaining about suicide ganking gank all you want i just dont think you should get an automatic payout for doing it either suicide ganking itself is profitable or it isnt if it is then you dont need insurance payouts if its not profitable then its not profitable and you shouldnt get a concord bailout for doing it
this tbhsuicide ganks are a part of the game and i dont expect that to change but those performing the ganks should bear the weight of that choice instead of having it subsidized by the very agency thatis going to punish them for it
theres no straw man here the reason this is being suggested is to reduce the number of suicide gankings is it notyou may want to pay more attention to cp happenings so you understand why this specific issue has popped up at this time also had you read the thread you would see that the argument is against mindless ganks not necessarily ones for profitall im saying is that the ganks people are aiming to combat with this change dont have a profit motive
actually i read and post in cp quite frequently that aside this thread isnt intentioned to reduce suicide ganks the only thing that would reduce suicide ganks would be removing guns from high security spaceand youre right removing the insurance payout will not at all limit the suicide ganks that are done strictly for tears i think you may be under estimating the number of ganks that are done for profit though lets face it if cpers are famous for anything its misinformation

i support this
as someone who makes most a lot of money ratting in 00 id say no to this idea but i have a counter proposalcurrently the faction spawn distribution is slanted heavily in favor of those people who spawn belts right after dt in general my experience shows that i get at least 30 now maybe 60 more commander and officer spawns when i search belts after dt than i do when i farm hours laterfix to income distribution to be independent of time zones and you will see a more profitable 00  from point of view of regular peopleto achieve this ccp would need to add a special flag in the spawn generation code that if it is the very first spawn after server reboot then it will never be a faction spawn faction spawn would only have a chance of appearing if you or someone else has killed at least 1 default spawnhowever since eliminating faction spawn chance from first spawn after dt would significantly reduce to overall rate of finding commandersofficers the default random algorithm should be adjusted to increase the chances of getting faction spawns in my estimate the chances would need to be upped by about 20
dude stop hijacking this proposal the issue here is that l4s make more isk than belt ratting in general
00 belt ratting income is heavily dependent on faction spawns the regular spawns are about 50 of the income then faction mods you find rarely make up the other 50increasing faction spawns is certainly more interesting than flat bounty increase and doesnt raise inflation
that is a option what about chaining i know if u kill every npc in the belt avarage 12 belts for 3 hours u get 1 special spawn that means haulerfactionofficer if someone is chaining it can take far longer before u even get such a spawn chaining wil give u every 45 hours a special spawn on avarage what if such a spawn is a hauler spawn containing 7m tri and 80k isogen the fluctuations are just too big if u get a officer spawn u might earn more than l4s im playing eve for over 2 yrs 1 yr ratting in 00 and i only had a offcier spawn once a ahremen meta 13 that dropped a ahremen armour expl hadner ahremen cabbooster and 250m db stuff close to a bilion in loot how fast do u have a bilion isk worth in lps
fantastic idea
return webs to what they once werereturn all speeds to what they once wereenable weapons to hit at that speed drones  missiles which were too easy to speed tankif people want to speed let them but enable everyone else to counter them a lot more smoothly than they could in the past
no speeds are fine
i could live with some of these changesmass and skills mostly but on the whole you have the wrong approach your mwd changes for example would make highmeta mwds better than they used to be  not only would they be fast again but theyd be better on cap and sig as well i also think most frigs are fast enough these days not supported
its fine fianly no more 17kms vagas anymore
i miss the speed
rapiers huginns  40km web with 001 speed multiplier with 2x or up to 90km with overloaded factionoverloaded faction web  195 km web on any ship that cared to spend as much money as a fast nanoship was spendingcurse heavy neuts  4025km shut off mwdother nanoships  tacle tacticssmart maneuvering that allows much slower ship to intercept a known orbit of the enemy that orbits another targetwhy are so many people so blind to basic game features even ccpthe whole nano nerf was done on invalid logic and has been a horrible disgrace to beauty of game design
they clearly went too drastic with the nerf but i dont expect them to ever come up with a more reasonable compromise ccp is stubborn like that and whoever makes the final decisions obviously doesnt play
i think more appropriately it would be not enough counters i think the implementation of a mwd killing 2 pt scram was more than enough extra counter to this as its absolutely devastating to speed setups far more so than any other counter neuts can be countered webs can be outranged but scrams are a kill or be killed counter onlylets face it pre patch a 15kms vaga could be outta your curse neut range in 35 seconds from 0 to speed it only takes 1 injector to ensure that pulse of a mwd so to really catch it youd probably be talking a combo of a few neuts a web or 3 a long point and enough speed to track it down still 90 web on a 15000 ms vaga only takes it down to 1500 not to mention how long itll take to slow it down so drift often carried it outta most ranges if the pilot was good primarying rapiers hindered this problem substantially more 20 speed hacs against 20 of anything else guess what died first for the anything else so what do they do bring 20 rapiers well then who does dmgthats why this suggestion brings old and new togetheri have no desire for speeds to be increased to anywhere near their pre nerf levels i would like to see ceptors more regularly hitting 9km ms wo over heating and more but not all cruiser hitting closer to 3k speeds and overloading to maybe 4 simply enough if a ceptor can hit 9k and a fast cruiser can hit 3k then a vaga should be 56 rather than its current 34kmsexamples of cruiser sizes that would probably get speedy bonuses as tradeoffs for their current onessacvagadiemios  middle of the road speeds bt tank and speedosprey navyvigilantomen navycurseand other current short range platformsan example of what id do to the deimos as a fix for this style of patch would be to change the falloff bonus for a mwd sig reduction penalty or tracking or 5 scrambler range bonus ie only scrams not disruptors to help it counter the speed issues it currently hasexamples of ships that would loses some massspeed to the current onesheavy tanksrangeszealotmuninnishtarcerbpilgrim
given the bonuses most people would see the sac as tank and the zealot as snipernano
which is why i believe i stated that some ship bonuses would need to change sac is a decent tank but its slot layout is not really conducive to a great tank yes i know you can get a great tank but it doesnt mean ship is optimal for it youd be far better served by a multitude of other amarr options for the tank choicesac works much better as a speed boat since its ideal choice of weaponry is pretty close range honestly if the changes went through as proposed the sac bonuses could stay exactly the same and it still be good at either option but not really a combo of both only difference would be its top end speed would increase by about 800 hopefullysac is ultimately a versatile utility boat so make it faster but still slower than a lot of the other speed boats zealot has a much greater range dynamic than the sac and the instant damage bonus where as the sacs range choice is a missiles and bslow missiles so if you plated and or tanked the sac its speeds would be considerably slower for considerably more tank if you modded for speed itd be good speed close range dmg or long range meh sounds good to me
you want to make insurance payments more marketbased yeah i can support that not sure what youre getting at with the t3 bit but ill give it a thumb
u need to remove blue salvage from t2 ships or else im going to fraud the insurance  buy t2 ships insure get killed salvage your ship and print isk
insurance is supposed to cost 30 when fully insured the only reason insurance makes some ship losses essentially free is that t1 mineral prices are 30 below the values that the insurance company uses you think the average hac drops 35 mil in t2 salvage
this will never happen and this should never happen i dont support obsoleting every other mining ship in the game thanks anyways
caps and supercaps are great for mining that said im all for a pure capital mining vessle of course
only if it had to cycle for 10 min stationary to be useful personally rather than strip miners i think it should use miner 2s with a bonus so that market can be revived after i gank about 30 of these ships in a day
meh it will happen eventually when and how exactly we dont knowthe mineral market is very sensible  and the real problem is that mining as a profession is obsolete  as 40 of the minerals come from the loot  its silly once such a thing has been fixed we will be able to fix the mining profession
this tbhthe reprocessing rates for items needs some serious looking at
bad idea it would flood the market
would love to see a capital mining ship with an onboard refinery and silosreactors that can be accessed in the same manner as a posmake it unable to cloakpaper thin shieldsamrour but with massive hull hpsmall ship maintenance bay10  strip miners logging off with reactions etc active destroys the components
so uh quick question why the hell does it matter if someones scanning you down if youre already aligned out the moment you see a hostile on grid you have about a 3 second window to  yourself and press warp before you get locked down more if theyre in something larger than a cruiser
i explained it here
people have been using the dscanner in this manner since before the latest probe revamp and were doing so when it was chance based even before thatthis is what the dscanner is for
its easy with practice to make yourself pretty much totally safe whilst running missions in lowsec briefly its to do with aligning your ship watching local and using the scanner i wont go into details here but feel free to mail me and i can give you the hints and tips that will keep you safe everytime
there is one underlying difference preapocrypha probes were in space for a hell of a lot longer than just 5 seconds
thanks but my concern isnt surviving in low sec i think i have that pretty well managed my problem is not being able to protect my deadspace when missioning before apocrypha an alert mission runner had a decent chance at detecting probes in space before getting busted after apocrypha there is only a 5second window if i am in low sec to make profits i just cannot take that risk after the patch what im asking is for ccp to increase that window from 5 seconds to something more reasonable
supported on the condition that the fc also gets dance technology incorporated into the fleet interface
i also would like a conga command for fleet
wha where are all the pvpers
not interested in the kms perhaps
they dont need extra epeenthat said not supported it is sad for logistics they arent on the killmails but there kills are the ships of their mates which they saved
the csm did have a meeting rightstuff was discussed
from what i hear they actually spent at least half their time figuring out how best to annoy you personally seriously man bumping this thread isnt going to get you anywhere stop
meissa hasnt been able to do the minutes due to personal reasons which i wont go into here erik has assured me he will try to get them done asap
do you know how i got into the csm sheer charisma  its just been too much time working as a pl diplomat in their customer relations department
i see in some other threads that being scanned down in missions is also another problem and after doing some experimentation with the probe drop trick it seems that to counter it you either have to hit the scan button every 4 seconds or load up the mids with eccm but both pirates and mission runners are in agreement having to hit a button like captain pike every 34 seconds is bad uieccm seems to reduce signature radius by side effect i once put medium scout drones and light drones in the same place and when i had the mediums at 100 percent the lights were at 86 percent but there is no module intending to reduce signature radius for scanning resistance and perhaps such special stealth modules would not be a bad idea it would not break the costconsequence model of eve since skills are needed to use modules and slots are taken up by them since there are already plate modules for ships as far as armor is concerned why not radar absorbing material modules fact of the matter is someone with the top lvl 5 skills and sisters gear can scan down a target very fast without having to narrow the probes down and scan repeatedly actions that warn the target these are the rewards for taking the time for the skills and paying the isk for the gear or grinding the lps but there is no stealth avenue aside from cloaking and you cant do anything while cloaked so where is the avenue for resistance to the instascan ability of those thus rewarded by taking the time for skills that could be rewarded to those also looking to adhere to the costconsequence model the hunter can get top reward for their effort but there is nothing for the hunted except the outdated directional scanner if you can skill up for sisters gear and pinpointing and aquisition others should also be given the ability to equipp stealth modules and skill up for sigrad reduction surely those who boast about their pvp ganking skills could not complain about making a hunt truly a hunt nobody admits to wanting an i win button and instad fall backto the skillsversusskills argument and i think such an argument can be made in this case
supported minnies need some love and bigger clip sizes for large arties would be nice too
while id like to see all of this functionality this is simultaneously too much and too little to be a good proposalexcept 1 thats fine by the time they started making stuff like this work they could be halfway to just making a properly moddable ui the return on dev time just isnt there for doing this

theres a lot of very silly suggestions in this thread why do you hate my poor little hawk so much that you want to give it a split weapons systemthis would only work if you increased the clip size of rocket launchers you often find yourself reloading mid fight as it isthe hawks problem is dps and slot layout  5 missile damage would keep it in line with the kestrel but more importantly its a bonus that the ship desperately needs and wont make it overpowered4 mids for an active shield tank is pretty laughable too ive seen many medium shield extender hawk fits and it should ring alarm bells that in thread after thread pvpers post fits that recommend you ignore the active tank bonusswapping a low to a mid would cure the problem if the slot layout cant be changed then move the boost bonus to a 5 resist bonus drop the shield recharge rate slightly and adjust the cpu  pg so that it can take a passive tankive been posting in hawk threads for nearly 3 years now during which time ive changed career bought my first flat and acquired my first grey hairs yet the same problems with the hawk get discussed time and time again without any action from ccpno waiti forgotthey gave it spinny bits and borked rocketsplease ccp fix the hawk otherwise many years from now ill end up as a senile old man in a care home confusing the nurses by asking for one more mid slot to fit a web
clip size is another issue anyone whos used rockets much will know how long 10 seconds can feel when someones shooting you and youre waiting for your launchers to reload however ive done some eft warrioring to show the case in pointusing all level 5 skills and one damage mod i switched between having reload time included and not included and the results were3x 150mm autocannon on a jag  133dps  141dps 9434x rockets on a hawk  109dps  123dps 886more important that the paper numbers however is the point in game where you have to reload i cant ever remember having to reload in a jag during a 1vs1 however its common in a rocket shiphawk bcu 4 launchers and lvl 5 skills gives a volley damage of 242 and theres 40 rockets in a clip so if you magically hit for full damage every time youll do a total of 9680 damage the jag in comparison does 24480 damage before it needs to reloadthe clip size needs doubled at least
a ship that gets a bonus to rocket damage hawk etc does often more dps by fitting standard missiles something is wrong

the arazu is as awesome as the lach is bad
as for 2 webs being insufficient to slow down vagabond all you need is a warp scrambler i like my 40km range webs

so you need a team of arazulach and huginnrapier to slow one ship down
this is a good idea and should be implemented
well you just need a ship with a warp scrambler
so you could just use a single ship a rapier at 10km range rapiers are supposed to stop ships and they arent doing that right now
so you want a solo pwnmobile its an mmo why dont you team up with somebody warp scramblers were introduced for exactly this reason to stop people webifiers only slow them down
the days of the solo pwnmobile rapierhuginn went away with the damp balance unless target bsbchac pilots were stupid the dps capabilities of both ships are fairly bleah which is how they should be given they areor should beforce multipliers in any given engagementwith the huge whine over speed fits which i personally had no issue with given i wasand remainknown for flying with up to 4 webs onboard the speed balance was introduced along with an excessive penalty to webbonussed shipsto take the vagabond examplegiven that the role of the minnie recons is to slow them and everything else for that matter and dictate range key bitthey simply cannot espcially when dealing with multiple targets remember keyforce multiplier a competent vagabond pilot can currently overheat the mwd to speeds approaching 5kms 60 of 5kmsroughly a crapload faster than a mwding rapierhuginnlookprior to the current state of affairs i would cheerfully pack triple webs and a flight of ewar drones allowing me to web multiple targets and send ewar around the battlefield as needed againforce multiplierwhile 90 webs were a bit overpowered60 webs are underpowered given the role of the minnie reconsand the failhyena i am offering a compromise that is reasonable balanced and probably easy to implement for at least a test drive on sisiand chucking out comments like fit a scrambler is random silliness really if you dont support the ideastate why you dont support it and leave it there and im sure your comments will be taken onboard by those that may actually read and find the proposal worth a second lookcheersbone

id support this the rapier is only capable of holding one ship at the moment compared to an arazu which could damp 23 or tackle 23 or especially the falcon which can jam several ships at once for a question of balance look at the rapier and its ability to be a force multiplier then look at the falcon and its ability to be a force multiplier though i must say one web should be enough to keep up with a vagabond an overheating vaga with a single 60 web on will get to under 2ksecond two webs and they wont break 1k but the fact that a ship could be limited to only 900 ms when the complete attention of a recon designed to use webs to slow other ships is on it dual webs on an interceptor will not even slow it below 1000 two 60 webs as of now 16 speed remaining before stacking factors 75 webs with the proposed change 625 speed remaining before stacking suddenly stacking webs to stop a target becomes powerful and viable while a single web is not overpowered again by buffing it to 90 alternatively more midslots please

motherships dont make sense as frontline ships theyre more of a giant logistics  long range support ship fighters this is not however an entertaining way to play id be all for buffing supercaps if there werent so many titans in the game as it is titans need to be easy to kill because theyre no longer a rarity when you can have a dozen titans on one side it wont be an epic battle to kill one youll just have more titans warp in and nuke everything off the field to save the tackled titan unless the titan goes down quickly edit unless the proposed titan change came as well personally id make the doomsday a single target 100k damage with a rof of a minute or so this way the titan can melt through battleships but has to stay on the field and fight rather than nuking the field and warping out or a titan class siege module capital turrets that can track battleships and the ability to be rrd unlike a dread in siege basically making the titan fight like an improved dreadnought designed to kill battleships though 6 capital turrets and a doomsday would work nicely against capitals too thinking its role in battle compared to a dread would be similar to a mothership compared to a carrier
i disagreerigs while having a heavy cost where imo more about getting a bonus in one area for a sacrifice in another area they do this quite well and people have chosen to ignore or sacrifice aspects of their ships they dont care about for important parts shieldarmour rigsalso i think this is actually going to push it further away from cookie cutter setups after all theres say 10 good or 20 ok ways to rig your ship so now cause theres 20 more options for your frigates that will greatly change its performance its more cookie cutter not even sure how you get that s
since you cant search corp assets and see contents of containers and containers are the only way to be 99 secure with assets in eve these days corps have their hands tied theft is such a prolific problem in eve that noone trusts anyone anymore also the corp has no way to track assets at all once it enters the corp hangar its in the black hole no papertrail now i understand that ccp wants the whole harsh world sht happens aspect to eve which is great but theres really no way to defend yourself or your corp anymorethe usual chain of eventssomething goes missing you look other corp mates look you dont find itso you petition it wait a week and a half and ccp says the items still exist but are in posession of another player and therefore we cannot disclose their whereaboutsthough adding an audit log wouldnt eliminate the problem it would how ever allow leadership to rid the corp of the theif immediately cause as it stands with game mechanics if your good you will never get caught because theres no way to track assets in and out of a corp hangar without using containers containers arent bad either but they are at current game mechanics black holes where items once put inside cant be searched or found unless your in system with the container
support
supportedbest defense is not putting all your eggs in one basket limiting as much fingering of the eggs or no eggs in the basket at all however you shouldnt have to ask ccp what happened to the items you should be able to retrieve it somehow on your own however generic the information is
hmm yeah existing auditing tools really suck for this purpose
supported there isnt much you can do versus corp theft atm other than putting everything really restricted areas even then you cant always trust people higher up with roles from time to timeaudit logs to corp hangars are in my eyes a must especially for people who live purely in posses
yeah the system sucks containers need to be ripped apart and recoded from the ground up  they simply dont do what they need to do i dont support adding audit logs to corp hangars but i do entirely support making containers functional
also true its a sentance i hear all too often about eve nowadays
completely agree if not audit logs in the corp hangar then rework containers so that they can do the job with a role like security officer and the ability to check member hangars why isnt there a way to track items cause as it stands something happens and if you think its worth it you can go through all the members hangars and find out that it was prolly traded to an out of corp altlink to mazzs can thread good side note to this postlinkage
well yeah this is what happens when you read a forum i post in ive said that aboutand this list is not exhaustive containers pos mechanics the corp interface the industry interface the interface in general every socialnetworking type tool eve hasforums mail etc intel systems and probably half a dozen other things i love the core of eve but all the crap that accumulates around it i cant stand
i thought you guys were talking about different kinds of cansoh well i still support it
i support the idea of only one of these cans and thats if it could be anchored mainly because i think the game punishes players that can only afford or only have 1 account and try to mine jet can mining has long been a way to abuse these players as well as people that arent smart enough to use 2 accounts or more to successfully remove ore from a beltbut these i dont care aboutim not a miner but there isnt really anything giant about a gsc when youre running a slowly driven hulkcovetor around a belt so you dont have to risk what little youre already making to a thieving pilotas said above i support some of this idea
i have a different container proposal already up that simplifies things a little bit more then this thread does its going to be presented at csm meeting after next
looks like this issue went completely off the rails at csm 3004turned into a discussion about 00 rattingwould like to see it raised again but this time focusing on caldari vrs others

yes yes and yesremove insurance and to counterbalance that remove last concordboostit should be easier to gank macrominers and ganking for tactical or iskreasons again and also it should discourage ganking just for the lulz
id agree to that no insurance payout for selfdestructs or concord actions neither makes sense
we also have to look at the sheer stupidity of it why would your insurance company pay you for your ship loss when you did something illegal and got owned by the police its obsurd it would go a long way towards curbing the lulz incidents hell saturday there were 30 pirates ganking noobs outside a station in amarr that will really expand the player base idiots

i must have found over 60 officers since they were introduced i cant really count them all i had every officer in game except hakimif you login right after dt and spawn all belts you can you get about 1 officer per week a few times i had 2 officers in 1 dayid say about 75 of all officers i ever found happened during first 2 hours after dtas it is now the people who login right after dt have a huge advantage in making big money in 00
ccp should rather nerf lvl 4 income tbh
this is a better idea but i still support raising bountiesincidentally all these proposal threads how much support do you need before anyone actually gives a toss
agree with ephemeronthe faction spawns at this time are really worthlessthe nerf to them was a total load of bulland a slight correction to bounties as well wouldnt hurt ephemeron come to n54 want your gotans 425mms
while i see the selfish benefit of raising 00 bounties i dont see a good logical backing for that idea i really doubt ccp will be moved to take that step so i propose a fix that makes more sense that they are more likely to act uponalso why do you need gotans 425 i dont think any of you got the balls to fly with them fitted sorry to say  being realistic
not supported and pls dont write an another topic for i need more officer spawn in 00
if u would have spend some time reading the above posts serious u would have seen that it isnt the issue here
i think any sort of 00 ratting boost will have to be in the form of improving materials drops not isk bounties remember whatever is done isk farmers will abuse it to the furthest extent possible if we increase bounties that will increase inflation and undo what we are trying to dohow about this ideathe unnamed module drops should be removed and high meta level named modules drops increased and leave isk bounties faction officer everything else as they are adjust rates so the average income with a typical battleship appropriately fit to the local area will turn in about 20 mil per hourif i recall the average is 12 right now anyways my goal is a 4060 increase after office spawns and such are accounted for thats not really that big of a boost but for casual players who cant check belts after dt it is probably significantthat would help casual players make a bit more money while also forcing isk farmers to deal more with stationsposes while bringing in their haul and therefore potential dangers posed by players it would also reduce costs for casual players when fitting their ships since they have to buy less t2i know it wont reduce the real costs since those named mods cost time to get but it makes things more convenient for members who rat and are in large alliances at war they basically cant participate unless there is a reimbursmenet program running funded by moongold thats how it was when goonbobaaapletcetera were going at it we just threw battleships at each other that were funded by infinite money anyways i know its not like that anymore with the war over but my point is that ratting is not a good primary method of income compared to everything else you can do in the game and ratting is the primary method of income for many casual playersi want to put some more thought into this issue before i actually start writing a proposal so id appreciate some feedback on this post as it is keep in mind i havent personally ratted seriously for a long time and most of my information about ratting is a little old or secondhand
it will nerf ratting income not increase itcurrently a player ratting in bad 00 can get more than 10 millionshour in minerals from recycling lootwith your proposal he would have a lot of meta 14 items that will recycle for less minerals and be worthless as they are overabundant so you would exchange 10 millions in minerals for modules that will refine for 34 millions and will not sell as everyone in that area will have tons of them
i wasnt aware that named mods recycle for less minerals then unnamed so leave unnamed drops in there but increase frequency of highmetalevel mod drops
not that sure ratting needs a boost to be honest everything needs to be looked at to fix the riskreward between high sec lvl4 missions and anything in low or no secadd to this that it probably needs to be tied into the probable changes to 00 sov and all that for it to make sense i think it might be hard to balance without tweeking just about every source of income in the game
i have always been of the opinion that nerfing highsec missions would simply cause a cancelled subscription problem for ccp ive always been under the impression that many people are not willing to take assets to lowsec or 00 for any reason and that the solution for balancing is to increase the rewards of low0sec while leaving highsec untouchedi do think that changing 00 ratting will have a big impact on the game but i think that it needs to be looked at for the sake of casual players who tend to use this resource more then anyone else
npcing has a very big impact and simply nerfing l4s isnt a option ether adjusting drop rates can a solution but i think this need to be studied by ccp different rats drop different loot that refinessells for different amounts so a general solution can be difficult the perfect solution could be adding a proof of killing a npc at a concord station vs fixed prices im talking about adding items similar to the blue sleeper scripts that are in every sleeper wreck a bs should drop a more valued script than a cruiser this would make it fair vs the ratter that chains for more bs spawns and the one that kills every npc for the chance on a faction npc or maybe bringing back the old logs that did drop a year ago random from each rat and let those be worth something at concord stations because this happens totaly random only the looters will profit and it wont profit the macro users i have no idea how much they should be worth i think my last solution is better than the first 1 maybe to avoid inflation u get lps vs the logs and a brand new concord lp store this would make ratting vs missioning more in line and the macros dont get any lpsexact numbers are hard to come with i think only ccp can figur that out with complicated loot drop formulas for that reson i think ccp need to come with a solution were they can live with after they placed l4 mission next to npcing
the integrating belt ratting and lp store rewards idea is an interesting one i think macros would still get lps just like anyone else but increasing the income by allowing people to accumulate points for faction ships and other stuff like that would not negatively impact any preexisting established marketst2 mods minerals isk inflation if this came along with a faction ships buff to encourage pvpers to use them we could buff ratting income without causing any item price crashes in major markets  while at the some time invigorating the faction ships market definitely needs more study though
i agree that plainly nerfing mission running isnt the right way eitheri just think that there are no quick and easy fixes and everything will have to be looked at since it all connects for simplicities sake lets assume we add more module drops to ratting in 00 how does that in turn affect mining profitabilityso just boosting ratting is in my opinion a bit to simple as it can have serious effects to either inflation making the boost worthless or other professions increasing the mineral supply from module reprocessingit is a hard balance which means it doesnt have simple sollutions
nothing is simple even implementing this stuff is pretty difficult thats why i have created this propasal to do some brain storming comming to conclusions and realising there is a problem that effects alot of people playing this game on a daily basis its up to the csm and ccp to really think this out in the mean while the best idea i have seen yet for this problem is the lp store idea in combination of collecting dropt items that can be handed over for lps at concord stations if anyone has more ideas pls keep posting
ive always liked the idea of point defense guns but not on the capitals make a t2 destroyer thats a flak ship or something dont put it on capitals if im flying my ms and i need to get drones off me i smartbomb with officer bombs and they pop nicely if little ships are bothering me i lauch appropriate drones 20 warrior 2s make quick work of most lil ships if they are in a bubble with ya
real life is real life when bismarck sunk it was hours and hours of intence atlantic chase and a mighty sea battle untill they sunk itit sunk it selfhow ever point is that to sink such a ship you needed a couple of ships in its size like hms hood may they all rest in peace shure maybe a few topedo bombers got in a torpedo or more point is bismarck went solo and died no mather all the pds on the ship and honestly the only real threat an aa battery on a wwii ship could take down was fighters becouse the danger aka bombing airplanes were simply flying to high so if we put this into eve that is a game perhaps a titan could fend off a couple of hobgoblin is no more no less with a pds all the other ships simply have to much range and why would anyone try to point a titan with an interceptor as the op stated only hictors can accually hold titansmms and thats outside 20km range i know im a hictor pilot so if your flagship goes flying on its own even with a pds that isnt overpowered it aint going to do any difference really a solo flagship dies in eve and in wwiiso no supportphooedit minor spelling misstake
the best defense is not being alone and doing stupid things with your super capthat you cant get out of which if you are flying it stupidly you should lose the shipsometimes the hardest lesson is the most expensive to learnnot supportedps  not bashing you dont even know you
supported it makes no sense for a powerful ship to be threatened by small ships that do not require much of a protection on the other hand the balance factor of the game has to considered carefully
support fleets capitals are not supposed to be solopwnmobiles
if your cap ship pilot is stupid enough to engage a sub cap fleet without support they deserve to die it is as simple as that we do not want the times back where motherships were basically invincible in lowsec
wow the goons have finally gotten something rightthis is a greatwonderfulamazingincredible ideaa concern that i do have is moving from the current system to this new system would it be just a mad scramble to set up planetary structures would sovereignty disappear when the new system is implemented leaving the space vulnerable until the planetary modules are anchoredi love the idea of naturally spawning npcs that fight for you but will they spawn in belts if they do will they attack normal rats if not will they spawn in the belts and simply not attack the rats also can their aggression behavior be set by the alliance and if so what about nrds space where the alliance has no standing slots leftwhat kind of other structures do you have in mind and what functions do you propose they have from two different perspectives1 what kind of actual functions will the structures serve other than sovereignty holding2 what is to prevent an alliance from filling their space to the gills with these things so that when they are destroyed the confidence level barely goes downan idea that i had a little while ago was mini poss which could be anchored anywhere except asteroid belts they could be set up by individuals within a corp instead of the corp as a whole something like this might be an interesting addition growing confidence and making individuals have somewhere to go that is entirely their own of course they would need to be scaled down drastically both in terms of their defensive capability as well as their fuel cost but i think it would be great to see something like thissorry for my scatterbrained response but i think that more tweaking needs to be done to this idea and i wanted to cover some issues thumbs up but keep developing
i need to think about it more but so far i like it
very interesting idea as many have pointed out it needs additional work but its an excellent start
the general idea is good only problem is that it isnt specific enough  theres too much left for interpretation it could be implemented in a way that would totally rock or totally suck we should encourage ccp game designer team to flesh out this concept but we shouldnt throw all support on whatever they come up with we need to wait and see for the details id estimate that fleshing out this concept to a good level of detail would take about 1 week and if they commit to it it would take like half a year to implement so its quite serious undertaking
i agree this is needed specifically with the corporation  alliance logos and manufacturing stamps
i dont support the idea of having personalization it seem cool but at the end of the dayhaving another issue for the clientservers to figure out before going into a major engagement jumping through gates etc etc just seems like a larger problem than anything it could bring into the gameand im pretty sure there will be some ways to custimize things once amb is fully deployed for people to go crazy withleave teh ships alone
they had to make a lot of changes to slow all the ships down i dont see any sense in going back over speed again so soon or ever to be honest
i see a lot of people who honestly believe that speed tactics should not be part of a well designed space ship combat game i find it hard to understand since logically it makes perfect sense that space ship warfare would have speed and maneuverability as cornerstone of many strategies not only it makes sense from theoretical point of view it also makes good sense in terms of fun factor  as more fast paced combat tends to stimulate stronger emotional response  more excitement
they overly nerfed something that wasnt nearly as broke as they made it seem speeds were bad but most people agreed that though change was needed their patch was over compensating for a problem god forbid they should have done half of what they did to start with the other parts on the back burner to patch in fast if the first attempt wasnt enoughhell most people just wanted more counters to speed and all else could have been left alone instead we got speed nerfed to oblivion counters added on top of it and the result is a disaster for any sort of close range warfare besides rr
the nerf was needed imo but did go too far pushing speedagility up to more of a middleground would be nice although im not sure your changes are the ones to do it ludicrous speed is bad speed as a tactic is good though and is something that is missing a bit from current mechanics
i didnt say they shouldnt be or cant still be i do believe that it was rampant and most people couldnt compete with what some dedicated players ran with because they could yea it was fun to do yes fights could be fast paced but to assume it needs another overhaul because ofeverything it used to be is a bit absurd with everything they changed the game just got slower though webs took a hit during this and scrams now kill mwdsi for one wouldnt have cared if they left it alone but its already been done and i think there are more things that need work on than another speed changei dont think thats the case there isnt anyone stopping people from running speed fit ships now maybe not to the same effect as before but i think thats due more to the counters than anything else even if they left everything alone and added only the counters it would still take reasonably the same styles of ships it takes now to catch a speedy ship being slower as everything is other than the frigate buffminus inties it still seems the bigger issue has become the counters theyre more detrimental to these styles of gangs
i also think speeds need rebalancing taking care mostly of the smaller ships first of all interceptors interceptors meant to intercept ships thus they really need to get there in no minute and since they have paper thin defenses their only mean of surviving is speedimo interceptors need drastic changes id even consider whether give them a rolebonus that mwd survives scrambling they are too light so cannot drift through scram range at least for 1 of every racial interceptors instead of the prop jam cap bonus  like ranis it has no wd and ws range bonus so it has to get in scram range if wants to scram otherwise should be overpimped and unlike ares that has wdws range bonus so only overpimped ships can scram it if flown properlyspeedcentric cruisers and hacs need some small changes
yeah but when have you ever known ccp to do something in multiple steps that would imply that they didnt overcompensate enough the first time i think the fastest ive ever seen anything get fixed is the year and a half it took to even start making black ops viable ccp simply does not revisit things and make second rounds of changes anywhere near as often as theyd have to for your suggestion to work
why does everyone assume speed tanking had anything to do with nanoships whether or not the people who whined noticed a nanovaga going say 8k a second might be hard to hit but its also moving too fast for its own guns to track with the exception of the ishtar nanoships had to slow down to deal damage making themselves vulnerable the thing is theyd only do this when it was convenient if they thought they would die theyd just fly off disengaging the rapier heavy neuts etc all good counters but only if the nanoships chose to engage you cannot lock a 56k a second ship before it flies 40km away from you especially as its unlikely to start 0km from you so to all those who never flew nanos or knew how they worked they could speed tank but not while fighting they were paper thin when caught but good at disengaging they did not go 20 kmsecond they went about 56 on most good fits just because a faction fit high grade snake vagabond with a claymore and a faction microwarpdrive overheating hit 20kmsecond does not mean it was a common or b practical see also the rarity of high grade snake clones with multibillion isk ships and a command ship to provide bonuses overheating constantly  with that out of the way i supported the nanonerf not because i think nanoships were invincible or had amazing speed tanks or they go 20kmsecond and my drake cant hit them it was diversity a gang would be reported before ship types were even known i would estimate it would look something like vagabond vagabond vagabond zealot zealot zealot zealot ishtar ishtar ishtar rapier falcon falcon nothing but nanohacs rapiers and falcons always every day for months a new gang oh hey we get to fight nanoships again it was clearly a broken mechanic due to the ease of disengaging it was too easy now its a bit too hard to skirmish you can warp off easily enough but floating around at long ranges while on the field has taken a significant hit honestly the nano patch would have been fine with just the nanopoly changes and stacking penalties the mwd speed nerf unnecessary removing the booster overkill nerfing snakes why lowering base speeds i would be in support of adding say 1025 speed to most ships a max speed in space always seemed a bit silly to begin with  but the way the game is coded too much more would bring imbalance to counter this give the rapier some teeth again maybe a 5 web strength bonus per level along with the range  also i find it ironic that ccp thought it would be a good idea to nerf webs because fighting inside web range was suicidal only to add a module with more or less the same range that ruins you just as badly as webs used to the warp scrambler they might as well have just changed the names the effect is the same i do not support changing the ship massesbonuses individually nerfing the way people fly now to make a ship into a nanoship hurts variety rather than helps it just give the option to have it fit either way rather than nerfing its damage and boosting its speed question for the op though why do you assume range and speed are mutually exclusive its a combination of the two if youre faster and have range you have the advantage close range and speed only mix if youre trying to get into range quickly rather than maintaining range see deimos as opposed to the vagabond
i like current speeds just fine in fact i havent any complain bout them in over a year
a ceptor once dropped that much its random but definitely worth it if you want to remove hacs from the market and inflate their prices
oh for sure it can happen but what are the odds this is why i ask about the average hac not the bestcase hac the best case is a salvage thats worth more than the hull but if you want to go sding to find out if you can get that youd better be prepared to enjoy your lorentz fluid and trigger units
about the tech 3 stuff you not only have the hull itself but all the subsystems with all the possibilities of configurations i dont see it being easy or even probable to come up with a proper insurance estimate
such a proposal would mean ccp need to actively stay up to date to make sure the default payouts are below the average price its a difficult thing to execute and would also end up raising t2 prices such that theres probably little reduction in cost in the end t2t3 prices are caused by greater player demand then there is supply thats why for these items the prices are especially sensitive to ebb and flow of demand caused by patches or other trends
i have seen it on multiple occassions now people that are afk harassing a ratting system by cloaking up and going afk for hrs for u guys not in 00 a hostile in system means u have to be extra careful and ideally not ratmine in the systems beltsimo this should not be possible gameplay and other players should only be influenced by people that are actually behind the computer or at least the game should be geared towards thatimo there is an easy fix for afkcloaking add a cycle to cloaks of like 10 mins and when the cycle ends a window pops up where u get 20 seconds to decide if u want to stay cloaked without decloaking that way if u go afk you will be able to be probed out after 10 minutes because ur cloak dropped if u r actually cloaked and behind the keyboard you can just click yes in the popup window and stay cloaked without anything happening
it looks like someone is at the wrong end of a local desensitization campaign
not supportedrisk vs reward either you risk it and get your bounties or you dock up or you go into the neighbor system
no support stalking a system is a valid tactic a good cloaker wants you to think he is afk even when he is not your proposal is easily exploited by macro
changing the game like that for people that seem to be afk and cloaked is a waste of time in my opinion however i think the idea that was once mentionednot sure if its still an idea or being worked on where cloaking really doesnt erase sig radius it only lowers it if that were to be implemented afk cloakers would start to be eaten on a daily basis until people stopped doing
frankly there is no difference in someone being afk cloaked and being afk in a station unless you plan to dock and check every station in a system frankly you should be as vigilant as possible at all times when in an area that requires itno support
you are not talking about me are you dont worry this problem will go away when ccp finally nerfs local chat
lol i am not saying its not a valid tactic hell its a great tactic nothing against cloaking whatsoever what my problem is is that i can log on in a hostile pocket cloak up and go to my girlfriend for the evening while the guys active in that system have to worry over a ghost player that is actually having different kinda fun
not supported
would you like to keep firing on your targetthen wed be absolutely sure that no one was ever afk and the events of gameplay were only influenced by a real life player
and there i am cloaked up in some 0004 system doing whatever business i might have there and rl comes into play and i have to leave my keyboard for whatever reasonsee what im getting at
no support cloaking is a valid tactic an afk cloaker is not a threat you dont have to be extra careful to avoid an afk cloaker theyre afk you counter your own point with that clearly youre not sure that they are afk if you were 100 sure they were afk why are you being careful are you afraid an afk cloaker will gank you it comes down to this if theyre afk theyre not a threat if theyre a threat and thus not afk then your proposal is meaningless also if you really do need to go afk for some reason why should you automatically lose your ship to probers a good solution to removing the afk cloaker threat would be to remove local then you dont have to see them it is a bit silly that local will throw up a red flag to a cloaked ship making it no less capable to stealthily approach you without intense patience until you think theyre afk but again you cant cry afk cloaker when a cloaker who has been there a while kills you theyre obviously not afk
alter reinforcement timer engagement from 25 percent to 90 percent of control tower shield in this scenario one could disrupt hostile control towers with a smaller fleet yet have to meet up full force when reinforcement timer ends to destroy it this also gives attacker an advantage given that the defender does not have an alt nearby to set correct stronthium levels
proposal doesnt make sense
currently control towers enter reinforcement mode when shields get below 25 percent make it 90 percent instead
oh now i understand so it takes away the ability for an alliance to generate a quick response in favor of forcing them to respond for ones only chance to save a towerone of the few good things about pos wars is that you can stront the towers so your people dont have to set their alarm clocks to 3am every day that is just way too much stress on an already stressful aspect of the game
to alter your phrase a bit one of the few bad things about pos wars is that one can stront the towers so my people have to set their alarm clocks to 3am every daythis just shifts the usage of alarm clocks to the defender
troll
this
thisnot supported
not supported an idea like this means that timezone wars become alarmclock wars just to defend yes i am well aware the attacker needs to alarmclock it if the defense is good in an time zone war the other thing is when you rf pos shield stays at 25 till it comes out if you were to start at 90 when it came out the pos would still have 375 million shields out of 50mil instead of 125 also with a dread fleet this gives about 5 minutes to get to the tower and restront it to a resonable hour for the defender which could be nearly impossible removing the defenders ability to restront is a serious advantage to the attackers that they dont deserve
meh i dunno much as id like to see one i think mining income is pretty low as it is and this would devalue mining for most people considerably
yes macro miners and afk players need their income increased 
it would not make every other mining ship obsolete because it would only be allowed to fly in lownullsecurity space in order to highsec mine youd have to use a hulkof course this is a part of the risk same with rorquals rorquals probably have as much trouble if not more than other mining ships in that security spacewell ganking is part of the risk same with the rorqual same with everything else sure the ships will be tough but theyll be vulnerable just like any other capital ship the number of drones from the configuration i suggested would give it a good defense but it wont have fighters which is a significant dealwell this would be the perfect counter this could singlehandedly mine a belt in short order as well it would also make holding nullsec territory more valuable which goes back to the complaints about nullseci disagree doing what youre suggesting makes the rorqual obsolete im only thinking straight mining ship but on a super scale also ten strip miners is impossible with the current game mechanics unless they made a midslot version that could only fit onto that ship

no no you didnt your profits will drop when someone scans down your plex regardless of whether they scan it down with this loophole or not your primary argument against this tactic is that you only have 6 seconds and need to mash your directional scanner to see something coming which is simply untrue you stay aligned and when you see someone landing on your grid you hit warpold system you stay aligned you see probes on scan you warp outnew system you stay aligned you see ships on grid you warp outsorry how is that any different in both cases youre forced to dock or safe up until the hostiles leave and in both cases assuming you arent afk you get your ship out alivelrn2argue plox
alternatively i do think it would be reasonable and make sense to be allowed to add probes to the overview so if you were really that scared about being probed out you could setup an overview just to scan for probes thus not having to scroll through the endless list of the unchecked use active overview settings box
well then you dont make sense if you mean you are trying to protect your ship whilst it is in a mission  then it is very easy to do aligning scanning scouting checking killboards checking corps you state you have never been killed in your mission despite being unexpectedly probe so you obviously have no problem with thisbut if you mean you want to protect the mission itself then no amount of scanning will do this even if we go back to pre patch scan times 22 seconds with max skills you would not protect the mission simply have more time to spot the probes and warp outeven if ccp were to give you an auto scanner your mission would still be busted and you would be unable to return to it to complete it  so would lose the isk and standingslowsec is tougher then highsec and rightly so its about surviving and is in fact very easy to do its not about risk free isk  if that is what you want go to high sec
difference between two systemspreapocrypha i could still mission even with neutrals and pirates in the system as long as probes were not visible on my scanner because there was a reasonable probability that i wasnt being scannedpostapocrypha probers can do their probing with directional scanner almost exclusively only having to rely on probes for about 5 seconds what this translates is dont mission with even one neutral in systemagain before apocrypha i could still mission even with neuts and pirates in the system as long as i was paying attention after apocrypha i cannot take that chance anymore because the odds stack greatly against meyes there are other precautions i can take not to get killed such as dropping a can at warpin aligning etc this doesnt protect my mission itself it simply gives me chance to get out of there aliveanything else i do even bringing in my own blob will not allow me to bring my isk earner out my pve ship basically one neutral in system  dont make isk
i dont just want to survive in low sec i want to make isk in low sec i know how to survive in low sec quite well but the reasons for me being there are dwindling i can no longer assume that if i dont see probes on my scanner chances are im not being probed  thinking this after apocrypha is a very rash decision by the way i dont want a failproof system 100 accuracy i just want a system that just as preapocrypha gives me a fair chance at detecting probes that is all im asking for a 5second window is ridiculous
dude i dont understand what part of this you dont get if someone scans out your mission now its the same as if they scanned it out preapoc the only difference is that you dont find out until theyve almost found you hence you align out and hit warp when you see a hostile on gridplease explain to me how this is at all different from the prepatch systemyou discover that a hostile player is scanning out your mission you dock up nothing has changed except for the time it takes to find you
its not the samein one scenario im still able to mission as long as im careful and watching my onboard scanner postapocrypha i cannot take that risk my scanner is unreliable one situation i can still make isk on another situation i cantfor examplepreapoc 5 neutrals in system i can still mission up until point i see probes on scannerpostapoc scanner is almost completely useless im better off dockingsee the difference
and remember that preapoc it took time placing the probes in place at least it took more than just 5 seconds scanner for mission runners is now crap it doesnt help unless youre spamming it every 5 seconds
and if you insist its the same then just give me the thumbs up in increasing the window in detecting probes to something much higher than 5 seconds since after all its the same and wont affect anything right its all im asking and as you put it its the same
no it didnt i would have bookmarks everywhere in system literally 100 bookmarks in the mission running systems  and this was by no means a large amount for the pro scannersi would use the d scanner narrow down the direction warp to a close bookmark and drop the highest strength probefrom your posts you seem to have little clue about probingyou talk about pre apoc probes and how great the system was when in fact your looking at the revelation patch where they went from multiple probes to needing only one single probeyou also took nearly four months to realise that the probing system had changed in the apo patch your original thread title was being probed down with no probes on scan you are flying around in low sec without even taking a cursory look at 4 month old patch notes you claim to not be concerned about being killed in a mission as you agree if you take precautions you are very unlikley to be caught but continue to talk about protecting the mission if the mission spot has been located whether bythree probes overlaping pre revelationone single 22 second probe pre apo  my favourite system incidentally4 movable probes and a 5 second scan current situationthe mission is now found you cannot run that mission from then on the method of finding the mission is irrelevant the one and only difference is the timescale you have to get out of your mission but we have agreed using some simple methods you can escape from any mission under the current systemso whats the difference you are confusing a lot of people with your posts they are incoherent perhaps deliberately soskunk
in either situation you just stay aligned and if you see a neutralhostile on grid you warp off theres no reason to even check your scanner for probes just be ready to warp off if they enter your mission
so basically youre telling me forget the broken onboard scanner just warp off once youre found again having my mission deadspace found isnt good for profits do you run missions in low sec for profit i want a way to keep an eye on probes so i dont compromise my mission deadspace
i think you know the onboard scanner now is no good to us yet you insist that things are the same as preapoc ive told you alreadypreapoc i would not have a need to warp off if i didnt see probes with my onboard scanner because it meant there is a reasonable chance that i wasnt being probed even with pirates in the system i could still run mission by keeping my eye on the scannernow my pve ship spends most of its time docked up because compromising my mission deadspace is way too easy now
im getting the feeling you dont care about the consequences of your proposal for other areas of gameplay

sharing an account is not a bannable offence just notice how many of the supercapital pilots that are shared aswell as recent shared accounts inbetween ebank members
horrible ideaeven a small corp with 6 members could end up swarming their opponents 247 with a dozen ships operated in shift rotation by the corp members also corp theft would then include the option of character theftsharing accounts should be a bannable offence human resources are strategic resources too it is just lame to swap specialized characters around for maximum efficiency it is bad enough that is already done by some but it should never be officially supported
this is pretty wacky but i think i like it i expect ccp will probably veto it and its entirely possible that they will have a good reason to do so but its worth asking about
yesi support this new fun and sneaky way to initate corp thefts
needs log off fleet command
k i want the views of csm and people who know what the game is about only not some random skms are made to show who is involved in a fight for that everyone in the gang should be on the km regardless if their role was logistics dps or just someone putting a bubble or decloaking everyone should be on the km
this csm responce is no xd
nein
not supportedhowever preset configurations of probes would be nice or the ability to move them all at once and scan time is down to like 5secsless or more
you can move probes all at once  hold shift as you drag a probealso not supported on the change  there has to be some countermeasure to a covops visible probes seems a fine one if youre having a problem use the directional to narrow them down before you drop probes  thats totally invisibleexcepting local of course
id like to see probes which could give out false signatures people have been asking for those for ages anywaymaking probing even a bigger cat and mouse game
just let them do their job you wont die a horrible death whether takes one day or six
i just thought id ask i always see ccp doing things for nul sec and this new fiasco that is called wormholes that will eventually turn into a perk for nul sec once again they get all the ships and rewards for game playing while we sit in the back bench to be satisfied with crumbs like marauders that only fix a problem that ccp created when they made scanning mission runners more possible that was hardly a step forward rather a lame attempt to keep things from getting worsei might accept all this nonsense except what about the chance to invade nul sec and claim something for empire this facion war is only against npc and has rather bogged down if ccp want to force us to pvp why not make it worth the while for pve playershave a nice day
they roll out new missions and exploration content fairly regularly its not flashy but it is new content i dont think that they did their usual batch with apocrypha but from what i hear about that dev cycle they probably had to reassign people in order to get it all out the door properly expect another hundred or so npc encounters in the winter expansion id wager and if you consider marauders a crumb youve obviously never flown one
the wormhole expansion was a huge pve boost im sorry if you dont like it  personally i think its a million times more entertaining than the same old snoozefest level 4 missions additionally ccp has already said theyre working on level 4 mission arcsfor a game that really does center around pvp whether its market pvp or pew pew they put plenty of effort into pve
well they are hiring 2 people solely to create new missions so i guess they will be soon
awesome erik thanx
the case i faced today was equally absurd and demonstrativei enter an isolated low sec system and notice few ships out there hoorey yet another possible encounter so i check the belts kill some rats while still scanning the entire system trying to track those ships down ok i eventually meet those get my fight get out and now have to wait like 15 minutes without showing to gatestation guns thats the way system have worked for agesit might have some minor issues like 15 minutes being a too long timer or gate guns updating it silently in case you decided to dock and wait for gcc to end in a complete safety im fine with it at least it has some logic behind itso i hang around killing some belt rats and all of a sudden notice my gcc is suspeciously long i hover a mouse over it and thats it timer towards players is about to end and a global one is now 15 again im getting ed off but playing eve actually gets you getting used to troubles like this one so i warp to a safe spot set my alignment getting ready to spend another 15 minutes of pure boredomfew minutes later oh wait is the gcc now 15 minutes againim getting really mad now since i have to waste even more time dealing with it meanwhile i write a stuck petition  thats it i got stuck cause while writing it the gcc got renewed yet again can you imagine once again for gods sake thats just inexpressiblewe arent allowed to post gm messages here so ill try to put the very gist of it im stuck blahblahblah try docking and staying docked for 15 mintes the gcc is being renewed while someone shoots your property in space such as cans and wrecks  this is a game breaking bug btw weve had a same issue a while ago with the only difference the bug causing a general pvp aggro timer so it happened in 00 as wellso i dock at this point nah thats an intended gameplay  so we now need to search for every peace of junk we might have left in the system and blow it up dont you consider this is a bug yeah thats the way it is supposed to work thats a risk associated with low sec pvp here the conversation ends basicallyok ive waited patiently for 15 minutes gave it few more just cause i know how it works and undock in a pod timer is off is it nope im a global criminal yet againthats outrageous i cant play this game by these rules and have nothing better than just logging off35 minutes lateri log in and the first thing i notice is im still flagged oh come onbut im a stubborn dude i leave the client running and go afk im getting sure i had waited for 15 plus about 10 or even 15 extra minutes undock bingo gccit seems like i simply can not leave the area before i manually blow all the npc wrecks i had spawned meh ok lets do itim now checking all the god damned belts to actually get one or two npc wrecks i blow them up and proceed to my safe spot few minutes later im enjoing a brand new gcc wow  i can tell you how easily exploitable this crap is imagine an isolated system with no stations at all say you have fighted someone over there in the beltanomaly killed a rat in the process sometimes you just have to then the blob came in and now you have to get out alright you warp out to a spot and start counting the time down while still checking for any probes etc but those dudes in the blob can essentially guard your wreck as if you really need to possess the wreck a rat had left and renew your gcc till youll finaly get bored and either log off with a timer suicidally enter the hisec gate or just till youre getting probed down and killedand just the whole idea of renewing gcc via shooting the can is artificial at best anyway it was recognized as a bug in case of general pvp aggro why should gcc work the other way
blowing up all the crap eventually allowed me to leave the system though as i stated gcc was reset once again after i shooted down the cansim very sad cause of this issue the low sec piracy is the only fun and casual game activity left and seeing it that bugged is simply dreadful for meim sure im not alone and there are others out there sharing my playing style those who enjoy flying solo and visiting isolated almost blobfree lowsec areasi do hope csm will address this asapi got severely offended so this thread will be bumping till the issue is fixed or till i get a warning
halfway down on the 2nd page is unacceptableccp lets fix thiswinter release isnt asking to much
when and where we sexually assault a lot of people and not always when we mean to  it all starts to blur after a while palso seconding the awesomeness of af gangs but just coz they rock doesnt mean that theyre perfect or that they cant be improved without attracting the nerfbat  which as wang will attest is my primary fear in this endeavour i think its totally possible hence my support
supported but i suspect this will be one of those long running things that ccp never resolve or even explain along with the bugged address book not updating as it should when people log onoff
aggression timers are for acts of aggressionshould be pretty obvious
agreeing with semper
not supported i wish i could support these changes but you would destroy my thrasher fit which is the only cost efficant small scale ship out there in my opinion
supported currently the only thing i see the destroyer class ships good for is salvaging this was not their intended role therefore they really need some love from the ccp devs to allow them to accomplish their stated mission kill frigate class ships as the destroyers currently are it is a matter of luck as to whether you will kill the frigate or the frigate kills you
i brought this up a while back its been brought up a thousand times honestly ive kinda given up on it
yes but we have a new hero if dierdra gets a meeting with ccp about this we should lay on the cheerleaders and champagne until the devs are drunk enough to give rockets a 1000 damage boost
well i hope you get itim just jaded and half asleepnighty
holy crap yes please fix rocketsop has it correct they do low dps on paper and you dont even get that as a abing battleship can outrun your explosion volocity
ive only ever used rockets once and they sucked when i diddefinitely time for the devs to start fixing their creations instead of spamming new content its getting kinda old tbcfh
rockets arent viable as islets get this done for the winter release
i approve of this message and or service
supported
yeah this really needs looking into when your locking down few hundred bpos weekly it gets really ing annoying
except youre forgetting the curse which is amarr and gets both a range and potency bonus also the falconrook had a range bonus until it was nerfed very recently clearly ccp did not design the game around ship bonuses being based on who youre allied with by that logic we should remove the arbitratorcursepilgrims drone bonus because amarr are allied with caldari who are the enemy of the gallente who use drones meaning it doesnt work to give amarr a drone ship

web effectiveness would proove usefull

you havent clarified in the original post which of the current ship bonuses your proposed change will replaceare you wanting to replace the 60 bonus to stasis webifier rangeif so i dont agree with the change what good would the increase of web strength be if an interceptor or vaga can speed out of your range before you can lockweb themif youre wanting to replace the 75 bonus to target painter effectiveness per level which is the minmatar cruiser skill bonus therefore always giving a 375 bonus then im fully behind it it will mean every huginnrapier pilots web gets a base of 75 speed reduction and only their recon skill level dictates the range they can web it also does away with the pointless target painter bonus that itself could either use attention currently or just be scrappedso which is it
supporting this even it means losing the painter bonus
additional bonus scrapreduce the loltastic painter bonus or whatever works this proposal is in conjunction with the web range bonusnot a replacementyou can relax and support now i will amend op slightly to clarify this point though 
who paints anyways 
imo ditch the rof bonus if youre going to do this recons are to do ew not dps plus it provides an excuse to change the huginn away from the painful splitweapons setup
sounds like a nobrainer to me wouldnt hold my breath and expect ccp to implement the obvious though
not supported i agree with this guy
hows this for a pair of suggestionsif you log off and are agrod before you disappear then you recieve the full 15 minute timer currently it takes a highly skilled actual skill and probe skillz to be able to probe someone out within one minute unless they have probes out in the general area just make a safespot and logout there tbhyou are anchored to the point where you logged out from ie you log out on a gate if you log back in and log out again instantly you will always warp back to that point this stops people logging inout of the same spot multiple times the anchor point is reset once you land on it and movewarp away
i supportbut redsplat you know that ccp sucks at fixing lag in combat so i would extended to 3 log out attempts due to desynclag issues in battlesand also client should map if realy ctrlq was pressed and client just didnt simple crash
although i agree most things you say red the issue is pretty much fixedpeople with any type of aggro wont warp off for until the timer is up besides red if at least one of your guys cant tackle a jump frieghtor before it ninja logs thats kinda sad
not interested in stopping the original ctrl q as there is no way to know if it is legit and i dont want to punish players with prehistoric connections so i think you are missing the point kindado want to stop abuse of the mechanics by multiple ctrl qsedit im not in the gatecamping buisness but be aware that people can logged while still cloaked from the jump and that freighters arent the only shipclass prone to abusing loggofskis
yes this and supported
i love how something pretty useful gets overlooked on the forums while posts about being able to paint our ships pink get replies out the arse 
idealet tractor beams tractor any wreckif a second tractor locks on from another person make it deactivate both tractorsflame away
why no vector addition as for the topic id say it makes sense though i can just imagine the howls of outrage from the missioners maybe if it turned them red to prevent excessive griefing but yeah its annoying to have a buddy im doing missions with and have tractorability depend on who got the last shot in in any case tentative support
i approvewould be willing to allow aggro
yes but only if it caused aggro and if multiple tractor beams would mix vector and strengthotherwise i would have it far too easy with my tanked orca
if tractoring someone elses wreck flags me as a thief in cases where taking loot would if theres vector addition and if i can use multiple tractor beams on the same object yes do it for cans too
about damn time
this is wrong all gang members can tractor beam it furthermore i think all mission wrecks are owned by the person who accepted the mission no matter who got the final blow
supported
i know its all fine if you do missions with corpmates but i recall having trouble when you do them with people who arent in corp been a while since ive done that so my memories might be off
very sensible idea how exactly does a tractor beam tell a hunk of debris you shot up from one that someone else shot up
just fleet member is enough doesnt have to be corpmate also setting out of corp friends 10 helps avoids the accidental kill from corpmates because your friend is flashy from looting wrecks in different systems whistlesanyway to the op i think the balance is fine it gives the owner a slight advantage over the loot thief that said i cant support it
if you are in the same gang or corporation the tractor work flawlesslyif you are not the wreck belong to the person that accepted the mission you think mission runners will be the only people protesting think about people tractoring jetcan away from miners locking and moving jetcans before you can anchor them stealing mission critical loot from range and a thousand other small and large way to annoy the other players bad idea
boost epeen growth
get it done allready thank you
lovin the gms that when a dev is quoted calling something an exploit says the dev is mistaken then closes the petition when you ask for proof of the dev recalling what he said previouslystill out a kronos ers
i suggest that the system be altered so that many of the faction ships and modules be available on the market much the way that faction ammo is availablethe best part is that if you really want to sell it by contact you can do that too the way you can with any item so overall it will give more flexibility to both the buyers and the sellerstldrthe contract system is slow awkward has no way to browse either allow some faction items to be sold on market or make contracts browsable and not such a slow crappy system note you will still be able to make a contract for anything you want just like before
i totaly disagree it would destroy a hugh trade market
care to explain how putting items on the market actually destroys them
you can search contracts for the whole universe the market only the current region youd also eliminate several classes of scams lame ones for the most part but still a notable part of the game
you can make a contract for anything from one round of small antimatter to a vargur your point it moot scammers will adapt i wouldnt worry about them but for the most part 90 of all the faction contracts are in jita 44 anyway might as well drop them into the market tab for quicker browsing
not supportedwhy would you want to be unable to search the entire universe for the best deal on a faction item if anything your proposal gives less flexibility not more
so using your logic everything should be sold via contracts for more flexibility
i agree with this also it would make it possible for people to test faction ships and items on the test server
nope faction items should be kept seperate from the market and the hoy poloy and the plebians if one wants a ming vase or some fine caviar one does not go to ones supermarket one instead looks up classified ads approaches dealers and such likeon a more serious note it will destroy a lot of visibility certain rarer items have if the person selling it just throws it on the market
yea keep in mind you can search contracts across all regions it would be pretty difficult to find a lot of rare items if you had to track down which region had them on the market or just hope its jita then lose it on the undock
im entirely in support of this itd allow for far better data analysisaverage prices say and a much easier time searching for items exchange contracts should only be necessary for researchedcopied blueprints and rigged ships they have use in other places but they shouldnt be so necessary for such broad swathes of the market
some people are commenting on being able to view across all regions what youre forgetting unless theres a skill i dont know about that extends it you can only accept contracts in your current region thus the only convience of the current contracting over all is just to be able to cross reference the average price of an item anywhere at onceim torn on whether to support or not
no there is no such skill and remember also that showing prices across all regions helps for common faction goodscn launchers and stuff but for the rarer stuff its often less useful than a market would be if theres zero for sale you get absolutely nothing under the current system whereas with a market you could at least head to forge and see what the last one sold for
why it not done yet  would save me hours  got to be easy to implement surely
some people have said eve is more of a scifi simulator and in most scifi simulation games that inculdes captain your ship going planet side on occasion and walking about in the stations meaning wis is a huge milestone for the simulation side of the game so i have two words for younot supported
going further walking in stations will be mostly created by a ccp group who are working on a totally different gamethey are pretty much going to copypaste what that team did for walking in stat
not supported the day ccp concentrates too much on fixing the bugs instead of adding new content is the day eve will diebolded the only edit required to turn your op into the generic post that appears before every expansion
not supported quantum rise was mostly game changes bugfixes and no new content save for the orca quantum rise was also my least favorite expansion due to this its important to realize that the art team of eve doesnt write the code the people fixing bugs are not the same people who are designing ambulation of course if youd like to have the art managers writers and other creative groups go in to rewrite the code and fix bugs im sure things will turn out just fine i would like to see eve expand beyond internet spaceships into a thriving scifi setting with more than spaceships dont play the game like its a job and rage over the little things adding depth and character to the game are more important than fixing some minor bug somewhere in the game that cost you a killmail one time and of course theres the fact that the people doing bugfixes are not going to stop because a new aspect is being added to the game  if all these people had their way eve would be a flawless game with no backstory that ran in ascii a text based adventure why yes id like to fly my ship up graphics fluff fix the bugs background fix the bugs new ships to fly no new content only bug fixes new tactics modules areas professions etc every game has bugs if you try to stop all new content until every bug is fixed the players will get bored and the game will die remember youre still in an rpg here internet spaceships are not in fact serious business im in support of anything that makes the game more fun for me to play whether or not i have to oh dear god why tap tab twice to fix my overview once every few days
as was said earlier why would an insurance company insure a ship in eve period most of the ships in eve are lost in deliberate pvp or pve engagements any insurance company in their right mind would never insure a ship used for combat especially if it they only charge a fraction of what they pay out if you want to make that argument at the least be consistent and say no insurance in wars missions or for any explicitly combat capable shipalso to a different comment almost every one of my friends myself included has suicide ganked people in high sec on multiple occasions yet none of them have done it explicitly for profit often they didnt even bother picking up the modules considering how many pirate and generally naughty corps ive been in it sounds to me in a very anecdotal way to be awfully like its an uncommon occurrence to gank for profit so i really dont see what this is aimed at other than simply not liking the lulz aspect which is perfectly legitimate honestly but at least you could say that outright
insurance is still a game mechanic and not a company removing insurance for self destructing a ship would just be annoying if youve paid the insurance its more profitable to destruct an unrigged ship than to sell it if insurance doesnt cover self destructs it just means you accept a mission and fly it naked into the mission and let it die that way or belt rats have a corp mate shoot it etc the change is nice from a insurance is a real business rp angle but does nothing for the game also please remember that concord is not the insurance company and does not rule the galaxy theyre just a police force for capsuleers not the government in other words if concord says youre a criminal the insurance company doesnt necessarily agree again if insurance needs to be realistic why shouldnt concord be realistic why should they have a 100 success rate and respond in seconds if the answer is because its a game mechanic then the same applies to insurance and no change is needed if insurance is illogical and needs to be removed then concord in its current state is just as illogical and just as in need of a change
no insurance provider in any realm of reality or unreality will ever disagree with being told not to pay
im totally against this change but i absolutely love this point honestly dont know why i read this thread since most of the people posting in it clearly didnt and made the same 3 or 4 points over and over againbut here i am i agree with the point that was made or at least implied earlier on in the thread the bigger picture point that high sec is a pretty safe and sterile place to be and making it even safer is both unnecessary and bad for the game as a whole i find this pointless dancing back and forth across the line between arguments from mechanics and arguments from storyworld consistency well i said it already pointlessi like that hisec is relatively safe because sometimes i just want to chill out whilst playing around in my internet spaceships but it doesnt need to be saferand yes this mechanic would make it safer by making suicideganking less common whether or not that is the intention of the shift is completely irrelevant drastically increasing the barrier to entry of the activity while decreasing its profitability will cause it to happen less often duhi think suicide ganking just to grief people is pretty dumb to be honest and would be unlikely to engage in the activity myself im not counting anything out completely though  but i believe that the general trend in this game towards making eve a safer more boring place to live is a bad onethere are a lot of things about this game that i dont like or agree with but i understand and respect that most of those things in one way or another contribute to the core design principles that make eve as a whole a game i really enjoy hisec suicide gankers are poopyface meanyheads but i respect their right to be poopyface meanyheads and see no reason to further abridge that rightfinally i feel it is worth reinforcing the point that eve is anarchocapitalistic bat crazy land where sure why the hell wouldnt the cops pay out insurance and blow people up in fact if insurance were realistic in this game in that it were profitable theyd be thrilled to do it to sell more insurance meaning that the problem is with insurance in the game in general not making sense not in this particular type of situationwell that was a rambling meandering post for which i now profusely apologize
but they would object to no one buying their insurance because they void the payment any time some corporation says dont pay realize the insurance company operates in lowsec00 as well dont see a lot of concord there concord is only the most important corporation to highsec carebears who think concord rules the galaxy
i think insurance should be brought in line with how real insurance operates as it is they always pay out more than they collect insurance should be expensive and tied to the driving record of the pilot you lose a ship every day it should be astronomical you are a successful pilot dont lose ships constantly it should be cheaper but not cheap every time you lose a ship it should really hurt not be something to laugh off
not supported
i disagreemost zero sec dwellers are bigger carebears then their high sec counterparts zero sec is just a big money making machine now if local was removed from zero sec i could imagine uping profits but as it stands most people just log when hostiles enter local
yupnot supported too
lol u are deffinaly never been in 00 u make more isk per hour by grinding l4s than ratting or plexing in 00 the plexes arent even worth the effort cause u always need to split the rewards becasue u cant solo them that brings back the issue of security less isk more risk in 00
that at least partially is a problem born at alliancecorp level if you look ratting vs level 4 missions even if ratting in good 00 is different from ratting in bad 00 and doing level 4 missions for caldari corps is different from doing them for gallente corps 00 is not convenient against level 4 missions but you are forgetting the corpalliance level returns most of the 00 cost are on the shoulders of the corp members while the best return are used by the corp the good corps share tat at all levels the bad hoard them only for the top echelons there is not a real corp level gain from running level 4 missions while there is a decent to extremely large corp level gain from controlling 00 space only part of the corp level gains are used for the 00 security if you pretend to get both way better player level and corp level returns from 00 you are asking for a very skewered balance
just raising bounties is a pretty hamhanded fix but yes 00 life is full of risk yet the average pilot is not really rewarded for this risk the only people really benefitting are large alliance directors like me who swim in vaults filled with dysprosium like scrooge mcduck and attempt to confer benefits on their alliance membership through dread reimbursements etc i want to see 00 more worhtwhile for the average alliance member and thus hopefully convince more empiredwellers to come play as long as missions are worth as much as 00 iskmaking this will never happen
confirming we have a rper
this makes a lot of sense in a game where your body is nothing but a convenient vessel oh science we can transplant a pod pilots mind into as many bodies as we want but creating a clone that looks different heresy
rather than walking round stations which is boring imo allow corp mates to man the guns in ur battleships using skills to train similar to pos gunner skills imo bs and bigger would have this however you could have the large mining ships allow a few corp mates inside as well so they could man the mining lasors or whatever you carebears do the skills could give u a 1 bonus to rof per level etcin regards to traveling in a corp mates ship a new transport ship could be introduced with a skill that allows extra passengers per skill entrepenaurs could charge passengers they could any carry pods obviously
i might agree as long as you stop using that ridiculous corpies expressioni run mishies with my corpies in our coveys to get iskies for our mommies jesus christ what is wrong with you people you speak like four year olds please visit your user settings to reenable images
i think you forgot goonies
not sure what you are referring to sir  i am honoured to have been trolled by the elite goon thread destroyers 
no hes right it is pretty ing annoying why cant you use real words
ok ive changed it so can we now get back to the original post please 
oka corpmate docks with my ship and im too lazy to press f1f8 to activate my guns so this allows him to do it for me and he has to train a new skillbook to allow this im not really sure what this achieves or how it makes the game any better ccp have had all sorts of headaches with allowing players to interact with each others ships like that see the foreverbroken clone vat bays and it really doesnt seem to add anything to justify the coding effort
1 have a corp mate man the guns because youre too lazy to actually play the game and want to get kills for being logged on 2 fly your own ship have your corp mate fly his ship and then have two ships instead of one gee i cant decide
butomg who will get the killmailtldr  no
i cannot imagine any reason why this would be a good idea
1 put your two chars in one corp2 mine with one park the other one in bs3 link the guns to your miner so you wont even have to change the window to respond to attack4 5 profit
i believe the attacker should have the advantange and moment of surprise the defender already have an advantage that they live in the area and have tons of more control towers the attacker must chew down
somehow i like this proposal cause its favoring attackers and real men endorse alarm clock ops
this change would make every single cpuusing pos mod completely worthless also you could run around with a big fleet and reinforce an entire systemconstellation in short order and make any sov holding alliance hate life even more than they already do holding sov already is more work than reward and this would further skew that continuumthis is an awful idea it really has absolutely no redeeming qualities
ehhhow is this any different then current situation only difference is that the defender mightmight not make it in time to adjust correct stronthium levelthen why do every alliance insist on having sovereignity and pos in each and every system they own this proposal will actually make alliances more alert and be more selective of where they chose to live i am sure that an 1000 man alliance in an constellation could easily deal with incoming invaders however the same alliance spanning 4 regions might not
interesting but i cant say im really a fan the proper role of a fleet ship is leading a fleet in battle anything else makes them like titans used to be unkillable and stupid moms need a bonus that puts them into fleet fights not into safe spots
no offense but i dont really agree with your judgement that the mom should be leading the charge not directly anywaysbut i also dont think that they should just be a carrier on steroids eitherbetter tank or better gank is not the answer for these ships it needs to be something other than thatwhat i suggest is just one of those optionswhat i suggest could have a very powerful affect on the battlefield especially if used during black ops operations nothing like having a base of operations right next to your targets complete with spare ships and etc if it is scanable is still an open question for me though but many felt strongly about it in the linked thread so im leaving that option open for now
you gave us the rorqual and as far as im concerned was a step forward in game mechanicssadly you limited it to low sec and at the time was probably the right move but now with more ore avaiable in game it would make sense to have ore compression in both empire and low sec with the added ability to compress ores in worm holesit was a great idea and now would make more sense to boost it up a bit rather than the need for bigger cargo holds more cargo bearing shipsuse something you already have established in game but bring it too all of us br argolighthand
not really needed youre always within a jump of a station in highsec and you can move stuff around by just aping ships full of ore if need be the rorq is designed mostly for deep 00 and you shouldnt really need it anywhere else im kind of sympathetic to the wspace argument but i dont think that adding a new ship with this capability is the right way to address that problem not supported

for some reason probably because the feel it is easier to balance them ccp has the habit to add low level missions new level 4 missions are a rarity i doubt i have seen 1 in the last year they have added a couple of level 4 storylines from what i have seeni hope the high level epic story arcs promised for the august mini patch will correct that a bityou see wormholes as some kind of pve boost several players see them as pvp content calling them pve is like calling 00 moon mining or ratting pve content the pvp environment where you do that has a huge impact on the activities making them at least as much pvp as they are pve

i agree with you mr billboard and have experienced most of what you described unfortunately you did not allow for others to give votes of support to the thread when you created itperhaps the best area for discussing changes to the client is the features and ideas discussion section at least it should be i also think that this area ie jita park speakers corner is an appropriate location to discuss ideas as well if enough support is evident it may then be moved to or referenced in the assembly hall as a form of escalation

all missiles need to be brought into par with gun dps currently they do perhaps 5060 the damage potential of a turret based ship that is the contemporary to whatever hull youve got missiles onsure missiles always hit without wrecking or low damage hits but that is offset completely by timetotarget that guns dont have to worry about heck missiles can be outrun even post speed nerfa web should not be a requirement to hit anything in this game an aid yes but it should never under any circumstance be required

supported i would like to see my vengeance and malediction be a bit more viable than the wet noodle throwing objects they are now
now only if each rocket slowed the target down by say 25 per hit for a few seconds or something that would make them useful also increase thier flight time a lot so you dont have to be in thier face to hit the target i dont know something unique like slowing the target down would be cool as a side affect from being hit by rocketsbut yes something needs to be done
even if there is some excessive request here from people that will only be happy if the torpedoes were capable of doing full damage to frigates as it was pre2006 the problem with rockets is real so supported

i will also fraps it from various angles and upload it in hd
i honestly want to see this and whoever doesnt or tries to come up with some pretty carebear excuse not to should be banned

just imagine all the rpgame backstory chronicles that could grow around this terrorist action it would be great
come on just think of all those poor carebears whove never gotten to see a doomsday you wouldnt want them to miss out on the shiny graphics effects would you
i do from time to time with whatever the advanced damp skill is trained it buys you approx 48 sig radius hit to the target if you have missile spammers with you it can help them out a bit it also lets you  kms from silly ranges and with lr ammo loaded into your lolartillery you might actually hit something anywayhugely situational and usually pointless hence easy willingness to reduce it and add the difference to web strength making the painter actually more useful oddly enoughor something along those lines 
toss the pointless painter bonus even when attacking an inty with artilleries 2x painters and 2x webs wont even scratch its paint itll just warp awaya rapierhuginn is committing suicide trying to tackle a vagabond inside warp disruptor range vaga w barrage reaches 30km easily for full damage where an overheated t2 disruptor is max 28km and the vaga will still have plenty of closing speedand thats just when looking at a vagabond there are plenty of other ships that can do the same easilyremove the target painter bonus for a web effectiveness bonus makes the min recons and the hyena viable fleet ships again theyre not nor ever were particularly viable solo ships except against patently inferior ships like perhaps a wet paper sack though i suspect even that can tank a rapiers dps
in my opinion web bonus is still pretty powerful just not win win button if bonus would be tweaked range bonus should be dropped or switched to strenght bonus i am strongly against giving minmatar recons ability to stop ships moving completely while orbiting outside disruptor range again60 web still cuts down speed a lot just not one web is enough to make target stationary which is good
ill agree witht he above post when the falcon cant stop several ships from doing anything at all from triple the range of a warp disruptor incidentally i think ewar should be useful and the ability to slow one ship down is simply not enough perhaps a stronger stacking nerf on webs but stronger individual webs to allow the rapier to hold several ships down suggesting a drop to the range bonus then what role would the rapier have i can do my primary form of ewar just as well as a tech1 frigate
i like and support this ideaim probably one of the few people that do actually use the tp bonus that these ships get and whilst it does occasionally come in useful i believe the rejig of web bonus would be worth the loss of iti agree with the concerns people have around not wanting to see way overpowered webs so potentially if we did have a web strength bonus on the rapierhuginnhyena maybe ccp may look at increasing the stacking nerf slightly so 4 x webs on these ships doesnt make it crazy strong but dual webs are viable
rapierhuggin do need a bit of a buff perhaps dropping one of damage bonus for a web strength bonus ill look to bring it up at a future meeting
ta and dont forget the lolhyena
i propose to reverse your proposal sized rigs will be fine but i want to see sized modules for every ship type no more heatsink iis for your bss youll need xl heatsink iis that cost 20 mil a piece xl 1600mm plates for 50 mil a pieceyour reasoning isnt very sound people fit rigs to smaller ships right now the only thing this is going to change is people with less isk will be able to rig their ships to compete with those who already rig their ships i see no negative effects coming from this other than me having to redo a lot of eft setups to account for rig bonuses on my t1 ships
heres a new threadissue sound engine  sound bugsit pertains to the user interfacethank you for maintaining this index
yeah id much rather like a more complex implementation that makes better use of both pilot and player skills
bad idea would be used like the freeform contracts were  that is the addition would only serve to scam steal gank and be a general ass not supported
like i said the problems with gang missions are dredged up from memories a couple years old i guess theyre wrongobsolete whatever as for the griefing all the same things could be done by just stealing if this has the same implications of letting them shoot you that stealing does how is this any worse
supported and stuff why this isnt feature already
yes but only iflike metioned before you can reverse engineer the implants out lets say if they had a 5 to repair amount you could salvage out a 3 or somethingbut what i think is most important get rid of having to keep an updated clone this game mechanic is too devistating to have in a game you can lose everything else in the game but to lose training time its just too harsh i know some people like the idea of having to keep an updated clone adds risk to the game but honestly its just not necessary to have in the game
contracts are there for a reason scammers need to earn their livinng somehow too 100 safe market is not supposed to be there
in that case add a contrqact hostory or something being able to stay out in 00 or wherever you are 100 jumps from jita or whatever and still be able to see how much an item is worth is very useful contracts also give a completely different trading style where advertisment and how well you can market a deal decvides how long it take to sell you can say that you can still use contracts even if the normal market can be used for it but come on be realisticpeople are lazy if its avaiulable on the market noone will check contractsimprove the contract system dont make it obsolete
not supportedsearching for rare faction items would become much more difficult under this proposalevaluating a fair price to pay or ask would also become harderit would likely lead to a polarisation of sale of these items in jitayes currently i still have to travel to buy the item but of course i can send money to an alt or trusted corp friend to get around this
seeing as to search in contract you need the correct name of the item while you can search the market under the right general heading and find the kind of item you want i think adding faction to the market is a good idea a typical example are the faction drones when you are searching them to see if there is a interesting deal you are happy to search augmented acolyte then augmented hobgoblin then augmented warrior then augmented hornet then move to improved acolyte then improved hobgoblin then improved warrior and end with improved hornet to move then to medium and heavy drones or you would prefer to look regional market see what is available with 3 clicks and without typing 24 different names then if you dont like the regional offers you can move to contracts all around eve supported unless adding all the faction items is a excessive burden to the database
i would be bothered to not be able to see faction items for other regions i think a better approach to this would be to make contracts better browsable not to make rare items disappear on jitaUFFFDs local marketnot supported
if they made contracts have similar functionality to markets in terms of price histories searchability etc then i would also be perfectly happy with that
noi dont want to 001 isk war on my faction loot
there are more benefits to having the rare modules on contracts than on the market as stated by previous commentshowever i do would like to see some kind of price history and other tools to make contracts easier and faster
i dont support this butthat is because there is an existing game mechanic called black market which you will see in data dumps and if you look at station services on evehqs map tool etc this black market it was implied was for things that werent available in normal markets ie faction stuff contraband etc its only available in certain stations etcjust get ccp to activate this feature

never understould why its not implemented
the poor op dont see the big picture wis is a base for wod the next mmo from ccp wake up
antisupport post
no interest in wos here
if youre actually hurt by a video game loss i think the game takes it a bit too far losing anywhere from fifty to a couple hundred million is risky enough theres no need to expect it to be an emotionally scarring experience to lose your internet spaceship if anything we should be encouraging more pvp rather than less pvp and heres a hint take away t1 insurance and a lot of new players will refuse to pvp altogether that would make eve much more fun id totally rather have less pvp but the added joy of realistic insurance beaurocracy beats out good fights with reasonable losses that vastly exceed any other game any day while were at it we can force players to realistically register their spaceships with the dmv waiting in line for hours to do so and to spend an hour a week getting their warp drive inspected woo reality is more fun than a game ever was
i didnt mean emotionally hurtwhat i mean is make the outcome of combat mean somethingif you want more people to pvp give pvp a context a meaningas it stands you rally forces hunt down your arch enemy destroy him andmaybe inconvenience him for a couple of minutes how very epic i want to see battles of attrition cunning plans to deprive our enemy of resources and strangle themnot games of freeze tag and dodgeball that change nothing insurence as it is keeps pvp as meaningless as a match of counterstrike
the insurance providers would easily find some nice politician that will make ship insurance against unespected lossec mandatory in high sec

true that
this is an idea that looks as though it makes obvious sense when it is a tabloid headline however i am not sure it does if we look at game balance the already outlined problems of high sec invunerability and npc corps come to mind now insurance in general there is an argument for scrapping the whole thing which i would like to see discussedwhat about dropping the insured amount by 10 and monitoring the effects on ingame economics i am not sure i would support such a proposal but discussion would be good
i support it hi sec suicide ganking is too much risk freeat least nerf insurance payout
insurance nerf it nerf it again and after nerfing it nerf it some more
quick question because i genuinely dont know the answerdoes any other mmo limit people to one account per ip
hey guys lets abolish cyno alts thereby making eve completely unplayable for capital ship pilots woohoono
look even if people are using alts and mains at the same time what difference does that make to you fact is they pay for them they have a right to use them if you dont have an alt thats your issue get one if you want one but dont complain that i have a few end of day its not even about who has more rl money getting an advantage i pay for 3 accounts with isk only so if i can do it so can youpast that lets pretend that you get your way only one logon per ip now what happensit so happens that i play eve so does my wife so which of us are allowed to run eve me or her and why should she pay for an account but not be allowed to use it because im using mineare you going to pay for my 2nd internet connection so i can have 2 ip addresses past that what about collages i know there are tons of people from the same schools on there school internet connection playing eve i guess they are out too how much rl money do you think ccp will let go so you feel like its fair for youlets go one step further say ccp pull a dumb dumb and do this one account per ip do you have any clue how many proxy servers there are in the world that can be used to redirect the connection to ccp so it comes from a different ip address thus allowing one person that is smart and knows what they are doing an advantage that no one else can use i mean lets face it you can get an alt of your own hell the first 51 days are free if you start a 21 day trial with the buddy program from your main then pay for the 30 days on that trial your main gets his 30 days too you see allowing everyone to have multiple accounts log on from one location is fair not allowing it and people in the know taking advantage of there it degrees is not fair and will  you off even more then allowing everyone to do it at the end of day no one not even ccp could stop multi boxinghave a nice day and please try to think before you post
the real question is why you guys are all still bumping this idiotic thread its old its been mocked more than enough already and its never going to happen let it fall off the front pageedit when i posted to this thread it was already the top one on the page then i buried it under the other 10 threads i replied to thats not a bump
as a fairly young player in eve i primarily play in high sec being young meaning my skills are nowhere near that of most in lowsec00 so i bid my time training honing my skills making the isk to afford what i can lose the days that i venture into the open lawless spaces to basically get my bumm handed to me so if this constitutes being a carebear so be it with that being said the salvaging rights have a problem ive tried to salvage while doing missions personally i have better uses for those high slots as in not taking hours to kill one ship low skills low dps gotta make up for it somehow minnie takes foreverive done the burn through come back in a salvage ship its either there or its not more often nothow about paying attention to your ship so you dont get to be a pod and someone warps in waits for a wreck and snags the wreck as you go along cause the npc is shooting you for 50k awayand my most favorite suggestion bring a friend along done that have had 4 ninja salvagers come in and start taking wrecks while they being tractored by the friend same mission different intervalsnow before some of you go on rants that im just crying about not being able to salvage my missions its not solely that ive spent time training to be able to make rigs and ie need supplies for that ergo i go make wrecks to salvage verses paying market value lower cost more profit and last time i checked a wreck it has my corp tag on it so do the cans my ships doesnt this denote ownershipback onto subject scanning down wrecks and warp to them is not a bad idea however it should work in conjunction with something perhaps locking mission gates to fleetcorp allowing someone as me trying to be enterprising some ownership of wrecks if i being someone who just blitzes turns in a mission the wrecks are now accessible to everyone with a scanning probe thus allowing salvaging also making salvaging a non trial learning skill would reduce it some as welli support the topic of a needed change just not the initial idea alone
not supported market value is dictated by the players and very prone to fluctuation if insurance values are set low and the price of t2 ships spikes then its still next to useless if the insurance prices are set high and then there is some event which should lower the cost of t2 ships then the prices will remain artificially high as people buy insure and self destruct their t2 vesselst2 is a luxury if i purchased a run of the mill car and added a big bore exhaust new engine new paintjob new sound system i doubt very much my insurance company would pay out the value of the extra parts if i smashed it up
so let me get this righta 00 defender  likely of the jan brady patrol or killmail addicts who kill everybody that goes into their system  and will say hey i am just defending my patch but could not explain the small frigs haulers they killed etcis now angry that someone  how dare they  gets into their system and cannot be instantly scanned down and instagankedoh and the lulz  until someone puts them to explain it and they tuck their shirts back in and its uh hey man we are just defending are system yeah thats itjust by knowing that a killmail addict is squirming unable to act out their emorageganker tendencies at the prospect of someone cloaked in their system makes me want to go cloak a cheapie boat in their system and leave it there for hours oh the tears just by being there and not having to fire a shot lets one up it remove local from 00 and make it delayed local like in wh space
you forgot the best oneswhich would get my complete and utter support121433 would you like to remain dockedand121434 would you like to remain in your pos shieldsgiggity giggity yeah
come on just think of how much lag you could save by creating a popup to ask people if theyre sure that they want to remain logged in
indeed i think im gonna go visit me the systems of wildly inappropriate with an alt and log it in while im at work just fur lulz
i corrected post
no you didnt
seeing as neuts and ecm with out a doubt can make or break engagements i think the use of pill designed to counter these modules is a good idea i understand that i can fit eccm to my ship and i also understand i could fly a passively tanked ship against neuting ships but realistically engagements dont wait for you to fit another ship just to come out and engage for that particular gang structure if im 20 jumps from home theres no way for me to buy other modsships ect i always carry a blue pill which is increases my shield boost amount by a percentage in case i get into a harry situation but lets face it  any pvp ship that uses a cap intensive set up and most do its game over when that nuet domi show up lets face it your having a great engagment with your worst enemys and that falcon decloaks and jams everyone  its game overi think pills designed to increase sensor strength or decrease chance to get jammed however you want to word it and a pill to decrease the chance or amount that is nuetd  nosd from you would be a cool idea and another money maker for drug makersflame on
pills wtf
grabbin peelscant really support this boosters in my mind are there to give you an edge in combat in general not against specific threats you could potentially load up on pillz and you have uppers and downers for every occassionever tried mindflood btw
this idea makes me think youve already taken too many pills
so you want to be able to lug around fittings in the form of pills with you so that you are effective in any combat situation without having to have logistics to change your setup if the situation changes not supported
this would be very much appreciated
i would agree with you but if you have spies in your fleet and its that big an issue they can warp to you i mean you are in fleet lets not be dense here supported if anything only cloaked ships can see other cloaked ships in the same fleet
the problem u r pointing at is quitinteresting support ship is involved in fight so u shoud be able to shoo it down without being killed by concord
im guessing you also want all of the modules to be onlined the moment it comes out of reinforcement as opposed to the 50 shields it currently requires
pos warfare is horrible at the moment and yes i agree changes are required however this idea does not offer a reasonable solutioncpu mods become useless after rf mode unless shields are repped you make no suggestion on how to deal with thatat what shield level do you suggest the tower exits rf a 90 shield limit for entering rf leaves a very small margin for repping out of rf when it exits arguably a tower could be repped out of rf in a very short time with sufficient carriers on field making the effort to rf it pointlesyou could of course and likely would rf a lot of towers in the hope that some at least would not be saved however i expect what would happen is a benny hill style chase involving the attacking fleet defenders titan bridging defense fleets and carriers jumping around like crickets every day day in day outdefinitely not supported
iceblock you really should stop posting your suggestions are terribleunless you are assaulting a d2 special if you havent rfd a pos in 12 cycles generally not enough time for an alt to get there and set the stront timers then youre doing it wrong anywayso then what happens what level will the tower come out at when it exits rf what level will the shields need to be at for you to restront the tower do modules requiring cpu go offline etc etc
actually i work for the military a ships radar cant tell the difference between an aircraft and a missile if the radar operator isnt paying attention then the ship is fedsorry but i vote no on this one
even if it would be implemented what would it be good for mining barges are not famous for their tanking abilities when the alarm goes off you are alredy scrambled webbed and what not leaving only seconds to wake up and see your ship die anywaylocal and directional scanner work much better they just require to actually play the game while playing the game not supported
i am curious if this has ever been mentioned or not and what kind of affect this would have on the game for logoffskies and such thingswhat if when you use a gate and when you are agress a ratget agressed by one you have something like an agression timer for 15 minutes like when you do that with an actual playerpros and cons
im looking for a critiquei also had an interesting extension to this idea give it the ability to enter a mode similar to dreadnoughts and carriers at which point it acts like a pos with enough power to field a small number of defensive pos modules this way it would be hard to kill while deployed yet extremely vulnerable while mobile
you want a ship with 8 strips carrierscale nonfighter drone capabilityand pos guns why not just say that anyone who flies one gets to host a weekly kegger at ccps expense this is so far outside the bounds of what is reasonable that i have no idea how to respond to it meaning no offense but you have got to step back from i want and wouldnt it be cool if and think about the broader scope of game design you cant just give yourself an omgwtfbbq pwnmobile for your profession just because you want it you have to make things that are on a reasonable level with everything else out there and that give the game room for future expansion you basically want to peg the scale right now which means basically that ccp can never again produce a new mining ship and then people will expect the same thing for every other profession out there in the next expansion how is that in any way interesting or fun
i think it should go another way must set up and be immobile like a movable derrick no defenses at all but able to rip into roids like there is no tomorrowand require fuel while in that mode make setting up so risky that you need a security detail or some psychosis to go into mining configuration 
currently if i want to look for ammo under the contract system t2 bps t1 ammo bps or bundles ect i have to sort first by crystals then advanced crystals then projectile then advanced projectile its annoying as heck to say the least the same goes for ships or modulesplease make contracts sortable by entire subgroups rather than individual typesie ammo ships electronic warfare ect ect that will let us see all contracts for particular ranges of items as well as the specific item type electronic warfare or stasis webs ect
set item category to charge
i agree that cloaks on nonbonused ships need a definate looking into i dont believe any capital should have the ability to cloak itself much less its entire fleetyour proposals for limiting cloaks is good but not good enoughfor all non covertops cloaksall passive regeneration halts capacitor and shield local scanner ceases to functionobviously some of these would be offset slightly by higher metalevel cloaks and t2 prototypes ie a prototype ii would allow 30 capacitorshield regen rates short range local scanner functionalitynon covertops cloaks should only reduce a ships sig it should never make them invisable bear in mind that a visible raven at 50km in space is visible only as a dot at best have the hull lights deactivated while a cloak is onthis makes having a cloak a viable defense tactic but not a sure bet like it is nowass with so many other flawed mechanics in the game such as rockets this proposal has been put forward for years and ccp just laughs it off
not supporting cloaks dont need to be changed at all

wheat you might want to copy at least one of those threads in the assembly hall the csm is not allowed to raise threads that are not based there and i dont think any of them are
thanks herschel yamamoto it is done and my earlier post has been updatedsorry for the intrusion csm i hope this helps
i dont know if this suggests that dierdra vaal runs solo in the wormholes or not i could not imagine doing so for a long time yet if at all anyhow miati leekon if you want to try pve in the wormholes perhaps i could tag along you could pretend that im not there otherwise it would be psve wouldnt itbased upon the tranquility department of public safety UFFFD spaceship driver license offices dev blog reported by ccp soundwave  20090715 204604 and the related comments and feedback you are not alone in your opinion that ccp might favor the nonsolo player i guess thats why its an mmog
who said pve has to be a solo activity sorry but this is a massive multiplayer game not single player  content doesnt always have to be soloable
pve is not of necessity a solo activity and it always crosses the line into a type of pvp considering how you define the term since there is only one potas it were if i had the confidence that ccp would really keep wormholes as a primarily pve experience that would not be subject to territorial issues as is 00 then whatever pvp occurs there would be understandable but i have seen in other posts and people have acknowledged that a type of effective soverigenity already exists in some wspace where effectively corps are farming wspace systems this was not the intent or promise of ccp neither i nor anyone else should be able to establish a pos or other structure permanently in wspace if they exist there should be a game mechanic that says they will eventually be destroyed thereby keeping that space open to all but i do not have such confidence in ccp doing this hence i wish to see pve expanded it they held to their promises then whatever pvp occurs in wspace would be more a one on one that has been all by eliminated from the game by ccps current course of actions and their propping up of large corps
fix rocketsthis is an excellent example of a mended feature that did not work out and thus should not go back in the queue of issues that need to be fixed but straight to the top of it ccp mentioned that they would go over the way they prioritize broken issues when the former csm went to iceland but i dont think we have heard anything about it since then
experienced similar bug not a long time agowas in ani constelation caldari cosmos and got a thief stealing loot from my npc killied by me wreckwell i get targeted him of course and start shooting bustard flee since i hadnt warpdis fitted but that another storyour story is ive got 15m aggro timer for shooting him saw him later docked and so simply leave him for goodwell ive got a surprise after 2 two not one not more jumps my aggro timer was renewed from 11 minutes to 15 againat first glance surprise was even possitive ive fited warpdis returned to station and waited for my pety thiefafter original 15 minutes but with renewd aggro timer it still showed 4 minutes for me he undocked and no he wasnt flagged for me anymoreso i gues i was somehow still flagged for himnah he didnt tried anything so cant say for sure was i flagged for him or not but the fact is fact gameclient showed me renewed aggro timer after firts 4 minutes and i didnt do anything in those 4 minites other then warped after thief and warpedjumped back to my bussines my own carebearing tbh no shooting anything no even targeting anyone or anything
if this is a proposal for a fix its in the wrong forum
and what does it look likewhats the correct forum then anyway is the forum selection a reason to discard the issue as nonexistant
winter release
you obviously dont understand how this really works empire or not has little to do with it
the one good thing about rockets is they allow for gratuitous use of the word borked
if i created the carcass whats in it is mine not yoursthis really is a very silly mechanic that needs fixing and ive been pirating low sec for the last few years until very recently and not even had the occasion to be annoyed by this yet but its a given that it shouldnt work the way it does at presentsignedcr

does your corporation even have any carriers it isnt anything like a jump bridge anyway because you have to put the carrier in danger to do it in the first place unlike a titan who can stay in a different system also i would of thought you of all people would support this but evidently little nameless corps like the idea of titans online even when they will never own any or if they are really lucky one
idea sounds pretty goodgives the carrier something to do besides rep towers all day
supported this should have been the way carriers worked from day one
heres a link for the lazy link
supported this would be a great change
hello little goon as a member of a nameless corp your proposal would benefit me above all people however as someone who engages in semi regular capital hotdrops this would remove a considerable element of risk by allowing us to bring support along with us instead of making them lug their way their from a balance perspective i cant agree to it either do it the old fashioned way or take ships with you in bays and get your support to come in inties and switch out on the field or bring a rorqual or ms with you and make use of the clone vat bay
i would argue against the make jumpbridgetitan obsolete argument on the basis that for large fleet combat where you are required to move a hundred or so battleships the titan is still your only optioneven a medium sized hot drop will still be far more efficient using a titan than trying to use multiple carriers and undocking your few passengers into the heat of battle

let me disband goonswarm just for lulz
i want to have a compilation of all angles at once in a hdvid so i can enjoy it to the fullestgreat idea too
lol rightterrorist act done by a desperate gallente pilot that was dissapointed in faction warfare dissapointed in his faction loosing hit the very heart of caldary in order to give his race an edge in the war or something then dies as the result and crashes his ship in the station the station falls apart and all the items in it get dstroyed
put me down for one copy of the hd box set pls
i have a better idealets just reset everything power the servers off reset the database back to a bare restore and then fire the game back up and reload all the player accounts minus charactersand watch the lulz commence as everyone scrambles for 00 space
oooh yes me want fraps
i want to see this happen it also has to be done with no one knowing its going to happen
this would be awesome go titan
and what kind of webrange decrease to you propose to compensatesince qr all speeds have gone down while maintaining the relative speed between shipsthe 60 web is extremely powerful except against mwd ships which require twinwebs even with just one the signaturespeed ratio of a mwd webbed ship is enough to allow full damage from all weaponsi say no unless range is decreased otherwise they become godly solomobiles and we will drown in rapiers again
both hands up
no web range decrease60 web is not extremely powerfuland considering that most standard combat fits do include an mwd the now sillyslow rapierhuginn is at a disadvantage compared to other recons capable of truely nuking multiple ships in terms of ewaragain force recon intended roleforce multiplier you can have the gun bonus backalso lol godly solomobiles perhaps somewhat predamp balance but since that time come on now and as a recent example yesterday i hung a pair of overloaded webs on a sacrilege from 50km to assist a wingman and that sucker was still able to close range forcing me to warp out fair dues to the pilot who was speed fit unexpectedly and with a booster a sac can run an mwd all day long where the rapier hasat bestaround 2 minutes mwd time to maintain range thats not exactly dictating engagement range is itand if you consider the fail that is the hyena one is basically paying out around 40 mill isk to hang a web or two for roughly 20 seconds before going pop to anything looking harshly at it 
not supporteddont be alarmed tldr  teh bottomwhoever thinks the rigs will become standard on all ships obviously has no sense of innovation in terms of ship fitting and pvp there never has been a stadard fit for any ship there have always been tried and true fits those which weather battles and tank missions with relative ease but there are always ways to break the mold and this change is going to serve as a catalyst to open up that creativitylets take a few ships into account for the expected change in fittingthorax possible rigs almost any hybrid rigs the armor rigs and the speedcap astrometric rigs use it in a mission add some resists and a few cccs a new player with a rigged thorax is going to be much better off in missions when given a shot at rigging who cares so what is the price they pay to do a mission is affected i dont see them blowing anything up any time soon on to a pvp rax we have a common plate rax load that up with some trimarks and you have a great bait ship lets say you are in a tackle rax load up some astrometrics to help with the cap or maybe overall speed be realistic there are so many ways to fit a combat oriented t1 cruiser i see way more lolfits and innovation on the horizon and both of which are things i look forward to seeing on a regular basis makes the game more fun to think of different ways to playill bring up frigates in general which can be insanely versatile in the right hands a frig rarely has the ability to run half their mods for a full minute before they cap out tack on some rigs whatever you want who knows what you can really do speed armor tracking range shields extra dps whoever said it will make standardized fits a norm has obviously been stuck in industrial ships for a bit too longa third and final point is the rigging of t2 ships who has ever had a ship get nerfed or changed their mind on a flying style of any particular ship nano ishtars nano curses for whatever reason a trimarked anything and decided maybe now i need to swap up the setup a little but those rigs are going to be a bihotch to replace now you have the option to rerig a ship for a decent price i know rigs are permanent for a reason but when each one costs 5 mil its still going to be a dent in your wallet when considering the overall price of the shiptldr what makes you want to force everyone to pay a premium for something that doesnt fiscally make sense at the moment so what if you do this makes it so other people can enjoy that luxury standardization is not going to be a problem it really seems like a whine from a bunch of rig builders and people who forgot this is a game and should be enjoyed by everyone not just people who voluntarily forfeit hour upon hour grinding missions just to get ahead of everyone else thats what faction and deadspace mods are for share the rig love and stop being so greedy
virtually every bit of what you said is exactly my point rigs complement setups they do not change them your ceptors are just going to be more cap stable your cruisers are just going to do a bit more damageits not like some git is going to mix a plated thorax with ccc rigs or polycarbs or eccm rigs or anything else that wouldnt make sense the point of rigs has always been a choice between do or dont use them if you risk the cash you reap the rewardi mean i just dont get peoples logic here what next do you want the cost of the navy vexor to drop to the same as the vexor because then maybe youll have more options on what ships to fly and how to load out your setup no navy vexor is better because you choose to pay more for its performance with both mission time and lp costis it the devs fault that the navy vexor takes way more time to get and therefore isnt conducive to 1 hr a day players who want to pvp in it is it the rich guys fault its a game just like all games you arent intended to do everything there ever was in this game you make a choice i make the decision to log out and go play soccer or bike for 2 hrs a day is that they nerds fault who would rather sit at his desk for 2 hrs or is it my ownim so sick of this equality bull because guess what you arent all the rig patch does is dumb down the game for the masses
aside from the relatively pointless comparison to navy vexors seeing as rigs are not faction fittings they are t1 and t2 gearanyway its about fun for everyone not only the people who can passivly make isk with all the isk they have already ffs we are talking about sub 10 mil hulls here and you are whining about people actually using things that are there for people to use sure there is a sense of risk vs reward all the mods you put on your ship are a risk be it 50k or 11 mil your choice but ffs you are rigging a 200k ship with rigs that cost a couple mil you are still putting forth a risk but its not a battleship risk scaled investment is scaled reward what if every ship in game cost as much to kit out as a battleship do you really think people are going to use them on a regular basis it closes off the accessibility to players who play this as a game not as a job you are putting so much of your argument into isk value as if it outweighs the players skill let people explore another part of the game and realize every single thing you add to a ship is risk including rigs no matter how expensive they are
you dont seem to get logic period this patch will increase options not remove them it will make ships more diverse not less this is not faction gear it is produced you might as well complain about modules for lowslots
i support this as ive read many posts as to how people have worked realy hard to obtain skills and t2 bpos for specialised profession only for ccp to along once again to basically destroy it
i whant trolls to die in hell people you are not using your brain regging destroyers and small ships is good
now this makes sense doesnt penalise those with genuine connection problems and means that if you do pull a deliberate logoffski then it doesnt matter how many times you hit ctrlq to move your emergency warp point the return warp will always land you at the point where you entered the original emergency warp
because there should be more to corporations then just getting membersproposal corporations  profits
please include this as an alternative solutionalthough it does not fix the problem 100 like your own solution it should be simplier to implement and wont cause balance issues on injecting combat setups or act as a 20 cargo boost for all ships whether or not they are likelly to use cansthis may be more palatable to the devs
a simplier solutionalthough i support the aim of this post  i find the proposed solution to be overcomplicatedissues that arise arewhat happens with ships that can have cargo holds less than 3k or more than 3k depending upon expanders  rigs fitted2030 buff for carrying items that cant currently be carried in cans2030 buff for cap injecting ship setups cargo hold space is a premium here
whatlast time i checked  the only assembled containers that could be put in a freighter class ship were general freight containers
i agree i think that containers should not be able to contain more space than they take up a container that takes up 3000m3 should be able to hold no more than 3000m3edit to show support i reread the extremely poorly worded op and realized that he was advocating the opposite of what i had originally thought
ive wrote a massive post in the other forum i guess ill just quote it as thats pretty much the second side of the same coinhere we gothe case i faced today was equally absurd and demonstrativei enter an isolated low sec system and notice few ships out there hoorey yet another possible encounter so i check the belts kill some rats while still scanning the entire system trying to track those ships down ok i eventually meet those get my fight get out and now have to wait like 15 minutes without showing to gatestation gunsthats the way system have worked for agesit might have some minor issues like 15 minutes being a too long timer or gate guns updating it silently in case you decided to dock and wait for gcc to end in a complete safety im fine with it at least it has some logic behind itso i hang around killing some belt rats and all of a sudden notice my gcc is suspeciously long i hover a mouse over it and thats it timer towards players is about to end and a global one is now 15 again im getting ed off but playing eve actually gets you getting used to troubles like this one so i warp to a safe spot set my alignment getting ready to spend another 15 minutes of pure boredomfew minutes later oh wait is the gcc now 15 minutes againim getting really mad now since i have to waste even more time dealing with it meanwhile i write a stuck petition  thats it i got stuck cause while writing it the gcc got renewed yet again can you imagine once again for gods sake thats just inexpressiblewe arent allowed to post gm messages here so ill try to put the very gist of it im stuck blahblahblah try docking and staying docked for 15 mintes the gcc is being renewed while someone shoots your property in space such as cans and wrecks  this is a game breaking bug btw weve had a same issue a while ago with the only difference the bug causing a general pvp aggro timer so it happened in 00 as wellso i dock at this point nah thats an intended gameplay so we now need to search for every peace of junk we might have left in the system and blow it up dont you consider this is a bug yeah thats the way it is supposed to work thats a risk associated with low sec pvphere the conversation ends basicallyok ive waited patiently for 15 minutes gave it few more just cause i know how it works and undock in a pod timer is off is it nope im a global criminal yet againthats outrageous i cant play this game by these rules and have nothing better than just logging off35 minutes lateri log in and the first thing i notice is im still flagged oh come onbut im a stubborn dude i leave the client running and go afk im getting sure i had waited for 15 plus about 10 or even 15 extra minutes undock bingo gccit seems like i simply can not leave the area before i manually blow all the npc wrecks i had spawned meh ok lets do itim now checking all the god damned belts to actually get one or two npc wrecks i blow them up and proceed to my safe spot few minutes later im enjoing a brand new gcc wow  i can tell you how easily exploitable this crap is imagine an isolated system with no stations at all say you have fighted someone over there in the beltanomaly killed a rat in the process sometimes you just have to then the blob came in and now you have to get out alright you warp out to a spot and start counting the time down while still checking for any probes etc but those dudes in the blob can essentially guard your wreck as if you really need to possess the wreck a rat had left and renew your gcc till youll finaly get bored and either log off with a timer suicidally enter the hisec gate or just till youre getting probed down and killed
and just the whole idea of renewing gcc via shooting the can is artificial at best anyway it was recognized as a bug in case of general pvp aggro why should gcc work the other way
these lil features are getting a little old

hrmmm well one response on drug issue although the response they arent used much really begs the issue of why there is a video on youtube about drug running tens of billions worth of drugs into jita complete with much dying by the customs officials i see some others are aware of the trade issues this raises and while i am not the fondest supporter of the pirates in eve they do make travel in hi sec interesting i think the covert cynos would ensure easy movement of say titan bpos and a host of other items a covert cyno does not show up on the system overview on the whole i think this is something that should not be added to hi sec

theres a lot of history of ccp making huge changes to features in game where rather than rebalance it they completely change the dynamics and then let it sit til people gripe for long enough to completely overhaul it againthe best example of this is eccm and its changes over the yearsoriginally eccm was a point based system if i had more points of eccm strength than your ship had to counter it you were jammed this system which had no real flaws was tweaked why well apparently it was bad when a dominix could dedicate its 5 mid slots to eccm and perma jam a target it just wasnt kosher that something like reliquishing 5 slots to jam another ship wo an additional back arrays could happen even worse you could cycle jam and dampen terrible i knowso we changed to the  chance system a complete overhaul rather than a small tweak to the current good system originally there was very little difference between a domis ability to jam with 1 mod and a scorps most differences came with range so now a domi could spend 1 slot to get a jam off add in a dampener to delay the relock and just wait til he got lucky enough for the jam to hit devs had a omgwtf moment where they realized that this didnt really give an advantage to eccm ships either because everyone was doing it so then another overhaul came in now we had the problem of massive range for eccm on eccm boats mixed with the problem of  based jamming which ment more targets could be jammed by an eccm ship wo the added heat and complexity of the old cycle jamming system well guess what we went from everyone carrying eccm to 34 ships jamming 1020 near permanently from 150200km awaywell damn that doesnt work either so now rather than that weve rebalanced it to where only eccm ships really can jam but with the exception of 1 they can only really jam well from very close range have to rely on chance and now whats supposedly tank and to compensate for it a ship and class that should never have drones has a drone bay to help add to lag already generated by drones recons other things that share similar storiesimplementation of sov mechanics all at oncespeed buffsspeed nerfsrecon overhauls in generalall forms of ew gearmajor ship implementations where a patch offered more than 30 new ships at one time rather than a bit more staggeredsuper capscapsblack opsetc every time ccp makes changes theyre drastic and game changing why cant we just return to smaller patches with tweaks to a system to see if it can be corrected rather than overhauled it might help avoid 5 year adventures where every step has been further away from the original good idea
i fear that regardless of support you might get for this ccp will not listen if it is escalated by the csm they much prefer long development cycles plus it could be argued that occasional major upsets are better for longevity as it forces players to reevaluate the mechanics keeping interest
your complaint is that ecmnot eccm that is the exact opposite was changed too much and so we should move to shorter development cycles im not sure youve completely thought this through
yes please
not supported i for one am looking forward to ambulation
why people are so keen to pay a subscription to beta test ccps new game i just dont knowguess hype just effects some people badly

insurance is bad mkay
id consider an idea to tie insurance premiums to ship market value and pilot performance but that really should be a separate topic
it has become extremely easy to probe players down in low sec combat probes only need to remain in space for as little as 5 seconds before being scooped up with a 100 warpable hit in turn it gives an alert mission runner seeking to protect his mission site that much time in opportunity to detect the combat probes having a reasonable chance in detecting combat probes is the only opportunity a player running a mission has before having his mission site compromisednote that i am not asking for 100 safety i am asking for a reasonable chance at being able to detect combat probes in space i also expect a lot of opposition from pirates benefitting from being able to bust missions in complete in stealth even from alert mission runnersso in to summarize spamming a button every 5 seconds is not fun please fix
i support this obviously
make me happy zastrow j and bring this into the next csm meeting
once upon a time someone under the employ of ccp crafted a number of ship models and assigned a job for each they made a number of tech i frigates which were designed for ew and another for exploration then they subtly altered the models for the tech ii frigates with stronger bonuses for those rolesbut one day they discovered that the t1 and t2 models for a particular ship didnt match theyd accidently made the t1 ship ugly as sin and the t2 ship was reasonably acceptable in order to cover their ass they swapped the models and hoped no one would notice but unfortunately they were wrongthe imicusnew helios looks like a dog lifting its leg on a fire hydrantthe maulusold helios looks like an xmas ornamentno one could say straight faced and sober that gallente craftsmanship is pretty to behold but at least the options used to be better than they are at the momentso heres my proposal swap the helios models back in fact swap the imicus and maulus models as well that way the ew frigs which are useless in any situation will still match and those of us who were born and raised gallente and yet had to crosstrain amarr to get a decent looking covops can get back out there with the right brand name on the hood
and 1
this praise and amen
i really didnt like have to cross train to pilgrim to get a useful ship for reconplex scanning machine
meh its a ship it dont matter what it looks like this isnt warcrack its all about what can be fit to it if i wanted to look pretty i wouldnt be playing eve dont get me wrong the graphics update was nice but its no gears of war or bioshock id be happy flying in a white sphere rods sticking out for guns if ship models needshould be changed the base model should be changed too in my opinion its better to keep the things as they are now it makes a bit more sense in progression than previously for newer players and those of us that suffer from crs a t1 ewar frig changed into a t2 astro frig for a couple races but not for otherssorry for the small rant but the changes are done the complaints can continue but i dont think things are going to get changed maybe if there was a significant performance impact scan probe bubbles or interface in general warp tunnel effect or causing other problems id argue for changing it
used to fly it all the time cant bring myself to look at the ugly hull after it being such a nice lookin ship
1 if you dont care what it looks like then maybe you should go play a pen and paper game or something maybe read a book perhapsbut for those of us to do enjoy using our graphics card for something other than porn wed like ships that dont suck2 if ccp can toss out a simple patch and switch models they can do it again obviously it wasnt hard the first time they just need to get it right by way of switching the proper models little kickstand boy imicus is an ugly model while the maulus is much better by comparison and wasted on frig ew which no one uses
imicus and probe  maulus and vigil tbh
what is it with people and this idiotic issue its a damned ship model it looks a bit silly but its really not an issue insofar as it matters at all it was a buff  you see how ugly the ship is and it reminds you that the cloak is off if you want to train ships based on how pretty they look its your own fault and you can waste your time on anything you please me i dont care what my invisible ship looks like and i wont support anyone trying to get a dev to waste even a coffee break fixing it now that its correct and implemented
part of the reason of the change was to make afterburners viable in pvp instead of mwd not only being the only thing useful but required
afterburner on interceptor was relatively effective for close range tackling  i used it many times successfullywhat they did was make mwd and afterburners equally worthless as the entire speed tactic is no longer a force worth fearingif they really cared about making afterburners more viable they would have introduced something like 50 web resistance on afterburnerno what they did was eliminate speed as a threat
now this truelly is a nerf just slow everyone else down and we will be happyit seems they arent the only ones going overboard
how did this work on other ships interceptors arent the only frigates
i am certain from my experience that 50 web resistance on afterburner would have made it a popular module for close range pvpanyway its pointless to talk about it now ccp destroyed speed tactics
you must be new here
i loledfake edit damn bumped it again

hi it seems the corporations could get a little more realistic let me explain   on sales not just missions isk that could be of diffenrent value from the main  creating groups in the corps so we could give different  to each of them a discounts kind of thing votes  so members could decide if the money in the corp should be used for this or that 51 minimum for the vote to passfeel free to reply 
3 already exists  you can make freeform votes 1 and 2 seems like they could cause horrible abuses on the part of unscrupulous ceos theyd make my life easier  its way easier to recruit when you get to include we wont  you like those other guys do in the ad  but theyd probably be bad ideas overall
currently more then half the stuff you can get in hacking sites is nearly worthlessencryption skillbooks  everyone only needs 1 in a lifetimeinterfaces and their parts  same 1 per job and dont ever need moredatacores  research agents provide those in much greater quantities and since you dont need to be even subscribed to get them the prices are lowdecryptors  mostly okbooster reactions  same as interfaces everyone has one and doesnt want moremy proposal is to have interfaces and reactions wear out in time and require replacementalso other sciences skillbooks should drop in hacking sites not only encryption methods
i support this as welldata cores are so worthless that if i dont have enough space in my cargo hold i really dont care if i leave them behind the fact that people can collect these on an alt log in once a year and dump them on the market for cash is pretty stupid interface prices have been dropping too not much you can do about the skillbook prices its a skill personally i dont care if the t2 stuff ends up being a little more expensive
1 lots of new playeralts join the game and need the skills2 datacores while agents provide much higher quantity are still worth it i mean we got some datacores at 600700k now and the demand is growing3 interfacesreactions labs get blown up corps start so there is a demandif you ask me the balance is ok compared to the isk you can get from equally hard combat sitesnot supported
new people go into t2 industry all the time they all need that stuff its fine  yeah prices have dropped compared to 2006 but meh
kinda curious how many times ccp has to say salvage is never going to be restricted before people get the hintno im not a ninja yes i am a mission runner i see no problem with ninja salvagers dont act like a victim and you wont be one
csm forums to bring an issue up to ccp via the csms in order to have it address kinda like your government unless of course you live in a dictatorshiphow many people said drunk driving was bad repeatidly before they made laws against it how many times did the government say ohh its no harm no foulif you were to play a real world scenario of say international water salvaging you can protect the salvage that you find how extreme you protect it of course is up the the persons but you can do something about it if eve is based off simular ideals what can you do to protect salvage cause when you are tractoring a wreck and another person can still salvage that wreck there is still no claim of possession thats like you dropping monies on the ground and i scoop it up nevermind the fact that your fingers were on the paper but hey it hit the ground and there is nothing you can do about it
the proposal in the first post is not about restricting salvage its about making it possible to find it when it floats in space without anybody around id like that
its easy soon as a ninja salvager appears you have 2 easy solutions 1 they cant tractor the wrecks so as soon as the get within range of a wreck destroy it 2 destroy all wrecks and warp off ninja salvagers want either easy isk or pvp give them neither and they will move on
well leave for the 2 minutes it takes us to get the popcorn then we come back and watch you blow up all your wrecks anyway the idea in the op is not a ninjanerf at all i wouldnt use it in hisec at all id use it to cruise fw areas and salvage delicious t2 wrecks this thread deserves moar bump
t2 is no way luxury its pretty much standard the insurance system needs overhaul
nice to see someone still cares but as another tip serenitys list is dead i spent a while updating it daily with a new post to categorize the stuffa gm deleted it all to make space for serenitys posts but you can see all my stuff here but after the first few serenity quit updating it and i eventually decided to stop with my updates now all the people who have been kicking around the assembly hall too long just tell you if its redundant
since this keeps happening it might be worthwhile to point out that these threads are simply for the csms to nominate what issues they are bringing to the meeting not for the general playerbase to nominate what they want to discuss at that meeting
were in space where no direction is special and orientation is whatever works i was thinking about how i wanted direct navigation in some of the missions i was doing notably one where i had to find a hole in a hollow asteroid but representing this would be difficult first the player would have to establish a coordinate system then fly relative to that i recently read the excellent how apollo flew to the moon and it really makes it clear how complex this was with all their calibration of the guidance platform and the various orientation matricesi guess i can see direct navigation in combination with a ccokpit view since that gives you an implicit frame of reference the shipss orientation from which to navigate however i suspect this would be harder to use in practice do the ships have steerable main engines andor or attitude thrusters could you strafe perpendicular to the natural ship attitude using guidance thrustersfrom a ccokpit view i guess you could use an extended wasd control with the length of time for which you held down each key corresponding to the acceleration applied in that axis it would be interesting to see how this worked out in practice but i suspect it would be pretty hard to use
maby because while combersome evemail is functionalif you would bother to read any of the information out there about wis you would know it is being worked on alongside other projects this is why they can still put out patches like the upcoming fwrigsfuel bays patch next monthmmos also have a tendency to live and die by content not enough content and people leave not enough fresh content and people leavewis might not be the content evebody wants but it is something many of the players do want it will also add depth to the game with is something very few mmos have acomplishedpersonally i am looking forward to wis and would rather they spend the time now to work out the kinks so that we dont have to deal with them latervic
no the issue is real repost it in the right forumassembly hall or features and ideas and you might get the sort of response you want the devs dont read jpsc from what i know of and the csm is only constitutionally allowed to raise threads from the assembly hall repost this in ah or selfreport and ask for a movebut given this chatter id just cut and paste and ill gladly support you there

as i see ithow is this a problem its not salvage so the looter is flagged to owner of the property that is taken if you targetted and fired on the person stealing surely your problems would be solvednotable points1 you want more reward get it some other way
ridiculousyou may have blown up a ship but the modules inside the wreck are still not yours if your loot alt isnt fast enough to scoop it up thats your own faultand your reward is winning the battle how about this instead loot inside a ships wreck is untouchable for 20 minutes after a battle thus giving the loser 15mins to drop aggression and 5 minutes to pick up what crap survived

you gotta be the type of tool that opts for the verbal tip ie great job when you go out to the restaurantbar  rather  than the cash tip verbal tips dont pay the bills
damn straight gratuities are for above par service im not paying someones wages for vanilla waitressing thats the restaurants jobif youthey dont like it get a job that pays more than 2hr
thats just showing how ignorant you are  1 youve obviously never had to work for tips ie someone elses generosity2 if you cant afford to tip  stay your cheap ass home3 serversbartenders have to pay taxes on what they sell reguardless of wether you tip or not4 as for working a 2hr job  if they took away tipping that wage would drastically go up  along with mealsdrinks and you couldnt afford to go out in the first place  which obviously you cant do  so save the headache  see 2 back to the topic
fully support of all the game ideas suggested this has to be one of the most useful and fun ideas ive seen postednot only that but with all the ideas put forth about how it could be implemented the reality of it seems quite plausiblenow while this idea should be spread among the player base to get some ideas for implementation rules and restrictions i think this could potentially add to the dynamics of fleet warfare in a very positive waycount me in
i dont see a problem with that a carrier capital ship should be able to hold a support fleet inside it making a carriermstitan able to move the support around with them doesnt make them solo pwnmobiles or anything you still need that support fleet its just a bit easier to move them around someone will probably say that makes the titan jump bridge obsolete but thats far from true a titan has a limited sma while an unlimited amount of ships can pass the bridge and using a bridge doesnt require you to put the titan on the battlefield 100 supported the linked thread discuss several ways to achieve this effect and the illusion of this happening while avoiding the player inside player and ownership problems ccp has said preventing them from implementing this in the first place

indeed all are good points the point to this in specific is to not stop theft but to make it possible for a ceo or director to find out something was stolen without having to contact ccp for an item tracethough the current trend of theft does concern me i dont see a way to make it safer without completely changing the mechanics of the corp hangar one thought on a side note was allow things other than bpos to be locked down so that they cant be moved without a corp vote back to topic tho aside from helping with theft identification it would also greatly increase the ceos directors abilities to search track and find corp assets after a relocation or invasion one director lends something out another director looks notices its missing but cant tell where it went cause the other directors offline so he gets concerned i mean this is avoidable and in rl its as easy as an audit log or a sign inout sheet you could simple add a third tab in role takequeryaudit then in the corp hangar you could set it to every time somethings taken out of a hangar that has secure enabled the remover has to right a note and is then recorded taking the item with time and date also this would allow ccp to enable the security officer to use corp audits to sieze items say an item marked corp is transered out of hangar well if its property of the corp then the security officer has the ability to search your hangar  as he does now and remove assets that originated in the corp hangarleast i think those are some more good ideas and explainations of the intent

to pull a can you need at least tractor power 1 vs any other ship attempting tractoring  or else nothing movesadd t2 tractor beams with 2 tractor power needing say graviton physics l4 and having a 24km range with 600 ms dragging speedgive 5 tractor power to the capital tractor beam i and introduce a capital tractor beam ii with 20 everything 6 tractor beam power 20 more range 20more tractoring speed needs graviton physics l5introduce 3 tractor beam rigs for tractor beam strength range and tractor speedmultiple tractor beams from the same ship should be usable on the same wreckcan tractoring speed will be that of the lowest speed tractor being used from the tractor pull win ship regardless of tractor strength advantage
you are really really overthinking this
how does the cyno generator know its highsec how does your ship know whom the wreck belongs toanyway dont like that idea i think the potential to abuse is far too greatits more than enough that anyone can salvage wrecks no need to give them the ability to drag them away while youre trying to salvage themand you know thatll happen just because
not supported see reason above
big if this change would require a change in how the tractor beam work and in aggression seeing how many bugs the stealing mechanism has show in the past i have strong doubts about how it will worksomeone know if the bug about opening another player jetcan and selecting the stuff but not mowing it so that when the jetcan owner take the stuff you get aggression against him has been correctedwe will get a equivalent bug where tractoring a can for one cycle will allow you to get aggression against the can owner when he take his stufftractoring back the can would create aggression against the original ownerif you original owner are tractoring a can and i lock it with my tractor beam we will both get aggression against each otheradding something that could mean a lot of new bugs against a very slight annoyance not supported
the stuff in the wreck belong to the person but the wreck itself is no ones i fully endorse thie service
yes i want to tractor everything i want to rig a dessie with 8 t2 tractors and snatch everything insightstupid jet can miners try to chase that can whilst i am tractoring it across the roid belt
when probing the recover probes button is right beside the analyze button this often leads to frustrating moments when you click the wrong button by accidentsimple solution is move the recover probes button to the right hand side and move all the other icons up by 1
supporting my own thread
signed it sucks when you accidentally have to launch and reposition all your probes again just because your mouse slipped a few pixels to the right
yes please
yup simple good design
oh boy you have no idea how often this happens especially when you are using synergy on several boxes
just be careful just go a bit slower it will save you time

allow courier contracts without any maximum size limit imposed when every ship is going to be rigged starting next month having a way to easily move large numbers of smaller rigged ships will be nice having to use 1 contract per cruiser you want moved is a waste allow people to bundle several rigged cruisers and anyone with a freighter big enough can accept if it totals 600k m3 thats fine arbitrary limits are badedit change the max courier size to 981250 m3  the size of the biggest cargo hold in the game courtesy of herschel yamamoto more than 100 items would also be nice
im pretty sure that csmver2 brought this to ccps attention and ccp said they were on itofc that might mean it will take 10yrs to get implemented
it should be 981250 m3  the size of the biggest cargo hold in the game
1 the limit is not random it is the size of a general freight container2 i think the rig situation will mostly change for frigs and cruisersthey can already be contracted and fit into the 120000 mUFFFD limitso only bc and bigger would be left outsupported anyway i was even hoping the orca would be able to carry 1 rigged bs
sounds good
perhaps because you can discuss the price with the seller sure you can do it as well in game but on the forum it is much easier plus people prefer the forum more than contractsyep  i agree it is a great idea to create sell divisions
hell yea  do it fast
why would we give people a choicewhat about services  what about t2 bpo etc etcgreat idea
id support this idea if they changed the public auctionitem exchange mechanics to allow you to accept from anywhere in the game instead of having to be in the same region as it is nowfor now divide the sell forum
it has come to my attention  though this thread  that alliance tournament slots are being taken by certian parties to gain a profit on this occasion which is the alliance tournament it is un sportman like as the only event of it kind it is a shame that people will delve into this deep hole to spoil such a occasion as this to link it to profit i am making this post to set a proposal to the csm to push ccp into making a few signing up changes to insure that only people that want to compete have the chance to get into the tournament to win it fabled prizes the selling of alliance tournament places are fobidden punsihment would obviously be at ccp discressionalso if there is any csm member looking there is also a movement of people in the thread calling for the csm member to forfeit his alliance tournament position  this being the main reason i am brining this thread to the assembly hall  i believe that th csm is here to look out for all the capsuleers you are our voice to the ccp community you are there to look out for the communtiy and yet you have a member of the board here not even aknoledging that the public that you ment to be looking out for are ignored recapthe end of distrubution of alliance tournament slots up for sale any alliance that does not want to compete to forfeit there slot and the next back up alliance to be put in it place let not spoil something good it we dont nip this in the bud now next year or the year after will be full of alliances joining up to it just to sell to people that want to compete in the first place ruining what this occasion is ment to be for if you believe with this thread stands for please action if by giving it your support armoured cedit at most make this the place holder for next alliance tournament let it be for all sales at this continous moment to save the future of the alliance tournament if that is the comprimise that must be had got to give a little to get a little
1 to ccp doing somthing about abuse of the alliance tornament and also the disrepect of the office that the csm in question holds

i actually agree with this threadbut only on the condition that the rule is not retroactive and that larks auction is grandfathered inhe is playing within the rules crying to get the rules changed to get him in trouble just because you dont like what hes doing is moronic
500
yeah any sales that have gone though before rule change are allowed to since they were agreed upon before such rules were introduced
i would ammend this with the provisio that they can only sell the slots to a reserve alliance and must then become a reserve themselves that way noone has to do the corp shuffle and the winner of the auction can simply step into the arena and pew pew
im for the change but not retroactiveyou cant change the rules cause someone else had a ideal to make some iskso next year sure but dont pizz in his parade
current auction  should be allowedrule change for next tournament  eh why not
good job to him for thinking of this
so how would ccp prevent selling the alliance tournament spot to someone else it would be really easy to do it privately and for every at that i remember there is always some people joining corpsalliances just to participate in itfix for next at let everyone in
i put a edit in the first post at best i would like to see anynew auction for spots from when ever the rules set is in place to be against the rules likly hood of it making it into the rules of the next tourney would be acceptable not making it in to the rules at all well that is a dark path since this has been put into the public veiw there will be more people wanting to do this which obviously put less pvp on the field until candidates have purchased a slot i know some of you are compairing it to normal expenses of buying items and such but this isnt a item this is a tournament
the logical rule that should be added to the next tournament and following ones ispilots eligible to participate in the alliance tournament must have been part of the alliance since the moment the application was submitted up until the tournamentclarification   this would automatically disqualify character sales too since you have to drop to a npc corp as per current character transfer rules it would also disqualify alliancejumpers trying to get into as many alliances as possible to become eligible and it would automatically make selling spots in the tournament impossible as a resultac  i strongly suggest you rephrase your op to make the above clear
not supported goes against the spirit of eve
not supported at allthe posted rules does not restrict the sale of alliance tournament spots
immediate ban retroactive to include the current auction
fair enough each to have thier own opinion spirt of eve fair point but the tornament is a change from the normal eve gameplay and these types of things are killing the spirit of the tornament imo anyway 
selling an alliance tournament slot is in my mind no different than selling a betting slip at a horse race it is a valuable asset and it is yours to do with as you please if ccp doesnt want this happening they can go back to giving out prizes evenly spread across alliance members i do not under any circumstances support a change to game rules telling people who they can and cannot accept into their alliances  and make no mistake that is exactly what youre asking for not supported
if this is allowed come next alliance tournament then expect to see a ton of place holder alliances bidding for slots for resale expect to see me there with 10 myself
definitely agreednobody should be able to buy their way in
agree the ally touranment should be hold in respect and also larkonis trassler of neo spartans laconian syndicate should clearly be removed from csm for his actions
just because he thought of it first imo i see no problem here
the above sums up my thoughts on this aswellbesides who cares the allaince tourneys have been a sad sad shadow of their former glory ever since 2007
imo laconian syndicate should be kicked out of the tourney and replaced with one of the backups if they already sold their spot the money should be refunded no further action needed beyond ccp making it clear that the spots cannot be traded
you mean back when bob was owning all tournaments because they had the most isk to invest in it and everyone knew who was gonna win your a freaking idiot manthe accusations of lack of emorality the edrama the tears  of tri  all make it seem like this tournament is gonna be a hell of a lot of fun not supporting this
let them be sold slot in motor sports have been sold in the past why not let that come into the game
seeing that what is sold is a place in a alliance for some corp wanting to participate into the alliance tournament i see nothing making that unacceptable per se i find a bit disturbing a csm delegate doing that as they should keep a higher standard of conduct than the average player i know big dream like the politicians had a higher standard of conduct than the average citizenso while i find the whole thing not a shining example of flawless morality it is fully acceptable within the game rules and moral standard i must admit i would find fun if after the tourney end in a very eve scam stile the alliance would keep the prizes whatever they are this year and the paid isk while kicking the corp out
silly this is totally in the spirit of eve and should be encouragedif the system is not changed i predict a great market for tournament slots next year more capitalism
i was being silly and wrong sorrymake it count for next tournament
oh please bar the one team that flew the imperial shipwho lost any selfrespecting alliance can afford a run at he alliance tournament i could selffund it if i wanted to and im not an especially rich player unless the rules back then allowed for officer gear or something money is not an issue for any serious alliance that said i agree with you  this at is going to be fun to watch the drama only makes it funnier
not supported this is hilarious
thisalso thisfollowed by with the minor wording difference that the eligible pilots have to be part of the alliance since at least a day before the lottery for tournament spots took place and allowing maybe 23 pilots that arent eligible by this rule per team or some kind of ratio depending on the amount of pilots per team rounded down for example 33 in a team of 8 would mean 2 noneligible pilots allowedi also hope and expect that lark scams the pilots of the auctions winning team out of any rewards they would possibly win the rewards do get to the alliance executor corp or its ceo i assume
this stuff is why i voted for lark in the csm election go neos
should def be stoped and the teams that do get pulled out and the spots given to the people who lost out on the draw
pretty sure this was considered by the devs before they decided on the formatso you ban alliances from doing what im doing how many others are going to do it on the quiet how are you going to enforce thisno alliance may recruit new corps or members after the listings have been published thats going to put a downer on things im not the first person to do this and i wont be the last
participating at an alliance tournament is a sport jumping on the opportunity and making a business based on the weak ruleset is just wrong those who are saying that this is very eveish are right eve is a harsh world people are scamming each other around all day but that does not mean that the alliance tournament should be like that as well it is not pointing into the right direction you do not honestly believe that the at7 team at ccp sat down to a table and agreed that cool we are going to do a lottery so that those who win can sell their places for good it is quite obvious that there isnt much ccp can do right now to stop this from happening at at7 as the rules are fixed and changing them now would cause a lot more trouble than good however here is an opportunity to learn from for at8 so this does not happen again they should either drop the lottery and find some other solution or make some new rules that counter this tournament position selling like someone already suggested only allow pilots to the fights who were members of the tournament before the alliance applied tbh i can live with the feeling that new members in my alliance cannot fight at the tournament if this rule makes the tournament cleaner why would i send my newest recruits to the alliance tourney anyways this is not a playground those who send pilots who just joined the alliance are most probably either selling the position or an alt alliance so its not a big loss anyways i support that the csm discusses this problem internally and if they find that this is a problem escalate it to ccp
man its full of cry babies here get a live or friggin bid to get neo spartans out of a pure alliance tournament
limit tournament to sov holding alliances there i said it p
this
i am sure laconians are just disappointed they cant hotdrop with carriers and pulled out they shouldnt earn money from it
for those of you who dont live in 00 let me give you some backgroundmost 00 outposts dont have a lot of office space when youre trying to have an alliance of several corps live in one of these outposts each office slot is valuable when you dont have any hangar publically accessible for say capital ship pilots to access corp jump fuel it becomes a huge hassle on a corp level pos corp hangar arrays are not a suitable alternative because they go offline when the pos is reinforced meaning you cant access anything inside on an individual level pilots cant set their clones to the outpost remotely without an office adding one more thing that just makes life in 00 a pain in the ass as it stands now corporations that own a 00 outpost control who is allowed to rent new offices and how much these offices cost if they sieze an outpost from a hostile alliance generally the hostile alliance will rent all the office space on the way out to salt the earth the conquering force can at best uncheck the publically available option and wait for the hostile offices to expire but herein lies the problem in addition to the month of rent they just paid for the office owner can also renew for the next month even if the station owner has made that office slot unavailable the result is that the office slot is unavailable for up to two months two months alliances are born and die in this hilariously long time period you can have sov3 jump bridges and cyno jammers and still be weeks away from hostile offices expiring so allow station owners unrent offices at will the effect of this is the unrented offices corp hangar assets get put into impound so if the station switches hands again the owner just unimpounds it whoopty doo but it lets the conquering station owner actually be able to properly function and live in his new piece of 00 real estate

zastrow told me to post hereand its a good suggestion anyway
this needs to happen not having enough offices for not just your allies or alliance members but a single one of your corps when you take a station is beyond ed
yes
not supportedthe current mechanic is perfectly within the griefingpvping spirt of eve if it was infinite maybe i would say it should be changed but 2 months sounds like an sufficent ammount of time to allow the losers get just a tad of revenge on the new station owners
i can see some hardcore griefing happening if offices can be arbitrarily placed into impound  forcing a fire sale is one thing but making it not even saleable id prefer that this be implemented with a bit of a delay on it  say a week to let people at least firesale their stuff or contract it into personal hangars this wont be such a big deal in cases of conquestsince you know its coming with time to spare but in cases of alliance drama and such itd be a reasonable defense mechanism that said the broad strokes i support

personally i want wis the lack of it to this point is the main reason i havent played eve until only a few weeks ago ive played many other mmos over the past 20 years yeah i consider some of the old muds as mmos  and am looking forward to a few others such as star trek online gawd i hope they improve the character graphics before launch and fallen earth but even though eve has intrigued me the lack of ingame characters has kept me from taking the plunge it was only after a visit from my brother who plays eve and his revelation that wis was getting near that i decided to open two accounts and get startedthe game asitis is quite awesome but the lack of a real ingame character is a turnoff to me as im sure it is to many many other mmo players ambulation will give eve the muchneeded personification that is needed to actually pull a player into the game universe and will probably lead to other interesting features as wellsonot supported

i support removing insurance for both concord destructions and self destructions
this but it also only makes sense if players are not allowed to stay in invincible corporations if they want to talk about adding more risk to hisec griefers why not add more risk to carebears who sit in state war acadamy and are unkillable via any other means than a gankwhy should npc corporation members be allowed more safety from gankers if they dont have to give up anythingill support this if you add on boot players from npc corps after 1421 days trial periodif were talking about risk vs reward why are npc corps immune to wardecs i say once a player is passed their noob time they gain the full benefits of becoming an eve player wardecs and allyou have to look at the reason some people gank in hisec its either profit grief or because someone is unwardecablefor profit i agree remove insurance from concorddokenfor grief i agree remove insurance from concorddokenfor unwardecable give players another option to kill themsome of you people are talking always about risk vs reward where is the risk in an npc corp where you cannot be wardecced and killed via normal means
remove all insurance thats totally fair
exactly the point if you do it for lulz you should pay in game for the right to get your lulz and killmailsin low sec00 you pay with the risk of being the target of a preventive attack in high sec where the target cant do a preventive attack you should pay losing the isk you invested in the shipleave it for rookie players in the first few months and maybe non combat ships in high sec the problem is what that will do to the mineral market
had wondered what happened to this agree with self destruct as wellsupported
i cant help but laugh all those folk who are ranting raving about this being an idea when it really gets right down to it they are just whining like a bunch of carebears they being the gankers and pirates who like to exploit insurance only to get concorddconcord governs the laws the insurance is handed out by a corporation of the concord assemblyin all reality all this crap about the insurance company not answer to the law is a load of bullsupportedif you get concorded or you self destruct you should not get any insurance backthis has nothing to do with why or how or wardecsits just that simpleyou really think my insurance company would really be thrilled to find out i drove my car into a wall for the expressed purposes of getting a new caryeah righttoo long you people have had it made in the shade for consequences there should be penaltiesthis doesnt take away your right to suicide gank or greif just makes it a little more costly

absolutely not
proposal ban whiny carebears who create thread after thread asking for the same thing in different terms supporting disex quit whining and spamming the csm forum this is what your fourth thread
no and why the  isnt there a no support option
to be perfectly honest and i say this as a pvper who likes to kill people missioning in lowsec it is far too easy to scan people out in a mission nowi used to mission in a nice little 01 system called annancale the lp was enormous and it was nice and quiet this was of course way back before even the first round of scanning changes when it still took a lot of skill and a ton of luck to probe a missioner out but that risk was always there and it made it a little bit more funnow that risk is a near certainty which seems to me to be a little absurd low sec died big time when it became a virtual certainty that missioning there would get you scanned out some kind of rebalancing is needed probably a little bit with the scanning system and a little bit with mission mechanics related to scanprobes
next patch will introduce new implant sets that can make you 100 unprobable now your getting more than your asking for 100 safety isnt that enought imho if you still think that combat probes needs increased time after that then i think your just after to grief pvp playersnot supported
for the love of god stop coming up with this pathetic elitist excuse for everything that is unbalanced in lowsec its first and foremost a game and a game is meant to be fun when only one party has the advantage and can pretty much own the other its not fun its unbalanced and should be tweaked accordinglyno lowsec is not supposed to be safe and its not anyone can attack anyone there without concord interfering and thats what notsafe means not that you can also get ganked in deadspace by anyone without warning or any way to detect itim not the most experienced prober out here far from it but ive written a guide on advanced use of the directional scanner to probe ships faster which pretty much confirms what the op is referring to i wont say its generally easy to probe ships but ill say its easy to probe ships without them knowing about it when you know how to do it too easyeve online might be a mmorpg and not a solo rpg game but you cant always fly around with a fleet of friends with big guns a lot of players are more casual or are in newer corporations where theres not a lot of experienced pvp players upper lowsec systems such as 04 should be a viable option to run missions in without being ganked so easilyand by the way theres a big difference between not wanting to be ganked 51 by elite players in a 04 system without any warning and not wanting to do any pvp at all stop calling everyone a carebear just because they want some aspect of pvp combat tweakedi support the proposition in general in the sense something needs to be tweaked so that victims being probed down can have a better chance at detecting incoming probes one thing they could do though is to have a sort of deactivation delay when recalling probes where the probes would stay at their deployed location for a few seconds before flying back
thanks for keeping it honest lucas i know this isnt going to be a popular thread among low sec pirates who insist in having it easy i expect the flames and i also dont expect a whole lot of support on the matter because i know i am one of the very few dedicated mission runners in low sec the little bit of mission runners that ran in low sec have packed up and moved back to high sec or 00 rather than attempt to correct the situation and with all these easykillpirates on these forums ensuring their playstyles stay easy i dont blame them ive moved around a whole lot in low sec and have noticed there arent many around like me anymore its mostly players that occasionally run missions but dedicate their times in other things mostly pirating themselves i hope ccp can remedy the situation soon rather than later
oh my you seem to be a exceptional narrow minded person combat probes are not only a tool for mission busting pirates they are also used for fleet combat and in a real combat scenarios ships are not sitting still in a mission spotthey very much need the fast scanning time to be able to track ships moving around in systemsin fleet combat you rarly if ever got the luxury of having time to exact pinpoint someone whit directional scan moving out scan range and launch probesarange them for 100 hitsif you want to be safe wait for the new implants and stop comming whit stupied ideas that you have no idea what kind of impact they will have
no unless you are equipped with an extra chromosone and safespot 1000k from a gate or planet it generally takes two passes and at least 30 seconds to track down a ship that is safed or in a mission
quite wrong it may take more than 30 seconds in total before you can warp to someone but it only takes 510 seconds to do the probe scan and get a 100 hit on the target if youre using the directional scanner first to find his location and range so in the end the target can only see probes on his scanner for that much time and if by any badluck he wasnt refreshing the scanner at that precise moment he wont see them at all and get caughtsee the guide linked in my signature for more details
then all they would have to do is only make it slower to scan targets that are in mission deadspace locations
i wouldnt mind a change like this at all since it allows both scenarios to coexist but i suspect avariels concern is more of an excuse and not the real reason for not supporting a change to combat probes but honestly i cant see any easykillseeking pirate agreeing with this change ever
the imicus grows on you give it some time
as the word about cosmos is now out officially i suggest the csm takes some time with ccp to go through the cosmos plans to provide some early feedback why wait till the release in winter and the saucer eventually hitting the fan the csm with its unique combination of people knowing big alliances small corporations pvp carebear security features community design and being tied to the player base can seriously aid in prioritization and provide opinions on how enhanced game experience would have to look likeon top of that we might be able to pull some additional info out of ccps noses 
reallyreallythe csm has no place to ask to ask to see new things the csm can be shown things if ccp trust the csm theres legal implications with doing so as per your nda having a csm saying hey we want to see this thing and know things that others dont just makes the csm seem like a group of elitist players who wants to see things in advance of everybody elseccp has shown the csm things in the past but that has been something solely left to ccp to decide what if ccp thinks that its important enough they will contact you and arrange a meeting to discuss it or even show you in iceland but requesting to discuss something which you have no reason but oh we just want to discuss it and get all the neat details just puts the csm in bad light imo
where in the op did you read an intent to breach the nda lavista the csm has been established to improve the ccpplayercommunication and have an additonal feedback channel very well then the dev blog clearly shows that ccp is willing to ventilate the topic to some extentmy proposal shall indicate that the csm is willing to discuss with ccp on that matter on as much as ccp are willing to reveal
nowhere did i state that anybody is going to breach the nda however when ccp discusses upcoming features with the csm its nda covered its that simple
sure the csm can see the shiny new stuff if they like not sure why you think you need a forum thread for this though  its a request not a resolution
currently because of the way the keyboard shortcuts are treated by the game you always have to use key modifiers shift ctrl alt or otherwise the game would become confused when you want to chat or type text in any input box there are also several keys that you cant bind for some unknown reasonsmost mmorpgs have remedied this by having a text input mode system where when you press a certain key usually enter or  or when the focus is switched to any text input box all singlekey bindings that can also be used for typing text are disabled until you exit the mode by clickingtabbing outside the field or by pressing esci think im not the only one that would like to be able to bind any function to a single key az 01 numpad keys etc instead of having to press multiple keys for everything but module slots and ui functions using the f keysfurthermore there shouldnt be any keys you cannot bind unless they are used for core ui functions such as altf4 tab enter and esc etc and also the system should be able to detect any key automatically including peripherals such as joystick and game controller buttonsthe process of binding a key using key modifiers should also be transparent no more shift ctrl and alt checkboxes you should just have to doubleclick on the function name in the shortcuts window and then press whatever key or keycombo you want to bind that function to which is pretty much a standard for most games out therein short mapping a key should work like this1 open the shortcuts option2 doubleclick on the function you want to change the key binding for3 the game enters key binding mode while in this mode all other keyboard shortcuts are disabled so you can use any4 you press the key or key combo you want to bind5 the game automatically detects the key and binds it to the function if the key is conflicting with another function binding a prompt pops up to tell you so and asks you to confirm if you want to unbind the conflicted function or not6 you click a save button to save all bindings doing so would save the bindings into a local file whether its in readable and editable plain text or that its binary is up to ccp but being able to directly edit key bindings in a file would be niceim aware this would require a lot of rewrites but i think its very much needed and is worth mentioning to ccpedit changed thread title to something more to the point
i dont have too much of a problem with the status quo but i think this would be better supported

choosing damage types becomes a moot point in pvp screw pve where everybody as in everybody that isnt comedy fit andor rattingplexing omnitanks in the first place and most missile bonuses except a select few namely the raven rook and widow lachesis huginn and typhoon with lolsplitweapons with rof bonus the golem with a general missile damage bonus a few of the amarr missile boats with a general bonus for short range missiles have bonuses applied to their racial damage type with a few ships that at least have a rof bonus on top like the nighthawk and cerb or have a minor damage bonus for other damage types like kestrel breacher and inquisitorgoing by caldari ships kin bonusaccording to my calculations using the relevant ship skill at a reasonable level 4  20 kinetic damage bonus on l5 the damage bonus becomes only more significant meaning less increase after switching ammo switching ammo away from the kinetic bonuses usually only brings a very minor damage increase thanks to that or even a slight damage decrease unless your target didnt plug his biggest resistance hole at allrough quick and dirty calculation examples assuming 100 as missile base damage and listing values for bonused missiles golem sacrilege etc and l5 skill damage for comparisondrake with t2 invul and em hardener has 58 thermal 685 kinetic and 75 em resists going with drake as a typical shield tanking example since t1 armor tanks already have kin as their default second weakest resist and its a decent damagetype to use against to begin withem missiles higher resists than kinetic passtherm missiles 1001058 42bonused therm missiles 1201058 504kinetic missiles 12010685 378kinetic missiles l5 ship skill 12510685 39375so depending on your relevant ship skill youll do around 10 more damage than just sticking with your bonused damage not stellar but an ok increase otoh if you had a bonus on those therm missiles youd get over 30 increase in damage insteadadding another invul further compresses the spread of resists with therm at 69 and kin at 76 leaves you with following damage after resistsem missiles higher than kin resists do not wanttherm missiles 1001069 31bonused therm missiles 1201069 372kin missiles 12010767 2796kin missiles l5 skill 1250767 29125as expected pretty much the same as the added invul doesnt change the resists in relation to each other an approximate 10 increase assuming you hit the right damage hole against 30 with a general damage bonusnow lets check it with shield rigs 2xem 1xtherm shield rigs  2x invul since those are cheap enough for sticking on your average pewpew ship and will probably become more widespread with the addition of rig sizes youd end up with 706 em 743 therm and 767 kin resistsem missiles 10010706 294bonused em missiles 12010706 3528therm missiles 10010743 257bonused therm missies 1200743 3084kin missiles 12010767 2796kin missiles l5 skill 12510767 29125switching damage type now boils down to a meh damage increase of  5 for em and a decrease of 10 for therm missiles with general bonus youd get a 26 and 10 damage increase respectively insteadbest case scenario tank with 2x invul leaving you with 612 em and 766 kinem missiles 10010612 388bonused em missiles 12010612 4656kin missiles 12010767 2796kin missiles l5 skill 12510767 29125now you hit the paydirt where switching damage type is completely and undeniably worth it with 30 increase in damage even over l5 ship skill and a buttraeping 65 increase in damage using damage bonused em missilescontinuation follows
sadly those shield tanks that come completely without em andor therm resistance plugging are according to my experience and a quick glance at a few recent and randomly selected drake and raven killmails at evekillnet mostly comedy fits that pose no threat to you either way and are going to die in a terrible fire whatever damage type you use just a little bit slower or ratting fits where youll obviously be prepared to hit the damage hole if theyre tanking against kin ratsadditionally youll have to find out which category of tank youre dealing with first because youre potentially worse off with em or therm depending on the fit to do so youll have to load rainbow damage first check the damage log for the best hit and spend what feels like an eternity reloading wtb 1sec laser reload times before you do your max damage thats 10 seconds doing no damage except for the launchers that already had the correct missile potentially negating any damage increase you might get out of it depending on the duration of the fight unless for example the dps increase is absolutely needed to break a passive shield tanks peak regenymmv with armor tanks but the general problem is the same while kin is decent by default after plugging the exp hole with a hardener theres nothing seriously left to shoot at except against t2 gallente ships with their high base kinetic resist where youre probably better off with anything but kin missiles by default where the lack of a general damage bonus on everything sucks pretty much too and when the kin hole is properly plugged as well you might start to consider therm missilesin general i wouldnt bother to switch missiles on a single flavor bonused boat unless it can reasonably assumed that theres a gaping hole in the resists ratters that are tanking against specific npc damage types and especially if they tank against kin damage rats youre going against a gallente t2 ship or you know the fit your target is usually using after seeing previous losses using that shiptype on a killboardtldron a ship with a bonus towards a specific missile damage flavour your increases in damage on a proper omnitank hole plugged are on average relatively meh unless you hit the untanked resistance hole and if youre unlucky while you run in with the damage type for the expected weakest resist loaded can do quite a bit less damage than your bonused damage type even if the resist is actually lower than the one youre bonused againsteditps please correct me should i have any misconceptions about how resistances get applied andor errors in my calculations
you forgot about flight time missles dont instant hiti would say something about defenders but i have never seen them fit on anything except npc ships

the only change ill support is if alts where removed but additional accounts where permittedsimply because the alt thing is getting out of hand but that might be an entirely different problem in itselfbut in all things the point remains if they want to lay down some money who is ccp to deny the privilegethen you run into the rich man poor man argumentbut thats a different storynot supported
i hate multiboxing kinda takes the multiplayer outta the mmo
ok gents ive been giving this some thought hear me out herenow im no industrialist by any stretch of the imagination i do not trade i do not mine i do not research etc etchowever i do haul stuff and shipsright now my biggest gripe is that the only way for one to move a rigged bs is via carrier jump sometimes thats not an option sometimes thats expensive as someone who has a corp solely made up of outlaws selling that rigged bs which just ejected can prove quite hard the orca is great dont get me wrong yeah the skill plan may be a little bit out of whack but thats the price you pay for what is such an amazingly versatile little shipanyway i digressadd one rig slot to regular freighters give them each 1 caliberation with the introduction of the new sized rigs it shouldnt require much extra effort to code capital or freighter rigs anyway the only rig allowed is this onecargo bay conversion rig armorcaliberation cost 1converts the entire cargo bay of a freighter to a freighter ship maintainance arrayarmour rig so it slows the ship as its afking its way through the world power from engines must be diverted to structural integrity ships can be put into the fsma fully stocked and ready for war but the fsma cannot be accessed in space nor can it be used for players to switch out modulescost i imagine would be around 50100 mil so it becomes prohibitive for a casual user to switch out on a regular basis more useful for corporations who move rigged ships and the like or as a one time shot for an empire player bulk moving his ships across the cosmos
supporting my topic yo
the freighter has no rig slotsor any slots for that matterthis means youd be opening a can of worms for demands to adding a mass of things that arent necessarythe solution to this problem is allow rigged ships to be stored in the freighter in there full size or allow rigged ships to be packed at penalty of extra spacethis keeps the freighter mechanic asisi recently have discovered how painful it is not to be able to pick or drop off cansbut i also know that such a thing would be widly abused if allowedgotta be careful how far we take this
this was suggested by csm1 tooits not a bad idea but im not sure if its the most elegant solution either
the better solution is just to let unpacked ships go into cargo the conversion rig is just clunky and unnecessary
this is already considered by chronotis no need for the csm
that already works up to 120000 mUFFFD you just need to make a courier contract
yes so they just need to make it work without jumping through hoops like couriers and to take off the stupid 120km3 limit on them
i like the idea but a better way to implement it might be to give freighters subsystems all existing freighters would get the normal cargo subsystem for free and installed so people can keep using them in the same way they do now but you could also choose to buildbuy a sma subsystem and swap them out in any station however even with the sma subrig it should still keep a small normal cargo bay l0k m3 like a carriers corp hangar for modules and stuff like that for the ships it could also hold the other subsystem so it can be reconfigured for moving cargo when needed
tech 3 strategic freighter  price tag 2 billion isk cheaper than a jump freighter but more costly than a freighter
in all honesty there are a lot of other things that could be done in corp management but these arent those thingsnot support although creative
mission guys lose x of their earning to the corp while the manufacturers miners and traders dont lose anything
so i know that ccp is talking about balancing sov and many people may not agree with me on this but what adding another level of sov sov 5the requirementsov 4 in 23 66 of the constellations in the regionthe bonus75 time multiplier on cap not supercap production in your const with sov 5how it would workthe capital of one your sov 4 systems would become a sov 5 system and the surrounding systems in the constellation would become sov 4 systems 60 days to go from a sov 4 system to sov 5 once all requirements for sov 5 are metthis is just an idea being tossed around in my head knock it if you want doenst matter to me i just think it would be an interesting change to sov that would make for some good fun
unfornatually i disagree with your proposal sov at the moment is already hard enough to brake for alliance that dont even want to bother trying to defence there space also make residence who have lived there a while shell them selves up even more which is not what sov needs right now also there are to many super caps in game and so increasing the speed to make them faster it detremental to the causei believe what sov needs is something a bit easier to brake but not to easy to invaders just walk in just something that makes the space more dynamic just so that powerblocks really have to be on the ball to maintain such a large amount of space
i agree with you on supercaps that needs to be switched to caps and i do understand where you are coming from i knew that would be an argument against this idea and honestly i have nothing to counteract that argument
sov 4 is more than powerful enough  i see no need to make highend sov even better not supported
what if it was reworked to where the surrounding systems do not become sov 4 but instead all moons in your sov 5 constellation or even region have double moon productioni would like to go with region because this would be regional sov so i feel there should be at least one bonus that would affect the whole region
the problem with it it that sov need to be more fluid pos shoots are boring and to a dying alliance taking down the new sov 5 would just be a chore it already a bore fest at sov 4 it need to be more fluid as i have stated earlier a active sov where that you need a bulk of members in the area sov 4 is aduqute
i dont see the sov system needing any additionsi see it needing to be reworked from the ground up on a number of areasnot supported at this time
i demand that ccp adds a module to the game that doe the following1 make all ravens  drakes  ships with mining lasers and ships with cargohold extenders invunreable to damage  ewar and or bumping2 will kill all ships attacking the raven  drake or ship with mining lasercargohold extender3 makes you unprobable4 makes it impossible for other people to loot your wreckseve really needs this because the risk and reward between money making and pvping is imbalanced pvp is overpowered
im not sure which bothers me morethe proposal itself or the once again random support these kinds of proposals seem to gain from certain members of the csm
lockedno content in op well no content that any game designer would ever consider
yo add this to the agenda let station owners unrenting offices
im building a game that does the things jarslow mentions with a newtonian physics model its playable but i dont think its playable in a way the vast majority of gamers would enjoy hence i had to program a flightassist that helps the player go into the direction he wants to which of course can be overridden at any time which makes it a lot easier to control but its still several orders of magnitude more complex than freespace or even descent 14 keys just for basic movementworking on the ui now as like jarslow sais you cant get your bearings and speed in empty space thus there must be something to assist the player with that as wellop be careful what you wish for
i am of the opinion that there needs to be a gigantic raw skill points dont matter in eve with a following explanation of how a 1510 mil sp noob can kill a 6 year old veteran in eve if hes having a bad day ie 50 mil sp industrial char gets killed easy by a 10 mil pure pvp pilot or something like thathonestly if there was some gigantic pop up the first time you signed into the game with a click here after you read this and then a are you sure you read this it actually matters in gigantic bold letters just to make sure they did indeed read it obviously people rolling alts wont have to see itthis alone would probably stop some of the whining you can never stop it all

at the moment you only need sentry drone interfacing 5 to use all races t2 sentry drones this is not in line with the other combat t2 dronesso i propose that the racial drone specialization skills should be needed as well in the same way as for t2 heavy dronesso to use garde ii you should need sentry drone interfacing 5 as well as gallente drone specialization 4sure it will require a few more days of skilling but the benefit is that you get the damage bonus from the specialization skill applied to them
yup get rid of the 10 dps drawback sentries have at present

this is what i expected to see when i heard about pos as a newbie i was vastly disappointed when i saw what we have
i too think this is a very good idea it just makes more sense  if my ship can fit in a carrier why cant i
so i fail to see your point no really i dont see any point at allsupported
tbh remove damn jumptitan bridges and make it so mstitanscarriers can move docked ships around ms should have an stupid large bay for docked ships followed by titans and then carriers not more than a couple of bs sounds fine maybe only 1
yes it would be fun but it has been stated times before that this is not possible due to certain session changes player logging off in ship etc and it screws up the code hence this is why it is and probably will never be integratedasking for this again will not help

omg 2005 xwhat the hell ccp the orca is fail its time to admit it  the orca is not a hauling ship
supported
bumped because i love my wyvern and she doesnt feel the lovei dont disagree carriers are logistics tools as much as support for dreads if and when regular fleets come rolling in but since mss cant dock they suffer greatly as a tool to haul ships around with seeing as you have to have pilots on both sides to load and unload where with a carrier you can just dump em into your hangar and contract or trade them back  or deliver if you have an office and they are corpmates also the mother ship has no more bonus to repping than carriers so its no more effective to rep with one as well they also limited by the fact that they melt like butter on a stove when they get into a cap fight so why bring one at all i guess what im getting at is they have very little purpose and use in the game as it stands unless you wanna lose it this is cause their survivability is soo low that its sad all we are asking is to give mss a purpose that is different than a carrier something they excel at other than drones finally for titans i would love to see battle titans with guns fitted and a siege mod warping in with the carriers and dreads and motherships to cap fights like a mixed fleet of caps instead of look a fleet of dreads spotted with carriers who are really just dread pilots who are in training
still no rewrite from vuk though maybe he is waiting until the meeting at fanfest or maybe with the upcoming winter expansion changing sovereignty there is a little sentiment that ccp have made up their minds internally already and trying to push any changes by players is a waste of energy
agree 100 percentmother ships are in dire need of some enhancements they arent even close to being worth the cost in their present form especially considering all the shortcomings that ccp has saddled them with at a minimum they need tech ii fighters and enhanced survivability otherwise why bother at all
you quote an item on titans to emphasise support for mothership changesodd i like the t2 fighters part however though i would not like even more complexity and little crafting steps simple more specialised fighter versions would be nice heavy fighters interdiction fighters along those linesi also liked the idea that got floated around elsewhere on using the remote ecm burst with scripts to punch dreads out of siege and such
lets keep this at the top for more reading
hell ya would love to see that happen
i agree eve needs this how else can players get a good look at a titan without worrying it will blast them in to bits chribba deserves this most awesome gift and honour
oh yes
only if its called oops i ddd againnot stolen from smirkney smears
in need of an urgent update
these ships have been neglected for ages and need to be brought up again they need some rebalancing for sure and even maybe a look at the drop rates of the bpcsi for one would also like to see them all have unique looks other than just a new skin the only pirate factions which now have unique ships are the sanshas and the angels with some stock ships this is ofcourse eyecandy but would make faction ships stand out more and not just a select fewfull support
with the introduction of the new improved navy cruisers the pirate faction cruisers are looking more terrible than ever ill flag this up at the next meetingedit page 2 sniper
absolutely totally supported and thanks for taking up the banner and running with it larkonis the faction ships are way too cool an idea to let languish like this
basically at the moment its only the pirate faction ships that need looking at the navy varients are all pretty solid but sub bs size all the pirate ships apart from sanshas have anaemic fitting and  slot layouts ill be pushing for these to be looked at
i got the impression that ccp are already aware of this problem the only faction ship that is clearly superior to everything else is the nightmare  which was actually modified a long time ago from its original crappy versionthe main problem i see is that ccp have a mental block again boosting stuff simply for the sake of improving things they need to feel like they are nerfing something to act one of the devs said something along these lines that every nerf is a boost to something else and every boost is a nerf to something else we need to help them by phrasing our ideas in a way that make it clear what they will be nerfing once devs get a good sense of how boosting faction ships is a worthy sacrifice to achieve some terrible nerfs in other parts of the game they will be moved into action
mmmmm delicious eom blue battleshipsalso there are no caldariminmatar and gallenteamarr hybrid ships id think the caldariminmatar ones would be focused on shield tanking while gallenteamarr would have armor tanking bonii just a thought
this always annoyed that i cant tractor my alliancemates abandoned rat wrecks because they arent in my corp seems pretty arbitrary
supporting this if necessary have it flag to the owner of the wrecks
if you added vectors into the mix i think you should make t2 and overloading a part of the beam function p but srsly supported for what thats worth
supportedhow about have a warning box for destroy active probes too
o
there really shouldnt be any limits its up to the person accepting the contract to determine if they can move the stuffthe reason for the limits is so that players cant make a courier contract thats impossible to finish what they should do is automatically split the courier mission into 120000 m3 chunks that way i can make a single big paying contract to move say 1000 cruisers rather than making tons and tons of contracts which is just annoying
not supportedmake the max limit 600k m3 or whatever but not unlimited it is bad enough with current contract scammers not to mention the contract mess that will happen if unlimited is ever implemented
exactly
up the item count in them as well 100 items would not be sufficient for some super cluttered 00 hangers where cans just arent realistically accessible
sounds good to me

yes
hi tash
this is pretty damn awesome i want a thumbs down icon 
i am sure you mean someone else sorry to disappoint you
make proposal for this and ill agree
whats funny about this is silver 0xd was the first or one of the first to bid on the very spot larkonis is selling a bid of 2 bil i believe
my thoughts exactly theres really nothing that would prevent a private sale of the slotbanning the sale of alliance tournament slots is unenforceable the real problem here is that theyre a finite resource perhaps a better solution would be that any alliance can put together a team and play some qualifying roundsthats a much fairer solution than first comefirst serve and it avoids the sale of slots entirely your team  alternates is defined before you qualifyoverhead is increased they have to run qualifying matches with tons of people but if you really want to fix the problem
why do you think that only allowing pilots to participate who joined the alliance prior to the tourney application would not solve this problem
flash to bang time from applications opening to the first match is what 8 weeks 9 weekssome alliances are born and killed in that time people come and go smaller entities may find they dont have the skill base for what was planned or the prostpect of fighting in the tournament may draw fresh blood into an allianceplacing artificial restrictions are daft imho
all of this debate is completely pointless and yall know itnext tournament everybody is going to use alternate identies to try and get a slot regardless of whether they will openly or discretely swap slots between the various alternate identities no matter how hard people shout here that they are opposed to it from there on the alliance tournament will be known as the x64 tournament
to be honest i doubt it theyve had the option to do this all along and it hasnt really happened  the only one i can think of was chribba putting othep into the last tourney with a bunch of immigrants as the 100m team most big alliances do it for fun and to put their alliance names high on the scoreboard not because they need a huge number of alts to try to win it all its only serious business if you make it serious business
do not supportthis is eveedit and after reading larks posts i will be voting for him next time around
it has been done already just on a relatively decent scale othep was a good example of commercial thinking 5 another but more on a level of failsafe and on the odd opportunity bigger boys went to smaller boys with offers they couldnt refuse isk makes stuff go round with 64 slots people will make effort to get in if they are serious and when people get serious they are not fond of leaving stuff to chance
this kind of tournament sell out is a total disgrace unlike general eve game play tournaments have rules there is honor involved thats the whole pointbut when you put it up for sale you destroy all honorwhats next a bid to buy out judgeswhos gonna reside over this tourny do the judges want to put their vote up for sale start your auctions
have em fight in the arena for profit or have em waste their invested billion just like the others who they fcked with their selfishness
might as well drop this thread as ccp is allowing itso get your bids ready for next year
this
cant change the rules in the midst of the process applying the criteria the op suggest would possibly rule out others who never intended to profit from it some people complained about there being kenny and 5 in the list but unlike lark they wanted to be in and fight really instead of selling their slot similar problem applies to fw corps in general as they cannot be in an alliance while doing their usual business just run it and everyone get over it dont make the same mistakes next time again
asolutely
completely needed there are times where even the station holder cant get an office for a month cause the alliance they procured it from unrented and rented for max amount of time
yes
makes sense to me landlord gets to boot folks and all that
supported
but it prevents the attackers from benefiting from the griefingpvping of conquering a station also its a dumb and certainly unintentional mechanic that ties up a bunch of manhours trying to figure out who owns which office
the eviction notice was when the station was getting shot for the purpose of taking ithonestly station owners should just be able to take everything except the ship a pod is sitting in give the owner a list of all player hangers impounded corp stuff and corp offices about to be closed and let them take it all during the first day after they take the station and have system sovereignty00 is supposed to be rough and something like this would undoubtedly clean up a bunch of hangers that havent been accessed in years
whybeen like the way it is for years countless of people corporations and alliances have petitioned to change the system having seen the issue a bunch of times from both ends all i can say is that it fits with the system its like collateral damage or infrastructural damage in a war it is not supposed to end that easily there is such a thing as an aftermathbesides you can always use the interface to both mess with the fees and prevent the continuation of office rentingonce upon a time i had a little spy alt in a corp which had its outpost captured by goonswarm i fondly remember the whining of the ceo for getting his stuff locked up but i also fondly remember the whining of the members as goons teased them around in local with it at the same time on the other alt there was minor ing by fellow goonies about not being unable to unrent the hostile officesonce upon another time and on yet another goonie alt we had a bit of fun with messing around over an office in an outpost we as goons had lost preventing the bad peeps to rent an office to continue their campaign and all that how fun it was to get told how the bad peeps would not see use of the station for another month and a half this obviously after right before losing the outpost making sure all the slots were rented by friendliesso the proposal really confuses me a bit since pretty much everyone has two faces in eve is this just a matter of changing faces as the circumstances warrantif so this is starting to remind me a bit of the whole supercapital issue drama where all that matters is to whine about them when you face them and to declare them ueber fun when you use thembut back on topic offices in 00 outposts are a part of warfare risk reward consequences time delays infrastructural damage we all know the drill i fail to see the reason to change it now that we all have dealt with this for years on end and as we all have used the current system from all sides of the coin
so essentially they can sabotage the station so that you cant use all its feature immediately as you seize itunbelievable no one in rl would do that standard tactic in rl and in most games when you conquer something you need to repair it or rebuild part of the structure 2 months can be long but i dont see any reason why you should have access to all the base functions immediately much more reasonable than the op
rough to rough the leaving owner should have the option to detonate all the ammo and stuff on leaving doing an high level of damage and requiring extensive repair from the new owner
this
2 months is an unreasonably long length of time
deal with it everybody deals with it everybody uses it everybody abuses itgoonswarm has conquered outposts and had fun messing up office fees for the odd idiot still paying them as well as simply using the management interface to lock them out the timers complicated things but people worked around it that is planning and teamworkgoonswarm has lost outposts and had fun messing up peoples campaign plannings by locking down all the offices for as long as possible the timers worked to the advantage for planning and teamworkeveryone active on the playing field of 00 has dealt with both sides of the coin over timeyoure a csm member zastrow it is not too much to ask to provide a rationale here a proper one yes two months is a long time but no it is not game breaking and everyone deals with this the same way it is a factor in campaign planning which everybody uses for both sides of the coin two months is a neglegible timeframe in the ebb and tide of 00 warfareso again why change this all the argumentation provided simply says it is too long thats not good enough if not for the part of riskrewardconsequences then on a simple game mechanic level billing  renewal
and how is that a good reason to just deal with it its obviously a broken mechanicyou put time and effort into conquering a stationoutpost only to have some corp who used to live there grief your newly acquired station in my opinion you should have full control over the station as you own it you put time effort and isk into it to gain control over the station to claim it as your own and you can still get messed around with in your own station your halfbaked reasoning of how much teamwork it is doesnt stand how is it teamwork to just prolong all your rent times to 2 months just before you station gets conquered the only thing i see is a broken mechanic being abused to the endmore control to the actual owners of the station so definitely a support
what makes it obviously its always been the case and everyone has both suffered and used the timeframe that results from this mechanism the griefing as you call it is part of eves gameplay granted the past year and a half maybe two have seen the game get a bit softer but especially in endgame content where the stakes are so high i cant see anything wrong with itquite frankly if this is griefing one could even call kiting pos shields griefing or shooting station services perhaps once a station is captured repairing the services you shot should suddenly be repaired by a single quick click of a button on the management interface  i do agree that whoever conquers an outpost should get full control over it that is already the case but as with everything in warfare nothing well almost nothing you can always disband someones alliance  is instanteneous everything takes at minimum time and effortnow given that everyone who plays the 00 game both suffers and uses this mechanism i get confused on why a change would be needed taking into account the level of gameplay and how people play it to the best of their abilities it has never stopped anyone from waging war on the contrary in many cases it has been used as a strategic toolits not half baked reasoning im simply trying to get zastrow to clarify his reasoning after all this is something which he and everyone who plays on that level in 00 has stumbled into and both endured and put to use the rent times are not prolonged to 2 months btw the timer comes from the billing  renewal mechanism the abuse as you call it depends completely on where someone stands over time in the case of goonswarm for example it has been both something to work around as something which has been used to hamper the progress or operations of opponents it just strikes me as odd to suddenly put this on the table where the mechanism has been both endured and put to use hence the question to clarify beyond the point of too long it isnt a broken mechanism as it works as intended it is not even a case of dodgy intended use the abuse element derives from player behaviour but perhaps it is simply a case of people changing their views depending on their position in game that i could understand
hes not dictating policy you fuckwit hes askingand i support it wis will be an abysmal failure and the timemoney spent on it would be better spent elsewhere
not supported i want wis
dont need walking in stations can still have all the other cool features like players stores
insurance does not cover the whole ship you get what you pay for if you dont want risk why are you playing a multiplayer game
i dont mind risk i do mind people not receiving the full consequences of their choices  good and bad
for the infinitely and repeatedly unanswered question as usual most arguments are ignored with a straw man focused on something foolish someone said for everyone who is whining about how insurance doesnt operate like a real insurance company why arent you whining about how concord doesnt operate like a real police force show me a police force that responds in a matter of seconds and never fails and then get back to me on why insurance has to be realistic as opposed to a game mechanic
why are people who fly warships into warzones still receiving insurance payouts
you mean like choosing to make isk while afk for 510 minutes at a time what consequence should this choice have
it already has the consequence of being far more susceptible to being suicide ganked if i lose my ship because im not paying attention thats my fault now isnt it
it is as realistic as your character immortality and the capacitor tecnology that produce energy from nothing come onif you could open a ineve insurance company you will really pay insurance to ganker and to character that loose ships in nullsec wars how could you make money from thati want to build a insurance corporation but i cannot do that because the actual insurance mechanics are so unbalanced that i cannot compete anctual npc insurance corp cannot loose money they always win what about thatso i support that
only time insurance should be paid out is if a killright is grantedno insurance payouts to concord deaths war deaths npc deaths or any thing where you were blinky red on anyone elses screen can flipping or looting
this times infinityyou guys beg for realism what if you get it concord is not by any means going to be able to save the day anymore think about those ships their cost and what it would take to put them in every high sec system and say goodbye to sentry guns up the wazoo i mean seriously the way the ships themselves is rather far fetched in terms of no upkeep over time and no fuel costs you want this to be more realistic its going to be even worse for you
actually i have often argued for fuel costs maintenance fees and jumpdocking costs to be added to the gamebut apparently people find those ideas offensive
please show me where i said anything about carebears you have high sec lvl 4 missions why dont you go there thats like whining about not being able to safely mine in lowsec high sec is there for a reason quit trying to change the game for your own selfish reasons can i not support a second time
i think perhaps with the current probing issues i dont really want ccp to do anything to probing except fix it though i agree that this is an issue i am not supporting based on thata better fix i think would be to change the spawning mechanic for mission sites so that they spawn far enough away from system bodies that they wont show up on a 360 degree scan from any of them sure this means eventually most pirates will have bookmarks where they can cover more area but hey theyd have earned the quick scangank by doing it the slow way at least once or being really lucky
high sec agents will sometimes send you in lowsec for some missions and declining them severely affect your standing with that agent sooner or later youre bound to have to go in lowsec to complete a mission even if its only 04 systems its also much longer to grind an agent in highsec and you know it the risk vs reward of lowsec missioning right now is just out of wack due to how easy it is to be probed down by piratesas for being selfish i could say the same thing to you stop trying to own lowsec and make it your personal pirating playground as if only your kind was supposed to be in it a lot of pirates have admitted that its getting really easy to pinpoint someone in missions now why are you still denying it
absolutely not there are plenty of ways for a missioner to avoid getting probednot supported
honestly i dont even use combat probes on a regular basis furthermore there is a handy button that says delay should you be within the decline time limit you can always postpone that terrifying low sec mission and then refuse it later on top of that feel free to work up standings with other agents in the area or here is a novel idea join a corp that operates in lowsec or better yet form your own corp and then establish standings in a low sec system of your choosing every time there is a little inconvenience for someone everyone begs for a nerf boring there are so many ways around this problem you are just trying to find an easy way of getting around it i find it funny that you criticize everyone who doesnt support you acting like they are some sort of idiot you need to step down off your high horse and welcome peoples opinions especially when you start a topic welcome to eve expect to get boned hard
my god you are something first of all i did not even start this topic were not asking to be invulnerable in lowsec while we do missions were only asking for a little tweak that would make lowsec missioning a little less of a gangbang haven but anyway no matter what we say you wont understand and youll always be against it because you will always want to own everybody else as easily as possible so this is pointless

hello all the greatest damage caused by the speed nerf is to the small poor frigates clases which now have no chances to evade drones drones now are the hell of frigates which cant do almost nothing against them i can understand the speed nerf ok but drones need a speed nerf too orccp make some good stuff to protect over 50millions frigates against 4 millions ista pop drones  no sense here some ideassmarbombs are almost useless against well trained drones but the smartbomb tecnology is only offensive here some other ways to be smarterbombsthe first one is an ecm smarbomb which only affect dronesor a concussion smartbomb that stun drones like an electical shock smartbombor a repelling smartbomb that makes a a mass effect to them throwing those small bds 30 km away from your shipsall those smartbombs cause no damage to them those are just a defensive system against themor a new hi slot fitting item which reduce the drone range control of a ship by the 5080 like a radar turret interferencer  i repeat hi slot  or another hi slot item which interference with the drone control effective inside a certain area around the ship  45 km max  which make lose the control over drones setting them in a non aggresive status returning in the drone bay or just swich targetor a bloody hell damned virus system which preveal over enemy bandwith drones making them working for you  only limited by bandwith of ship and player skills or a stupid tractor beam which put directly enemy drones inside cargohold  lol  or a new kind of ammunition with the 100 of damage against drones but with also a 100 against shipsor make ecm brust effective against drones and reduce also the radar strength of dronesor just a new skil book which give a 10 smartbombs damage per level still useless in my experience frigate classes need the respect losed with the speed nerfand something must be donei finished  sorry for my english please support
i support myself yeah i think those ideas are cool
review might be an idea to edit the post subject
support me d
frigates can fight drones just fine web them shoot them that battleship will run out fairly quicklyunless its a domi or specifically fit to fight frigs but theyre supposed to be good against small fry
yeah i can target them fire at them hit them and kill them but 5 against one i have only the time to shoot one down the other take me down i presume you are a drake or a raven lover try your hawk against 5 good trained hobgoblin ii and reply at this againyou cant no more mwd away from them they always hit you and they will kill you faster than you can blow them up alli know im lonlie at this because you love your drones and you never want a system which can make them weaker but thats simply necessary maybe not for cruisers battlecruisers or battleship but for smaller ships means escape from certain deathand please dont reply here if you are not supporting those cool ideas i just want to put something good over the plate and there are many other ships with drones not only battleships which are slow and fatty and can be easily avoied i mean cruisers like deimios arbitrators iskhurs curses and all the ships which can carry drones i know drones are the primary damage dealers of many ships but i cant undertand why there are countermeasures for almost anything but not from drones i think drones are cool but they shouldent be that scary im not proposing a weapon which can wipe them out just something that makes them less effective think different
i dislike this proposal for two reasons1 nonfrigates will start fitting these frigate modules which could make the entire battlefield screwy2 drones are gimped enough asis with respect to other weapon systems because they can be blown up and dont have any way to be replenished except in a station frigates shouldnt have free reigni did think that for a while defender missiles should target drones as well as missiles but that could become horribly unbalanced because defenders are a notarget option this however is rendered moot because your tiny frigate could just fit fof rockets or standard missiles and solve the issue as welledit graduate to cruisers yourself or fly an assault frigate
great idea and then any t1 frigate can solo kill any passive tanked bs really balancing proposalno support

as much as i would like it and it would be pretty cool i can think of 2 reasons this would be a problem1 t1t2faction ships how are you going to tell them apart i can imagine clicking on tem and being able to see the mini portrait as original colors would work to an extent but it would add to a lot of confusion2 sever load i really dont know if this would be an issue or not but preloaded and cached ship models probably boost overall speed a bit and this seems like it might add a little work when you consider people are in ships a fair bit of their in game time
i like the idea of opt in so if i want my spaceship game to have everyone in the same ship look the same i canwhat i would rather not see but what some people want is ship  mspaint  penz0rwessletemplates is a good idea colours should be rather subdued though i fear some people may parade around the galaxy in hot pink cruisers that make eyes bleed just to make points
i like the idea maybe not full customisation immediately but certainly extra skins for the ships would be very nice
ok ewar drones would be a blast if they were useful i dont see why few ewar types get 3 drone sizes on top of that lets get some drones that can perform their tasks to a decent degree of competence sd drones zerk webbers think about it oh right warp scram drones cmonnnnnnnn you know its gonna be fun

from fi discussion thread proposal written here basically a revamp of the way scanning and intel information is handledshared in game a more significant change than most raised here but imo an important one i would love to get csm consideration for this
im not sure i like this it just seems too complicated for a game such as eve online which is already quite complex to begin with it all sounds cool when you first read it but when you think about how much it would change the game and all the added micromanagement you would have to do its a whole different thingalso the idea of cloaked ships being pinpointable within a grid is absurd what is a cloak good for if everybody can still know where you are even if they cant visually see you they will be able to fly next to you and uncloak youtheres also the huge problem of server load just enlarging the size of grids would have a huge impact in populated systemssorry mate but i dont support this proposalthere might be a way to do something similar but less extreme and less complicated to make the current system better but this is not the way im also afraid this would favor pirates a little too much as if they didnt already have enough advantages with the scanning system we have now it would also penalize anyone who doesnt play in a huge corp where they can constantly be in fleets as they fly around i dont believe this would be a good thing for the casual player base
an interesting proposali however feel that it takes the speed out of the game especially with small fast fleets as you need to position your scout and let him probe or scan before you can find any potential targets depending on how long this takes this can and will make your gang slower and more easily reported by the intel networks if anyone is watching with a pos or probe networkone of my main concerns is how will stations take place into this scenario as it stands its no easy to get your covert ops out of a station through an enemy gang and into the open space maybe passing a bubble without getting killed also if covert ops become detectable on grid it will become near to impossibleone thing to also keep in mind is the potential of removing fun out of the game its not fun having to do scout duty to protect people its not fun having to scan every damn system to find targets and its not fun to setup a tower in every system just to get a view of it think of the fuel cost an maintenance hours to keep a good intel network you will probably have to do thatalthough i am primarily a 00 pvper im not too bothered with the current local system as knowing who is where is extremely important with 00 warfarepvp the current system provides you the pilot but not his location his ship his abilities or his intention you need to use the directional scanner and some knowledge of the system to find out what he is in and what he is afteron a second note for some who keep popping this up as well its not hard to actually kill the carebears as long as the player is aware and paying attention he will not get killed however if he doses of our loses attention because they take local protection for granted they become easy targets but keep in mind losses in eve arent by far cheap for most playersi think the proposal is interesting and creative but has a few too many drawbacks in its current form so no support however im open towards changes which will give some form of strategic benefit to the roaming gangs
i can agree to that it would reduce the speed of the game that not necessarily being a bad thing  then again it also introduces alot of ingenuity room for error and most importantly strategy and brains to the gameits also a matter of making this work and im sure things like that will be thoroughly polished  personally i will be happy to let go of the name xfe4g no eyesthe more you think about this now anyone who rats or mines or roams in 00 will be fleeted togetherfor maximum efficiency at seeing what comes and goes just by passively linking sensors and collaborating for intelligence trueit could be integrated into the game and be yet another awesome feature or it could be a missbut so far ccp hasnt really let me down when it comes to these thingssure eve has a few small things that bother its still the best mmo yet
i was under the assumption this system was more or less intended for 00 onlymaybe i was wrong but as you say larger grid size in high sec  badi hope this wont be taken the wrong way but i was thinking more 1001 stays the same as alwaysand 00 gets the new system i cant tell you why but the current system is a little simplistic and too predictablewell either way its good to see someone having real ideas
im afraid the op intends this to be an overall change for the whole galaxy and not just nullsec which is why i think its not such a good idea this system would be fine for advanced nullsec players that have been playing in large alliances and heavy fleets for years but not for the casual highseclowsec corp player who only fleetup for major opstheres also the whole change to to the usage of cloaks that i just cant get around being able to know where a cloaked ship is within a grid renders the cloak useless to say the least
ill treat this the same way i treat proposals for new sovereignty systems this is not a complete proposal and it is not ready for implementation however with an issue this longstanding and complex i dont expect it to be  if ccp has spent years not coming up with a solution im not going to expect that a player will its a good idea and id like to see it taken to ccp in hopes of them taking it and adapting it into something workable on that basis ill support it
some replysin regards to the grid size increase how do you think it will increase server lag even if lag is a function of people on grid which i believe is an incomplete analysis increasing the size of the grid will still not necessarily add any more people to it compare it to today where everyone is already packed into a few separate grids each gate each station and each pos location this change alone will not change that and because it offers the opportunity to effectively occupy any space in the system it might actually spread people off those few specific grids which in essence would lighten grid specific loadregarding cloak detection getting a hit down to a grid keep in mind this would still be very difficult to do meaning lots of individuals in just the right locations does not mean decloaking especially considering the larger grid sizes this will add a slight feel of apprehension and fear when sneaking around a crowded enemy system because there will be a chance however slight of being detected fear does equal fun in this caseas to the concerns about this requiring micromanagement i think the levels of action required are misunderstood here there is no actual requirement to use probes or poss ships sensors would still be nearly as effective as they are today currently you know exactly when you enter a system who is there but you dont know anything about them other than a name a simple directional scan might reveal what they are in but only if they are already relatively close to you this will not necessarily change what will change is that you dont necessarily have to use the directional scanner interface to ascertain this information it will also give an informational edge to smaller craft as they will be harder to classify and locate basically this moves a lot of the scanning tasks into an automated system that simply gives you the results and actually takes care of the sharing of that information in effect lessening the management required a basic scouting job would in essence just require being there in the properly equipped shipobviously there are conflicts of interest and of course no single proposal is ever entirely sufficient in its early stages however i feel this would actually make finding and partaking in combatespionage a more natural organic process and actually less menial
whybecause when i fit 3 wlinks and guns on every fleet cs except claymore there is 1 unused hardpoint remaining or with all guns fitted only 2 links remaining both variants are suck and that is one of a reasons to train alts for boostingof course this ships are not damagers but give them enough highslots for their full potential
obviously here is my support
how about we give them all 5 high slots after all they can all fit at least 4 command processors in the mids so you wouldnt want to deny them their ability to fit 7 gang links plus a full set of weapons would you not supported just because you have to make choices when fitting does not mean that the ship needs a buff

missiles dont instant hit but if the dps is roughly the same as the same weapon class of turret theres no problemwhat it seems like from this thread theyre not roughly the same or if the nerf did make them roughly the same people want imbamissiles again so they should be fixed what we could use here is some eftwarriors posting theoretical numbers if there are already some i apologize that at least should give people a reasonable idea of how unbalanced things areeftwarriors dont use all level 5 for one set and 0 skills for another imho the base damage all l0 and high end damage all l5 should be compared without fitting modules other than launchersblastersrailslasters etc
honestly for all the people demanding more realistic changes to the game ie insurance payouts faster concord response time etcwhy not make sentries realistic as in they dont respawn in mere minutes and they are more destructible for something that puts out that much dps and tanks that well it cant fiscally be replaceable in that kind of time frame so if you re going to change the insurance to make it more realistic why not this and i dont want carebear whines
sure make sentries destructible then make npc fleets drop on anyone who tries to do it i bet the factions see a bit of a difference between murder and an outright assault on their police forces
can i have some balogna i heard i could find it hereme pauses for laughterbut seriously i would stop paying for my alts and so would a good portion of the eve community i believe this is a fun game for people to play not a fricking job so many people on these forums seem to forget this is for fun not so you can vicariously live a successful life or some crap like that deal with itbump so people know who to pod next time they log on i hope they bring alts for the irony
free bump for op because this is silly and everyone should see how silly it isto my quoted friend guild wars can be run in multiple instances on the same computer theres a regedit method and theres a program method regedit is technically safer for your account but i use gwx2 and works fine for me gw is also technically a corpg but whateverand then to the op 3 accounts means 45 a month because i blow all my isk on spaceships and have a general disability which allows me from saving up enough money to purchase gtcsbasically boohoo only one guy cared and thats because he cant afford a second account yet
i for one welcome the idea of jumping in to corp mates marauder  faction bs and taking pot shots at any passers by in high sec letting him deal with concord
wont happen everbackground on capsuleer pilots relationship to ships gunsif you bothered to read about the game wow what a concept youd realize that it would be breaking the games canon if you willthis idea is good but it would not be eve onlineships are not poss and your complicating the game many times over
i have played this very cool game for a long time since it started and i want to help make it more fun for crops they should have corp missions big fights with npcs and story line lots of fun for many with carriers drednuts battleships t2t3 ships a battle that this game can only offer if companies would have to go to war not just a faction battle a mission to take a station with a huge fleet two avery type of ship are a mix of biggest to littlest that would be awsome
and they could call it a level 5 mission
nah if they called it that then theyd be obligated to make it suck i like the suggestion generally but its too illformed and incoherent to be taken forward

yes 
all the hawk really needs is a rof bonusi actually agree with the clip size issue but i think that should be left alone for balance with 4 t2 standard missile launchers a t2 bcu you can melt most t1 frigs and destroyers without having to reloadwhy anyone would want to split weapons or give a bonus to td makes no sense to meedit i use as a longmed range damage while someone tackles
thank you for demonstrating my point so wellan af that requires someone else to tackle for it and does 126dps even with max skills 2 bcus and a 75mm rail in the utility slotoh waityou cant fit all that so youll be down to about 100dps but only when the railgun gets into range i can do similar dps in a crow and be considerably more useful to my gang as someone who uses the light missile setup what do you do with the last high slot and how the hell do you cram a mwd and active tank on therearguably 88 missile dps is ok given that it hits out to 60km with cn bloodclaw and rockets are a whole separate quagmire so if we ignore the dps and say that the hawk is meant to be a nuggets tough active tank to tackle withthe fitting process goes something like thismwdcheckscramcheckdamage controlcheckem resist rigschecksmall shield boostercheckhmm cap only lasts 35 secondsnoscheckhmm up to 55 seconds cap so at most 30 seconds of cap to shield boost with after burning the mwd to get into rangesmall cap boostercheckso thats all four mids gone and weve got 6292 ehp with a sustained defense of 81 surely this is better than the faster gankier jaguarnope my dual mse jag with scram and mwd has 10853ehp so it would take the hawk 563 seconds to make up the ehp difference and way longer if we factor in the 52 sustained defense of the jag certainly more time than it would take the jag to kill the hawkthen theres the ishkur with 73 sustained defense and 235 dps the hawk can offer gallente pilots 8 more sustained dps if theyre willing to live with less than half the dps if we now bring rockets into the equation i need a web on my hawk too so there goes the cap booster and you can forget about ever pulsing your mwd during a fight or getting into tackle range of a neut cruiser or generally being useful in any wayplease move one slot to a mid and fix rockets the hawk will still be sub par but would at least be useable
were using two completly diferent fitting philosophies for the same ship you seem to be going for a close in heavy tackler while i am just sitting at range and using volley damage i fit a ab to mine and run it in a small gang just seemed to be the way it was disigned to me to do what your doing i would just fly a jag or a wolfill try your fitting later and see how it goes
myself and everyone else who has asked for changes to the hawk are idiots because we missed something that should be blindingly obvious  the hawk is missing a slot vengance 4 highs 43pg  160cpu tackleretribution 5 highs 56pg  125cpu dpsishkur 4 highs 42pg  155cpu tackle  dpsenyo 5 highs 50pg  145cpu dpsjaguar 4 highs 43pg  160cpu tacklewolf 5 highs 48pg  125cpu dpshawk 5 highs 42pg  180cpu tackleharpy 5 highs 50pg  175cpu dpsall the tackle afs have 4 high slots with 3 primary weapon hardpoints and a utility high except for the two rocket ships  hawk and vengeance i assume this is because rockets do so little dps that you need 4 of them to get anywhere close to the dps of 3 close range turretsthe result is that the hawk has one less mid  low slot than the other tackle afs because its been moved to a high slot but the extra high is only compensating for low rocket dpsthe vengeance has been robbed of a bonus instead of a mid slot it is the only tackle af with 4 hardpoints for its primary weapons system and therefore has no utility high this has been compensated for by giving it a cap bonus equivalent to running a nosheres a crazy idea  if rocket ships need 4 launchers to do the same job as 3 turrets then give them an extra slot
ill warn you now that my rocket fitting sucks which is kinda the point im trying to make

i agree with the market view approach highlighted earlier as a lot of the code should be in placeall it would need is the followingtake the assets list and use that instead of the market dataallow players to select station system region or all as the rangereplace the market list right click context menu with the standard item rc menu if the item is outside the current station then you would not be able to fit to active ship but all the other options sell repackage reprocess etc should be available if the player has the relevant skills to do this remotelyit would enable you to search your items and they would be organised in a standard layout that we are already used to with the market viewthey could be colour coded to show if they are in the players location ie you need to fit a module and want to see all you have thereby helping you decide if you need to fly a few jumps for the slightly better one you have tucked away somewhereall items ships and suchlike will be under one consolidated list and this could also be then applied to the corporate assets showing which station the items are within and helping manage larger organisationseven with a 10 player corp we have so much stuff all over the place it is a large overhead to sort it all out possibly have the options to create contracts if you need large amounts of ore picking up and consolidating etcsm

i find the idea realy fun dont think theres any big balancing issues and exploits asociatedwhen i started playing i thought carriers do exactly that and i thought it was really cool multiplayer at its best a little disapointment followed a few days later but hey no game is perfectas for the session change and coding issues i dont see how it could be so badjust add a few tiny exceptions to the rules1 carrier does not warp if pilot logs off and has docked players2 no docking in stations with docked players3 if docked player logs off the store ship session change triggers so his ship is leeft inside and his pod warps away that last part should have ben posted in the discussion thread but im lazy danyway i support but seing the enthusiasm in this thread i dont have any hopes of ever seing it implemented

exactlythe light and the heavy interdictor paths also deviate quite a bit and im sure a few more such examples can be found if someone gave it a second thoughti dont like that i have to train industrials if i want to move something why dont they make a transport battleship with say 10000m3 cargo so i dont have to train industrials
supported why because 1 bil is a hell of a lot of isk for the vast majority of people whove been playing for less than a year in terms of hauling we have a bicycle with basket industrial ship a semitruck freighter and a limo with a bunch of fancyshmansy gadgets that takes 3 months of skills to get toorca why not just make a suv suggested mini freighter200250k cargovery minimal amount of slots if any very minimal bonusescost175min summary we need a solid purely hauling ship that players who are a few months old can afford and use
heres what i seei see a thread of a bunch of people who want the following dont want to train adv spaceship command dont want to train for orca want a bigger cargo bay that is cheaper than an orca want something fast and easygot news for you guys if you can fly an iteron 5 you are like 2 skills away from a freighter dont want an obelisk then you get to choose to train something elsei think the idea of different sized ships is great but when it comes to hauling you have five friggin options1 tech 1 hauler2 tech 2 transport3 orca4 tech 1 freighter5 tech 2 jump freighterthe jump freighter has a smaller cargo bay and it is able to jump places so if you want something with a smaller cargo bay there you gothe iteron 5 can carry 50km3 or something very close to it if you want to carry 100km3 buy an orcaseriously youve got the following progressiontech 1 hauler 50km3tech 2 transport 30km3  warp strength or 10km3  covops cloakorca 100km3  corp hangar 40km3 note a carrier gets 10km3tech 1 freighter nearly 1 million m3tech 2 jump freighter 350km3why are you all still whining about this 
when you can haul a rigged battleship though high sec then well be good
supporting tech2 indies are to small no way i want to train up a load of pointless mining skills to use an orca ill probably have to buy a freighter for my alt which is massive overkill1 for a middle ground hauler
this is next to ridiculous if an industrial isnt good enough and you dont want to go the full path and get a freighter training a different line of skills is but the price you payoh someone said you cant haul a battleship in an orca fitted or repackaged this is false you can fit a packaged bs in the cargo bay want to move a fitted and rigged bs quit crying right click it make active and fly it there
unfortunately i do not support this idea as the rapier has a range bonus just like the gallente variantthe other two races get effective bonuses instead of the range  making them in my opinion just as effective at their particular task

you have not read the opinformed comments from othersthere are no complaints regarding not being able to hold down xyz shipwhat you do have are experienced pilots detailing examples of the incapability of the huginnrapierlolhyena to properly dictate range and engage multiple targets as a proper force multiplierits all good thoughyou choose not to support the proposal fair enoughi expect nothing less from a lolcaldari anyway  but at least understand the issue and be against it for a correct reason ehps protip1 vaga is not the fastest ship in the game

cool we just need some new pirate factions new npc 00 space new missions new agents and new pirate implant sets etc etc to go with them
now now lets just focus on updating the old pirate ships first then we can has new sweet looking thukker rifters from gw
they dont have to be awesome or even comparablebetter than their t2 counterparts but yea theyre definitely too expensive for what you get
as a mission running i like the idea as long as adding the vectors of all active tractor beams are part of it and i can shoot the baddy i personally will not i once tried to kill a ninja with my pve fit ouch
stupid immersion breaking is stupid
salvage thieves have quite enough advantages as it standsdowncheck on this idea
i would love to just have tractors be vector adding devices they have a pull strength towards the tractoring craft period everything else is determined by the mass of the tractored object and i mean any object you can haul asteroids if you wanted though it would be very slow and pointless other ships why notof course this would also need to be balanced by my ever wanted total mass  contained mass  cargo mass would be nice to have an empty freighter warp much faster than a full one and relaly how often does cargo mass change a simply calc each time an item is added or removed from a ship would not be game breaking
itll need an aggro flag and shouldnt change ownership after all  picking something up shouldnt make it yours honestly this needs to be fixed for can flipping too because its dumb that the original owner can become a thief to a thief  thats just sillythat said you should be able to tractor beam anything a tractor beam is a piece of tech and doesnt care what it grabs nor should itso with appropriate code to prevent griefing  absolutely
oh and i forgot to add that the same vector needs to be applied to the tractoring vessle in th opposite directionand yes tractoring an object owned by another should be counted as aggression tractoring another ship should be counted as hostile concord

i naturally support my own proposal
would be useful  currently the only option for moving ships around highsec seems to be the orca 
maby a t2 freighter with a ship maintenance bay and no cargo hold
im sure there is some other thread somewhere but nvm its missing ingameand if its t2 it should not go over the 2b range
removing the 120k m3 restriction on courier contracts would allow freighters to fill this role
perhaps a t2 orca
for the bloody love of god no the orca is an mining command ship no matter what stupid classification ccp has thought it should fillwe need smalllight freighters that fill the 75k200k range of cargo we also need a small and large ship that can move fitted vessels it should not need any more skills to fly than the normal freighterswhy does there seem to be a need from the player base to add extra requirements for a ship that really should already be in the bloody gamewe need less oooo shiney design and actually get a complete system developed that is not missing gaping holes
supported 
a sort of space tugboat would be another option too but id like to have a ship dedicated to the transport of large shipssupported
would be pretty useful
id kill to se a mega being tugged though spacesupported
excellent idea
this should be the province of freighters and orcas i expect itll be easier to make ccp let us haul ships in the right hullsthrough one of the many proposals to haul rigged ships than it will be to get them to bring in a new hull for the purpose
as long as its a t2 orca which doesnt need mining skills im proposing a ship dedicated to hauling rigged ships  it doesnt even need to have a cargo bay and certainly doesnt need mining bonuses editwhat kind of skill requirements would be reasonableindustrial vspaceship command vadvanced spaceship command somethingnew skill
ok what is the fascination with the orcait is a misguided vessel that has bastard requirements if it meant to be a transportfreight shipit is a mining command ship it is meant to haul ore and act as a central point to mining operations hell any solution to the hauling of fitted ships should only really require industrials v on a seperate note if we are going to be thorough we need a reworking of the entire transport ship skill systemthere is no reason for there to be racial industrialtransportfreighter skill progressions all cargo ships should be like the ore ships a separate system unto themselvestier 1 industrial 15 freighters large cargo shippers move 1 or many fitted shipstier 2  transports jump freighters jump shippers another section that is missing would be the heavily armored freighters and shippers you know like the transports that have armor and a few levels of warp stabilityit just seems clunky to have some many racial skills splitting out this tree for no real good reason it is definitely an area that could use consolidation and refocus
industrial ivspaceship command iiifor the tier 1 version of the ship that can haul 1 bsindustrial vspaceship command vfor the tier 1 version of the ship that can haul a few bssindustrial vspaceship command vadvanced spaceship command somethingnew skillonly for the tier 1 version that can move fleetsthere should also be tier 2 version that are either faster or have thick hides like the transports are to the normal industrials
i dont see anything wrong in the skill path for the orcaa t2 orca should be able to carry 1 or 2 bsnot supported
ok this thread has little  if anything  to do with the orcathis is a proposal for a dedicated rigged ship transportthis has nothing to do with mining or the orcas training pathuse of the orcas hull because its pretty and easier than making a new model may be a point though  
ugh no the current system is just fine
yep would love to see thisas a side note does anyone else think the orca looks like a memory stick
absolutely a few things that might want to be looked at are but not limited to the open jump bridge and jump to buttons on a titan in the drop down menu there was a great mistake made by olex huzzahs titan pilot he accidentally jumped to a cyno on a lowsec gate in his avatar because of this the trash and make active buttons midian kell trashed all of his active pvp ships in station because of this
pleaseentire scanning ui needs work
too true
i think unlimited is fine or some obscene number like 100000000000why wouldnt a corp with 15 freighters accept a 1bil m3 contracti dont see how can scammers use this to theyr advantageso i support until someone explains why not also i think the 100 item limit is there to prevent excess database load so maybe that should stay
good idea
you cant split a package if you could sure but you cant haul 50km3 in a hauler even if you take two trips thus 981250 has to be the upper limit
 what they said
the only reason i can see why this isnt implemented would be due to database loadwould love to have it
yes please how about some sort of searchtag for that handy filterbox reduces serverload in comparison to additional column i think
very good ideaalso an easier way to drag items from my hanger into a container in my hanger im sure theres a way to do it but its not intuitive at all
sure they can eve is a harsh world where scamming is easy and encouraged rememberccp already showed a willingness to sell out it would be perfectly within the style of the game for ccp to take the money and run proudly proclaiming that they have successfully scammed a bunch of suckers for billions of isk all within the gameany notion of rules and honor was gone when it went up for sale
just because im making a public sale doesnt mean this is the first time this has happened
supported because now the floodgate has been opened the applications for the next alliance tournament is going to be a total farce
and that is what this is for
yeah also did you see how quick ccp were to lock down discussion about this not just on the sell order which is reasonable but in general discussion aswell just because its a csm i bet i dont know what im complaining about though i see so much moderator bias on the forums its unreal
ahahahaha maybe the threads were locked down because they were full of hormonal pubescent nerds whining about fairness in this bleak and deadly internets spaceships gamefyi being on the csm doesnt entitle one to any special treatment im playing by the rules here sonny
not supported lark is doing exactly what i voted him in for
not supported and i wish id thought of touting at places 
if entry to the at continues to be random draw then supported for this reasonhowever id prefer all alliances that want in getting in and then having a series of early qualifier rounds to knock down the numbers to 64
i dont support the reselling of at slots
then dont buy them
i voted for larkonis and i fully support his efforts as a csm as a csm he represents my veiws and the veiws of many pirates many of you have missed the point that isk makes the universe go around this is the very nature of the game we play people will doing anything to make a quick bill i dont see how many of you wouldnt do the same you talk about honour responsibility sportsmanship in a game where scamming is rampant ganging up to outnumber your foe is almost encouraged most people are looking to shaft the other guy to make some isk
what about next year and the year after when more and more non pvp entities enter the tournament to sell off the positions alliances will grow bored and so will audiences since the people signing up are not there to fight are you so narrow sighted to see where this is going and what it could ruin yes eve is about scamming and isk but id rather we have a tourney of fighters as that is what it is there for this is the only place for honourable fights to the death where eve stands still and doesnt become her self for those that want to save the tourney and can see further that 3 inches in front of them support this notion
so stealing a tower that has just been unanchored doesnt even flag as a theft how ridiculous is that steal a 4 isk piece of tritanium and you can be shot steal a tower worth hundreds of millions but thats fine no criminal flag no shooting allowedthat really is bloody stupid
asides from the obvious well do it better crapthe pos is not a can its more like a wreck in a sense with no items insideso i suppose from the programming standpoint i can get why they did what they didbut youd think it would at least flag the thief
deploy your pos in lowsec00 shoot anyone who attempts to steal itprofit
actually pos towers are just like every other anchorable item in the game  you can steal any of them if they arent anchored and none of them flag the thief in fact if you dump out a gsc with items in it and dont anchor it someone else can come along scoop it to their cargo hold and its now if i understand the mecahnics their can and they can remove the items at will
if this is your argument then you might as well disband the csm and close the feedback forums the length of time a bad mechanic has been implemented is not a good justification for the preservation of the status quo ive stated my position in clear terms 2 months is an unreasonable time to make a victorious corporation wait for an office slot to open up in a station they now own
as csm you should do better then one item forum quotes if that is the standard they might as well disband the csm and close the feedback forumsthe two month timeframe is not a problem if the timer is to be changed cool but itll have to be for a different and more solid reason then just we dont like it cause right now for our current and near future in game situation it does not work for us aside of disbanding alliances or people throwing in the towel cases in which unrenting is rather easily assisted or arranged anyhow two months is never an unreasonable timeframe for developments to take their course really warfare goes back and forward after all we have seen this all over the map over the yearssince wars always have timeframes attached which are undeterminable and where planning always requires day to day management and often crisis management in the face of challenges  and heck youve used this mechanic to your advantage and had to work around it  why should offices and their renting mechanics be different from any other sort of war processes or even post war cleanup processes all of a sudden
i would say refund any bills for outstanding rents that have been paid so that the clock runs out on the current rent that way instead of waiting a maximum of two months youre waiting anywhere between 1 minute and 1 month after taking the station depending on the remaining rent on the office2 months is a bit harsh but equally gaining instant control seems equally harsh i see no problem with people salting the earth behind themim sure everyone is guilty of this tactic at one point or another just because you happen to be a victim of it now doesnt mean that a change should be implemented
if your insinuation is that i am only bringing this topic up because of something happening to me in game currently then youre incorrect goonfleet has an office in all of our recently acquired outposts including jlo which we acquired a couple days ago however it is true that this was the event that brought it to the forefront of my mind as ive had the same thoughts every time weve won or lost a station in the past couple years ive used it myself before too when goonswarm abandoned the south to move to delve i personally made sure every last office slot in every outpost we abandoned had all of their office space rented out i could sit here and tell stories all day but the bottom line is that its a bad mechanic the only recourse to a conquering force in the current mechanics is to wait 2 months renew your eve subscription twice before youre guaranteed an office under my proposal the recourse for the aggrieved party would be to take their station back something which could be done in a much shorter timeframe and encourages attacks and space fighting which is the better policy
supported
i disagree i am in full support of this idea
well the current animation only lasts one second so unless the cycle is coming down to one second at least give us gas harvesters something to look atplease 
sounds like this post needs to go in the features and ideas part of the forumand yes i want to see some tornado action
sounds good i shall make a thread
yes and bring back the old tornado animations instead of current vacuum cleaner short pulse
incredibly minor but sure
minor but an understandable issue we all like eyecandy
i think that these arguments are good and stand out from all the other pirate whining but i dont agree one bit1 suicide ganking will not stop with the proposed change it will just make it a bit more difficult and hisec just a bit safer safer not safe2 the profession needs to be nerfed and the alternative provided is to pick suicide targets more carefully whats the difference if you lose 15mil isk or 50mil isk bc example if you suicide an indy with 1bil lootand as for the only argument i find a bit validif someone runs from a dec into an npc corp it means they disbanded theyre corp for the most part and run away from you to hide under concords skirt they have no poses no systems no nothing or if they have then those are defensless all they can do is run missions so you have won the war what else do you want want them to quit the game and die in rl 3 whell a t1 railgun and a cruiser of a yearold trader or miner arent exactly the tools you need to fight of gankers now if some of those new bounty systems that are proposed all around got implemented then i would agree with you on the last part but would still support the op
they make armor platehow about signal absorbtion plate
as for starting this topic who caresowning people as easily as possible get over yourself its fun making explosions and its not like i want it to not be an earned reward its a payoff for the time i spend not doing missionsway to not say anything constructive or counter my points i run low sec missions and i know the risk its so easy to instantly warp out the moment you see someone on your overview if you are being smart about it
youve totally missed the point of this thread you may run missions in low sec but im willing to bet you dont do it as a main profession when you do it enough as i do and your missions start getting busted left and right the problem isnt just surviving low sec its trying to make a profit in low sec i dont expect you to understand as i said you dont run missions as a profession in fact i dont expect many players to understand my problem because quite frankly i know there arent many professional mission runners in low sec anymore theyve all left to high sec or 00  anyway what i do expect is to get flamed by ignorant people i dont mean this as an insult who do not understand whats going on but still have an urge to insult so shoot away  im bringing this to the attention of whoever is willing to listen and understand this is how it is whether you understand it or dont like it is irrelevant
i have changed the name a bit
supporting this thread means supporting a nerf to the keres the forgotten cousin of the helios dont give gallente eaf pilots yet another reason not to fly the thing din all seriousness quit whining about it its a covops ships hence you should never be seen not to mention if youre that big of a graphics buff cross train another races covops if it means enough to you to tell ccp to spend their time on it why not spend some of yours instead
yeah god forbid we use the same hull for 23 or more shipsthat would be just laziness
supported forever its so easy just swap t1 models ffs
hmm does this workezzr
yes please swap the helios model back to the old one
this might seem stupid but i believe this would help more than 1 person anyway its very minor changewhen you cancel a reseach job can the slot be available again right now even if you cancel it the slot still takes the spacewhich mean if you made a mistake clicking too fast then your stuck for x days or weeks or something
considered asking for this before but after thinking more about it i realized i cant actually support it people would just pile up fake jobs on npc lines to let themselves get instant me lines for anything they wanted youd wind up with crazy tactics to fakeclog lines leading to even messier npc lines and harder access for smaller players i get that its annoying but its less annoying than losing your materials when you cancel a manu job
this is exactly why the it works the way it does
not supported as stated by others there are plenty of ways to deal with drones any speed tanking frigate that has half decent skills should be able to kill drones off before they kill you hobgoblin iis wont catch up to a speed tank and warrior iis will slowly kill you but not quicker than you can pop themin short learn to fly
definitely neededwhy does the game tell me that oem is not supported when i try to bind a function to strgUFFFD i mean i can type an UFFFD in normal chat why cant i bind anything to that or to page up or page down man i could go on ranting about that all dayoh and give us a launch drones function
i believe the current system only has a set list of keys you can bind and that it detects the code of the key to define which one it is if the key is not in the list it wont be accepted thats why i think this is pretty stupid you should only have a list of reserved keys you cant bind to but any other keykeycombo you press should be detected and accepted and shown as it is called in your languagei mean this is not like its rocket science to a game developer its very common and standard through most games that use customizable keyboard mappings i really dont see why ccp couldnt spend some time to update that module
im sure this has been discussed previously but i dont see a topic here so ill make onei have two suggestions on how to improve account security1 limit accounts to logging in from their origin country only i have an eveonline account this account is addressed in the united states it is terribly unlikely that i will ever login to eve from a country outside the united states this feature could be enabled by default but have a secure procedure that allows a player to enabledisable this feature logging into the my account section of the eve website would need to have these same restrictions in the event a login is tried from a nonorigin country the owner should be notified in the same manner as described below2 alert owners of accounts if someone is trying to guess their login information if someone somehow guesses my username and tries to guess my password if they fail to login i should receive an email that has the following the username of the account they tried some players have more than one account the password they attempted to use against my account this would be very useful to tell if an everelated site leaked information since we could use passwords specific for these sites if someone hits our account with that password we know where it came from the ip address of the person that attempted to login to our accountexcessive failed login attempts from a single ip address should also raise flags for gms as wellsuggestions have been made before but these were ages ago and we havent heard anything about it
supporting my own topic since all the cool kids do it
what  a captcha to log in  well thats cool  i guess but anywaymhh yeah those things would be good i guess it would stop the chinese farmerswell thats what i can think offfor the account login yeah but wouldnt that be a privacy issue since you know the ip of the person who tried to log in
if something similar is not allready in place then maybe also3 more than 10 failed login attempts from an ip address per day  should automatically block any further attempts from that ip for 24 hoursstops brute force attacks
supported
speaking from the persepective of a nonlawyer in the usmost ip addresses are recycled anyway so theyre not directly tied to any one person at best this will get you their isp that plus the date and time of the attack could lead you to an actual person but only if you supoena the isps records and a court order trumps personal privacy most of the time at least in the united states
greata captcha added to a stupid forum boards system that is already broken to begin withas long as the system doesnt force password changes no problems heresupported
sorry you forfeit your privacy of your ip address when trying to break into somebodys account
ip addresss mean nothing today they can be spoofedremappedredirectedproxyed
running a proxy for the eve server involves a little bit of logistics
your actually saying that thinking its that hardyour treading on thin ice palleave the geek work to the geeks and just take my word for it its not hard at alla little foolish perhaps but easily done
a warning should be sent but you shouldnt be prevented from loging in theres a lot of eve players that are in the army and they travel a lot this would mean they wouldnt be able to login anymore i can also imagine some players wanting to login into their eve online account to train skills while on vacation in another country what about thatthis however i totally support any series of 35 unauthorized attempts to your account should be communicated to you in the same way credit card fraud is if someone is trying to bruteforce your password you should know about it then again i believe your account becomes locked if someone tries to login more than 3 times in a row with the wrong info but im not sure about that
im a geek thank you very muchdid i say it was hard to donoi said it takes a bit of logistics to do meaning it is an annoying barrier for them first they need their usernamepassword then they need to figure out what country their account is in then they need a proxy that is based in that country they can usually assume its us but its not always the case ccp could also narrow it down to stateprovince or city which can be configured by the end user then they need a proxy in the same stateprovincecity as the account holder systems such as geoip are generally accurate enough for this kind of usage any problems a player has with the system it would be their option to disable itccp already uses such system with their credit card validationthese players can go through the secure procedures to disable the feature thats why i suggest a system to disable it a minority of players have this situationthe account being locked after 3 attempts would be very easy to grief figure out the username of your enemy and fail to login several times and he is then at the mercy of the timer or gms to get back in the game
1 if this was implemented this should be a disabledbydefault feature it is your belief that a minority of eve are international travelers but you honestly dont know whether that is true also this is amazingly easy to get around with a vpn or ip redirection service and serves little purpose2 i doubt ccp would release the ip that attempted to access your account the account does not belong to you and you therefore have to right to such information i agree that a number of repeat failed login attempts should raise flags on accounts for suspicious activity
they already show the ip of the the requester for any api call in the api logs so i dont see why not
heh somehow i doubt a majority of eve players frequently travel internationally but sure it could be default to off the problem with that players that are most vulnerable to getting their account hacked are not the kind of players that will go and enable this feature until all of their stuff is lost and by then they probably wont renew and ccp loses a customer if the player cant be reimbursedanother thing the system could be setup to where its not just by country but by state province city as well the end user could have the option of configuring exactly how restrictive their account is country was just the first step the only thing thats important is having a decent and secure procedure to change these settings so someone with the password cant just go to the website login and disable them willy nillysee above post apias far as the account ownership that may be true but its in ccps best interest to help me protect my account from unauthorized use because if someone breaks in and steals all of my stuff my fault or not and their gm logs show nothing they will lose an account 5 accounts in my caseif you have noticed ccp has already started making changes to the forum captcha these are slightly misguided because i believe they are poor methods of solving the problem but it shows they are at least trying to do something to protect the players

no chancei know hundreds of people myself included who have jobs that take them onto foreign soil youre basically shafting a significant chunk of the playebase into not being able to play the game when theyre away with workyoure also shafting everyone who travels to fanfest and wants to skillchange or log in the morning after an epic night out to talk to their corpmatesyoure also shafting people who decide they want to emigrate and would have to run the gauntlet of customer support and wait till the next ice age to have their account details changedyoure also shafting people that decide they want to go on vacation and take a laptop with them only to find that their account is locked because theyre logging on from an ip in a different countryyoure also shafting people who are serving in the armed forces when their tour of duty takes them to far away placesi can see the basic logic behind it but it has a horrible set of side effects where everyone who doesnt sit at home on their buns festering in front of the same computer day in and day out is being shafted thats lots of shaftingeven with controls in place to enable or disable it its a bad idea since someone could take control of the account and enable it for their location and the damage is already done before ccp has a chance to respondsorry i know its suggested with the best of intentions but its a terrible idea
thats why they could opt disable itgive them the option of disabling ittheyd need to change the address on the account in that case plus it would be possible for ccp to set up a system that handles this automatically similar to a password reset mechanic they get an email click on link to confirm changesa good fix for this would be to give players an option to disable itperhaps there could be an option for players to enabledisable this featurenotice how i said a secure method of handling the enabledisabling meaning the account owners email would be contacted before changes take place heres a idea rather than blocking the login fire off an email to the users email account with a 6 digit code ask them to enter in that code if they are able to connect to the eve server chances are theyll be able to get to their email maybe add sms option too once they enter the correct code they have the option of adding the current location as a temporary location 24 hours or permanent location these same restrictions would apply to the website as welli much rather see a random number generate keychain toy implemented but if ccps not able to do that right this minute these are other options
i hope its fixedreally not looking forward to entering a captcha 27 times to login
big signed on that oneedit seems to be working so far
dear lord this is going to suck
yeah i feel like they have taken the opportunity to fix this issue when they put the captcha feature online
come back 5 hours later have to log in again i see theyre still not up to any sort of tolerable standard still it seems a bit less bad than it used to bethough the captcha at this frequency is still more annoying than the relogging was
and it should also have a cone too when its narrowed downthe probes when out and on map display each have their own spheres this makes for good graphical use of them and easy resizing to give a good visual reference on how far out they reachi think the directional scanner should also have this on the same solar system map view and that sphere being easy to resize as well the directional scanner should also be viewable as a cone when its set to less than 360 degrees and this cone should reflect the actual direction that its pointing inthough such changes could make life easier for gankers and pirates its only logical to give the directional scanner a better user interface such as that and would be a benefit to all players in the long run
yes please
was there another issue on this topic could have sworn id already supported still its a good idea
yeah it was mine ill try to find it againedit found it 
ui improvements can only be a good thing
delete plz sorry
when people need to plan the material needs for big projects they usually have to go through a tedious process of checking material requirements then they have to get to multiplying closing windows writing stuff down more multiplying closing more windows reopening windows its a vicious circleto get rid of all this nonsense i propose another application be added to the accessories toolbar with the calculator log and notepad you could draganddrop blueprints from your instation item cache onto the included blueprints list then aside each blueprint would be a small text box 1 and 1 buttons possibly included labeled runs in which youd put in the desired amount of runs obviously once youve added all the blueprints you want to include then set them to the desired amounts of runs youd hit a calculate button then on the other side of the window this application would look alot like the reprocessing window it would give you a list of all the materials youll need and in what amountsupported

supporting this though i cant imagine itll ever happenat least not until the week after we get a moddable ui
i for one hope it will itll make the manufacturing process alot more easy and thanks for your support
i have played eve for near 3 years and never had a problem until the last massive download now the exefile error crashes eve i have google this problem and have encounter many players with the same problem this is a ccp problem not a user problem ccp needs to fix this problem the players in eve will not except anymore excuses fix it and fix it now
can you be any more vague what the hell are you talking about exactly this is hardly a post fit for the assembly hall
why was my words censored it is the exefile error
forget it no help here
moved to issues workarounds  localization
you realize that no one can help you without being more specific my client is fine i advise calming down and providing information without becoming emotional
1 pts for not including the phrase i pay a monthly fee so you owe me ccp

example proposal here that i wanthey if you want a real one wellmhh  i want ccp to buff missilesi dont know its just an example anywayif im creating a thread regarding a subject that i wanti should technically theoretically support it no need for a reply to support my own idea
but for some off fcking reason that i really dont understand like lots of ops are doing ill support my own threadyay looks like my brain just shorted outway to go fused brains
yes i know its ridiculus and i woke up on the bad side of the bed this morningim just sick of this type of situation thats all
cool story bro
this is not a valid assembly hall topiclocked
ive attempted to use them for quite awhile basically they dont workits a thin line between them being too powerful but currently ive found ew drones to be the option that will give you the least bang for your drone cargo if you want to have a usless drone payload then ew drones are the ones to packweb drones are cool if you know how to use them though only come in one size
supported all ewar and combat utility drones need a looking atspecifically ewar drones and combat utility drones should be one of the same no reason for the distinction and they should all come in 3 sizes all of them need a buff except for ecm drones which could use a slight nerf maybe 85 of their current jam strength too often ive seen bs get jammed by a flight of small ecm drones sure it should happen but rarely
i agree with most of what is presented here i dont want nerfs to the ecm drones though but as it stands 5 medium scout sd drones can be negated by 1 sensor booster loaded with a tr script i think they wanted to go with a full flight of light drones being able to act as 1 module but they kind of missed the mark with just about everything but the ecm drones and i still wonder why the warp scram drones havent been implemented those however would be finicky seeing as you have a potential to fire up 5 drones so only 1 or 2 would be needed otherwise it would just be redundant idk supporting btw i didnt before whoops
just a quick review here your contradicting yourself here you say its rare that a bs gets jammed but you want that nerfed  pfff whateverwhy is the op supporting is own thread  why lots of op have an urge to support their own thread  why the  whould you not support your own thread and create one in the first place  flame offyes ewar drones need a workout their pathetic as it is right now the only drones that i find really useful are the damage drones i get more for my buck in these
these are useless issuesand wheat they are not worried about sound considering most people have it turned off

the whole point of being neutral is saying i dont want to be involved becoming involved invalidates neutrality supported in fact why not go as far as saying that any neutral getting involved in a pvp battle at least one involving 2 warring parties in empire automatically puts the corp into the war and the necessary war decconcord messagesfees are automatically sent and the corp goes to war 24 hours later
supported any external action either assisting or attacking another player should cause aggresion
signedeven though i probably benefit from this not being implemented

amidoinitrite
exactly  if you want to throw yourself into a fight fine but it should actually have consequences and commit you to the fight
so if for example im a member of really big alliance and some pissant corp ticks me off and i see his corp is at war or i just have an alt corp dec his i can get a free dec against him by simply rring one of his targetsaggression timers should be increased to 2 minutes at least i dislike neut rr but its something everyone uses or would if they had it available even if they swear on biblekorantorahbaghavad gitapasta they wouldnti like the way neutral rr works now so no support here yet

having experienced this first hand i know how broken it is remote repping should be classed as aggro for the purposes of the dock and jump timer when the target of the rep is engaged

second post updated to include all the issues if ive missed something then post it here and ill update the op when im back from holiday in a couple of weeksuntil then you can always have fun with the chuck hawk gamethe hawks so wet that when it tries to drink a cup of tea the tea drinks the hawkthe hawk doesnt attack it taunts in a french accentwhen you want to bait a velator you use a hawkthe hawks cpu was designed by sir clive sinclair and the cockpit controls are qaop spacea hawk doesnt undock the station spits it out in disgustok i know the chuck norris thing is a bit old but its fun to add some more anyway

support because i hate having to insert wordsslade
i think an alternate solution that might even have a better chance would be to lobby for cargo mass to affect total ship mass this would allow a lightly loadedempty freighter to move faster as it will be much lighter this is something that should have been in game forever but was probably never put in for database reasons still an extra database calc every time cargo is added or removed from a ship would not be a huge amount of extra cpu work but would imo make a lot of sensei dont think youre going to get ccp to pay attention to the small freighter because in their eyes its already sorted
if ccp introduces a minifreighter it should follow the standard training path of ships it should not require x industrial lvl5 only lvl4
dude 1 hmm i bought 16mil of tritanium and need to do 3  4 runs with my rigged haulerdude 2 use an orcafreighterdude 1 nah i know ill go to the forum and make ccp add a hauler to the game that just fits my personal need
actually smartass i have an orca obelisk itty 5 and one of the transports regardless of what i have i still find the inconsistency a point for improvement in a game where almost everything is player constructed supply lines are extremely important the entire ship training system could use an overhaul
once and for all the orca is no small freighter and using it as such would be a misallocation of valuable mining bonuses and skilltimei myself happen to have an orca and a freighter the orca is used for what it is supposed be supporting mining fleets with bonuses and easy hauling hauling not traversing through 15 systems the orca is even slower than a real frighter i know it warps faster but its align time and subwarp speed are horrible just a reminder coming out of warp at a gate bumping it and going 3000ms in the wrong direction in your orca is fun try it out sometimeand my freighter only used for hauling pos fuel is 80 empty for most of the flights not to mention the investment of 900million for the bloody thing
you can still dictate range if you a have a fast gang b have a gang that can kill the fast ships quickly to prevent being drawn away from the main body of the hostile gangb can be done with arty very well and you have the right support ship already on hand to paint webs are for buying some time to destroy or outmaneuver fast movers theyre not only there for tackling because this is what you want these ships to be mere tacklers actually they are obviously intended to be the cornerstone of minmatar tech 2 tactics indeed for any speed tacticsthe notion painters are situational equals speed and tracking are situational because you wont have both speed and trackingdamage without painters since webbing for tracking purposes is counterproductive if you want to dictate range ie move quickly yourself painters are your way out rapierhuginnhyena are painter ships with a web bonus used as a tackler only when their gang is too slow to dictate range with hostiles going at 40 in the first place
supportedduring the nano era you absolutely needed a rapierhugin in your gang if you wanted to kill anything at all people started cross training for rapiershugins just because they were needed so much in gangswith speed reduced to a normal level i think we can cut the minnie recons some slack and reinstate their old bonus

bumping since this is important
i wondered if anyone had asked previously about the viability of salvage drones we have drones for everything else in game why not salvage
this has been brought up previously about once every couple of months actuallypreviously there was a skill in the game for salvage drones but i am not sure if the drones were ever actually implemeted at any rate the skill was removed and ccps typical response to this proposal is that the implementation would be a bloody nightmare so they arent working on it
unless they did something unique with them only make them usable by specialized salvage ships then  no would only be used as a way for missionrunners to increase their alreadymassive profits and move salvaging away from its own profession
well salvaging drones would be great but i think the whole salvaging profession should be reworked if you introduce themmake salvaging a profession like it was explained in the backstoryit should take a significant amount of time to gain anything valuable from a wreck also the salvage loot should require more space ie alloyed titanium bararmor plates even the intact ones require only 001mUFFFD doesnt feel right an intact armor plate salvaged from a battleship should require way more space than 001mUFFFDwhen salvaging was introduced i immediatley thought about fitting a salvager to my hauler and start collecting wrecks in the universe only to find my hauler to be the worst choice i could have made
you mean i could follow mission ships around in a vexor and clear out their mission space 23x fastersupported
in all honesty id like to keep them as relative collectors items tbh i think the main problem is the cruisers being underpowered they dont have the extra push you would want from a faction ship if anything give them a buff dont seed more i like the idea of having the prized ship sort of thing
a slight update of the faction ships couldnt hurt
looks too low to me tbh
sounds good
currently it is possible for a player with low security status to travel through hisec systems with relatively little worry the faction police will respond to your presence but if you are in a fast ship then one has relatively little to worry about even battleships are able to make it through with the faction police not engaging there disruptors for approximately 1015 seconds after engaging youhowever when travelling through concord sov systems notably yulai and three or four others even if you are not engaged on the gates by the police spawns there is a random chance of incurring a gcc upon entering the system and even during warp through the system this leaves the player unable to leave the system or dock and 9 times out of ten will result in the destruction of ones shipthis does not just affect outlaws but players with for example a security status of less than 20 travelling through a 10 system which has concord sovreigntywhile a relatively minor problem it is a source of much irritation if travelling from one end of the galaxy to anotherunder no circumstances should travel through hisec be safe for those with low security status the faction police are merciless and will destroy anyone who lingers around for too long or disconnects while travelling added to that are the risks of happening across a switched on pilot with some tackle fitted finding mid warp that one has recieved a gcc without even being aggressed by the faction police goes against the grain somewhat though
agreedthe whole gcc system is bugged as heck though
yes
in this instance i happen to agree with lark the gcc is there to serve a particular purpose and in this case it doesnt sound like that purpose is being servedi support a more general request to have ccp review gcc mechanics and update anything that seems to not make sense
so  what is the problem im a bit confuseddo you think concord also having a discrete beef for people with a negative sec status even if they are just petty criminals on their own turf it is their sovereign system is a problemor should concord display such behaviour outside of their sovereign systemsor should concord mind their own business and only deal with serious organised crime ppilots with a negative sec status need to be wary of law enforcement and quite frankly it is not surprising to see the equivalent of the feds give a hint here or there or put a stumbling block on their road for people bordering on criminality so the local cops get a little success too once a while makes the chief and the mayor look good in a manner of speaking cause well normally the local cops are a joke who never catch much of anything
this just sounds ludicrous supported
while it makes sense that concord might be a bit more fussy than the 4 empires about who can travel in their systems the way it currently works is in need of some fixing especially the gccs during warp failing that improved documentation
when you are aggressed by faction police you can still use jump gates and dock when you are under gcc you can do neither afaik at least in a shipspecial note evading concords wrath is an exploitso technically ccps own lazy mechanics would cause anyone with a 20 traveling through concord space that gets gcc to be committing an exploit by survivingedit forgot to support
makes sense
need to increase limit of items in a courier contract also 100 just isnt enough without having to make multiple contracts to get items from 00 to the destination
good idea
yessss and fast
please how many buyers do you think that there really are and really if someone is willing to pay several billion over and above the normal entry fee for a spot do you really think theyre not going to use that spot the alliance name might not be one full of pvpers but the players fighting will be i cannot imagine any circumstances where a glut of noncombat players will threaten the competition
i see nothing wrong with what lark is doing
supportedon a side note current tourney should be unaffected and lark should scam the auction winner if he is good he could probably get two or maybe three bidders to payeditforgot to check the check box
thread is pointless as ccp claw has already said that next time around the rules will be getting reviewed so im expecting the changes to come anywaynot supported as people have said your just jealous that he thought of it and you didnt
i think all players should be able to join the tourny if not luck of the draw whay not a fat wallet
so first you argue for unbelieveable ideas then you argue against them make up your mind
ok but then it will follow you in low sec too give you infinite duration global criminal countdown at least as long as you arent caught and get your trial and prison sentence investigate where you live seize your assets and all your clones lock you in a cell if you are caught kill you if you make resistanceare you so sure now that you want a realistic concorda chance of not losing a ship when doing a gank against some daymonth compressed time instead of yearsdecades as this is a game of locked character
unsupportedthread
that made me giggle considering that the thread has gone on for 6 pages after that post
you want funnyevery single reason for saying no is utterly stupideven inspite of the fact that this in no way hurts the criminal professionother than taking away free isk
but drake you know everyone likes free isk
i see the problem and i agree with it it is a complicated issue eve has always been a game of effort vs reward hiding and watching local is deffinaly more effort than running l4s the fact that l4s give more isk per hour than 00 npcing is strange maybe its caused by outdating l4s are getting improved all the time and 00 has always been the same i think this deserves some time from ccp to look at and balance it more
supportedif ccp doesnt want duplicate models just give the ugly model to the ewar frigate who cares about those
i have not flown my helios since the model changed
i want my old helios back 
if somebody sees you flying in a covops then youre not flying it right
supported also the drone commands need to be looked at i hate it when i set them on a target and have focus fire and then they split into groups and they completely ignore the target i set them to which is in drone range
make all racial border regions low security 05 for at least 1 jump so that it would not be possible to travel between amarr caldari gallente and matari regions without passing through a low security system one jump through low security space would make travel a bit more exciting and a little less inviting to afking guilty of that myself the possibilities this could bring to economic game play would be exciting as well there would also be more opportunities for commerce raiding and commerce protection
this isnt uscanada borders were talking aboutif anything the borders between amarrminmatar gallentecaldari amarrgallente and minmatarcaldari would be have more security than almost anywhere beyond capital systemsedit not supported
i was thinking along the terms of a hotly contested nomans land certainly not the uscanadian border i do see your point though
there is a lot of nomansland it is between the jumpgates you never ever go there
not supported if anything these systems would be as ap pointed out even more heavily defended by the races holding them not to mention that the empires have a vested interest in insuring that trade vessels can flow from empire to empire with as little hindrance as possible
i oppose this for the same reason the people ingame would oppose this  itd bugger up the flow of people and goods something fierce commerce protection is for people moving things to dangerous zones
and then that single lowsec becomes a bottleneck deathtrap that becomes absolutely bloodshoot impossible for the average player to go throughwould be great for the pirates for a month or two then players will pretty much stick to their own empires and the pirates will be back whining about no targets in low secwhat could also happen is all of the players settle up near jita and the other 3 empire population dries up significantlyso you end up with empire4welcome to caldari online
flying a freighter around is already the most boring thing possible adding more risk to flying a defenseless ship around empire is not an improvement
i would like to see commerce protection for people moving things through dangerous zones as wellyour opposition to this proposal is very nearly mirrored by others in disagreement to it im a contrarian so the things you all see as negatives i see as positiveswhen i made the proposal i expected opposition especially in the form of i think its too risk free to move freighters around empire as it is i would like it to be harder and more dangerous freighters should never be able to move between borders without an accompanying escort of mixed ewar and bb assets id like the game to be more challenging not less it may be that there is an ingame solution to this already and i think i know what it isthank you all for your comments while you have disagreed with me you have brought illumination to what was for me a dark place
not supported want to stop drones from killing you set yours to kill them or web and shoot if you cant do that then i suggest you get a better ship or switch to a ship with drones
no support as it is though there are some funny and viable ideassome ew that reduces bandwidth could be really cool but only in the case you can counter it so also a bandwidth bonus mod should also be introduced but it would really touch the nowadays balance of shipsso there are fine and funny raw ideas but they are far from being a proposal
id say no battleship classes are supposed to be superior on a one to one basis in direct combat thats why theyre useful despite their large cost and slowness the slowness is a big one since bses cannot escape anything ever whereas frigates can pick their fights
i cant speak for minmatar stations as i stay out of those regions however caldari and to some extent amarr stations need their docking radii looked atas i type this i have a ship in amarr at the caldari p8m4 station a ship is right on the undock 37km away from me and yet i am only 5km away from the stations docking radiusthe amarr stations are almost as badnow look at the gallente stations as an example my alt is at p9m20 station in dodixie the moment he undocks he starts leaving the docking radius of the station i undock and stop ship there is a rifter on the undock 9km from me the station reads 6km from mewhy the discrepancy can this be addressed to even out the stations to help somewhat in everyones favourite game of dockundockim not asking for priority attention btw just something to get to eventually after you fix scan probes
a discussion regarding dual monitor support has been going on for some time in this threadhas any member of the csm raised this issue with ccp yet its hard to overstate just how much dual monitor support could improve the game imagine having one monitor for your primary view and all the information windows and chat on the second monitor it would offer players and fcs a whole new way to enjoy evewould anyone else like to see the csm push this issue
this has been requested over 9000 times already
csm minutes 0101080035 multiple monitorthis is possible in the graphics engine but is not supported in the ui code and would require a significant rewrite also we wouldnt be able to do this with the map because of the seamless zoom unless we completely rewrite the map it should be possible to only render in part of the frame but things like the ship hud messages aligned to the centre of the screen and the overview etc would need to be fixed all of it is possible but a lot of work would be needed
they seems to be working on iton the last fanfest they showcased it already
this would make fleet battles a lot more fun imo
bump
how do you propose that they disable the feature say a player lives in the us is in the uk on business goes to log in gets locked out so what they just check the account page to disable it oh wait if you have it happen that way then all the hack attempts will just be against the account page youd have to have them disable the feature preemptively which is great until someone forgets or doesnt know that this feature exists and then they find that they cant play the game its simply not practical
1 people might not always be in their country no2 yes
the system to enabledisableconfigure it should be handled by sending them emails and having them confirm their actions that way so as long as they could access their mail theyd be able to login
less bad but i still foresee major problems i could only conceivably support this if it defaulted to being off and even then im sketchy on it
1 i agree with2 from seeing a corpmates experience if you suspect your account was broken into and you want to know the history of your accounts login information the gm will disclose that information to you in the case of my corpmate there was a virus on his computer and the attacker was remotely controlling it so the gm told him that it was his own ip address that was logging into the accountalso currently if you didnt know any ip address that accesses your api information is available to you if you check it before the log entry is a week old this is actually a nice way to harvest ips if you leak your api to an enemyedit beaten on the api thing
this is what a truly well thought out and balanced idea will get you majority of praise and approval out of those that respondat least this is mostly true in evesupported
yes please fix the loginout thing it would also be nice to have a global logout button in case you need to switch accounts
i saw a post a year ago suggesting homeworld style navigation where you first set your coordinates in the plane and then your coordinate perpendicular to that plane that plus a waypoint cue would certainly make the navigation micromanagement a little less painful
i think theyve added quite a bunch of pve content during last yeartech 3 wormholes industrial capitals orcas low sec rats and some missions got a bit oomph tooim not saying theres not much to be done but yeah pve has got enough attention compared to other thingsi think wormholes are badly documented mechanics though even though there seems to be clear difficulty levels etc its hard to say what is what  also i think difficulty gap between normal pve sites and wormholes is too big there should be a bit more easier wormholes too with less profit of course

wow accidentally hit enter to move down to body but forgot it posted and my jackass friend made this alt on my account and made it default so ignore this char namebut anyway is csm pushing for any balance some stuff id like to see ismore falloff for acsrolling split weapon bonuses into one bonuse ie typhoon would have one skill bonus of 5 rof bonus to large projectiles and cruisestorpsmore damage for artillery or hell maybe they need a whole reworking right now theyre abysmalnerf tachyon just a bit ludicrously higher damage and tracking compared to 1400s and 425s
years ago when my eyesight was still flawless i got majorly hooked on eve that lasted for a year or two and ended with me having gone through two sets of glasses im up to three now p dont get me wrong  i only blame myself for that not taking enough breaks and so on  but i do wonder sometimes if it wouldve helped if eve had some sane fontsanyway i just reactivated my account again and am somewhat shocked or rather annoyed to find its still not possible to get a decent ui font it was so bad on my 1920x1080 22 screen that i just swapped it with my old 1680x1050 22 one i should say its not just the text size which it seems you can now at least modify to some extent by making it less condensed the shapes seem horrible too i can up the chat window font size 2 or 3 notches and i still cant read it comfortablyso theres my vote please consider making this possible
there is a system in delve that i have no idea what it is actually named because of this it could be 0i0ai or o1oa1 or 01oai or 0i0a1 or o101a or 0ioa1 or
yes please even improved kerning and tracking of the current font would help a little with attention payed to those characters mentioned in original post

yes
except that you cant search within them via the assets menu or search function making remote stuff management painful and you need to reopen all of them manually every time you redock and remerge the windows if theyve playfully decided to seperate themselvessupporting thisthough id settle for assets working on stuff inside containers

rofl though i say any drone lovin is good lovin so supported
you should need a freighter class ship to move assembled bs just like you need a freighter class ship to move them packaged it should be harder to move a rigged ship then it is to move a repackaged one
itd be best like a freighterno fittings no cargohold no jetcans just shipsso they have zero tank completely vulnerable not for solo ship movingbut can carry as many or more ships then a mothership and go into empireforget the t2 orca this has nothing to do with mining as far as using it to transport ships for sale in empire think the ship would have too much tank if its designed to make a suicide gank anything but a sure thing when you consider the value of a shipment of bcs the suicide gank should almost always be much more attractive then most freighter loadsthe tugboat idea is cool think thats generally what were talking about a ship made outta scaffolding rather then a hardened ship bay
0 tank i was thinking of something with similar stats to a freighter  but with a ship bay instead of a cargohold
or we could just get a new kind of freigther containers that are bigger and can contain rigged ships it should be pretty easy to code it so they have the same restrictions as a carrier corp hangar regarding goods within ships
im all for this but not a t2 orcathe freighter  transport skill at level 4 must be a requirementand the new skill to fly the ship must be a rank 14 skill and cost at least 300m
yes please
ok the mid warp thing is an issue but as for the rest flying into a concord sov system with a low sec is like walking into a police station while you have an active warrant out for you of course theyre going to react
get rid of concord systems and fix gcc
only a pirateganker would want concords systems eliminated fix the bugs but keep concords systems intact pirates will be less apt like in the real world to bum rush any tom  andeve wondering into pirates attack zonestwo days ago i watched as a pirate or other with a bad sec status got blown to bits by a concord vessel it was the funniest most immersive thing i had seen at a gate thusfar guarenteed to disuade any other criminal from rolling up on the po po units at customs for ex thinking they are gonna run thingsdont throw the babyoutwiththebathwater
i agree with this proposal
its certainly broken
sure
and i would like a free   but i aint getting one should i complain because noone wants to give me oneseriously suicide gankers are giving miners a good reason not to mine and then they just mission and hey we all know missions are broken because they give just as much minerals as mining its a big wtf from mespread the love a little isk to missions isk to suicide gankers isk to miners and industrialists then maybe we are getting close to how it should be
since when did concord have jurisdiction in losec
when sitting cloaked for hours u can still zoom in and look at the outline of the pretty little antenna tho dit was a damn cool ship probably the best looking in the gamei too havent flown it since think i trashed the one i had been flying
agreed
typical achura response damn ugliesold helios model was nothing short of sexy  now i cant even bear to look at the thing fortunately the number of people flying the things has plummeted since the change so i dont see them often but would be nice if they didnt look like space poo
if this proposed change went though and chribba was also allowed to bring his veldtitan into highsec i believe that eve would be the perfect gamealso boost the hyperion and fix logoffski mechanics
i will admit i choose to train certain ships because of their look i thought i had a nice looking symmetrical ship then they changed it please return the original
in my opinion the helios is one of the ugliest ships in the game but beauty has always been a matter of opinionbeauty is in the eye of the beholder ccp switched the models of the cheetah too which in my opinion was a mistake cos the probe hull is ugly for my fellow sufferes secondedbut ccp wont change it theyve turned down far more useful changes no offense lax
you could outsource some work to ea and have them make a sims 3 expansion solely for eve based on sim city 2000 and please keep the cheats the same
or better yet they all shoot at it once and then go shoot whatever they wantthen theres mining drones tell them to return to bay and if they finish their cycle before they get back or out of range of their target they unload and sit there instead of docking again with mining drones since container and drone return range was changed to 2500 m they shouldnt need to come all the way back to 500m or less they drop off their ore at 2500m but continue towards your ship till they hit about 500m then go back to mining minor issue but annoying when youre trying to get what you need for a project asap
judging by the rest of the issues that dont get fixed or take ages to fix id say the latter supported however
as much as i like shooting newer players and having their drones aggress me on the undock this is ridiculousim also tired of half my drones deciding to change targets for absolutely no reason im scared one day theyll go off and get me concorded 
supported the current drone ui and stances are painful at bestvic

hahahaha nottits bad enough when carebears want high sec extended but for people to ask for the opposite should know betterand its not risk free theres this thing called suicide ganking
theres nothing boring about the current structure of interstellar commerce i was attacked by two real nonrat pirates during my second on my 6th now day of traininggamingyour suggestion though interesting would spoil the fun for those of us less inclined to combative engagements you could always attack a commercial convoy and take your chances thru engagements with that corps military escort or with concord if thats not enough military excitement then i dont know what isi love combat and can find more than my desired share of it as is following your request the very nature of the game will change to a less individually adjusted ability for crafting an individual destiny and more of a combat shooter thats what low sec space pirating mercenary exportition escortvip protection and faction battles to say nothing of the myriad forms of economic warfare are forif that cant get ones blood boiling then perhaps nothing will
often you will hear people come onto various forums asking for a t2 bs more geared toward traditional slug fest pvp the issue is that if u just make a bigger better bs with a lower cost so that its not entirely pvp prohibitive then it becomes the standard and likely becomes a solo pwn mobilean idea occured to me that could perhaps satisfy those who seek after the bigger badder bs and still encourage a balanced count on your friends situationmostly ill leave specifics for later but basically the idea would be a heavier more dense ship so that its size stays approximatly the same they would take the tier 3 bs add 2 more bonus to it significantly more buffer not significantly more resistance spider tanking can be bad enough as it is and generally boost its combat effectivnessthe balance would be that these ships will be too heavy to use jump gates and will not possess a jump drive of their own the only way to transport these ships would be via carrier or mothership or freighter if unassembled they could dock or sit at pos be fit and rigged then jumped to the battlefield pilots would then dock up into their ships from the pods they bring into system or jump clone in and pew pew until they die or win at which point they must dock up their ship for it to be jumped outdiscuss as the idea isnt fully complete yet p
pvp t2 bs marauders seems to do a nice job check the videos from darknesss

tech 3 industrial capitals orcas new ships is not pve contents wormholes ok low sec rats tweaked a bit not added if you feel that is extra content every time a ship is tweaked it is extra pvp content and some missions got a bit oomph too please dont speak of what you dont know there was 1 epic story ark for new players some new level 13 mission and a pair of storylines it those arent fw stroylines simply added to the general pool no oomph at all in any of those even if some have nice stories
the people who voted for this idea better explain why they voted for this issueoz pointed out it was already refused by ccp why was this raised again
because some players mothers told them that they are unique snowflakes
i do lvl 4 my missions in caldari space most of them are against guristas and include multiple battleships the salvage is rediculous even from the battleships i use t2 salvagers and 3 salvage rigs and im not talking about smaller shipsi think that salvage dropped by the guristas need to be improved

you do realize this will continue the killing of smallgang warfare no pvp shouldnt always be about who has the bigger blob and hit and run tactics should be encouraged pitboss and supporters if you want remote reppers to have no escape then why not fight in a belt oh yeah because then you cant deaggro and dock up if things get nasty personally i actually enjoy it when people use rr neutral or not against me reason being 90 of the time they end up doing something stupid they aggress in something i can kill even with rr they leave themselves open to ewar or my personal favorite they leave their rep alts in harms way this thread was started by the pitboss executor of empires premier griefing alliance privateer alliance privateers are good at one thing griefing im sorry pit you talk a lot about neutral remote rep abuse but when was the last time you fought outnumbered including all participating ships rr or otherwise against someone who actually had a fathom of experience in pvp im sorry if you missed out on a couple mining barge kills because their buddies were generous enough to help them get out of jita and im sorry if youve lost a few ships to wildly inappropriate because your pvp alliance is too disorganized and divided to learn to work as a team the current game mechanic supports teamwork between corp mates alliance mates and just friends you meet in the game guerrilla warfare you can hit and run when heavily outnumbered and force your opponent to adopt a different pvp strategy than just the bigger blob wins and the element of surprise and danger that eve is known for pit why not just bring antirr support it aint that hard lets consider the circumstances that recently took place privs decced wi about 5 members of wi were interested in fighting and between us we had maybe 5 more friendsalts whod help out as needed thats 10 total versus an alliance of 200 and you were still unwilling to fight because you couldnt work together to come up with an adequate counter to our strategies would it make a difference if all 10 of us were in alliance why dont you just bring 10 dps ships and 190 remote rep ships find your own counters to remote rep we have tldr quit whining and find counters to it there are plenty
i was waiting for one of the kings of rring for cheap kills to open his yap  no offense but you said it yourselfthis is the exact reason why i brought up this issue stop hiding behind the facade that its going to kill small gangs  if you the had skills you wouldnt need to rely on 5 alt accounts
as usual taken out of context and still not particularly relevant what exactly is wrong with me helping out friends who are getting station camped by a priv blob if you guys cant deal with some rr find someone else to campedit not to mention how the hell does bringing rr to make a 2 on 20 a 5 on 20 classify as cheap id say picking on carebears who dont know jack about pvp is a bit more cheap than surprising griefers by winning a fight in which even with remote rep we are heavily outnumbered
i support this fully missles in general need a boost but none moreso than rockets
fix the darn rockets
an alternative solution is to make station containers transparent to the assets window
yes and the sound system these days is rather boring i want to hear more
i digged up the only to my knowledge dev posts about the sound issuesboth posted inthe sound problems are due some attentionin the general discussion forum it would be nice to continue discussion bumping there so the issue could get more attention from players
i had my say in gd and there at that time i thought ccp had fixed it until today i went mining in a frigate and had that awful bread crunch sound going on all the timewhat ever it is ccp is clearly not in control of their brand new sound engine bring back the old i say this one doesnt sound like it was worth its money or at least bring in some engineer who knows what he she is doinganyway ccp can rabble on as much as they want claiming they fixed it or worse works as intended ghaaa the actual sound coming from the game just simply tells a complete and totally different storysupported time to fix this ccp
agreed it seems unfortunate that some of the threads are already locked when the concerns expressed within them are still valid and not resolved posting in the existing threads should keep them alivethe purpose of this thread is simply to have the csm find out from ccp what is going on and to get back to us so if you wish for the csm to bring the issue to the attention of ccp please tick the boxsupport this topic   check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going onrelated post apocrypha 15 threadssoundagainaudio in map browser still badissue sound hasnt been fixed since the apocrypha xpack

in a nutshell ships will be able to equip a new kind of boost ship crewmen can specialize in certain areas of ship operation giving you bonus to these areas in npc academies you can have your crew trained to higher grades which improves the bonus but it requires you to provide the required curriculums to the academy for training you crew and for commanding them later the necessary leadership skill to take crew on board you need to invest into a special rig care for your crew means you might want to eject early from your ship prior to destruction thus ejecting your crew with you or you will lose the training invested into themthe basic thoughts behind crewseveonline is a space simulation simulations always try to build a bridge between gamplay and reality it has been established through 
abilities dependencies and requirementsintroyou acquire freshmen from the academy a new station service equip your ship with the rig for one or more human teams the crew rigs come in different sizes as rigs will do in future and off you go through their crew the crew rigs have similar benefits and backdraws like regular rigs with the added benefit that you may choose which specialized team to put into them while you cannot exchange rigs you can exchange the crew in a crew rig to modify your bonuscrew can be trained in a variety of specializations depending on the specialization and the grade of training the crewmen will boost respective systems of your ship giving you the extra power in a fightimprove your crew by sending them to the academy the academy will ask for curriculums in order to teach your crewmen to the higher level you also need the appropriate skill yourself in order to start a course and in order to lead crewmen of a certain grade you will need the sufficient leadership skillwhen taking damage into hull your crew will suffer leading to random casualties until all die when your ship is completely destroyed and only you automatically eject as the hull begins to desintegrate completely save yourself and your crew by ejecting early enoughthis all comes as a whole new business area too personnel the training of it and the trade of experienced ship crew between pilotsto start with crewsyou need to acquire and rig your ship with a crew rig the rigs come in different sizes and allow for one or more up to three maybe teams of any specialization to be assigned to their slotsget crewmen from the academy they will be untrained or acquire experienced crew from the contract market or from corp mates who are able to train them assign the crew to the slots and you are ready to go when you want to put crew of a certain grade see training below onto your ship you also need the required leadership skillimplementation in the ships ui 2 optionscrewmen either come as individuals or in teams the authors do not have a clear preference and would like ccp to decide according to implementation constraints effort marketability and balancing aspectssimilar to both options is the fact that crew takes damage upon the ship taking hull damage either they die one by one option 1 leading to an irrevoquable loss of the crewmans ability who may be replaced by backup from cargo or they are injured opiton 2 allowing healing them with the proper equipmentovercharging might apply just like for other slots  with increased casualties due to human errors in operating dangerous equipmentwhen you lose your ship you will lose your crew unless you eject early before complete destruction which will eject your crew with you their escape pods will be attached to your capsule either visualized or not the basic concept is that they flee with you if you succeed and you can save them from destruction and losing all the bonus you trained them forcrewmen as chargea rig provides one or more slots for crewmen any slot can take a limited maybe 5 crewmen of any specialization but it must be the same for any given slot the total bonus is calculated from the average grade of the assigned crewmen taking empty positions into accountcomparable existing logic like the name suggests the ammunition charge is similar to this crewmen appear as count in the slot as crewmen die the count decreases and vacant posts can be remanned from cargo
crewmen as team modulea rig provides one or more slots for crew teams of any specialization the bonus applied to the ship corresponds to the grade of the team when you get into hull damage your crew is injured decreasing the bonus you may improve the health using medical equipment like nanite for broken modulescomparable existing logic crew teams are like modules which you fit into the slots provided by the rig they take damage like modules do and can be repaired using the right equipmenttrainingin order to improve your crew you need to send it back to the academy academies are a new station service where you can also get untrained crew if you do not want or cannot afford to buy them off the market you need the according training skill to do so appropriate to the specialization of the crew to be trained crews have a fixed specialization which cannot be changed by training in addition some curriculum are requested by the academy to start the coursewhen you want to put crew of a certain skill onto your ship you also need the required leadership skill such skills can even be split up by specialization so that for helmsmen of grade engineer you need a helmsmen leadership skill on level 2depending on whether ship crews are handled as teams or individual crewmen can be applied to this aspect accordinglycomparable existing logic training works like the blueprints me and pe can be improved with researchsummarysummary of the penalties crewmen cost money  dayly weekly or monthly salary to be decided by ccp crewmen can die during fights crew rigs have downsides like regular rigs
grades and specializationsteams can differ in their grade level 1 technicians level 2 engineers level 3 specialists level 5 elite level 4 veteranwording can be changed of course but the basic idea is that you may invest into your crew for better bonusspecializations are thinkable in any number of facets  helmsmen offensive weapons shield technicians shield propulsion engineers speed scan analysts exploration drone operators mining laser calibrators and much much moreone slot can only accomodate one specialization at any time but the crew may be changed when dockedskills involvedfor exampleleadership crew team management required leadership iiienabling l1 1xteam l3 2xteams l5 3xteams crew leadership required leadership ii and social iiienabling l1 technicians l3 engineers l5 specialists advanced crew leadership required leadership iv and negotiation iv enabling l2 elite l5 veteranfor the different specializations propulsion engineers skill required navigation iv perhaps some more depending on the level the crew wanted to use hastechnicians engineers helmsmen required kills from gunnery skill tree and so onto start training of the different levels and types you need a special skills from the science sector
i like it it is a highly complex boost  instead of tweaking with existing weapons and modules and it caters for mission runners as well as pvp

ye be a great add on to a o0 or wh mining ops
with some tweaking i think this would be a very good idea
sounds quite reasonable  i would like to hear what the csm assembly says to that next sunday imho this could really improve mining in lowseci would like to point the interested reader to a post on featuresideas called deployables and corporate specialisation which could be capitalized together with this posting just a thought
um i thought this feature was called corporation andor alliance membersi agree it is stupidly easy to break up mining ops and have a gank if you can find such an operation in 00 which does not have advance warning through scouts still this is kind of a multiplayer game right
aye i think this is a very good idea as cons specifies in his orginal post no pvp pilots wanna be sitting around for hours on end protecting hulks etc so it does leave them wide open for attack at the moment for miners its either stay in high sec or go to 00 for the rarer minerals where a bigger alliance can give system protectionthe mmg sounds like a great idea id say maybe limit the amount of guns you can have in a belt sorry typing and dunno if cons mentioned this but if u get each person flying haulers mining ships to drop a mmg it will be to powerful having say 20 of these guns in 1 belt wud be slaughterbut apart from that i think its a really good idea cause at the moment for miners low sec is a nononot that im a miner myself i just think low sec is to overpowered on the pirates side  miners deserve some defence plus it makes it more fun for the piratespark
sounds like a bad idea to me thats what sentry drones are it would make low sec and null sec mining too easy pvp is an integrel part of the game and pvp vs low sec miners keeps the market stable by keeping people that dont want to get shot in high sec a security force isnt hard to get in a corp and if its that much of a problem hire some mercs for an hour or just mine smarter
if you dont want to be shot then dont go into low sec whats to stop pvpers from setting these up to keep miners away what stops me from defending a pos with these why not just fly a ship with warp core stabs when mining wouldnt this cause more deaths of low sec miners that feel safe with these guns up how many can you put out at once what would stop people from gate camping with them just a few questionscomments i have about these guns for carebears
whats to stop them well first theres a fuel cost second there is no miners alreadylastly what miners are being kept awaythe real change is 00 i could set them up then ratting would be way safer at the same time the boring 2nd accounts can be miningthen it comes back to uberblob time ewwwwwwww
the proposed fuel costs are low you never said a dmg mod for the guns or a range mod your also puting dreadnought size guns on an auto turret how does that protect agains a crusier that ruins ur ops since it wont be able to track i mean that was ur big example of why its needed right what ever happened to this being a mulitplayer game play with some security members and get them into ur corp if you want to be safe stay in high sec or get some security if you dont want to be bothered by pvpers your playing the wrong game as for 00 your alliance isnt doing its job if u have roaming bands of pirates taking down ur mining ops in ur sovergn space if you dont own the space its your fault ur getting owned in it join an alliance that controls the space already basicaly this seems to me like you trying to thake the multiplayer out of the mmo rpg
i cant wait for this to be implemented

its not just him i gather albeit his choice of words is  not exactly awesomesauceim still having trouble seeing the problem here im afraid gcc under concord sovereignty makes sense it is concord sovereignty unlike other systems where concord has to operate under a shared charter or together with faction elements these systems are the domain of concord it does suck to go in there with negative sec status and pretty much find that concord is letting you trip over something so that the cops can get you but at the same time it makes sense plus it is a random occurance it is not like this is an iron cast guarantee that if you have negative sec status and if you go through concord sovereign space they will let you stumble over something so the cops will get youits an odd chance event bear in mind that to concord anyone which has negative sec status is not a well behaving citizen but someone who is either borderline or already a criminal concord does not have to take into account the realities of life in space they have their bureaucracy to maintain after alllike i said the random chance of incurring a gcc as someone with a negative sec status under concords sovereignty does not strike me as bad or brokenit strikes me more as an officer standing outside his headquarters and sticking out his foot when he sees john doe average policeman spot or run after someone with a criminal sheet running across the pavement
this is all true however the gcc mechanic and concord response is there to punish players immeadiately for hostile actions in high security space its a rubbish mechanic that trips up even players who are not outlaw as such
the mechanism is not rubbish its a random event which makes sense if it happens it sucks but that does come with negative sec statuskeep in mind that we are talking about concord here not the empire factions police concord is the supreme watchdog negative sec status means outlaw regardless of how big the negative sec status on their turf they are likely to let someone who is not a fully fledged good citizen stumble so the regular cop can get himthe gcc mechanic exists to punish players for criminal actions and not staying on the right side of the law for which the only means concord has is the mechanism of sec status if positive all is well if negative they at minimum give you the look next step being they let you tripconcord like every bureaucracy will not build up a complete file on everyone and all actions across all time they use a simple response  action mechanism based on criminal actions and security status
everytime my ship reaches an object im approaching it will bounce around i think navigation computer should calculate distance and speed properly so this doesnt happen
a need for dynamic missionseve online unfortunately features rather weak pve with a finite amount of repetetive missions mission running apepars to be the core gameplay activity for many pilots and is the main income source of many despite adding more missions over the years the weak spot of missioning is their predictibility sites such as eve survival and the cosmos database feature complete walkthroughs for all missions the challenge level is not too low due to the encounters being too easy it is low due to the static and predictable nature of the missions themselves missions require no creative thinking and problem solving from the pilots they have deteriorated into a read guide press buttons in correct order get your moneyseveral games feature parametrically generated environments and encounters which improves replayability dramatically instead of focussing on adding more of the same ccp might wish to explore the avenue of dynamic content to dramatically improve replayabilitysome examples of dynamic content in gamesdiablo and several roguelikesfamous feature of diablo and roguelike games is the random generation of dungeons for almost infinite replayability certain questrelated elements in the dungeons are premade but used as random encountersdwarf fortressthe whole world history pantheon quests npcs and story is parametrically generated creatures have a basic template which is then expanded on with history and stats a mustplay for any game designer or developer well a mustplay for anyone with a few spare braincells been playing it for several years now and im still not tired of it watch the video under the whole world link so you dont have to spend a whole weekend to learn the basicsjumpgate evolutionfrom website jumpgate evolution offers limitless game play and content with a unique mission generator capable of generating thousands of fresh and immersive missions for players to embark onplayers are given ultimate power as jumpgate offers a fully immersive player driven economy protect a merchant vessel on its trade route by intercepting enemy players or answer a battle stations call for help by delivering them much needed supplies  seems like player action affect the npc economy as wellblack prophecydespite having a fixed storyline to some degree bp will randomly generate encounters and whole sectorsproblem summaryas we can see eves competitors havent been sitting still and two competing space mmos will be released soontm with both of them featuring random mission generators meanwhile ccp is hiring more mission writer jockeys it must also be noted that the missions added in empyrean age are mostly frustrating missions that are rejected by pilots for various reasons kills empire standings impossible gate restrictions annoying enemies like buzz kill which only made mission running more of a pain instead of providing muchneeded variationlets have some discussion now while i go write up some solutions in the next post

at the risk of coming across as an ass there is enough pve content in eve this is after all a pvp game i will agree that the pve side of things is of interest to marketing since eve in its continued growth does and will continue to appeal to a variety of existing and future niche markets comprised of player mentalities and behaviourstill ultimately we have to keep in mind that in eve the pve side of things exists in support of the pvp this is not hello kitty online as some would sayyour references to third party games are nice but rather without direct use without first mapping out which potential player mindsets and thus niche markets would even be exposed to competition between eve and those games this while obviously keeping it within the broad general framework and goals of eves mechanicseves marketing is primarily focused on distribution the subscriber growth opportunities through market channels that is not the same as marketing through game design dear now all that being said i think you and many with you including some people at ccp may be forgetting the biggest and strongest attribute of eve  players drive eve we get the pixels from ccp we then run off and go crazy the biggest growthspurts of eve have come from player driven events and trends including scandalsso instead of priming pve against pvp i would much prefer to incorporate both these things and that biggest attribute result being a framework perhaps under the cosmos paradigm there is room for this to enable players to create their own missions challenges and jobs regardless of whether pve or pvpnow i realise that is easier said then done but a lot of the tools are  on a basic level  already available the biggest challenges would be to enable the utmost of flexibility without opening up to exploitation this obviously being the most tricky part because of the schizofrenic nature of eve but hey lets be honest when you look at the upcoming fw boost we already see people working out means to make the most out of the new reward mechanisms by pairing accounts in support or even against each other these are things ccp do take into accounton both a design and marketing level the challenge is somewhat different it pretty much comes down to the choice between the eternal race to add in new content complete with balances in an ever complexer race of complexity law of diminishing returns pretty much in the long run or switching to a framework where players are provided with further tools to do what they are best in going crazy with pixels and driving the game and its exposure ever furtheras a sidenoteit is probably best not to including jumpgate evolution in comparisons with eve you have to remember that the core developers ran away with their tails between their legs from eve after getting griefed as a result their game design became so screwed up they recently had to suck it up and go back to the table as their post trauma views on market and death concepts were so laughable that even in the family  friends debunking rounds the game pretty much died an agonising death
just varying the hostile npcs that spawn in a given mission would go a long way towards making missioning more unpredictable rather than having a mission where 2 battleships 5 cruisers 3 sentrys and 10 frigates spawn every time assign every shiptype a points value and have randomly generated spawns of a set point level for that mission heck use the points system from the alliance tournament if you likeit would be pretty cool to warp into a mission not knowing if you were going to get 3 battleships or 20 frigates
you certainly seem to have many of us figured out alreadyan advantage of having predictable missions is that it allows players to work around real life schedulesa compromise might be to add a surprise me button to the agent conversation window which would then result in the agent providing a semirandom mission within the abilities of the player such a button might only be pressed on weekends edit the existing request mission button could be changed to bore me also will the new random missions have sound
while ankhes approach of comparing eve with other games impossible i know might not be appealing to all why explain twice what others have done already  at least you seem to know what shes talking about  now take the good from all others and make it even betterwe cannot neglect the fact that missioning is still a highly used income generator  and it is highly boring as it is also ccp is putting energy into creating more missions which are just more of the same as ankhe said this is all notwithstanding efforts to get the epic arcs going which also allow decisions they are in the same way improving the fun factor in missions as this proposal is doingone note to playgenerated content  i have been discussing that up and down with a number of pilots with very different background besides the real tricky challenge of providing a toolset of success factors that are smart you need to avoid free text which would else open the door to abusive language but on top the exploitability is huge as soon as you allow spawns to appear upon player mission setup to get around it i am discussing mercenary contracts to start with where the money solely comes from the issuers pocketback to this subject  procedural content is discussed up and down the industry eve should not lack cause soloing does get pilots started they will sooner or later get hooked up on the eve feeling anyway and move into the sandbox to play with the rest of us
i support the introduction of dynamic missionsfurther i would like to see all current missions aside from storyline arcs and epic mission arcs folded into this systemthe fact that highsec farmers know exactly what ships are in a mission when they spawn and what the triggers are is a problem that needs to be rectifiedand dynamic missions will make the pve grind actually enjoyable for a huge swathe of people enjoyable missionrunning in and of itself mad i knowedit the devs should be forced to play dungeon crawl stone soup to teach them how random generation can be succesfull
heh comparing eve to other games is known to get you shot on sight in quite a few places in eve you have to keep in mind that missions as well as other pve really was just conceived as a means to an end it is only logical that the continuation of that train of thought leads to more of the same as the base concept is not subject to change however in the light of a growing subscriber base this is not necessarily wrong depending on the various niches among subscribers this may very well be the better approach given manhours and further commercial considerationsits a concept which would warrant an expansion on its own really and it would be perfectly paired with the early elements of cosmos which apparently will come to us in pieces  no pun intended as i mentioned earlier i do think that the biggest forte of eve is the ability players have to go crazy drive things forward providing a foundation for this only makes sense but this does mean quite a fundamental choice it cant be both approaches again considering manhours and commercial implications it will have to be eitheror and until or even if that choice is made we have to work with what we havebut yes it is a topic on its ownmy main concern is twofold aside of the abovementioned1 eve largely consists of a variety of types of subscribers of whom a substantial portion plays eve for the pve side due to real life circumstances and most notably playtime restrictions dynamic mechanisms can easily upset that niche so to speak there will always be a need for knowing what comes as it lets people allocate time in advance2 a quite possibly equally large portion of subscribers uses missions as a simple means for isk for them missions are a means to an end they have little interest in spicing things up as making isk suddenly becomes flexible as some would say unpredictableas such the somewhat simple approach of make it dynamic could easily upset this niche again leading back to the closing part of item 1

prophecy is a tier 1 battlecruiserharbinger is a tier 2 battlecruiserergo the harbinger is supposed to out perform the prophecythe prophecy is still the better option for upcoming missionersnot every ship has to have a pvp usage
youre right bc teirs only matter for baseline comparisons of quality lets avoid looking at the distingusing characteristics of other ships like he caracal vs the moa the thorax vs the vexor the domi vs the mega the apoc vs the geddon the raven vs the scorpion the typhoon vs the tempest the drake vs the ferox the rupture vs the scythe the omen vs the maller and whatever else it out thereusing the tier argument is the dumbest thing ever when even the devs have said that tier does not dictate rolefunction think before you argue about the 2 hours of difference you just put up between a newer player flying one ship or the otherim glad that idiotic arguement got addressed at the beginningwhats even more amazing is that you dont realize that at lower levels of bc the glaring hole that is the prophecy becomes even more pronounced because it does have less fittings less turrets less drones less structure less armor less shields and fewer slots so its one useful feature its resistance bonus or lack there of at lower levels becomes even more of a problem which means that a newer player would be even better served using the harbinger over the prophecyi no way does my argument only apply to pvp the problems with the prophecy are universal it cant perform well in pvp or pve or any situation between the two
a ship with resistance bonus always gives nice baits
i think the prophecy is not underpowered when compared to its counterparts i just think it lacks a real role gallente have the drone  blaster mix caldari have the gun  missile mix and mini have the missilegun  gunship mixall amarr have is great laserboat or less great laserboat that said the prophecy is still a decent ship and certainly performs better than the ferox or cycloneif anything i think the harbinger is a little overpowered as it far outstrips the brutix as a gank machine and has fantastic tracking and range as wellas someone who extensively flys the harbinger i wouldnt like to see it nerfed to much perhaps give the proph a 50m3 drone bay and the harby a 25m3
that would be a good change maybe give the prophecy a damage instead of a cap use bonus so it is like a miniabaddon too
or give it some medium projectile bonus p scnr

part 2 of the boosting terrible bc series takes a look at the cyclone and trying to figure this pos outcyclone gets 2 bonusesrofactive shield boostingon the topic of rofcyclone gets 5 turret mounts its counterpart the hurricane gets 6 and a double damage bonus the cyclone is also almost strictly limited to a range platform because of its delegation of mids to tank and limited low slots for any sort of speed  damage since its also an active tanker it cannot rely on both a burst tank and a mwd because it would require cap injection which also uses a mid leaving 2 slots for either hardeners or a boost amp this also means it has no form of tackle or webbing while at close range thus the long range delegationbecause it gets a rof bonus its hurt further for its range duties because 1 range guns for minmatar rely on alpha and 2 the faster the guns shoot the more drawback there is to their very limited ammo clips for artyon the topic of active shield boosting bonusif a cyclone were to go a full out shield boosting midslot setup it either a has to give up 1 of its 5 precious mids to a cap injector to have any chance of keeping the boost up or b would be better served by extenders because they would offer more tank for a much more sustainable capacitor and would almost equal the boostable ehp of a capped out cyclone if it went the extender route it would automatically be served better in the situation that it were taking massive damage since it would not have to tick off seconds to regain shields it would also nullify one ship bonus which brings the question wtf do i have that for but again it runs into the problem of an immobile ship so it either has to sacrifice its tankability for maneverability which the hurricane does way more efficiently or it has to rely on a ranged platform to rely on a ranged platform is silly as it has no slots for sensor boosters tracking computers and limited low slots which it could dedicate to its split damage platformhurricane can both out damage and run a far more efficient tanking platform if it so chooses it can also mix both roles much easier and draw an even bigger gain in choosing to do both over the cyclone add to that its ability to out perform the cyclone at range because it gets the more valued damage bonus to increase its alpha as well as 1 extra turret which we all know is better than a non buffed launcher any day at range and you just cant find a reason to choose the cyclone for any rolepossible fixes to the cyclone1 let it mimic the typhoon by boosting its drone bay to 100m with 75 bandwith change its shield boosting bonus to a missile rof bonus and add 1 missile slotor2 add a turret change the shield boost bonus to a tracking bonus change the rof bonus to a damage bonusor3add a mid slot remove a high slot boost the drone bay by 10 or4add a mid remove a high add a turret or change the bonus to a missile rofany of these solutions would give this ship more purpose and utility it would no longer be outperformed at both close and long range by the hurricane or it would get an acceptable tank for its tradeoff of damage right now it just does not make sense to use this ship over its counterpart

double post
how about this5 add 2 turret slots and switch 5 rof bonus to 10 optimalthis would effectively mean 5 increase of turret dps 40 alpha it would become decent support platform for dispatching frigates at long range for people that cannot flyafford muninns and it would become true to its current descriptionedit additionally replacing shield boost bonus with tracking would support the new role more but every day is not a christmas besides that supported from yaays ideas i like 2 the most
i am not sure it is really all that bad with the cyclone recent videos of kil2 and someone else where i forgot the name show that the cyclone perfoms really well even when fighting multiple ships
all of the problems you describe fall into two catagoriesthe first is that ccp believe higher tier ships should be superior in everything thus the hurricane for some reason is superior to the cyclone in every way including shield hitpointthe second is that the shield booster bonus is inadequate its not enough to clearly show a cyclone out tanks a hurricane by a fair marginmy solution is far simpler than your redesignall active tanking bonus ships to have a clear role in pvp or pve should have their bonus increased from 75lvl to 10lvlthis suggestion is relivant to gallente and minmatar tanking bonuses ships and would rectify most of their problemsif you dont believe me try doing the math currently there is a clear incoming dps amount for active ships that after about a minute their tank becomes apriximately 2 better than a passive bonused resists tank the problem us the margin is far too small and the benefit is not great enoughwith the active bonus going from 375 at lvl5 to 50 at level lvl5 you will see a clear difference from a bonused active tanked ship vs a non bonused one in nearly all small to medium sized engagementsthen the cyclone will shine
the only problem with the cyclone is that nobody active shield tanks in pvp any more that and it requires twice the skill of the hurricane to be effective in if you fly it with skill its a great shipbottom line is this if you want 600 dps out of either ship your left with three slots for tanking the cyclone will outperform the caine with these slots
this is not true if you use the blue pill andor crystals
hrm so if you use an expensive implant set and some drugs it gets better well ofcourse it does but whats stopping the buffer tankers from using an implant set and drugs also mate its not a convincing argument against increasing active tanking bonuses to 10 per level
i think that a discussion with ccp would prove very productive as the csm may give ccp considerations they may not have thought about yetreading evemail out of game would be nice but i think a lot of people would love it to go a step further and be accessible through other mailclientssome questions for discussionto what extent can evemail be read outofgame as part of the current cosmos plansdoes this include support for alternate email clientscan a copy of evemail be forwarded to an external email address just like existing mailforwarding systemshow can players organize their evemail sent box inbox customization foldersthe csm should gather some information from their players and forward the conclusions to ccp
with the upcoming winter expansion it seems safe to say that the nda will really be put to the testthat aside i agree with lvv that it is simply up to ccp to choose whether to use the csm as a sort of think tank concept feedback obviously not mechanisms or not that being said given how the concept of csm is reaching a point where it is becoming a replacement and a more structured and efficient one to the features  ideas section it is never a bad idea to keep track of the place as a coherent subscriber feedback mechanisms independant of the functioning of the csm members themselves but im pretty sure ccp read the forums they rarely come out of the woodworks but they do hover over us question is whether or not it is within the rights  roles  etcetera of the csm to step up to ccp and ask for insight on such plans as cosmos maybe i do recall an interview with ccp recently where it came to the topic of the power of the concept and instrument of csm and the road of earning it so there really is the potential foundation for the op has csm reached a point where it can comfortably make such steps and be comfortably communicated with for such a purpose if yes cool if no well then maybe soon
adding to avallocs suggestion ui show info button with chat invite thread wiki i would like add to this the feature of allowing the pilot who is inviting to give a short message along with the invitationthe block level would then be threefold allow all convos show message first block all this message would give some better indication to the purpose of the invite and allow the invited pilot an informed decision whether or not to take the call much like a number of pilots have a note in their bio stating dont convo evemail rules this feature seems helpful to me for that purposethe hail messages would then appear as motd in the created chat channel handy cause it would be visible to those whom you invite to join the convo but they would also see the hail message according to their settings and it would also show as motd when settings lead to an immediate initiation of the chat

how do you see such a bribe being calculated  it cant be a simple one time fee approach corrupt officials get greedy for example itd have to be more complex then that and that means complicated id love to see more dynamic mechanisms for the game angle you are hinting at but it cant be a matter of black  white all in all this reminds me a bit of material for a mini expansion  codename yarr or something like that 
issue i would state as simply buffer tanking is unbalanced in relation to active tanking with the former being too effectivethis is largely due to the fact that hp increases for shield and armour are too great and the prevalence of readily available and easily fit resist modsthe former can be laid squarely at the feet of the ill advised hp buffi would like to see ccp attempt to revisit the balance between these two forms of tanking and ideally reduce the base hp gain of modules such as shield extenders and armour platesi do not believe buffing active tanking would achieve a desirable result ships in eve are far too survivable as current imoi beleive such changes would be beneficial to gameplay favouring small gang warfare and guerilla warfare as current expecting a smaller gang to achieve anything vs a larger one is unfair when buffer tanks come into the equation if they are in a time critical enviroment to give an example a 3 man gang locks down a drake or buffered geddon and has only a paltry timeframe to achieve anything before the blob arrives
imho the balance is okbuffer tanking especially armor just means grinding through the hitpointsactive tanking has the possibility to recover even from a few percent structure hitpointsnot supported
different ships have different advantages and in general you buffer tank for gangfleet pvp and active tank for solo there are plenty of viable active tanks however they should never be the endall of pvp not supported as the system is already balanced

what stuff are you talking about
its interesting sushistrip that what youre looking for is an option to pilot your ship rather than command it a friend of mine who used to play eve now plays star wars galaxies partly for what you are looking for and partly because of the depression brought about an incredible ship losswhat is also interesting is that the current eve sound system seems more conducive to the style of play which you seek rather than to the style of play eve seems built around

the exact reason helping a completely outnumbered fleet is cheap tort saying even if ccp decide its cheap that people will find a way around what does this have to do with anything since the mechanics stand how they are atm i wouldnt go betting ccp is on your side why dont you come up with some actual reasons against his argument if your alliance had any skills you wouldnt have to rely on a 110 battle
you flamers keep on missing the issue  does privateer gank and grief noobs and carebears they do is that ok  yes cause wardeccing in empire is a feature of the game having said that whether being a blob ganker is ok or not and where you wanna polish that ehonor plate and hang it over the fireplace is your issue and is not relevent to the issue at hand  namely remote repping having no real consequences at all imo if you jump into a fight you should be game mechanics wise equal to everyone else  and if people actively attackingactivating offensive mods on others are not allowed to dock up people activating rr on someone should be in the same situation its not about removing remote reppage or increasing the power of blob or whatever other spins you try in order to divert attention from the point  its about equal and fair battlefield game mechanics wise to everyone if the players choose to blob remote rep grief or whatever its up to them  and it is as intended in eve
i think the reason that so many people support this is because on the surface it seems like a totally reasonable argument sure everyone entering battle should be forced to commit right but people arent taking an indepth view on the situation why dont you people take a moment read the previous posts and actually provide reasons as to how the points brought up are invalid you guys just dont know how to pvp are just ed that you cant win outnumbered fights tbh 
being a lowsec pirate in a corp of about 10 active members max usually means im outnumbered either by other pvpers anti pies fw big alliances etc so i know how to fight outnumbered and i usually do so as for no not addressing the issues raised by other posts  its because no issues were raise saying omg we need remote reps to deal with blobsgriefers just shows how unimaginative and generally ty you are in the gamethe point raised in the op was that neutral alts that could be 4050k off on some stations are repping and then if engaged can dock up and the 15min timer and then do the same  again that rep even for 1020seconds might seem minor but it could sway a battle from losing to winning or getting away and im not ing about the hulk that got away due to remote reppege or the privateer blob that misses kills  im talking about pretty equal situations in which one party can gain a large benefit with very little to no risk even ing falcons are in more danger than remote rep alts eve is all about risk vs rewards  you can make more isk in 00 but its more dangerous well trade is most profitble but thats besides the point etc in this case there is a major reward in rr neuts and no tradeoff whatsoever  unless said neut is stupid or got bumped off stationgateas for dealing with wardecs in empire breaking the concept of the game is not a solution to it  try hiring merc paying the wardeccers leaving the corp or maybe just maybe  fight back mashpsputting a 3 line post that has no relevant info other than a flame and saying people dont look at things indepth is bad bad posting  if you wanna troll learn from the goons in caod first
i found it completely ironic that privateer alliance would be moaning about neutral remote reps when they are as guilty as their targets for this if not more sofour neutral remote reps in a fight today where they already outnumbered us and had the upper hand but the fear of losing a ship caused them to bring out the neutral reppers for the gank vs fightyou are a hypocrite pitboss and the rest of your alliance are as full of fail as the people you accusefix your own internal pvprs before you try and fix the rest of eve
amongst the marines militants janitors prisoners exotic dancers tourists and scientists hanging out in my hangar perhaps there are some worthy of being sent to the academy maybe the damsel will want to stick around the next time i rescue her from her favorite jetcan im not sure how enthusiastic the exotic dancers will be about going to academy and besides they might prove to be quite a distraction to the instructors
i like the idea in general perhaps the slots would actually be for specialized ship officers as opposed to crew in general as its my understanding that we already have crews on our ships they just dont do anything from a game mechanics perspective using the slots for officers would have the same effects you stated just the explanation would be changed a bit to reflect that you are adding officers to enhance your existing crewsperhaps we could also implement something like t2 pods that would allow us to have a better chance of saving experienced officers when the ship explodes as their escape pods would actually be compartments in the enhanced pods enhanced pods would have higher ehp but slightly slower align times and speed to reflect the need to protect the officers who dont have the same protection vs acceleration in the compartments as we do in the pod proper
it might be interesting but even in eve there are limits on how much complexity can be thrown at the player at once i think this change is entirely too likely to be on the wrong side of that line not supported even though i think id personally enjoy it a lot
i like this idea but it may be a strong interference with the gameplay at the moment i am very dependent on my corp mates or friends if i need a hauler or tackler i have to ask my corp mates for their support with this change i am playing alone in the future because there isnt any need for these kinds of relations
there are at least 1000 things in this game that could be improved or balanced before ccp should worry about little people inside ships
believe me as someone who has put up and taken down way more then his fair share of death stars i know the feeling back to page one with this one in hopes of something different
agreedthe fact that ewar is imbalanced is almost a direct result of the rsd nerf way back when and now more than ever the players are seeing and experiencing itrevisiting npcs is something ive been beating on for quite some time and its more than just the crap ewar issues its also security problems engaging when your timers are up due to federationnavy conflicts etc
supported
sounds like a good idea to meanother option would be to put webber batteries near to the timer so that a single ship cant speedtank the npcs whilst capturing the site
agreed i noticed this problem also and with ccp taking a look at fw soon this really needs changing
this isnt the only problem with the basic fw mechanics see also spawning system and system numbers but sorting the npcs would be a good start
i agree
i agree
agreed this should be reviewed
ok i agree that npcs should be reviewed but i think you are missing the point ie that the currently npcs dont need to be detroyed to capture the plex if the npcs had to be destroyed first then this would make solospeedtankplexing as opposed to speed tanking an irrelevant issueagreed the npcs ewar should be in line with pc ewar ie give caldari navy multispecs with eccm conteracting it however the amarrs neuting and tracking distruption and the gallente should have sensor disruption and warp disruption these would be more meaningful if you had to kill the npcs to capture the plexalso im amazed that the navies dont use ewar batteries at their bases
supported also what is up with lexe being on the censor list
yes
fw needs some love
i agree
agreed
agree  i like the idea that you should have to kill the npc that are defending the plex in order to capture  supported
npcs need to be destroyed for any capture this is bare minimum that is required to change thingsadd or remove something to discourage read make impossible the speed tanking with impunity the speed tanking was the reason mwds were disallowed from mission in times past if i recall this can be ai coding change to make them ignore what they havent hit after x number of volleys or something similar the ai is dumb enough to chase a target that is hundreds of km away leaving everyone else alone  this is part of the speed tanking fw plexes definition as far as i am concerned
with all the balancing going on around the universe certainly looking into this would be appropriateyou have shown with the sleepers that the ais can be improvedi also concur with veshtas suggestions
supported
this is the reason gallente pilots stopped plexing so soon into fw and it definitely needs to be looked at
agreed and how about plexes that feel more like a mission and less like a button with a couple rats hell even some useless decorations floating around is better than what we have now
agreed
supported 100the npc imbalanced has completely discouraged our corp from fighting in plexs period hope this gets reworked
minnie militia checking in o
i agree and i will be supporting this
i have to wonder though where would the pilots go when docked inside a carrier just looking at the map screen or something equally boringalthough i think this would be a sweet awesome way of showing off the practical applications of walking in stations just think instead of sitting at a crappy blank screen they could make the inside of a carriers stationlike environment that you can wait in it doesnt necessarily have to be as complicated as an actual station environment just something sweet to dolook at while youre being transported aroundthe general idea of actually being able to carry active pilots around space is sweet but it does need some fleshing out imosupported
i would think having the pilot who is docked share the same perspective as the carrier that is carrying it just zap his overview and grey out his modules maybe let him see the capacitorshieldarmorhull of the carrier carrying him so hes aware of the ship taking damage so he can execute an emergency launchthey act of docking with carriermothership could create a chat channel hosted by the carrying pilot where all the people piggybacking can communicate with ease were about to jump into action get ready or our jump to system xyz has been delayed 15 minutes
supporting this carriers actually being able to carry ships in a useful manner hell yes would lead to some interesting uses of carriers and some awesome new tactical options to explore
support completelyand no carriers wont replace titans for bridging this merely makes logistics easier a carrier can only carry two battleships  to carry a fleets worth of battleships 100 would require 50 carriers still far easier to just titan bridge
this really needs to be a feature of this game theres no good reason for it not to be
csm2 had a similar issue called turning titans into mobile stationshere was ccps response to that item in my recollection of the actual discussion the above statement is probably a little too optimistic theyve spent some time looking at the problem and found it to be just too technically complicated to do they did admit that as time goes on sometimes a new programmer will look at an old problem a dozen other guys have already looked at and see a new way of doing things that nobody else did
love the idea i dont think its come up in this thread if it has im a ed terrible poster but what happens if the capital youre docked in logs outcrashessomehow leaves space are your ships immediately ejected as it goes to emergency warp or are you stuck in a clone that is living in the great logoffski in the sky
i was always under the assumption that you could dock inside carriersms and when i found out that wasnt the case i was pretty dissapointed i really like this idea
iirc ccp said that would require both pilots to be considered the owner which wouldnt be good and the db cant handle it anyway however like the thread in feutures and ideas mentions linked in op iirc ccp already have technology to teleport a player from 1 place to another like fe gmsdevs moving people to the main test system on sisi so it could be solved by simply having the people docking get teleported to a station in a system inaccessible by normal means or just into empty space in a system like that if its easier give the system a 100 penalty to speed and have an indestructible bubble wherever the ships end up to prevent people from fighting in there that means that from a database etc perspective the ship wont actually be inside the carrier the carrier is just the entrance and exit point to that area but from a gameplay perspective it has the same effectwell in that case they should just read trough the thread in features and ideas check if they can implement it by doing it the way suggested there and if not write a rely there explaining why and what the problem is they are 100 correct in assuming that a new programmer hired might see a new way of doing something to get around old problems but the thing is that programmer might not have to be hired by ccp with the several hundred thousands of people playing eve im sure we have our fair share of programmers not hired by ccp so if they want to find that new programmers original and special way of looking at the problem and provides a soloution the forums are the perfect place for a brainstorming like that if noone in this community can come up with a workaround after that then yes its time to drop itp
it should be up to each individual to decide if they want to see the real text of have it censored theres nothing i hate more than censoring forcing censorship on people is like forcing religion on people if youre afraid that your kids will see evil words and corrupt their souls then just prevent them from playing online games in the first place dont try to control the world control your kids instead also as far as i know theres no censorship inside the game especially not on voice so your kid will be exposed no matter whatas for clicking dangerous links well if someone is stupid enough to click just any link maybe they deserve to get infected but anyway if ccp had the least amount of sense they would be using smart regular expressions to filter for exe file extensions in links or filenames instead of just replacing every instance of exe in the post
one thing for sure anyone playing this game will eventually get the read plenty of  either in local chat corp chat alliance chat or hatemailand if thats not enough will hear all those bad words on tsvent so this forum filter is for show only it achieves nothing
precisely which is exactly why it should be optional
big
not supported i already rig my t1 cruisers and they have survived many fights because of that so why not be able to do it cheaper and better also most of my fits require rigs to work at their best or at all especially on frig sized shipsccp has the right idea
umm great so what youre telling me is that you invested more into a ship so that you would ultimately gain from its advantage in situations what youre missing is when its less about what you did because everyone is choosing to invest in something since investment cost it lowered your gained advantage in scenarios is diminished thus it lowers the payoff of choosing to use those rigs while necessitating that you do rig because the standard has risen ultimately whats happening is your ability to survive because of rigging is being cheapened by the fact that your competition is going to be bigger stronger faster toowhen you make everyone special nobody is lowering the cost of rigs is removing the choice and adding the necessity to use them you made my point for me and yet you still argue against it because you dont see the whole picture everyone here whos argued against this point has argued a me centric argument without considering how it plays out within the entire environment yes your ship gets a boost but so does everyone else where as there was once distinction in ship performance for set roles now there will be none so when your now armor plated t1 cruiser gets pointed more easily because the average newb in a frigate is sporting the latest and greatest in rigs how will you see things any differently than you do now the only difference is that your still going to run through the same amount of ships that you always have and those rich bastards are just going to have more money to throw in different directions than they did beforeso rather than rigs being the standard by which ship monetary class warfare is raged it will instead be all faction gear from the lp store or more implants or more drug use i mean where do you draw the line once you go down this path youre not solving any problem you may have listed youre just shifting the problem elsewherei can tell you that if this patch goes through and i do end up spending less to rig my hacs or command ships or interceptors you can damn well expect me to throw those same savings at gallente webs or domi scrams or amarr eans or faction reppers and still my choice to invest will diminish your choice not toi fought a guy a few days ago who spent an extra 8 mil on a small centi repper vs the t2 version for his taranis he chose to invest 9 mil extra and gained an advantage for it he was a  to kill should i complain that centi reppers are so expensive compared to t2 giving him a huge advantage
yaay your an idiotccp is doing it right so stop this crusade you have of you know i still dont know what your complaining about really its like your just complaining to get attentionlet it go man let it go
yes everybody look at me im moses coming down from the top of the mountainit has nothing to do with how out of whack this game is going to become because of this patch surely that isnt my intent at allpunisher before patch 3x axuiliary nano pumps 75 milboost active tank from 6084 dps using 2 energized adaptives and a t2 small repairafter patchpunisher3x auxiliary nano pumps 300k 2 amarr navy ean 44 mil 1 coreli ctype small repairer 9 mil 20 mil for additional modssave 1 pg 13 cpu equal cap use 100 dps tank after patch the guy who chose to invest still gets a massive boost to his ship for the same cost over the guy who just rigged slass warfare arguement still exist nothing has changed that to me looks like a farse of a patch that has created a non issue out of something that people were content with until ccp brought up the issue there was very very limited grumbling before this patch was ever mentioned its amazing how after ccp created the issue all the wealth envy came out in droves and yet still it wont change that fact all it does is remove part of the choice people have in game this patch has 0 to do with the cost of rigs and that affect on gameplay the rich are still going to be rich and youre still going to be at a disadvantage the only difference is going to be the diversity the choice to use rigs vs not had on this game
let it go
i like the idea as long as its balanced not to eliminate the need for player protection id see this more as a means to allow your guards to respond from somewhere else in system not as a way to eliminate the need for them i agree that currently balance is too much in the favor of pirates these days but eve isnt supposed to be safe so the balance should probably always favor them a bit i say this as an industrial player btw
so how many can be anchored on a particular gridcurrently towers have a fixed load that they can support so these devices would also need some sort of limitation on how many could be plunked down or force them to require some other core anchored device that provides powercpu on the gridtheyll also need some sort of limitation as to where they can be anchored must be anchored within 100km of an asteroid this to prevent them being spammed at gates around stationsoutposts and used as supplemental pos defensesenable them to actively engage npcs because the npcs will certainly engage themtracknig and rof should be on par with pos anchored defenses and their scan resolution terribly lowotherwise its a pretty decent ideaalso they need to implement the same mechanic to allow 00 alliances to anchor defenses around other objects gatesstationsoutposts but not pos structures that already have fixed defensesbetter yet all they need is one device  the defensive screen array this item can be anchored at a belt or near a stationoutpostgate and allows the anchoring party to then put in place the same exact weapon arrays that are in the game for pos defensethe defensive screen array can lock up to 6 targets and can be controlled by someone with starbase defense skills in the corporation that anchored the screen no additional rights are needed
this idea just seems illconsidered on all fronts pos guns for temporary installations fuel costs per hour higher than the actual cost of the guns if you want security on a mining op bring friends or fly a ship that can both mine and fightit is utterly meaningless to talk about improvements to lowsec mining that arent based solidly on the idea of putting worthwhile ore there until you make it so that jaspet and friends are worth more than veldspar youre rearranging deck chairs on the titanic
this
would they go bzztbzzt instead of pewpew then sounds nifty
this would be intriguing whats to stop them from being used for gate camps though
some short answer to the replies i have gotyes this is a multiplayer game ipod is right there the mmg is notto be used by a single player since the guns takes time to setupneeds to be maintaine with fuel it isnt a work for a single playerat the same time heshe is doing miningso it is tool for mining ops with multiple miners i have tried in myfirst post to point out it is for miners as in a collective groupdoing a mining opsdeath doorsetp talks about sentry guns for miners well if we take themight hulk it have a dronebay on 50m3 and a bandwith on 25m3 a singlesentry drone takes 25m3 so if a miner in a hulk would use a sentrydrone heshe can only use one at a time also sentry drones is to targetbattlecruiser or bigger ship most loadout on hulk is about hobgoblin and in some case hammerhead hobs is better since you will have 5 of the sametypeconclussion is simple for a miner dont use sentry drones instead five hobs or equivalentdronessarcasm says that the fuel cost is to low well perhaps if you mount a single onebut the idea is that you should mount zero to many mmg in the belt the more youput there the more expensive is it so from an economical point a mining op will not have so many of them because theywill drain the profit from the opherschel says that bring friends to the mining op well the thing is that carebearstend to be with carebears and pvp with pvp but that is not the main problem the mainproblem is that pvp pilots dont want to be in a mining op since there is to little actionhence the need for some kinds of protection for a mining ops several miners and haulersin the second post on the lowest row i put some limitation how many guns you can havethat depends entirly on how long the mining belt isthe limitation is max anchor distance to other gun s10 000m m20 000m l40 000malso in all my post above i have talked about mobile mining gun from the name it is pretty clear that the guns can only be anchor in the ore belts and not at a gatepersonally i cant see any problem with players putting this on a gate however the fuel cost can be alot so  if those players would like to drain they wallet with fuelcost on mmg it is they problem dmister xerox mention that the large is the same size that kills dreads well in theory a pirate could come to a mining belt in a dreadcarrier hence the need for bigger gunshowever if you want to anchor one or more of them it will cost you alot of iskso to summarize it1 there is a physical limitation how many guns you can have depending on the size of the ore belt2 there is an economical limitation how many guns you would like to anchor3 the mmg is a support to a corpalliance mining operations with several minershaulers to participate in
the name states pretty clear that it is mobile mining gun ie for the ore beltalso there is a cost factor they will cost alot to run every hour so having those guns on a gatecamp will cost alot so if ccp would give you the chance to use in a gate camp the question would then be for you how much should that gatecamp cost you per hour1misk  2misk  14000m iskbut that is only theoretical since the purpose of the guns is to be placed in a asteriod belt
how sad that we dont want to be shoot at with this guns there would be equal fights but i guess that pirates dont like that it is better for us miners to stay in high sec and mine there and you get less target to shoot atso for me it is thumbs up all the way for this really good idea
sounds good to me cons but then tbh i think there needs to be something like a carrier thats crossed with a hulk mines around the same as a hulk but has the use of fighters  drones like a carriermight be something else to think about for none empire mining and being a capital ship it would take a fair few sp to be able to fly it unless your hulk pilot is also a carrier pilot helps if i put a thumbs up
how about instead of a fuel cost give it a time costinstead of some artificiallyimposed limit on how many you may have on a grid and another artificially imposed limit on having to anchor within x kilometres of an asteroid how about making the guns asteroidmounted with the mounting process requiring a drilling and fixing procedure that takes x minutes to secure the gun to the asteroidthis way you do away with some artificial reason why the guns can only be in belts and replace it with an expected reason and the fact that drilling the host asteroid and mounting the guns to replace anchoring will take a significant portion of time means players will be less inclined to spam themalso perhaps an additional requirement that asteroids that have guns fitted cannot then be mined themselves or perhaps if it is mined the guns fixings become unstable and the gun ceases to operatei also think there should be some mechanism for incapping  forcing removal of guns once the belt has been vacated  perhaps that the battering of asteroid impact will destroy the guns after x period of time or maybe that they are not automatic but must be operated by players in a similar way to pos gunning  that way some poor guy entering an empty belt in which someone has previously fitted a gun will not be aggrod by deserted equipmentjust a few more ideas for the potnice idea  probably needs a bit of kinking out but you could be onto something
i love the idea its great for stimulating the industrial side of 00 and via that to drop the mineral prices in empire this will be a benefit for all in the long runbutthe guns must have a range that is good enough to hit a fleet of 10 to 15 sniper battleships and actually scare them they must therefore also have enough hitpoints to be able to survive a at least a couple of volleys from 5 sniper battleships you would be looking at something along the lines of 40k to 75k hitpoints this is to let them actually be usable in fighting for a period of time and to give the miners the time to run away or do what miners do in 00with a decent price tag and maybe some playing around with price tags and ranges between guns it could be very interesting espescially when you start incorprating remote repping from logistics and people nearby to help out it could be very interestingit would also give a good base for other tower that would limit the use of hicsdics remote rep tower etc etc etcbut all in all its pretty genius
not supported if mining ships were supposed to be able to hold off pvp ships which they shouldnt ships designed and fitted for pvp should beat ships designed and fitted for pve theyd have spare slots and hardpoints for gunsmissiles and a tank
hac prices have steadly risen for certain hacs requiring ferogel and other t2 components over the last fourfive months hacs like the deimos which have always had costeffectiveness issues are now rapidly becoming too expensive to fly in pvp capacities 160 mil isk for a ship that is not remotely as good as a battleship for its dedicated role is simply too much money and this is the same for many other ships in the hac categoryi would like to see the prices of heavy assault cruisers and other t2 itemsships looked at and addressed to balance the costreward balance for hacs
dyspro moon owners are that way 
costeffectiveness is a matter of self perceptionim perfectly fine paying the current price of hacswelcome to eve where even the market is full of pvp someone is beating you right now cause they can afford what you cant tldr no
and if i have my way depending on which regions you are in they will peak at 200mas stated before go complain about the material spreads in t2 usage
its not an issue of you being willing to pay that much certainly there are some hacs that i would pay that much for but at this point theres nothing a hac can do that a rigged battleship couldnt do at the same price or a rigged bc at the same price hacs have always been the expensive rock stars of the pvp realm but at this point is out of hand they need to be at least reviewed i just think ccp should look at it is all
if hac is to expensive do like i dofly dominix as pvp that is so much better cost only 50m  equipment and they do tank much betterwell that is my 5 cent in the matteror even better go out there and kill those dysp moons and taken them and build ship from that d
certain hacs requiring ferrogel all hacs require ferrogel and quite a lot of it as for your broader point its supply and demand if you dont want to pay it dont plenty of people are still willing to buy  the deimos isnt especially good but 20 still trade hands in the average day in forge and thats essentially flat over the last year seems like people dont mind paying 135m any more than they minded paying 75m
not only do you obviously have trouble understanding economics but you are forgetting the number 1 thing hacs have that battleships dont mobility
i cant give a thumbs up for this idea about ccp begins to fiddle with the economyhowever i give a thumb up to cthul that have understand that deimos and other hac is much more agile ships than battleshipsis deimos worth 200m well if you can kill other ships to a profit that is worth the ships price  your equipment  rigg times two atleast then they are worth ithowever if you fly out from the station and then die right on the outside well i guess no ship is worth the isk and time spending on getting that ship belnevyn the untouchable
and lockspeed and trackingop is forgetting that people bought  and fought with  hacs back before invention when they were 300m
and considering the inflation 300m back then was probably alot more then 300m is today
whats this inflation you speak of
i wish hacs could be cheaperi dont grind missions all day i dont have the rl money to pay for a second account to make isk for me i dont buy illegal isk all i do for the most part is pvp and run some level iv missions every once in a while to earn some isk to buy more cruisers and t2 fittings right now i have around 123 million isk which might not even be enough to afford a single hac regardless of the fittings are you saying that because i dont have rl money or the time to grind and i believe eve is supposed to be the one game where you are not required to grind in order to advance that i must be forced to fly t1 cruisers all the timei support this
please visit your user settings to reenable imagesonce upon a time in a galaxy far far away in a game which people played due to the immense amount of awesome that was in store for a character there was a great looking font this font which was displayed on the map above your navbar during warping docking and jumping operations and in the market headers was perhaps the most beautiful font to be seen in all of eveit jumped out of the screen like nothing else could when that font showed up with its beautiful sans the wide tracking and the pleasant size i felt as if i had become a part of a greg martin paintingthere is power behind that font ccp whacked it and their reason was to enhance the game with unicode fonts seriously im not going to redo this again but if the developers of a game are so lazy that they need to give us impact to replace a font that is graceful flowing and wonderful then you need to ask the developers whats going on inside those heads of theirsi posted it in a thread years ago and ill post it here that font was the reason i started playing eve im not kidding when i saw it i felt like every little detail mattered clearly the developers dont seem to agree with me any more shortcuts lack of finesse and destroying original game audiovisual elements over the period of years has caused me to think that ccp no longer truly cares about the material in their game and just getting a buckif you support this you are supporting not just bringing back the original sans warp drive active font but you are also making a statement that its sometime the nuances of eve that make the game great when you strip a game of the details here and there you are taking away the games personality you know all those games you see that are ripoffs of wow yeah they beat around the bush and use shortcuts just to deliver a product instead of a finished detailed quality item this is no different only the competition is coming from this own games pastive sat on this for over three years now is the time to fix it
bring back mah font
replacing a custom game font with an unicode font is not done ea learned that when they removed the uo font from the new client too
i agreei did have a huge rant written up but i decided against posting it since it was unduely harsh on ccp however ccp if you have a clue you will just stop adding features and spend an entire patch on fixing bugs devote 6 months a year hell even 2 years to it but at the end make sure that every major bug is gone people would much prefer playing a game which works rather than a broken game where the devs keep adding more broken stuff
too much mushy feelings and romanticism in the opbut oh well beautiful font make me tear up as well  bring the old fonts back dammit
nice font  i like itccp please
agreed please bring the font back ccp otherwise i may have to punch infants
make this happen
classic
people actually like that font crazy the solution here is to let us customize and release the old font for download these weird folk who like it can have it and the rest of us can use one that isnt ugly
the font was replaced with unicode so that they could translate the text into other languages
this is what we call a classy font
surely there are serif unicode fonts that look similar to the old onesiigari and i discussed this font and although this is a minor issue i agreed that the old warp drive active font had an almost powerful effect on new players that was lost when they switched to a sansserif font with low kerning
that font looks cooler
thumbs up
signed
i am tempted to agree it was a little more classy than what we currently have and it is of course not impossible to have a unicode serif font
ccp needs to bring hull repair modules in line with the repair efficiency of their shield and armor counterparts since the defensive value that a hull can have is a fixed absolute this should not at all unbalance thingssimple fix do it
current situation there is no direct way to inform other players in eve online that you may be afk or busy for the moment unless you consider the option of denying all conversation requests but that doesnt give the other player any useful information concerning your statusthis is compounded by the having the person in your addressbook which means the conversation is accepted automatically whether youd like it to or not and if youre afk theyll never know it and it could lead to a diplomatic incident tmproposed solutionadd the ability for a player to voluntarily toggle themselves afkbusyavailable this could then be conveyed by way of an icon on your portrait within all channels including local and if a person convos you itll tell them if youre afk or busy especially if the conversation autoaccepts should you be available then the system will act as it does now
you should also have an icon appear above someones ship when they are typing to avoid killing people when they arent giving combat their full attention for honor
this is one of those things that i hope winds up being supported when ccp overhauls all the social tools this winter but yeah bring it up  if this isnt being planned it should be
i dont like it working in all channels we should have the option to choose which channels this functions for for example i may want my corp mates to know im afk but i may not want local to know especially in a hostile system
not a bad idea while were at it why not just make it like other social networking websites you can type in your own status message
yes
u mad

u mad
this would be cool so long as it could be selective be afk to corpmatesalliance members but no one else thinking of covops in enemy systems and the likealthough personally this shouldnt be a priority for ccp as there are many other worse things with this game
supported dont think the status should show up in local though
supported

this is a good idea if im afk and a friend convos me i dont want them thinking im ignoring themso it should pop up in the chatbox in a special font some special text that is user customizablefor example i am afk
such a quality postsupported
having it show an icon in chat channels especially local would make this worthless no one would actually use it for its intended function theyd just set themselves afk when theyre really not and vice versa being able to turn on a chat request autoreply when youre afk would be all right but most people will get the hint anyway when you dont reply to their convo after a while its not like people arent aware that most of the people logged into this game are usually afk
cant goons stop to make useful suggestionspsupported
i rarely agreed more with the goons
weirda thread with goons and theyre not the ones trolling
i was thinking the same thing maybe theyre bizarro world goonsanyway i support this for all channels except local  i dont want people in local knowing if im afk or not
i would really like to see the game implement a jabber backend so you can connect outside of the game as well gmail and facebook both do this already and its proven to be quite robust and scalable this would chatting system and allow for statuses to be set and the like
this will make it so no one ever logs in fair warning but yes a sweet ideaas far as the afk thing i think it should be optional based on each channel you are in because of the way local works in its current implementation your name there can mean a lot of things and even used for misdirection sitting cloaked afk in a hostile system 237 and only operating 1 hour a day allows people to hide when their operations are taking place since this is more of a convenience thing the option to hide it from localspyridden channels should be available
i have proposed this before so obviously ill support this with all my heartthis should be part of the upcoming cosmos project if it wasnt already planned seeing the availability status of corp alliance and buddies when the 2way buddy system is implemented is a must
i support the general idea but i strongly oppose local chat indicators local should not get any kind of boost we should be preparing for the eventual local nerf which would make this indicator obsolete
minor issue but agreed
this is something that has been bugging me for a while although given issues with a ships inertia a battleship takes forever to slow down etc it might make more since to create a toggleable or adjustable setting of some sort
perhaps the addition of a ram button so approach could be something more in tune to your suggestion where ram is what it is now 
ok
i agree that in some futuristic space ship game there are some mechanics that seem very prehistoricunfortunatly this is just a nonissue really in comparison to a ton of other things that ccp needs to look ati am not saying you are wrong just saying at this point in the game it is not important right now
sometimes you want it to do this ie when bumping a ship outside of pos shields personally i dont have this problem just learn how to properly time stopping your ship so you stop before colliding
current situation right now the logging of chat channels is all or nothing youre either logging every single thing or youre logging nothing at all it isnt very flexible considering there are sometimes you want to have a channel while other times youd rather not especially local when youre in jitaproposed solution add a toggle for each chat channel where you can enable or disable logging it could be done the same way you turn channel blinking on and off
very much supported 
perfectly reasonable just make it so that i dont accidentally click the button too often  burying it in a settings menu might be preferable as far as im concerned
waste of programing time i would much rather them work on other things with their time instead of going this directionthumbs down
would be neat and hate to agree with a tri but theres better things ccp could do with their timethat being said implementing this might be pretty quick one file per chat channel log each to its own if checked doesnt seem too bad so if its a quick fix go ahead if not work on a higher priority
shouldnt require too much effort to add
current situationthe overview is normally a very helpful source of information in combat situations unfortunately it doesnt offer enough when it comes to pos modules there are only two ways to tell the status of a pos module one is via the ui at the control tower and the other is by selecting the modules in space with the overview but wait with the latter you must then hunt for the target bracket by spinning the camera around and then zooming in to see if it says online anchored unanchored or incapacitated if the pos module is crowded among a bunch of others this makes things even more frustrating add in the ability to turn off brackets and the fun hahaha no spikes even moreyes there is a third way which ties in with the second one and that is locking the module and seeing what the health is this unfortunately is only useful in determining if it is incapacitated and if youre a dreadnaught in siege you may have just wasted precious seconds locking on to an already incapacitated module proposed solutions add another column to the overview which shows the status of pos modules or create a new set of filters associated with incapacitated online anchored and unanchored or create color tagsbackground within overview for showing the pos modules statusprosanyone who has ever done a pos shoot will no doubt cry tears of joy with this change being added carriers motherships and logistics pilots will be able to pick out which modules need repairing much more easily
agreein with dis
pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee add a column for this god it would be so helpful
all my 5s in massive fleet fights figuring out whats online and whats incapacitated is a pain at best and absolutely impossible at worst
oh god yes
fully supported
edit i fail at reading comprehensionyes i would like to see this column added to the overviewfor your next trick how about getting ccp to add a use jump bridge button to the selected item panel
anything to make the souless grinding of logistics easier
yeah ok
oh god yes do this
absolutely
makes sense
ok whatever
you have no idea how much better this would make pos setuptakedown it would still suck but it would suck less combat and general interaction would be so much better too
agreeing with this
a column on the overview with some status would be extremly useful
bandwagon
4 wheels  0 wheels
supported good and helpful idea
for the love of god
good idea
this would make it even easiertoo easy for sniper fleets to incap defensive clusters on a pos currently you need to at least either get within 100km to look at the pos modules or have a cloaky scout relay targetswhile i agree the current methods of trying to figure which pos module has which status is a pita i think allowing anyone looking at their overview from any range what so everas long as they are on grid is to excesive a swing in the other directiontldr  no
please add this pos shoots are bad enough as it is
if there is a 100 man sniper fleet sitting at 160km from the tower and they cant see the modules statuses its not going to change the fact that all the important modules are going to be incapped in 10 minutesif you want a compromise how about you can see the status if the module is within the targeting range of the ship you are currently piloting all this does in essence is saves the ctrlclick it still preserves the no 400km scout from your idea but also makes it suck less to shoot a pos
yes indeed that would be nice
yeah 100i had an idea originally for agents to move you to new agents in different systems as you complete missions so mission running wasnt so staticthis pretty much falls inline with my ideas so supported
totally acceptable change for the prophecy i personally feel the harbinger is fine as it closely mimics the geddon the prophecy just mimics that gift you get from aunt clair every christmas that was more appropriate for girl who was perpetually 12
except when its counterpart can tank nearly as well while adding considerably more offense if the prophecy had more powergrid andor capacitor to actually benefit from its role bonus this would be less of an issue if every low and mid slot were dedicated to tank a harbinger would actually provide a better buffer tanked ship than the prophecy due to powergrid aloneif both ships were to active tank the harbinger would still outdamage considerably still have nearly equal tank and more capacitor to run that tank while having an extra mid slot to further bolster its capacitor or add some sort of utility not to mention a bigger drone bay and considerably more powergrid which will not all be consumed by that 1 extra turret and mid slot so again why use the prophecy in that scenario when it just gets out performed on so many levels if it were to have a capacitor role bonus or a range bonus or something extra to consider to mix with its armor hardening then yes maybe you could distinguish the ships role but currently what it can do the harbinger can do more of way better
i agree the proph needs a boost a larger drone baybandwith  a damage bonusarmor rep amountarmor amount  cap bonus would helphowever your tier debate is a bit tricky its not as simple as they scaledont scale as a general rule higher tiers are better and should be better than their lower tier counterparts one main factor having to do with increased cost why make them the about the same when the harbinger will become uselessall races have many different roles to play with but amarr gallente gets blastersrailsdrones caldari gets railsmissiles minmatar get shieldarmor and projectilesmissiles amarr gets just lasors all amarr ships are either heavy tank ships or heavy dps ships cept apoc for snipingand arbitratorr for drones making both the harbinger and the proph dps would be a mistake the proph would just be a weaker version than the harb however adding to its tankingbuffer abilities would fit in nicely with the rest of the amarr line up or go different with a drone boat like the arbitratora drone boat large arbitrator would be sexy
teirs have never mattered when it comes to performance people always make that mistake because they assume that a teir 3 has to be better than a teir 1 take the geddon as a prime example its a teir 1 battleship that does more damage has more drone capacity and near equal tank to its teir 2 counterpart it also has better cap stability than its teir 3 counterpart even though it concedes its capacitortake the vexor as a 2nd example near equal speed and tank as a thorax yet the thorax does a completely different thing than the vexor either ship is debatably better than the other and it really comes down to understanding their role not their teir same for the ferox vs drake although there is some overlap which quite honestly their should not be with the shield hardening bonusthe prophecys issue is that it does not have a defining role to define its role as a tank is not adequate because it does not fill that role well in any regard you can get near equal performance from its cruiser counterpart with a few various distinctions extra fitting for plates vs lower sig and speed etc so why pay more for the battle cruiser class in this instance if its going to be the tank role fine but allow it to be by allowing to fulfill that need well otherwise change itbtw agreeing requires ticking off the support box
profecy is fine leave it alone
thank you for yet again trying to snipe at one of my post without at all refuting with good evidence why im wrong maybe if youd actually back up your statement rather than just snipe id give a rats ass what you felt
let it go man let it go its just a gamei feel the ship is fine as is im not sniping and no i dont have to convince you and give examples why it needs to be boosted you started this thread so it is your responcibility on presenting things to convince us it needs to be changedi am not convinced
debate is a 2 sided affair you cant say its fine without providing evidence in light of your argument even if its just a fit you think works or build you might try you have to provide something ive provided a base argument i cannot provide further argument without knowing what youre side of the coin is like i cannot show you why your opinion is flawed without knowing what your opinion is its terribly easy to say its fine as is its hard to back up why the ship is fine as is for me to go out and try to counter every possible argument would make this thing unreadable and long winded but if you provide me subset of every possible contingent its so much easier to prove to you why youre wrong and im rightthus far your its fine remark has done nothing ive shown why it gets out classed at any role its assigned to thus making it obsolete there is no reason to have redundancy in an class of ship as it just makes one ship worthless you havent even refuted what my op says you havent stated how it tanks better or how it works better which is the point of the topic without doing the above youre sniping youre taking me out without without providing me a chance to fight back the definition of sniping so either provide some proof as to why the prophecy is good or fine or gtfo its your sort of comment that makes this forum worthless
and then he wonders why nobody likes him
do approve the prophecy is laughable compared to even the ferox
ive flown both ships i honestly cant see what the big deal is one has defense and one has aggression emphasissomehow i seriously doubt your that experiencednot to mention your obvious ego issue
just here to reiterate that dps is the only thing that matters
i think the numbers above speak for the lack of defensive advantage of the prophecy all things considered im actually very experienced with both ships which is maybe why i can see clearly and formulate more of an arguement than a its good trust meyou look at any of the other tiers of ships that mimic what the prophecys role ispunisher  highest powergrid of the frigates considerable capacitor in its class most low slots highest armormaller  highest powergrid of the cruisers considerable capacitor most low slots most armor baseabbadon  highest powergrid considerable capacitor 1 less low slot than the most of its class but a gain of nearly 2100 armor and a mid slotprophecy  14 less powergrid than its class alternative nearly 600 less base armor equal low slots a loss of 300 base capacitor with equal recharge time and 1 less lowmid combo to help gain capacitor even though with max skills the ship can get 25 more ehp its already yielded 12 of its armor hp back because of the higher base on the harbinger to active tank the ship is already conceding 1 mid which aids capacitor its also yielding some power grid some base armor and a huge damage fall off for this slightly better tank its nearly impossible to argue price point on any t1 ship because after insurance its nearly negated i believe its about 2 mil difference in the end to choose either tank on the ship severely cripples its performance at any other task where as its alternative can nearly match its tanking capability while still performing the role damage boat drone boat range platform mid slot utility and capacitor beast better im sure i left some outthere are my facts where are yours not one person has even offered up a viable tank solution to compare this ship to its couterpart because quite simply its does not hold water
the dear old prophecy is fine leave it be
for gods sake just implement the damn update already the point the op made was ccp already said theyd fix this whether the whining gankers like it or not so they should just stop procrastinating and do it
i love that word and indeed just implement it ccp you said it would be dealt with soon now keep your promise
not supported at all in any way no
last year there was an amazing ingame event malkalen no not the malkalen incident which was little more than pretty footage no i mean the malkalen relief effort in the wake of the malkalen incident there was a major capsuleer effort to supply the rescue effort it was as simple as putting up npc buy and sell orders for trade goods and posting a few news articles but it created a powerful story that any pod pilot could take part in  and many did both altruists and opportunists it was a brilliant use of existing mechanics to breathe life into the newsby contrast consider the recent turnover of halmah a fw system taken from the amarr by the tlf there was a post up on the official forums about the capture shortly afterwards in which the minmatar forces claimed to be freeing all the slaves followed immediately by an amarrian response that said no way and sadly thats true ccp has posted through prior scope new articles and in todays chronicle that there are social and economic repercussions for system occupancy as pilots we can make claims about those repercussions but nothing we say or do makes a real differenceccp could change that and it need not require the development of a major new game mechanic i would like to suggest that ccp takes the malkalen relief effort as a model for adding ingame economic consequences and stories to fw for the amarrminmatar conflict it would be as simple as posting a few million slavefreed slave trade good units on the market in a system after a capture and posting a scope story about the turnover 24ic takes auga slavers descend on the new bounty or tlf captures halmah transport industry struggles to move the millions freed before an amarrian counteroffensive something similar could be done on the caldarigallente side with confiscated trade or industrial goodsappropriate buy orders could be placed elsewhere in the relevant empire space allowing pilots to resell these resources and recoup their investment a pure sale in the case of slaves and confiscated goods or as proxy for the subsidized transport fee for freed slaves in the republic it does not need to provide a profit although that might be worth considering as many pilots would take part just for personal reasons since these systems are lowsec it will also encourage the faction that lost occupancy to stick around and disrupt trade runs and give pirates an incentive to involve themselves in the inevitable real chaos that would come with a change in administrationthis change would allow dedicated players and corporations to have a factual impact on the socioeconomic outcome of fw actions without requiring significant development or having an unbalancing effect on the player goods market and notable successes or failures would be good subjects for later news stories getting players more interested in the current state of fwedited for grammar
i kinda like this idea supported at least in principle
i support this idea fully whilst it will have little impact on the lives of many pod pilots in eve it will also require almost no effort to implement for those who do roleplay surrounding faction warfare i think it would be finally something that could be done which could been seen as a pure rp effort in secondary support of fw
jade constantine brought something similar up a long time agothat said supported but keep in mind that it shouldnt be a winner takes all situation where people will leave the losing side just because the winning side takes all rewards which basically grinds the whole conflict to a halt just like what happened on the gallentecaldari side
if there were an ingame consequence to system occupancy it might help get people to sit there for hours doing the plexes
why do mission runners deserve more protection than miners or ratters who choose to go to low sec solo if you played wow on a pvp server  would you complain that people keep killing you will you try to mine  fish whatever keep in mind that low sec is the equivelent in the eve universe of a pvp serverhigh sec is the equivelent in the eve universe of a pve server if you want to avoid pvp use high sec
so in to summarize spamming a button every 5 seconds is not fun please fixnot supported it is painfully obvious that op never understood or used the previous probe mechanics which were span butan every 24 seconds depending on skills implants and never getting a hit as the mechanic was luckdependent with skills giving little to no bearing on resultsman i hate faillolcaldari pilots 
eccm mods make you harder to scan but do you realize that you are suggesting a carebear to fit a pvp mod theyll throw fits of impotent rage over the idea
current situationanytime you jump through a gate through a jump bridge relog or do anything else that is considered a session change the client forgets any passwords you have entered for your ship this is especially frustrating when using jump bridges on friendly pos that dont belong to your corporation each time you use a bridge the password must be reentered the same could be said for friendly pos shields which require a password as it can only be typed in after youve entered the solar system proposed solution i propose that ccp look into adding the function of eve client remembering passwords between session changes proit will cut down on the additional effort of reentering password if youre going through multiple jump bridges or if you have to leave a system and return
yes please
yes i always forget to paste in the stupid password
o
please do this jesus christ
yup maybe some sort of savable password list would be nice too
please
there is no reason not to do this please change it ccp
absolutely annoying to no end
can we get ccp to let our ships remember that we enabled fleet member useage of hanger and maintenance arrays on carriers too while were at it thats just as annoying
i concur
do it
yes 110 agree
eve needs cookies
10
this was just about fistthroughmonitor frustrating when i was checking out password mechanics on sisi i cannot imagine doing it for real supporting this wholeheartedly
yes please
definitely this is another of the many things ccp should have done in the first place
i like cookiessupporting cookies for eve
also i feel it will be beneficial to let all the alliance through a jump bridge without needing to enter a password each trip
i want it can i have it please
so i was moving through highsec with my alt the other day to grab some ammo so i could continue my merciless quest to kill the ebil carebears that invade my beautiful home of egg  and by instinct i hit the directional scanner scan button to my horror i saw the following 2 fleet pests 3 navy ravens 1 nightmare 1 mach 4 mega navys  and other assorted hulks orcas retrievers and lesser bss and as i sit there pouring saliva all over my keyboard i remembered it was highsecnooooooooo this ebilness of the carebears should not and could not be allowed all of them like the malicious little midget albino guineapigs that they are scheming us hardworking pirates of our isk by staying in highsec under the defense of the corrupt concordand so i suggest  those ebil bastards give us hardship all year long tempeting us with their faction fitted faction ships and yet never risking anything  so forget the riskreward situation forget about balance forget any stupid idea other than this stupid one  lets have one day in the year where concord and the faction police go afk grab donuts and coffee and highsec becomes a no man land where people can gank anyone and anything  24 hours of complete and utter mayhem of ransoms and faction ships exploding and of carebears tears lowsec people always get the rough end of the stick so let us have 1 day in which all our dreams and hallucination come truehaving said that i doubt this will ever really happen but a pirate can dream cant he
supporting my own idea cause im cool like that
there are quite large areas where you can shoot to kill every day of the year except for patch days and suchit is every system with a 00 to 04 sec ratingmaybe that is new to you
another of the threads i want to gank stupid people in highsecif you want to gank them there live with the risk of loosing your ship to concordif you dont want to loose yours then gank the people in lowsec and 00not supported balance is fine as is
yeah but thing is they only fight people who want to fight they want to fight the helpless players with impossible forces because thats the cool thing to do hey man im all for pvp i love pvpers because well people buy my stuff because the last item they bought from me got blown up by a pvper so pvpers are essential for me to make iskbut what your asking for is just stupid grow a pair and go hunt down targets in lowsec or 00 im sorry lowsec is near empty but perhaps instantly blowing everything out of the sky with impossible odds everytime a player jumps into lowsec isnt the best way to encourage more players to go into low sec
would be awsome to have a highsec free for all daysadly those marauders and faction bss will be all docked up and the pilots will be sitting in a bar or perhaps the pilots will be sitting and smacktalking in local about how unhappy they are about not being able to do missions
ummno
yet an another emorage post of poor form and foolishnessno
supporting despite the use of ebil in op random senseless ganking is fun
no can dothere are enough stupid people venturing into low sec and 00 space go kill all of them first before you start looking for highsec targets
yeah actually thats probably what would happen everybody would take a break from eve since it would be announcedthe only players that might actually play would be new players that happen to be joining eve for the first time only to get instawtfpwned when they undockgreat way to introduce players into the gamewelcome to stations online
mash  notheres low sec and 00 to go fight inwhy not make your way to curse theres lots of action down there with the curse coalition pl etcwhats up wanna pick on the noobs in high sec pfffthaha p
you silly noob  i spend my days clearing the galaxy out of the scum that roams lowsec nay seeing anything but people who want me dead gateguns who want me dead stations guns who want me dead rats who want me dead and seldom even roids that want me deadand all i ever ask for all my hard work keep the demand for fresh ships high is one or two faction ships to come over and let me guarantee their safe return to highsec  for a price ofc but no you carebearing highsec noobs sit there in your level 4 missions ing around in utterly fail setups using faction ships and faction fittings to kill rats and generally desecrating anything that is holy in eve nightmare as level 4 ship noooooo so one day that us 100 who are hunted all year long one day for us wretched beggars to enjoy life to the max  and to get payback at the carebears who are a mockery to the awesome pvp game that is eveplease hear the ply of our lost wipping souls and allow us to distribute divine judgment on all who dare stand in our path in our special day of total omgwtfbbqepicawesomepwnageend roleplay

someone needs a hug
this is kind of a little known thing or atleast it seems to be but tracking disruptors are overpowered for use on unbonused ships right now there is nothing wrong with what a bonused ship does to a turret cruisers dps the problem is that any ship with a spare midslot can fit a td and really open up engagement options for itselfthought it was hard to hit a af before wait till those jag pilots start fitting a td in one of those midslots and pwn just about any turret cruiserthe myrmidon flies exactly like a bigger arbitrator if you put some tds on it domnixes are pretty good as wellnext time you want to fly a frigate sized vessel and you have a spare midslot throw a td in there a single unbonused td effectly adds 40 more speed to your ship as far as damage negation goesanyways i think i outlined the problem enough my suggested fix is a nerf to there effectiveness in general and a increase in the bonuses on td bonused ships now i dont want them to be absolutely worthless on a unbonused ship just not quite so awesome
remember td still do nothing to missile ships
right cause fully what 16th the ships you encounter maybe are missile ships in any small gang scenario you will have multiple viable turret ships with which to use your td on
if they were actually overpowered it wouldnt be littleknown mid slots are scarce  how many ships think a td is better than a mwd or a point or a cap booster besides they ought to be usable  i want ships to at least consider using spare mids for ew in normal circumstances and i mean all types of ew nah you dont need a sensor booster throw a painter on instead should be something that gets said more often td arent generally as good as ecm but theyre probably the closest and their power level is fine the problem isnt with td its with tp and sd
not supported tracking disruptors are fine they can be countered with maneuvering your ship
so how does it figure this out  if you warp to one bookmark and fly to another which does it display maybe have bookmarks included in the nearest options or something
like when u r jumping it shows current location and destination
when warping you mean it already does that what exactly do you want
you can always press f10 to show the solar system map and hover your mouse on the closest pin icon to see which bookmark youre closest tootherwise just pay attention when you warp if you warp to a bookmark the warping to text will show the name of the bookmark
thisif you want a nice looking covops to die in get an anathema
fail logic i could just as easily say that the other model was always the t2 astrometrics ship for gallente so why change it change the t1 t1 meaning worse worthless t1 frigates less important than t2 counterpart to match the more important t2 model they switched the wrong one if you ask me
youre not doing it right  i dont know anything about this i have no opinion but ill jump all over this with my csm boots anywaystfutake your ego that says you must have an opinion on this and move onto the next threadcomment on stuff you understand first
so youre suggesting that theres a valid reason to be looking at a covops model you should either be cloaked have a scanning screen open or both if you dont then youre doing it wrong seriously on what basis do you suggest that a guy whose career is literally telling people how to play the game better that he doesnt know how to play
is this thread titled how do i fly a covertops correctly
you are so right why would i look at my ship anyways they obviously dont want me to look at my ship because they have the first person view featuoh there is no first person i can still see my ship when im cloaked thank you very much if you couldnt see your ship at all it would be extremely difficult to see what you were doingjust because hes in that position doesnt mean he represents the majority of eves players and their ideas i for one didnt vote for him think of corrupt politicians it happensedit do csm delegates even get paidedit2 they dont why does he have the authority to tell me how to play my game and which ship model i should use then
lol leave it to someone in eve university to get itbesides i cant cloak my ship while dockedthe original maulus hull has sort of a bug shape to it which is almost attributed as cute the imicus is definitely not cute and because of this we wish to have a cute ship which we fly a lotwhats the ratio of helios to keres you see flying about im not one for making statistics onthefly but im almost certain there are a lot more covert ops than electronic attack frigsso how about you change your position vanity has everything to do with eve
no  if youd just asked that this thread would have been over a week ago and with much the same result indeed
ill tell ya what hersheyif you dont have any constructive comments then save the killmail epeen bullshit for your corpalliance forumssiigari got my point precisely as have several others that have contributed to this threadthe imicus is an ugly shipthe maulus has a useless roleand yet someone at ccp made the call to switch the t2 models instead of the t1 models thus retiring a pleasing model and forcing everyone who used to fly a helios to retrain for something elseif it was so simple for them to swap models then they can do it again and get it right instead this timealsocsm arent career gamers they arent even ccp employees they are volunteers who got picked to voice our opinions to devs because ccp is too lazy to respond to customers themselves
wasnt intended as epeen just as comedy  i never said i could do any better and seriously anyone flying t3 in march obviously cares more about doing things in style than they do about doing things effectively its fine if you want to play that way but youre in the minority if you do i wasnt referring to his csm tenure or his rl career dv is director of training for eve university when he says someone is doing something wrong im inclined to agree with him
idk if im correct in saying this but all ive heard that eve university can do is blob with frigates and an occasional cruiser tbh that takes no skill how much training skill does it take to train somebody to do that
man all those big alliances do is shoot their enemies it doesnt take skill to do that any monkey can click and f1f8 statements like they just blob says nothing about their skill level  do they blob well or badly do they win fights or lose them ive never flown beside them or been a part of them but i know that theyre a corp that people get pointed towards to learn how to play well and that theyre a corp that advertises the presence of gobs of newbies and isnt plowed under by wardecs 237 their killboard shows 47 efficiency which isnt bad at all for a corp with their demographics from what i can tell from back here id have to say that theyre pretty good
the fact that such sets and drugs dont exist theres a 5 shield hp hardwire and thats it actives on the other hand can get gargantuan drug and implant bonuses  something like 92 tank if you use strong blue pill and a full highgrade crystal setedit typo originally said 62 meant to say 92 stupid numpad
this
im not sure what a huge isk investment has to do with an underpowered ship a huge isk investment is a great boost to any ship it will not change the fact that the ship in question lacks any real muster compared to alternatives the standard t2 fit is extraordinarily lacking no matter what combo of gear you try on this ship can the ship perform well in isolated instances yes absolutely can alternatives perform considerably better in those same instances absolutely it not really filling a role if there are already better options for the same role out there so the better idea would be to change its role to something more unique within its raceclassbare in mind one of the options ive offered up is to give it more ability to define its role as a shield tanker wo changing its offense id be very happy with this choice if it came down to that right now wo ridiculous implants or boosters a normal tank i can come up with can be overcome by a large portion of t1 cruisers and on top of that it will cap out very fast or have to sacrifice some of its ability to active tank for an injector slot and even still with an injector its not buying a large amount of time additionally add to that the problem that in order to get its best tank its uses up 80 of its cpu 35 of its power grid and cannot fit an mwd because it is dedicating those slots to tank so it becomes an immobile sorta ok tank with no ability to fit any armament and extraordinarily in efficient capacitor how is that in any way shape or form acceptable compared to what almost any other bc class ship can dowhats even more amazing is that it can passive recharge for considerably more cap stability and less fitting requirements while adding double the amount of ehp at about half the recharge of the best but shortest lived burst tank how does a shield boost bonus make sense with the ships current stats if a passive tank with no bonus from the ship negates every intention of an active tank on this ship in the first place for the record best burst tank i can get is about 1122 with max skills every 3s with a med injector and 800s plugged in it can sustain that tank for 45 seconds with 6360ish shields as a start point assuming even damage distribution and its tank lasting exactly 45 seconds at which time it caps out assuming no reload on the injector it will have gained approximately 16830 shields for a total of 23190 shields best possible scenario for the best burst tankfor a passive tank with the same shield hardening the same ship can get 1625 shields recharge per second with a starting shield of 15338 1625shields45s 73125 for a total of 22650 while still retaining its ability to recharge at max capacity at the end of that 45 seconds and with nearly 100 more cpu and 400 more powergrid to use it also does this by completely bypassing one of the ships bonuses which is specifically geared towards shield tanking will expensive implants andor expensive drugs change that argument slightly yes but for the common man no and no drug will change fitting requirements
contyou could also swap the ability for its shields to recharge quiet as fast passively with more buffer by swapping out purger rigs for extender rigs in this scenario the ship will start with 23326 shields and yet again the same shield hardening additionally it will gain 1265 shields per second at peak this means best case scenario in 45 seconds of time it will gain an additional 5692 shields for a total of 29018 shields while retaining its capacitor and approximately 400 extra powergrid 100 extra cpuin both passive shield recharge scenarios i will concede that part of its recharge will be lost as it will not always regain its optimal amount per second yet in both scenarios even if you were to remove 2000 shields from the recharge which is high it still retains capacitor it still retains its ability to recharge after 45 seconds at max potential for whatever remaining shields are left and has the allure of much more usable fittings not to mention that its recharge ability in 45s is already outdone by its raw hp by an amount of 245 to 1 ratio if you were to dedicate just one mid slot to anything other than active tank this difference becomes even more glaringly problematic so why should a ship that gets no bonus to buffer tank either equal or outperform a burst tank in every way from a ship that gets a 375 boost to a burst tank if and only if you have maxed skills with the ship itselfand finally if you were to task any of these 3 ships with a tank that lasted less than 45 seconds the burst tank suffers more by comparison with every removed second
fit close range put in nos in the missile hardpoints when the rig changes come out fit a set of capacitor rigsbut seriously you havent given me a reason why we cant just increase the bonus to 10lvl
which would be a boost ie the topic and yet another of the many options to suggest along with any of the other options i provided initially hence you would support the idea of this post which would be reason to click that little box and not sound like youre against me
well truth be toldsignedbut only if it increases one of its bonuses or stats not to make it a different shipi like the tanking bonus and rof bonus just needs more of something cap shield hp bonus velocity increase would be another good thing make it faster than the cane by 30ms

doesnt i was just trying to address nians ignorant comment as for the rest of your post im not sure you quite understand how passive shield tanking works you dont just sit on your peak recharge all the time  you only get that at a very specific point if your enemies are kind enough to be doing low dps forever yes passive tanks are greatwhich is why missioners love them so much in any sort of real pvp passive tanks are awful  they take up too many slots to counter a damage profile that doesnt come up very often also did you include the fact that an active tank fits 3 gyrostabs and a dcu in the lows instead of 4 sprs i hear that has an effect on the ships performance im not trying to defend the statusquo cyclone here  its a pretty bad ship and is in serious need of more midlow slots andor an unsplit weapon setup i tend to be a bit dismissive of csm doing balance work because its sort of a bottomless pit but this is one of the better targets for a balance thread i just dont like to see stupid arguments being left unchallenged
well ofcourse sir gyrostabs and sprs have an effect on the ship only drakes would fit sprs in lows if pvp and no drake pilots do that since it tend to ruing the purpose of the ship  damageas for the cyclone its a minmatar ship and its really fast accually so it would be stupid to use sprs they ruin your capacitor with 4x sprs in lows you can not even tackle usually in pvp like gank canes and such the shield is just a small buffer not a passive tank buffer is not passivepassive is not buffer see my point here back to cyclone being minmatar  capacitor already suck so having the ship shieldtanked either it cant tackle or youre just wasting capacitor so throw on a couple of lse 2s and dictate rangethe thing here is that cane does this alot better than the cyclone the cane accually outperforms the cyclone in both active and buffer tanking  dpstherefore giving the cyclone a boost can be a good thing to do its stupid having a shipclass and rendering it really bad since the tier 2 is much much better and in the eve climate of today neither local tank nor passive tank are prefered buffer andor rr is the most used pvp tanking method if youre in a gang the cyclone is a weak gang ship to it can fit an active tank o and nothing more the hurricane out performs it in gangs and solo since the hurricane can tank tackle and kill at the same time cyclone  pick two dps tackle and tank hurricane  pick three dps tackle and tanksee my point again
cyclone is a great ship head to the my eve section and watch some videos of it taking down multiple tier 2 bcs you dont need the implants and boosters but if you do have them its a terrifying shipwhat people dont seem to realize is that it requires excellent skills to really shine
actually if you choose to do 3 gyros in the lows of an active tank it cant even last 45 seconds i went with an active tank and a dcu2 with 3 power diagnostics to both boost capacitor and boost max shieldsshield recharge hence the best possible active tank comment furthermore i pointed how how crippling on fittings the best possible tank is thus limiting the ability to fit guns launchers or other high slot mods in the first place the only way to point out flaws is at the extremes because middle ground has way to many variables wed argue forever on middle ground with an infinite set of possibilitiesi also conceded how active vs passive tanks work but explained how the recharge factor of a passive tank is only about 2040 of its total tank over equal time bufferpassive tanks gain the advantage of requiring 0 time to already have a significant tank advantage over active tanks active tanks require more time to equalize the field and eventually overcome bufferpassive tanks so the real argument is less time benefits bufferpassive tanks more than actives the exact opposite of what you argue i would encourage you to go review the numbers game i posted more closely to see exactly how that argument plays out
ive broken a golem in a sacrilege a faction navy raven in an absolution seen a carrier broken by a 3 hacs and a million other impossible things doesnt make it amazing it just concedes that some situations are dictated by luck others by stupidityyou ever seen a magician on the street doing card tricks on tv believe it or not they dont work all the time the camera just shows the times that it does
5 x autos  nosneutsmwdinjectorlarge sbscraminvulngyros and speed modscheap shield resists rigs in rig slots if you wantthe cyclone is an excelent skirmish warfare bcif you read the description of this ship thats exactly what its supposed to benot the easiest ship to fly not one for noobs but in the hands of a skilled pilot this is not a ship to be underestimated
looking at yaays fit for the passive tank it seems hes using 3 lse 2 invuln dcu 3 spr and 3 purger its a drakelike passive fit in order to get the numbers he refers to and even then it only works that way at peak if that tank breaks the pilot is totally screwed whereas the active pilot can still tank even if hes dyingand maybe live long enough to kill the attacker because of it i have difficulty believing that someone with as much pvp experience as yaay did something as laughable as putting together a passive shield tank for a cyclone with a dcu in it and then claimed that proved his point thats the sort of lolfit i expect from someone whose idea of the perfect ship is a nighthawk with t2 purgers not form someone who was a longtime fc for a serious alliance if he was talking about a buffer fine great  perfectly reasonable fit but his fit had sprs and purgers in it heres the rough numbers assuming fits that dont totally suck a decent buffer tankim not going to discuss the passive further its a lolfit without rigs gets 66k ehp the similar active fit with a cap booster gets 36k and reps 723 dps the active tank is better after 41 seconds of combat if you rig them up it becomes 90k and 1153 dps which means the active is better after 47 seconds if you factor in capacitor you change the rigs slightly and the turnover is instead 55 seconds if you add 3 pdu to each fit for the biggest tank possible turnover is at 63 seconds this is ignoring shield recharge in all cases because its unlikely to be relevant those turnover times are decent for the active tank in some roles especially at the lowercost end of things though in no case are they great they become quite nice if you crystal up of course  the last example has turnover at 36 seconds with a highgrade crystal set in or 30 seconds with a strong blue pill as welleven assuming maximal penalties those numbers look a whole lot better though they of course cant be taken too heavily into account given their cost theres also more room to throw faction gear at an active fit which again makes it better in the case of someone who has far too much money for most roles in pvp the buffer tank is better though that is of course true for most ships its often true even for the ships with an active tank bonus which is really kind of a shame a cap buff might make the active tank option work better or even a shield hp nerf though thatd have to be accompanied by a corresponding buff somewhere else still i dont think any of those numbers i gave are especially unreasonable the tanking mix on the ship has been pushed towards active about as hard as any can reasonably go i think as for my comment about passive tanks they tend to be wellliked because theyre an easy way to get a high sustained tank  on most ships higher than the sustained active tank its not really relevant for the cyclone because the passive sustained is about the same as the active sustained but i was speaking more generally about why passives get used
i take offence to that perhaps your own paradigm complex is blinding youi am well aware of the cyclones immence capabilities for active shield tanking when fitted correctly and with an implant set  drugsthat however is a moot issue as i said theres nothing stopping other pilots using implant sets and drugs it doesnt have to be tank related but they will still boost the effective of whatever ship they chose to use them with just as well as what you would choose for a cyclonewhat baffles me is you didnt event considder the imbalance of resists vs repair bonusesas i said long ago a long lost but most informative thread took place that broke the bonuses down to effectiveness and it was concluded using math that to balance the two only needed the repair bonuses to be increases to 10lvllet me tell you a truth originally the repair bonuses were 5lvl just like the resist bonuses but ccp realized that it was well out of wack and to be cautious they increased the repair bonuses to modest 75lvl that we have nowgiven the changes to tanking style and the prevalence for ehp and rr tanks in pvp its time to rebalance all local repair bonuses to 10lvl so the ships with those bonuses are the choice in smaller engagementsalso guys did you count the total slots of the cyclone compaired to the other tier1s a while ago it was concluded that the cyclone was sub par so ccp gave it an extra medium slotbtw i still believe the cyclone could do with a speed boost so its the fastest battlecruiser
youve managed to give the ship a setup most t1 cruisers can beat in dps or tank and most certainly speed and agility utility as well as sig radius about the only advantage it has over the rupture is raw ehp at the higher cost of more mods and more insurance rupture can still do virtually everything that ship can for more dps and a different style of defense the rupture can easily skirt its gun tracking and range while dishing out more than enough dps to double its tankable damage while beating its speed and hanging outside its nosneut range youre putting that ship in a situation where its relying on its contender to not be paying attention to range or for a fight to start at 12km or less to even have a chance of being affective almost all ratting less not pvp setups can out tank its damage dish out considerably more damage than its tank which will break the ship in time measured in seconds i mean its not even versitile in its ability to have a decent tank decent dps and decent cap warfare with decent speed its countered and beaten on virtually every front together thus it makes the alternatives in similar roles such as the hurricane far better solutions to that style of fightingfor the record the hurricane can come up with virtually identical stats while dishing out more dps and with a higher base ehp the difference being that the hurricane can be far more useful in other capacities as well
so much wrong stuff i dont know where to startok some t1 cruisers may be able to match its dps or tank but not both at the same time and definatelly not with neuting ability as wellremember we are talking about skirmish warfare here so the cyclone is not sitting still it may be doing 15k to 2k ms considerable reducing damage from missiles and somewhat from tracking depending on the exact situationi would like to know the setup of this ruppy that can deal more damage while maintaining an orbit in point range of a ship doing 15kmsit would need 5 425mm a mwd and a med injectorthat does not leave much fitting for plates  resists  gyrosno the ruppy will not be able to skirt the cyclones tracking  it will have at best a marginal speed advantage meaning it will end up either pursueing the cyclone or running away with very little tracking to protect it while the cyclone can repair its tank the ruppy cannot if platedresistthe cyclone pilot abrubtly changing direction could also easily bring the ruppy into neut  scram range at which point it dies or if the ruppy pilot is orbiting to far out he is gonna lose his point and let the cyclone escape a lot of ratting setups dont fit injectors neut them and they are going down the ship is not sitting tanking it is using speed to its advantage to reduce damge taken add in a 35 bonus to shield reps and its not such a wimp as you seem to thinkas with all combat in eve though  you need to pick your targets and i was not trying to say this ship can go head to head with other bcs or bs but flown with care it can usually get away from anything large enough to hurt itthere are ships out there that are better at dpstank or cap warfare or are fasterwhat you have in the cyclone is a ship that can do all 4 things fairley well at the same timecane is a nice ship for sure though to do what you say it would need to be dual armor repped with no plates otherwise it would lack in agility to a clone2 slots for resists leaves 2 slots for speed  damge mods whereas the clone has 4 cane having 2 extra midsit would be interesting to see a cane fit for this role for comparison
if were talking about speed fitting a cyclone vs hurricane back before the massive speed nerf another thread or two took place on speed fitting minnie bcsafter sitting down and working out the minimum fit for a speed fit bc even with the 1 less midlow slot count vs the hurricane because the cyclone had a tanking bonus and 5 medium slots the cyclone actually tanked better and kept the speed it requiredthe issue for a cane is if you fit enough speed mod to make a speed ship which i consider a minimum of 3 then you only have 3 left in low for a tank or gank if you attempt to tank you slow down as it would be armor hence a bad thing so you can spend 3 slots on gyros for the gank after that you are left with your 4 medium slots assuming you didnt tank with your lows your going to have to put something tank based in your medium slots perhaps an extender if you do that your down to three slots next is your mwd so now you have two slots a webber and a scram is the usual choiceafter all this you have lots of dps but your tank is crap rigs could help but you would probably also want to get some ambits in for falloff speed is as it should beif you fit a cyclone however you know your dps isnt going to come close to a cane you could spend 3 lows on gank but you only have 4 lows so after the 3 speed mods you have one left gyro ofcourse next is your mediums you could do the extended trick like the cane but you have an extra medium over it and a booster bonus so you fit your lsbii its cap hungry so you have a couple of choices put in a cap booster or use your 3 utility highs for nos i go the now route personally maybe even 2x nos 1x neut suck the enemy dry to keep your tank going and then neut them so they cant shoot at you assuming hybrid or laser boat then your mwd a webber and a scram leaves one slot either an invii sbaii med cap booster up to you but what ever it is i would go for something that helps my tankin the end the cyclone has worse dps but its utility is greater than the cane oh and dont forget your larger drone bay ewar dronessee what i mean the cyclone has uses you just have to work a little harder to figure those uses outbtw as i suggested you all check the slot amount for each tier1 bc i thought i should tell you themhighturretmissilemediumlowprophecy 76136  16ferox 76554  16brutix 77045  16cyclone 85354  17so even ccp figured the cyclone was bad several times and has buffed it even past the othersit was originally 85344

nice idea
so if someone convos me i am subject to this hail message first or i get the option to read the hail without opening the convoim just wondering because you know people would grief the crap out of players if they are subjected to this hail message without the option to block that first
sounds reasonablewould be nice to see a convo invite with a short message indicating the purpose since half the time i get convos from random people and i have no clue why as im not shooting them and they arent on local so i usually just decline them assuming they arent worth my time
abusive messaging is already something you can petition i assume this would be a short message that displays in the convo request window
i suspect this is going to increase petition traffic to an all time highnot supportedwhy this is likening to a new form of spam by hail messages one liner insults and quipsgood idea good intention but i see bad things coming of this
good suggestion i can see how this would be useful
cant see why not
whilst not terribly important a lot of information is being posted in regards to wormholes and they currently do not have a thread to post all of this in missions  complexs market discussions etc would seem fit to move all the information to a wormhole discussion thread
true but this is not the place at all
im not sure a new forum is worthwhile but perhaps relabeling the existing ones to clarify it would be worthwhile
i cant imagine any situation where this would be useful
well its a minor issue iteron cargo has a couple thousand less space than container so when im transferring ore from miner to it i put the amount my iteron can hold say container has 24000m3 i mined 4000m3 then i would transfer 1269m3 to container i know there are important issues to fix and tis is something minor but last time they fixed something about grammar so i know they pay attention to detail and every detail is important perhaps if u right now think u wouldnt use this option just abstain of voting on this say no if you think something negative would come out of this not just because u think its not useful for yourself thank you
i can like when if when i shot someone i get to pick how much volume of antimatter out of my cargo bay to use could this be done suredoes it need to be nodont get discourage just think about bigger issues or something to really enhance gameplay or something
no fit cargo rigs
just learn how to do the math man its not hardie if one ore unit uses 01m3 and you can carry 3000m3 then you can hold 300001 units of ore so 30000 unitshow hard is it to remember one numbernot supported
while it is laughable that a small fly can lock down a carrier 10 times its size or a titan 100 times its sizei dont see this being a part of the solutionive always said i want capitals and super capitals to have inherent warp scramble strengthsuch as ranging from carrier 1 to titan 3up to ccp to make this whole ordeal less laughable p
it used to work that way hence why it was changed to the current system
so what youre saying is that an outlaw gets to join a pirate faction pay a fee to operate freely in highsec and gank anyone in a mission corp that is never going to happen good idea or bad

im a pirate and i think its a stoopid idea good pirates have no need to be in highsec for their targets
can you incorporate the following into your proposalprevent players from barging in on another players client to barge in ie start conversation a player would have to have explicit permission from the player or a minimum standing level at leastthanks
having the name linked ready to be checked would make it easier than looking the person up but this is hardly an issue that need to be addressedthumbs down for wasting programing time when it could be better utilized in other ares

this was already raised passed and agreed to by ccp
and yet its still not implemented so time for an update
something i proposed a short while ago is related to that issue scripted flypath its related but somewhat completely opposite being able to manually automatise sic flight beyond the usual orbit and approach
i for one hope the develop something useful instead of this walking in stations thing like the planetary colonies they promised us err 2006 or was it 2005 i cant remember anymore
missions are ok probing for hidden dedspaces are ok it just lack of nice items to be found ive seen mission rats loosing more and more nice items and i dont even bother to salvage guristas and serpentis no more only angels blood raiders drone bs and sansha more and more wrecks are taged as empty while ratting in 00 i can see now where the good loot and salvage went wormholes are ok too but you will get tired after a while and you need masses of skills as well to build t3 isk to earn by create t3 ships yes and fun to make i have all the needed skills but i dont probe myselfthere is no good to make more missions if loot and salvage decreases when new patches are released maybe ccp want us high secer to roam 00 or even join 00 alliances eve is much about pvp yes but as long as pve is a major part of the gameplay ccp should consider to give back mission rats these nice t1 loot and salvage items what about adding some fierce commanders they who drop faction stuffs and t2 implants as well as part of killing main bossesi sometimes find better drop from commanders in 07 than running high lvl missions something is wrongwhat ccp could do is to add an agent bureau where player owned stations in 00 can hire agents to the stations lvl 1 to lvl 5 agents maybe its the way to go if ccp really want players to leave high sec and join 00 because not every player want to pvp some want also to do missions to fill the wallet after loosing some ships on the pvp battfield cheerssm
i approve of this message
i personally cant be asked to salvage the time i spend salvaging i could have pwnt another missionwould i make more profit by salavaging everything before moving on i dont know but it sure is a hell of a lot more fun than salvaging and that is what is important to meif people want to warp to my mission to feed of the crumbs i let fall to the floor from the table so be itthe current mechanic is working just fine in my opinion

supportedafs definitely deserve 4th bonuses theres hardly any reason why they should not have it some of the ships bonuses need careful thinking though one example being the harpy if you want to boost its sniping prowess with damage bonus it will start to seriously melt faces with blasters too tracking bonus will also make it an enyo with bigger buffer shield regen and faster speed should the enyo sport 400mm and even with 200mm harpy seems to have 1ms faster speed with ab oh and it will also have a longer optimal range meaning that with careful piloting you can keep the hit quality bonus of optimal range while enyo will drop to falloffi like many of the ideas posted here except things that force the ships to specialize a lot like bonuses to scramblerdisruptor range for the jaguar i want to keep my acsin case you are not very interested about the jaguarminmatar in general or the enyo im afraid theres nothing else here for you to read others please continue as a jaguar pilot id definitely want to see a tracking bonus even though as i use 125mm my tracking tends to be pretty much just whats needed when using orbit 500m with ab the range tends to be around 16002000 meters and transversal around 04 and the 125mms tracking is almost 05 but it would still help when dealing with the drone cruisers making them atleast a little bit easier to tackle for a while untill help arrivesenyo definitely needs something too to make it something else than an assault ship for dronechallenged gallente pilots do take into account though that the enyos optimalfalloff is about the same as the jaguars currently both almost reaching to overloaded scramblers range what this means is that should the falloff bonus be added enyo would become a hmm a rather hard opponent for the jaguar as a user of an active tanked jaguar i feel that there might still be a chance to beat the enyo though but im afraid almost everyone uses the 2xmse setup  jaguar can still outrun an afterburner enyo though and mwddisruptor setup is quite hard to support with already heavily capdependant ship not that i have any field experience with enyo other than a few fights against itand please please swap the bonuses between wolf and jaguar or atleast give the jag falloff and let the wolf keep falloff bonus as well sorry arty users but i have my reasons that ill state next as the thrashers already an insanely effective small arty platfrom and optimal bonus is totally worthless with acs on the jaguar there arent too many reasons for the optimal bonus on the jag in the first place sure it can tank better than a destroyer with smaller sig radius against people shooting with bigger guns from far away sure its faster while still less agile than the thrasher but what happens when you are caught by a fast close range tackler you have a very expensive for a frig ship that deals a fraction of the destroyers damage while tanking only a little bit better than said destroyer what this means is that the arty jaguar is worse in just about everything except tanking sniper battleships and such on top of that you have the lovely price difference that a thrasher and a jaguar have currently it really feels like the jaguar is a t2 ship with only 2 bonuses which is ridiculous thankfully though its still quite awesomesorry about the long post im very enthusiastic about the jag i hope atleast some of you had the endurance to read the whole wall of text

if we supposedly didnt have any big hitters than how does a 25 man gang run from my 8 man bs gang how does an entire alliance your alliance take 30mins to formulate a strategy on how they are going to attack my battle hauler gang that was meant to get you guys to actually undock from jita it must feel comforting to see comments such as  that im not getting killed by a badger i dont believe that lousy pilots can instill that type of fear on anyone without commanding some type of respect in terms of skill were doing something right unless whats been happening the past week has been a complete mirage granted we were in your alliance for 2 months i personally never wanted my corp to join but at the time it was the best choice we had for pvp am i grateful of course id be a scumbag if i said no am i happy im no longer in it im sure you know the answer to that oneyou made this thread about neutral remote reps but your alliance is widely using the tactic want to help put a stop to it enforce a rule against its use within your alliance sure you no longer can fight fire with fire but there are other ways that you can legitimately counter these tactics you really need to chill out on bashing my corp you do not have the slightest clue what we had to go through to get to where we are
the reason changing this mechanic would be a bad idea is because it would make it significantly harder to combat enemy fleets of a larger size and make people less likely to fight at all which is never a good thing specifically it will just mean that the bigger blob will be station camping the smaller group and the smaller group will have no chance of breaking the camp until it breaks up itself im not saying that a small gang should be able to go after a large fleet however if the large fleet doesnt have their sht together and work as a team to keep their squishier ships alive then hell yes they deserve to dieon the other hand your base argument is that remote rep is currently overpowered which is a much more reasonable argument than the one that a major mechanic in eve should be changed because you lost a couple ships to be people who know what theyre doing should people agree with your argument then you could argue that rr needs a nerf which is again a reasonable argumentthe problem is the proposed solution it just wouldnt help things if you want to nerf remote rep why not talk about a boost in fitting requirements a nerf to range or some similar rebalancemake a coherent argument as to why anything should be changed and youll find people are a lot more responsive so far all ive heard is lol u pussies used neutral rr when we blobbed u on station and managed to kill a couple of us clrly you fail at life and we should change a major game mechanic 2 benefit mah griefin alliance also bches aint sht am i missing any of your major points
did you even read the op this is a aggro mechanics issue not a rr power one rr should give you the agression counter same as attacking this is a problem everywhere its just more prevalent in empire station games
we use this tactic because others do we want to change the mechanics so it provides a fairer fight sure if the enemy fleet brings remote reps then thats fine but so long as they cannot dockrepair and return within 30 seconds thats what the topic is about theres no point shooting ourselves in the foot by stopping our own remote rep because then it automatically puts us at a disadvantageand i dont mean to be picky but to be fair bsg did start this and was really asking for it
so wait are you wanting a change to this mechanic or not please stick on topic as this is for either supporting the claim to give aggression to remote repairs or for looking at why it shouldnt your post was just a plain bash against us as said before why should we shoot ourselves in the foot by not abusing a mechanic which everyone seems to abuse and your great fleet set ups would have had a remote rep or two and so u could have abused the mechanic as wellpitboss is only one man and atm in control of a corp with 166 members he is not on all the time and therefore has no control over who does and doesnt use remote reps that figure count is only for his corp the alliance holds even more people which he is not incharge with so your asking a train to fly here if someone does not want to loose a ship then he will remote rep and what really can he do about itfrom my experience with bsg in that fight i am guessing you either lost a ship or something didnt go right for you since the last ship u lost at jita you took one hell of a rage cause u engaged without confirmed support and lost tho to be fair u did calm down after a while and apologized which is always goodplease try to keep on topic start a flame topic elsewhere and we shall have our monkeys get on the problem as soon as we teach them to read
ok two things here1 tfs wasnt using neutral remote reps and your in corpalliance pilots already outnumbered us that makes you as guilty of abusing the game mechanic as the next bloke2 i pointed the above out as hypocrisy because it is that wasnt an open license to personally attack me as a woman that from pitboss just goes to show his general disrespect for women and his obvious issues regarding women in general it had nothing whatsoever to do with the debate over neutral reppingthe fact that pitboss and the privateer alt commenting below him needed to throw themselves in the gutter with personal attacks on an out of game level goes to show the type of mentality immaturity and general lack of integrity privateer alliance is full of as much as pitboss would like to think he is widely respected in this game and on the forums i think he just pretty much lost respect with a great deal of people in one emo raging omg a woman has peed on my game experience and shown my alliance up for the hypocrites we really are statement
you know i had to go and find what igs was and i really dont see the resemblance between my comment of u attacking us and wizards and fairies do u play the right gamewell thats what theorys are there for possibilities yet to be proved wrongyes we used 4 remote reps so what is the problem when we fight people use them on us so we are allowed to use them on other people and i thought u would have known 0 casualties are better than 1 so it was smart of them to ensure they had some back upand no there is no lead by example this is a game if u lead by example u only reduce the chance of you winning the only way to get this changed if more and more people abuse this then it will be changed i ned to ask is this like a subtle attempt at weakening our fleets you cry because we use rr and then u hope for us to stop which then u bring in your own rr theres an other theory u can blow out of the water
kailen just post from pb  unless you guys went to the same school of caps lock its pretty obvious that kailens your alt palso any comments on my argument that this would kill the ability to fight against blobs
i am not a pb alt and my caps were only to high light that this discussion is about the aggression countdown not remote repairing itselfas to your thoughts on the blobs i would say theres both a yes and no answer not everyone wants to use remote reps so i would say they would be limited in fleets with only one or two people using them so the smaller fleet needs to concentrate fire and use ecm to disrupt the larger fleets main dpsers but generally the larger fleet would win just due to superior numbers the absence of the aggression countdown would greatly help the smaller fleet but it is not fair from the larger fleets side a 290k tanked ship with reps will survive for a good while before needing to redock so while the larger fleet concentrates dps on that repper it just redocks and repairs only for them to have to do it again and any good repper will have eccm so its wasting a lot of the fighting time for the larger fleet just for the smaller fleet to get some lucky kills when the larger fleet has to concentrate on a heavily defended targetso yes this nerf would cause people to become more inventive when it comes to dealing with larger blobs but i dont think it would kill it off it would just remove the easy way out you still have ecm and other methods of disrupting larger fleets
hey guys lets keep on topic thread cleaned of offtopic and trolling
alright so if this is the only way small fleets can kill large blobs maybe the issue isnt that this shouldnt be fixed because its obvious that it doesthe fact of the matter is a new way for small fleets to combat large fleets needs to be proposedas i said before you cant be neutral and help someone in a fight that puts you on a sideirl if someone were to bring painkillers to a fist fight that person would become part of the fightinstead of all of this trolling and whining about people fixing an exploit thats the only way for small blobs to beat big blobs then the issue isnt that the exploit doesnt need to be fixed something else needs to be doneexploits  tacticsits like saying prenano nerf using nanos was a tactic no it was an exploit that if not taken advantage of wouldve made your ship useless at the time
to be honest its not hard to counter rr as is hell probably 10 of my last 15 kills have been people who brought it neutral remote reppers and thats really not an exaggeration as you said the counters to rr are primarily dps and ecm both of which are highly effective when used correctly a lot of it is knowing your enemy and in most cases if you have a blob of gank ships you should be able to outdps remote reps unless the people youre fighting bring their own blob of logistics hell my most recent kill had 2 logistics alts repping him and was tanked for gallente and just 2 of us still managed to pop him before he could redock not to mention he had a pretty nasty active tank on the thing probably around 900 dps tank without rr its possible it just forces a bit more creativity in your fleet composition
yes to both of the top two fights when repping it brings you into the fight and puts you on to a side so let this continue but give the reppers an aggression countdown so they stay in the fighti am perfectly fine with people repping i just dont like reppers being able to instadock repair and come out again in a matter of 30 seconds while the main targets own tank has held and he can continue his repping workthats what this topic is about its not about criticizing spelling or abusing the reppers for wanting to get into a fight its about keeping them in the fight so they can pay for their decision either with death or a pat on the back depending on who wins
exactly thisneutral means not picking sidesrepping someone means picking that persons sidethe only way at all to justify no aggression is if there was some super lame forced mechanic that split your rep to every ship in range allowing the one without the neut repper on their side to just move in range to steal some of the rep but how lameunrealistic would that becurrent mechanic is illogical
facepalmand repping means the opposing force has the right to engage the repperit means the repper is no longer neutral because he is red on your overviewhowever the repper has not committed an aggressive act therefore he is able to dock at willyou could always not fight on a station
it is still very much so indirect aggressionyoure helping someone else aggress a target better than they could without your helpjust as everyone against this proposal says eve is a dangerous place get over it  eve is a dangerous place that means its dangerous for logistics aswell for every action there is a consequence so far logistics near stations dont have any real consequences and are invulnerable to attack due to instadocking for free there is no reason being outside a station should be a safespot for anyoneif you want safety dont undock camping the dock to help a buddy then docking once you take damage is an exploit not a tactic
1 does the combatant gain an advantage by having a neutral perform remote repping i would say yes the aggressor is being boosted and will be harder to kill2 should the remote repper be considered a neutral once they start to support a ship that is actively engaged i think its safe to say that if you are an active participant then you are not neutral 3 if youre an active participant and therefore no longer a neutral should there be a consequence ccp you decidesomewhere in a war torn land rlenemy combatants are engaging one of my squads and intend to kill as many of my men as possible out of the corner of my eye i see two adult males that appear to be resupplying class v ammo to the enemy i call the squad leader that is closest to the suspected resupply effort and ask him to confirm what they are doing he informs me that the men ive identified as conducting the resupply are in fact delivering ammo to the enemy soldiers the men ive identified are not armed and have not engaged my soldiers but since they are actively supporting enemy soldiers they are no longer neutral for those that do not understand why ive declared them hostile without ammo the enemy soldiers are no longer a threat or not as much of a threat by eliminating their source of ammo i can win the engagement or improve my chances of winning the engagement killing the two males that are resupplying them with ammo seems to be a logical and acceptable course of action
pitboss sad man sad i had told myself i couldnt be bothered to post in this crap but i just cant help itsince youve been around so long 5 years you should remember when it was adapt or die with the other alternative being stfu in evenow its the above 2 with an overwhelming addition of emo whine on the forums for changea little backstory for those just joining46 of us shut down the privateer alliance in jita for basically 2 weeks honestly when you redecd us for another week i almost pied myself laughing youre rant is we had neutral rr and rr is overpowered etc dude seriously if you cant figure out how to defeat 46 generally less of us with 12 rr guys helping youre doing it wrong and need to emo rage quit now can i have your stuffs and put it to proper userr isnt broken anyone can do it its cheap its effective its about the only counter to blobshuge station camps since nano and ecm took a hit you shouldnt be rallying support to get rr changed you should be figuring out how a small group could put that much hurt on your alliance with so little effortneutral rr is the same as a nonneutral rr same rules etc same limitations only difference is that the 1st time or maybe 2 if youre really not paying attention you can suprise someone pitboss me doing 50 kills in just those 2 weeks to your alliance isnt an rrs suprised us its a you fail we had the same group the same guys etc nothing changed we fight against rr on a daily basis its simple to counter if you know what youre doing and id be glad to help you guys out with a remedial class on watching who reps who what they fit what they use and counter it one size does not fit all and 1 tactic sure as h3ll doesnt always work except rr against you guys apparentlylet me give you a little taste of what will happen if they add an aggression counter to rr like you are whining about since i doubt youve thought that far ahead stabs pitboss lotsa stabs sit there rr align out warp rinse and repeat and no you guys dont use hics for crap so dont even use that argument btw you can warp out and back as fast or faster then docking and undocking  jita 44 weve tested youll still fail youll still whine and all people will have to do is change a couple of mods and tactics a bit tbh i could care less if you succeed in nerfing rradding an aggro timer since ill just change what i do againomg falcons are wtf pwn omg nano is wtf pwn omg wtf rr is wtf pwn whiners need to whine whining about a tactic because you are too dumb to counter it is sad but its the way eve is going all hail the age of emo whiners expansion
also clarification for rr etc in highsec1 if you help a person in any way that is being attacked or at war you are automatically flagged to those peoplecorpsalliancesthis can be rr remote rep energy transfer tracking links logi drones sensor links anything that helps that ship once that happens you are fair game to be shot and killed by anyone that was fighting the guy you helped ie you are a valid targetbeing neutral only helps you as i said above the 1st or if the privateers 2nd through 50th time to suprise your enemy all the same rules etc then applydiscuss
is it possible to get an update on thisthanks
it would be very cool to have something like that but a barrage of them would be a little too crazy me thinks also there is another problem missiles of all kinds fire from only one point on your ship and hit only one point on their ship so they follow one straight line when flying if u wanted something like a barrage then u would need to equipped 6 rocket launchers to a raven and fire them all but ccp would need to have individual launcher points on each ship the same as turrets so when all are fired they leave the ship at different points and they should hit different parts of the enemy ship making barrages look cooler as 6 rockets other another missile are fired and follow different paths so u see the 6 travel and hit the targets ship
agreed boost rockets so they are effective against frigates

i support this
npcs in general need a kick up the arse
supported  npcs are currently unbalanced a vigil shouldnt be able to speed tank every single amarr plex
i agree
oh hey i should read this forum more often agreed as to ops suggestion
agreed
have to support this as the npcs in plexes do need an overhaul the caldari ecm npcs are particularly noxious in a closed system like fw where you have no choice as to which type of npc you face its one thing to face jamming npcs in venal when you are ratting quite another when they are the enemy you must face in a given form of gameplaythe speedtanking issue is also a problem in my opinion its strongly related to the need to ensure that plexes that allow in larger classes should make the use of those larger classes strongly desirablecosmo
fair enough you dont support it but youre misrepresenting the concept quite a bitfirst the against force can suffer faction hits if necessary thats a balancing decision for ccp i neither rule them out nor recommend them because i leave that to ccp to decide in terms of the weighting of itsecond the against force cant just roam around the highsec of the chosen enemy at will the restriction on them is as much as is on the minmatar militia in the highsec of the empire they have chosen to oppose i say this clearlythis is not just a mass war declaration in disguisefurther the barriers to entry can be financial as well as standings if ccp deems it necessary i dont rule it out or recommend it one way or the other for reasons the same as i explain above please dont interpret silence on a particular point as one thing or the othernow others complain about neutrals in fw well plenty of militia corps constantly complain about the issue but as long as standard war decs remain possible and despite the complaints they always will unless ccp want to totally break faith with the rest of the eve player base and insulate fw completely it wont go awaysome say that the element of the ally power not being hostile ie its forces not being war targets and its space being unrestricted by npcs etc is a problemwell that can be looked at as a single element of the proposal by ccp in consideration of balance there are pros and cons the intention at root is to limit the scope of the against declaration it forces a third force to choose if you allow the ally power to be effective both through npcs and its militia pilots then you also i would submit in all fairness have to allow the third force to be effective against its facilities ie plexesthe question there is whether that broad an against entry is actually desirable that means any balancing in terms of standings isk commitment declaration periods cooldowns and so forth that ccp introduce are fairly moot when it comes to the third force being able to rapidly switch its focus to operations against the other power i do leave that up to ccp when it comes down to it but i think it removes some of the overall attractiveness of the concept in both design and rp termsincidentally a further point with regard to rodjs question as to why anyone would want to be in the militias with this option on the table well i did answer it and i think satisfactorily but ccps latest proposals on rewards add to my answer even more sothirdforces that is against fw participants would not be eligible for lps or other rewards that full militia members would be eligible for an important element of making basic militia membership attractive while the against option remains useful for mercenaries freebooters alliances etcincidentally i do realise that a basic philsophical difference exists between me and those who think fw is merely transitional play and cant be an end in itself in my view that notion is antieve i think it is why fw is regarded with disdain by many if fw is to be a valid endgame option which it should be like any other gameplay in eve then wider participation and more options for participation are importanti can only claim my interest is primarily in the health of fw and not my own narrow interests i say it pro forma for the record as its been raisedcosmo
hi cosmoi like the general idea but i do not like the restrictions on who can shoot at what ship that stays in place i hate the current mechanic where a fw fleet is roaming consisting of players from several corporations and only some of these are deckedif we allow these third parties into the conflict then they should become valid targets to other third parties whenever there is a fight going oni thus do not support your suggestion as it currently standshow about the followingif your corporation or alliance has wardecced a fw factionin enemy high sec faction navy of wardecced faction will attack you on entering system when you aggress an enemy faction pilot you will go flashy any pilot from any corpalliance can now shoot you without a sechit or gate guns you get gate guns you do not get a concord sec hit for attacking enemy faction pilotin enemy low sec when you aggress an enemy faction pilot you will go flashy any pilot from any corpalliance can now shoot you without a sechit or gate guns you get gate guns you do not get a sec hitin neutral low sec when you aggress an enemy faction pilot you will go flashy any pilot can not shoot you without a sechit or gate guns you do not get gate guns on you you do not get a sec hit
i dont support gate gun fire automatic or otherwise on people who are in a concord warfw war type state with respect to othersgate guns are not intended to give people home advantage especially not in lowsec but not in highsec either in my view thats what the npcs that spawn in highsec against enemy pilots are fori also dont see why any pilot from any corpalliance can now shoot you without a sechit or gate guns is a valid or balanced suggestion to make about people who are engaged in a concordfwtype war in any type of spaceyour proposals amount to almost totally removing the point of a concordfw war state the effect in practice of this would be counter to the whole point of my proposalthanks for the input but ill stick with the basic principles of my proposalcosmo
this is debatable from my point of view but i though it would be nice to make lowsec system captures mean something realthat aggression rule is not ideal especially in highly populates systems but without it one would always be better off in third party corp then in a real militia since the militia ships will be primary in mixed engagementsexampleteam gallenteanticaldari corps 5 shipsgallente militia 5 shipsteam caldariantigallente corps 5 shipscaldari militia 5 shipssince the anti corporations can not shoot at eachother since they are not at war the militia ships on both teams will be called primary until all the fw ships are down
definitely not supportedi have read quite a bit of the thread and someone else mentioned this but i see no real downside for being a third party participantbreakdown benefitsmilitia you are declaring against has to worry about 2 opposiing militiasany third party forces you have to worry about the militia you are declaring againstso right off militia members have to worry about 2 parties  all third party participants and all the third party participants only have to worry about 1 opposing forcethere is absolutely no reason for a corp to join the militia when it can limit the amount of people that can legally shoot it simply by going with the third party route i dont think any standing hurdle would justify this
well ships have max concurrent operation users rightwhy not use that as a baseline for max docking must be in fleet 
which is precisely why i cant support this ship logistics are already too easy without making them even more so if anything they need a nerf imo but thats another discussionben
you seem to be saying your carrier has room for 2 bs but not for 2 pilots thats a bit ludicrous not a huge fan of rp but someone ought to justify that in context before just saying nope cant have more people in your giant shipin any case i support this idea as long as there is a fitting requirement and preferably one that makes the mothervessel more vulnerable somehow it could be a powerful change so it probably deserves something of a tradeoff
how many ships you can move doesnt change you just get the ability to move the pilot aswell
supportedi like this idea its useful and adds a bit more hmm to the game and may also lead onto walk in carriers which would be great
i love the idea in fact when i first started playing eve this is exactly how i thought carriers did work i can see this working extremely well even with current game mechanics you fly you ship to the carrier in space right click select dock carrier pilot accepts session change and you load into a station type screen perhaps ccp could create cool carrier docking bay screens one for each race or simply use the screens already in game docked players are removed from local and also cannot see local they have access to a fitting screen and the corp hangar depending on roles as they would in a normal station pilots should also be able to change ships within the carrier pending the ships are in a corp hangar tab they have access tothey would undock as they would normally with a confirmation required from the carrier pilot the only drawback i can see this having is it has the potential to reduce 00 traffic and subsequently spontaneous pvp in border systems due to many people taxiing along with a carrier pilot for simple empire runs to check markets buy bpos skillbooks etc
not supportingi think im going to by default say no to the majority of yaays postscan i get an amen for that  o pnothing personal yaaybut your really turning into a paranoiadelusional some such or anotherlets face it how can this so called rig patch be that badcheaper rigs for small ships frigate pilots can now afford to put rigs inand still have the option for larger rigs if i read the patch notes rightdont you think your just jumping the gun a wee bit
how is adding 3 more slots which could have countless diffreent fittings each making pvp more cookie cutterif anything pvp fittings were cookie cutter even more so than now nobody rigs frigates unless theyre stupid and have too much isk now its possible i like the rig changes it adds more diversity to the game screw you all who have enough isk to stupidly rig your frigates and dont want me to be able to
im seeing several major points in the op and ill address each in its own sectionlarge rig prices will decrease drastically the current lack of understanding of market pricipals buffles me to be quite honest rigs atm are a niche market  increase for rig demand more people buying small and medium rigs cause they are finally logical to use  increase for salvage material prices and better prices for the less used materials  equal or higher rig pricesgain vs loss read the rig description  on most rigs you gain something and lose something in return for example armor rigs increase armor relate stuff but decrease speed price is another factor but isnt the main issue at hand so allowing the use of rigs on frigscruisers will not remove the win vs loss equation but rather make it more reasonableloss of diversity  diversity and cookie cutter fits are very rarely influenced by rigs i could fly a buffer tank cane or a repper cane or even a nano cane  and the rig prices will have little effect on that however being able to rig it reasonable might might ill use more t2 frigs over using battleships which means more diversity rather than less if a rig that was nay affordable before make my nano or other less common fit much more reasonable it will only increase the sightings of such fitssmaller rigs would be smaller bonuses for less cost im starting to doubt your intelligence level here this is exactly what is going to happen let me teach you a simple truth about about math  10 increase for 1k armor is less that 10 increase on 10k armor same for any other number will a 1k increase in speed mean my frig will be able to speed tank more effectively if im going over 3k either way not very likely will it mean ill get the tackle on people far away or on faster ceptoretc more often pretty likelyeverything will be rigged now  rigs meaning nothing argument thats actually pretty cool imo will that mean all frigs will be rigged almost def will it change anything in frig vs frig fights not noticeably and def not more than fitting and ammo choices will will we see frigs being more effective as a ship group idk but i think that is more than likely  same for cruisers and bcs and it will allow for much specialization in niches meaning the big bad bs owning everything myth will be much less prevalent also will that mean that rigs will have no more umph factor no cause we still have t2 rigs that will cost 40mil or so for med and 56mil for small thats just guessing though i think its gonna be much higher still more on the factor of 23 decrease per size group rather than the 8 decrease for t1 rigs and will still allow the concept of bang for buck fittings also this will increase the use of t2 rigs on non mission or faction ships which imo might reduce the omg its faction and t2 fitted factor but will make it more of a real t2 rig and less of a t2 but more like faction rig in conclusion will this rig change have its problems more than likely will this change lead to some balance issues prob is it more reasonable than only using rigs on t2 ships and bsbcs yespsdoes this post have too many of the is my mom a  more than likely type sentences yes but i still like them edited for legibility
supported  a small rig should have a significantly smaller effect than a large  perhaps 14 15 or even 16 or so with a correspondingly lower price
rigs do they are percentage baseda trimark on a mega adds far more 2000ehp unfitted vs 80 than on a punisher not supporting this topic
whats the point of a rig that gives a 15 bonus to a frigate who would bother with such a worthless item
nopethis the basis of your entire thread is not correctthey have drawbacks for a reason they were intended to be used to specialize your ship for a specific role allowing for more different roles its also the reason why t2 has less rig slots than t1 since t2 already is a specialized version of t1so yes were getting cheaper ways to fit smaller ships this will open up rigging for smaller hulls too especially t1 hulls where it previously didnt make a lot of sense since the same rig would be better spent on a larger hull insteadin conclusion there will be cost effective means to specialize t1 frigates in the future this is great news for everyone who loves to fly small hullsby the way im not getting why smaller rigs should be less effective the bonuses are already percentual its not like we had a rig that gave you a flat 500pg which would be hilariously overpowered on small hulls
thats an additional 15 of survivability seconds count in this gamefor you to call that worthless is nothing short of laughablecourse im not supporting this thread by answering that statement or reenforcing it only that im stating a fact that people will use these worthless rigs to get that extra edge even if its a very small edgesmall edges win the game these days
son stay off the drugs
in my opinion youre missing the whole point rigs are made up out of junk you gather from wrecks theyre not so hi tech or shiny i think its more like assembling selfmade turbo on your toyota corolla mark ii makes your car do some noise maybe burn some rubber on wet concrete too on good day then engine blows upi think some rigs should have more hilariuos side effects though
ccp has got a good idea going with this proposed change to rigs the only problem is that many people with existing well researched rig blueprints are going to get the short end of the stick when all of their existing blueprints become large rig blueprints by defaultfor example those with control capacitor circuit blueprints can rest easy as those are popular rigs for ravens however people possessing gravity capacitor upgrade blueprints are out of luck as there are probably few if any who would want to put those rigs onto large ships it would be nice if after the change there would be a way a player could convert existing and now large rig blueprints into small or medium rig blueprints at the owners discretion
uhhhhhhh thats why we use percentages in evewith bigger ships you get more effect and in smaller ships you get less effect cause of smaller hp damage etc
this actually makes sense im not sure how this patch is going to change wealth envy much seems like a lot of fluff without a lot of content
supportedthese expensive rigs can clear the dirt between the good and great pilots you say it doesnt make a difference but i am sure it does small may it be but that small difference can change everything in a fight
pvp isnt expensive but it isnt cheap either how about doing some isk making work to pay for your play time dont whine to ccp and demand cheap pvpyou want to minmax you should have to pay dearly for itotherwise get in a rookie ship and go to a starter systemhighly supported to opedit for typo and to add thisthe casuals whining for free epics have come to eve
yeah i support this argument i do not think this is a good idea for the balance of the game frigates already have good advantages over their bigger siblings and really the upgrades are the reason why you move into t2 class ships
well the idea is not to give the miners weapon to defend of every pvp pilot the idea is to give them some tools to make the fight a little bit more eventhe only defence a miner have today is a few drones even the drones is not much help since you can only have 5 active small drones or an mixed of medium and small drones which we all know is crap setup to have or god forbid a single sentrylarge droneanother problem which i belive this idea will help is that there is few pilot in low sec and way to many in high secso how to get pilots out from high sec and into low sec and finally to the life of nullspacewell introduce them gently into the environment give them some equipment so that they can defend them self once they can see that they can defende them self without to much losses they will begin to get more and more friends outand at one point it could be that high sec will be for noobs except jita and other major tradehubs lowsec for some experient pilots and nullsec for the eliteplayers or pilots that shouldnt be there but is there anywayso for that reason i fully support this great ideafor us pvp there is also a nice addition i can think about alot of nice tactical situation where even we can have use of these gunsi would love to have a couple in my hangar and have them deployed in mining belts for some nice target to take out d
ccp messing with the market is bad you not being able to pay for a ship means your loss if the price gets too high then it will go back down because other people will stop paying for them also capitalism is such a wonderful thingoh not supported
hopefully the costeffectiveness issue will be fixed when insurance is overhauled hacs are not too expensive fly t1 cruisers if hacs cost too much thats what they exist for
considering the sheer amount of sniping hac gangs ive run into im fairly sure that they are cheap enough
ccp adjusting build cost wouldnt be messing with the market it would be balancing nothing wrong with thathowever while i am going to press the support button i dont think they should change the build requirements of hacs they should fix alchemymoon mining in general to get supply and demand into balance again the hac prices are just an indicator that something else is wrong atmright now there isnt even a healthy supplydemand relation simply because supply is fixed the ammount of people able to use t2 stuff increases so the demand for the moon materials increases however the production of high end moon stuff is completely fixed even if i would pay 100 times the price that it is going for now the total supply of them wouldnt change anything since it is allready maxed
changing material costs for hacs wont change anything unless they remove desp need  it will only make owners of r64s richer when supply is cornered suppliers can demand any price that the market will pay  and if people are still buying hacs at 150mil changing anything wont matter this isnt like the t3 change where you have tons of people supplying materials for production  you have limited r64s and most of them are owned by several big alliances who are usually together add to that the fact that trade isnt as simple as reducing production costs  reduced price tag as people can play the market as they pleasetldr version  ccp can try and  with the market but unless consumers stop being willing to pay 150mil per hac or whatever prices will not change and for that to happen people will have to create big buyers groups that will say no to high prices but that will never happen cause people are stupid and usually follow the herd mentality anyhowso no not supported at all but please when you do buy that hac finally please faction fit it and come to lowsec  i could use a nice ransom
i cant see the sense in this argument i think its because its not an argument after all but some kind of whine you have no money because1 youre lazy to make some2 what you make you rapidly go to get it poppedwith the same effort and logic you should propose that carriers with fighters and stuff and skills too yes should be not more then 123million isk because you just have that amount so what dont buy any m8 you dont have to 123mill is good for approx 100 rifters with okish fittings so you can do a lot of pvp go with itthe price for hacs is just fine they give you approx the same tank as a good bs with real good sensors locking time mobility and at the same time they can put out quite decent dmg and until peepz buy it for 160mil the price will not and shouldnt changeno support
so the problem are the alliances that are holding the r64 moons i wonder why that problem keeps popping up everywere ow wait maybe its time to revieuw that that brings me to alliance cost to run space for noobs yes pos fuel  jb cost isk to run and defend space properly u need sov that sounds fimiliar ccp is going to change the sov system end of this year so maybe in a year or 2 the op gets his way after the sov revieuw after r64s distrubution revieuw  probaly after some l4 mission boostslike i always say cheap ship is dead ship i always spend atleast 250m on my hacs if i pimp them with faction they need that love with recons the same they need faction to be flown properly in a pvp way not a blobfest there u need ty t1 cruisers for
nothere is no problem prices are a factor of supply and demand and people playing with said supply and demand in order to artificially raise moon mineral prices also since the moon mining dupe bug was fixed there are less minerals on the market  more demand  higher prices now ofc the mineral prices might be too high for reason  but again its not about alliances or sov its all about what people will or wont be willing to payso basically if you have a problem with the prices of hacs or moon minerals dont pay it if enough people are not willing to pay prices will go down but like ive said  since people are stupid its more than likely that people will still pay todays prices for the next 23 months
get out seriously you think things are bad at the moment i remember paying 300 mil for my first vaga and i had to travel across 3 regions to find on on the marketkids today dont know theyre bornwith no big wars on at the moment prices should stabilisecost effectiveness is in the eye of the beholder to some people a diemost is obviously worth 160 mil because people are still buying them at that price
we all know the problem is r64 moons it always hasits about damn time ccp did something about it its been going on for far too long00 space  if dont have an r64 moon oeps sorry youre dead cause 1 r64 moon will give more income than the tax of 500 players
the only problem is with balance between moon materials in production should the other two r64 be balanced like prom  dysp in usage the prices would stabilize a bit lower but not droping too much so its meaningless that and fixing damn alchemy allreadyanyway is a matter of how spread wants t2 to be maybe they are actually not that bad with it reaching such prices as it was too wide spread but raising the issue to know what are the thoughs of ccp may not be a bad idea at allthere are too much richie rich kiddos who spend too much time at internet spaceships but for the average player according to qen and other devblogs and real data losing a ship which with rigs and t2 fit can reach 200 mill lose is a hard enough hit so what does ccp think about itan other way to go is removing the damn insurance allready on t1 ships for older players say 3 months old suddenlly losing a bs worth 250 mill is not such a vain thing
like i said there are parties that have enough r64s to do this stuff that are responsible for 20 of the dyspo market kuch kuch delve no offence t1 goonies just a example r64s attracts big alliances and once a alliance got enough of them they can manipulate the whole t2 market we all know what happend when delve was sieged the problem is that there arnt enough r64s that are owned by non big alliances u can wonder now should it be able for someone to have a r64 for is onw no deffinaly not but if i look here i see 67 large alliances holding 95 of the r64s of witch 3 own 60 of all the dyspo moons i wonder if there is a real market in r64 mins
actually the issue is with r64 moons but not in the sense that most people assume it is many people assume that every alliance in null space controls a vast swath of r64s and r32s which fuel this massive conspiracy that there is this conglomerate to control the marketthe truth is far more sinisterthe actually truth is that way back in the way back machine when the game was bright and young whatever dev team seeded the original moons did so half drunk and dumb with no sense or rhyme or reason to balanceso in reality we have sections of space are literally overflowing with r16s and r32s seriously its a freaking cadmium fest and then you have sections of space where its nothing but r64s and in some infinite wisdom that i have yet to figure out in my lengthy time here they seeded those r64s according to racial spacewhich would make sense if the actual build requirements and spread were spread according to racial spacebut as we know now they are not only 2 r64s go into the bulk of all production and to make things worse every expansion since a point of time has actually made it worse by bulk copy pasta build requirements see jump freights so that instead of fixing this balance in demand its actually made it worseyou want to fix t2 prices fine just argue from the right platformeither the build requirements change to use the less used r64s some of us have pushed the idea that all industrial t2 items should use the amarr lines instead of gallente or moon locations need to change as well which wouldnt be so bad in of itself either
anyone have any arguments why not
following up on issue 0101050038this was listed as resolved by bane glorious despite no ingame resolution and no resolution listed on the csm resolved pageas this has been an ongoing issue for literally years it would be appropriate for the csm council to actually see this thing through and get ccp to actually make necessary changes as has been suggested over the yearsresolved autocannon issuelocked large projectiletempest thread warning 47 pages longanalysis of training large artilleryadditional known projectile issues1 specific to republic fleet emp ammo noted by kessah why is the damage modifer for rf emp ammo at 525 while the equivilent ammo for gallente gallente navy antimatter and amarr amarr navy multifrequency have their modifiers set at 555 an added point to this both amarr and gallente navy ammo damage is spread across two damage types while emp is spread across three further lowering its damage effectiveness2 per ccp zuluparks rather vague conversation regarding tempests and large projectiles in general it appears that ccp has determined that minmatar ships fight in falloff with the laser weapons buff this essentially places all short range combat in minmatar versus amarr situations at optimal for the amarr using high damage short range ammo while minmatar ships using autocannons using high damage short range ammo are essentially always at optimal range even when at full falloff range for the autocannons3 as mentioned below lasers hybrids and missile systems all have skills that decrease a major disadvantage to those weapons systems controlled bursts affect only lasers and hybrids while rapid launch for example affects only missiles projectile weapons do not get a skill that helps specifically with autocannon disadvantagesedit changed rapid fire to the correct skill rapid launchedit change of titleedit addition of major locked thread
i would also love to understand why there is a skill to reduce the primary drawback of hybrids and lasers yet not such boost exists for projectilescontrolled bursts
one more amazing reason to bring the font back how much cooler and easier to read the map was
support
i love that font
doesnt work very well every time i encounter other languages in eve my winblows system goes berserk on the letteringmac however doesnt break a sweat prob due to language packs or somethingbut seriously i do like that font
the font being unicode and the font being crap difficult to read mainly are two separate thingsthat said an easier to read font would be nice but i dont particularly care for serifs
that is a great image dont forget to edit your post to support the topicthe font was widely used and widely sacked bring it back
honestly i would rather just see a freighter given some sort of option to reconfigure its cargohold into a hangar when you use it to transport goods you cannot access the hangar when you use it to transport ships you cannot access the regular cargo holdthis would save the devs from having to design a completely new ship or even code in a new one and would also prevent from adding to the propagation of more skills that have to be introduced each time a new ship is designedother than that id support the idea
exclude local and any results from a people  places search while were at it and id support itben
cloaky ships are far from invulnerable
standard cloaks  i would support but covert op cloacks should stay as they are
conventional cloaks and cov ops cloack should be scannable although it should take a considerable amount of time for the last onelet me tell you why its become a fairly regular tactic in 00 to take a bunch of recon shipsbombers move to a hostile system and stay there till judgement day you can do nothing about a red recon gang sitting in your backyard thats only 3 hours active per day and afk for the resteven if it takes half an hour to do it  cov ops cloaks should be scannableccp promised us 2 or 3 years ago that they would make noncov ops ships that are using a cloaking device scannable so either it is hard to implement or they quickly disregarded that idea
funny how pvpers and pirates bash on carebears the second they want some aspect of pvp nerfed but that they are the biggest whiners when something affects their own little world ill say what you keep telling carebears when they whine about anything learn how to live with it theres no such thing as free lunch

thisthread
yes this has been stupid for 6 years nowadvanced star ships that can fly a zillion times faster than light but cant stop before they crash into stuff while using thrusters is kinda dumballthough ram option would be needed if approach actually worked as bumping like it or not seems to be part of the game
while your at it make your ship deal damage if traveling faster then 1kms and you ram someone itll give the spearhead on the incursus a use lol
do it
im shooting pos mods right now and at 5km from them its still annoying to find the online ones
yeop
this didnt bother me massively until i started to siege towers but it really needs a solution supported
kinda intersting that it is nearly only goonswarms and goonpets that like this ideai wonder why i would say that they want an easier way to do pos bowlingin my experience this idea is crap and let me explained it1 an experience fleetleader keeps track of which guns have been taken out and which is left to take out2 an experience and good tactical fleetleader tells which target is primary secondary etc3 a good and exeperience dread pilot follows his leaders ordersimsalabim problem is solved in an very easy way without any more coding for ccp todo instead they can spend they hour to implement other features that is needed so badly in evewell that is my 2cent in the matter and i stick to itthumbs down for a bad idea
supporting this although being able to apply filters for incapacitatedonlineoffline mods would make it an even better ideawhat exactly does this idea have to do with pos bowling
this proposal has nothing to do with pos bowling i have no idea where you are getting this from unless youre just trying to be inflammatory per your opening sentence have you done pos warfare the issue is for anyone to easily tell what the stats of pos modules are the fleet commanders job especially should be easier and not bogged down in trying to zoom in on a module for status large artillery battery is primary what there are 6 of them which one yeah that argument fails even if the fc can broadcast the target but then that isnt what you are going for herenot applicable here you ignored the applications the new ui improvement would have for repairing modules too i really do wonder if youve done pos warfare or not
what is the point of giving the option to pick view and take permissions with pos modules to alliance if it does nothingalliance cant view or take yet you have the option to set view and take to allianceits like this whole menu does absolutely nothing at allwith or without permissions some alliance can put stuff in ill get more into the some part in a bitwith or without permissions alliance cantviewtakemanufactureresearchor pretty much anything else youd do with a posand not even all members of alliance can give it seems almost random who canceo of executorwhy is exe censored corp in alliance cant give but a couple of the directors can my alt who is a director in said corp cant give yet one of our brand new recruits with no roles set can givenone of this changes no matter what i set permissions tobefore you think this is a centralized bug note that i have two poss set up and both have the same problemssomething needs to be fixed here and fast
the whole pos system needs to be blown up and coded afresh its utter nonsense how it all works as for the exe censorship its because of a spammer going around posting links to keyloggers no idea why they forgot the leading dot but hey
anyone else notice this as a problemi mean im pretty sure that there are people that have tried thiskind of makes sense if a corp wanted to allow alliance to use some of their modulesnice that the interface is there sad that its just a tease
supported i personally dont want to see people given rights they really dont need for example to give rights to a corp hanger at a pos you give rights for all offices as well which makes it a security risk and is sillywhile youre at it redo the entire permissions system it need help badly
for someone who is standing on there very small yet very tall podium you certainly do not have a great deal of support from the pilots who use these shipshence my ego commentthread

i am ship looks to cool to never see them in space
after some test on eft i can only say yesbut perhaps the good way for this ship would be to more drone or launcher why dont put in this ship 6 slots for launcher with some bonus in heavy assaultthey are already some ship use themexemple vengeance  bonus rocketstealth bomber  torpedomalediction  rocket rocketsacrilege  heavy assaultdamnation  heavy assault why not prophecy  heavy assault
because the prophecy is an amarr ship and amarr ships use lasers and the odd drone the ships you list are all khanid ships seriously though if the problem is that the tanky bc gets a less impressive tank than it should boost the tank toss an extra thousand or two armor hp at it
i find myself agreeing with yaay

sadly i want to see this ambulation livejust because  might bring new players
not supportedi too am looking forward to wisambulationwhatevertheydecidetocallit even if they werent making it those resources wouldnt be used for eve as theyre working on another mmo that will use the wis engine as its base ambulation is just an extra that comes with it as well as a chance to get the graphics portion live and tested while the backend stuff is worked on
i support ambulation completely
and i completely support your support of ambulation completely cant wait to see the rest of you walking in station heh
im also signing in as one of the no ones who want walking in stationsif its not your cup of tea thats fine but a lot of folks are very much looking forward to it both i and my wife who has her own characters and accounts are really jonesing for itas to why  its hard to roleplay in a spaceship new eden is more than hulls and a lot of folks want to experience that so what if they recycle the code thats just good business and the cross pollination will mean that both games will benefit
i know we all want to see the rest of your boobs 
the idea is simple it follows the same concept as a mobile warp disruption bubble but in this case its a cyno jammer it would take quite a bit of m3 to move aswell as having a long anchoring timer but once online would jamm a certain radius around its self say 150k they would come in many sizes small 75k medium 125k large 175k xlarge 225kthese special bubbles would also have a cycle time after which they would go into a state named recharging at which point the jamming capabilities are nullified the recharge time would be a quarter of the cycle time for theories sake lets say 30 minute cycle time this means recharge would be 75 minutes why are these needed they would be another card in the fcs deck as well as allow attackers and defenders alike to temporarily shield themselves from hot dropstitan drops and such if the bubbles were set up correctly they wouldnt prevent warp ins or affect warping in any wayif the bubble was dropped after the cyno went up or during once it came up the cyno would still be valid but ships would randomly appear cloaked acros the system using the same mechanic that is seen when the cyno dies as you jump the cyno would also go instantly red and not auto run another cycleofcourse these would only be able to function in 00the other idea would be to make this a highslot mod for black ops bss allowing them to create a cloak of jamming around an area where during the time only covert cynos could be openedthe first idea is the primary one though i hope you like it please discuss
i support my train of thought
i support this product and or service
i like the general concept  but the practicality of it is questionable at best so you cant cyno within 200k ill just cyno a bit off in a ss 5mil off and warp the capitals to the field  yes it does make me a bit susceptible to drag bubblesdictorhic bubbles for my capitals but its easily avoidable same is true with people trying to warp dicshics on my cyno as i can do it in a safe off from all the planets and just get a bubble towards them so anyone warping to tackle my cynoed caps will be caught in itso until said issues are address im ambivalent and not supporting sorry
i will grant you that yes but a cyno off grid and a cyno on grid are 2 different thing for instance a titan cynoing on grid just jumps in dds aligns and gonetitan off grid shows up on directional and fleets have time to scattercaps on field can immediately start combat caps warping in are at a disadvantagethis  will take between 550 seconds depending on bumping aligning and warpinseveral seconds is the difference between having pos ammo and pvp ammo or scripts right getting hics on the field to hinder their warpins and spread em outsure if it goes 200k you can cyno at 201k but that still not where you wanna be is it assuming the fleet is near the center of the bubble that gives the tiran much much less range on their dd cause they come in 200 away and it only goes 250k testedit also makes the difference between a regular dread gang and a sniper dread gang bridged in support and everythign cant immediately appear on field therefor the friendly forces have time to react and dont have the panic of enemies appearing on top of you thought your points are valid they are not hitting at the heart of the argument which is to hinder not stop cyno of enemy support bridging or caps coming in that extra few seconds say 3040 where they land load and align you can be more prepared than if you didnt have the jammer shroud
also how effective is a hot drop that has to start offgrid it loses its ohst factor instead you get cyno up 30 dreads on directional get bubbles up between us and load pvp ammofinally more often than not youll get the cyno warping to your grid uncloak hit cyno button and go oh st and by that time support has him locked and done
interesting concept though i must say that you numbers seem off  the recharge time idea is kind of silly and theres no need for four sizes still i like the broader idea
supportedalso would like to see low sec usage no need to restrict it to 00 like warp bubblesa similar mod for a rorqual would also be an idea to help protect mining ops from hot drops in addition to giving mining ships laser dps  but thats another issue 
dis issue support it needz
god everyone that has anything against this proposal doesnt do a good job at hiding the fact that nerfing this would ruin the one thing that they enjoy doing in the gameeve is a game about riskrewardsuicide ganking has no risk and lots of reward in some cases more than l4 missions i watched a freighter full of capital ship parts get suicide ganked a couple weeks ago the loot from that wouldve been wondrous if i was a part of itif there werent insurance payouts for illegal activities then itd force suicide gankers to pick targets thatd offset their losscurrently the police offset your criminal activitiesdoesnt make any sense at all
this man has made the pointsnot supported stop whining about suicide gankers theres plenty of ways to keep yourself safe
the point of the topic wasnt whining about the act of suicide ganking thats all and goodthe point of the topic is how nonsensical it is for concord to pay you for breaking the lawive never had a problem with suicide ganking and i also dont think removing insurance payout would stop or even slow the act of doing much at all it would just make you pick your targets more intelligentlyyou wont just suicide gank a floating destroyer for lolsyou wont just suicide gank a caracal on his way to a missionyoull suicide gank a cov ops frig for the possibility of carrying bposyou or a scout character would scan cargos of industrials and pick ones with juicy cargo for you to gankyoud make more profitable decisions to offset your loss a loss which there is absolutely no reason for the police force to pay foritd be like if police paid for your car that got wrecked while they were chasing you
a interesting addition to the role playing aspect of fw i would prefer something more in deep like temporary agents giving out slaves to move to rehabilitation centers and then a second agent there giving out freed slaves to move to other locations with the mechanics added with the first epic arc it would not be difficult it added the possibility to deposit something in a container in space so it would be easy to add a rehabilitation station in space each race has have several agents asking you to move item a from agent a to agent b then item b from agent b to agent c and so on around a circuit that in the end return you to the starting point a temporary circuit sending you with a load of freed slaves to the rehabilitation center from there to a station with a load of workers and assorted people and then from that station to the starting system with a cargo of vitoc remember vitoc addiction is not curable so you need it to keep the exslaves alive dont seem to hard to make after implemented it would require only to move the position of the first agent to a new system when that is controlled by minmataramarr would have similar agents asking for a raid against rehabilitation facilities to get potential slaves dropping them in conditioning stations and bringing again vitoc to condition themprogramming some similar circuit and bringing them on line only when the condition warrant it dont seem too hardeditit is a mission idea so slightly different from the op idea more based on market but bot should make some fw aftereffect visible to the general populance
sounds like a good idea
sounds good
some good ideas on this thread
gotta agree with this
the principle is sound i have often thought that agents in space at appropriate nonfw capture mechanic plexes might be one way to make this kind of thing relatively automaticcosmo
i agree that this would be a much better way to go both for immersion and balance but it would require more development on ccps part my suggestion is intended to provide some sort of real effect to occupancy changes that the rp crowd can enjoy and the pvp crowd can enjoy griefing with truly minimal ccp effort i would fully support your idea if ccp decides that they are willing to devote staff resources to making the effect of occupancy more transparent within the gameif anything i would expand your suggestion into a minigame of sorts where occupancy slowly converts existing resources from one factionspecific type to another and there are tagstyle missions available allowing you to use personnel trade goods to convert the types more quickly eg slavers rehabilitation experts medics what have you as the resources change type courier missions open up to deliver them to the home systems this would allow the minmatar a chance to speed up the freeing and repatriation of slaves and the amarr a chance to disrupt these operations and to recapture slaves if they regain occupancy and similarly for industrial output for the caldarigallente conflict the resources could replenish over time keeping people from both sides active in the fw systems long after the immediate occupancy clash and create disruptable trade routeshowever i would bet that ccp has already considered many such ideas but scrapped them due to staff time issues hence i proposed my limited idea
i dont support this because think about it when you mission in lowsec you should probably align in order to make a quick get away at least you would if youre smart now when a flashy comes into your mission youre going to leave and probably not come back they know where it is and might wait for you does it really matter if it takes them 30 seconds or 3 minutes to find you youre not going to finish the mission anyways so with this youre just trying to prevent the inevitable
as a weapons system rockets are utterly useless i understand the point of rockets  in that they provide something which hits reliably but even when they do the damage dealt is minimallets do a bit of mathcraft hereno skill bonus no ship bonuses3x rocket launcher i 19 dps  12 grid   45km range3x 150mm autocannon i 24 dps  12 grid  04  40 3x gatling pulse laser i 26 dps  15 grid  20  053x light electron blaster i 32 dps  12 grid  05  15from this alone you might say hey thats not so bad rockets trade off dps for range and not having to worry about tracking except rockets also have a explosion velocity of 85ms a speed attainable by practically any ship in eveif the enemy happens to be going at 170 ms even if you match speeds with him in a chase rocket dps drops down to half the original amount to 95 dps 170ms is approximately the speed of an enemy frigate while webbed with a tech 1 websecondly as ship equipment is upgraded to best named range and tracking increase while with rockets the range and explosion velocity of said weapon remains constant my proposalboost rocket damage by 20 so that rockets have a base damage of 30boost rocket explosion velocity by 200  so rockets have a base explosion velocity of 255ms this is still lower then the speed obtained by many frigates but would allow rockets to deal full damage to a tackled cruiser at least
supportedalso although missiles in general need a look at throwing the  missiles are nerfed lets fix that first before rockets argument isnt the answer rockets are wtfbbqed atm which also affects ships such as the crowmaelvengeancehawk  making them less than ideal with all 4 you could go missiles and long range but thats not a fix to the prob just an adapting to the situation  something that the missile fix which may or may not happen in the far future will not address sufficiently anyhow
missiles in general neet to be looked at theyve been nerfd way too hardplus you get to add the joy of travel time to every last bit of dps numbersi love missiles and have well over 6m sp put into them but every last post about numbers involving missiles put them way under any other weapon
while i appreciate the help to get rockets fixed maybe bump the existing threads instead making new ones
theres an existing thread for this
this suggestion shouldnt even have needed to be posted its how it should always have worked
its common sense imohow about the ability to have a key ring that has stored passwords that automatically work unless the poss password has been changed
must have had the carebear stare seizure
it was called armageddon day back in 2007 during dt for expansion cant remember which everyone was given max skills on singularity every system was turned 00 also
and sisi was completely lagged out and the joining queue was impressive
this is a exelent idea it needs to be supported by a login message or something this will bring pvp to the carebear puppies that are afraid of pvp they will get a taste of pvp when they come out in t1 cruisers and stuff maybe they will like it and cut the carebearing supportededit this topic will get roasted by carebears but hell what do u expect form them if they miss out 1 day of income 45m x 6 hours 270m
getting randomly ganked by blobs is not good pvp
up
good 00 is fine is the problem of the corpalliance if they fail at exploiting and aiding their members as they should moons  plexes and almost all of them can pretty much be run by two guys or one and his alt which is not uncommon for 00 players to have can make a lot of money belt rats allready have an higher chance for higher meta drops and in general more drop again not our fault if ratters cant be bothered to loot it yeah i know there are bigger inconveniences about hauling stuff etc but still is part of the sandbox is players fail to create a local market about it and anyway in the age of jumpbridges and jf lol in case of players residing in npc regions that are nto as secure as territory with sov they have higher chance for factionofficer so it evens outone thing though is true changes proposed by ephemeron should be implemented as is a no brainer that people that can log after dt has higher profit that anyone elsebad 00 needs a boost though is just not right you can earn more in empire than there but as has been stated only ccp knows all the details about the bounties  drops and how it all is even out one change i would make though is to mvoe from a direct bounty to tags model for everything this way you would accomplish two things you force everyone to loot stuff including hisec runners so is easier to control ratios between minerals  isk and on the other side you force players to haul stuff so it can be intercepted by other players in hisec mission runners would have to transport them to concord stations which could be camped by gankers or hisec wardeccing corps or sell to players buy orders probably losing money
while i support this concept this tends to become another nerf to 00 players highsec players can easily turn in their tags freely  00 players have plenty of risk transporting tags around
could you stop bumping your whine thread dave its a violation of forum rules
oh for the love of god stop nerfing ecmtracking disruptors are fine  learn to maneuver your ship against someone tracking disrupting you learn to recognize tracking disruption and change ammotracking disruptors dont have the range to be usable at fleet sniping distances or at the very least if used at those distances the tding ship can be very easily shot atyes i know guns are supposed to be better than missiles but everyone is already used guns and more reliability is a key reason that missiles exist
tds are fine i almost never see them used except on pilgrims and curses now yeah i could fit one on my harbinger but i find a webber far more useful and they already nerfed the sht out of webbers
tracking disruptors do nothing to drones do nothing to missiles and do nothing to an enemys ew compared to sensor dampeners and ecm they only do one very specific thing so they should be pretty darn good at it
didnt ccp fixed that and ewar affects drones nowthough not sure how effective that would be 
not sure how you can blob poorly if you have enough ships its really hard to lose they arent plowed under by wardecs because theres too many nobody is willing to fight against such numbers 47 is actually kinda bad considering that they are flying cheap t1 stuff and even with their blobs and numbers dont kill as much as they lose in cheap t1 equipment
who cares about the expendable newbies at eveunihelios
apparently their credibility of knowledge on this subject is based on the expendable newbiessorry i couldnt resist getting in a fight with them
i just hope after seeing this thread decent into trolling that csm members think twice before shooting down issues they have no understanding of see how constructive that response was csm stick to  you know if its not your issue then move along to something you understand
yeah theres a reason i let that subthread die should probably have dropped it one post sooner but meh how could anyone possibly not understand this issue its not exactly complicated
its a very agile ship good tank however it does need some punch in the forum of better damage bonus or another turret slot tanking bonus is fine

yes you did miss the point im afraid the argument in buffing the cyclone isnt an argument of cyclone a vs cyclone b its cyclone vs other ships of its classso while the implant set and drug you choose for the cyclone is the best option for it they are not the best option for the other battlecruisers thats the pointas for the scale of the booster bonus think of balance in regards to bonuses resist vs repair5lvl resists give you an ehp bonus it also assists in passive tanks and rr gangsrepair only assists repair it has little benefit in ehp and it has no bonus in an rr gang finally its completely counter productive in a passive tanklike i said before 5lvl resist is almost always far superior to 75lvl repair there is only a very small window of incoming dps that the repair bonus is superior and that superiority is only after a a minute or so and only pulls away from the resist bonus by about 2to increase the repair bonus to 10lvl increases the window of superiority for incoming dps and makes repair bonused ships the best tankers in small to medium engagements while leaving the resist bonused ships the kings of large engagementsthat is what is the point to the repair bonus been buffedin regard to your assertion of this making missions ships even better be honest with me just because the repair bonus gets boosted to 10lvl would people drop their cnrs and start flying maelstroms i dont think so missile ships are still the best pve ships in gamei will remind you that the repair bonused ships include several gallente blaster boats that are best used in small to medium gangs also

i have flow the cyclone got some kills in it like it but im not silly enough to think its because its a good ship it was because people think its utterly worthless when in practice it is mearly very very bad i feel sorry for anyone who flys this in pvp engagements who cant overheatcould do with another mid tbh but i cant see that ever happening
your original comment on the topic was whats stopping the buffer tankers from using an implant set and drugs also and thats what i was referring to were you referring to a buffertanked cyclone or a buffertanked drakebrutixharbinger i assumed you were referring to the cyclone which gets next to nothing from drugs and implants when buffer tanked i have never understood the love for the raven its tank is ugly its dps is mediocreeven on the cnr and missiles have all manner of suck attached to them that turrets dont have to worry about the drake i can understand but the raven is just unimpressive give me a dominix or a pulse abaddon any day

oh noez i sorry not enough missions mining plexs ratting wormholes mission arcs and trade for youalso the following makes me think this is yet another highsec needs to get more stuffs  make lowsec and 00 highsec pleze thread i have a special quote from ccp just for the occasion for all ya carebear idiots eve is a dark and harsh world youre supposed to feel a bit worried and slightly angry when you log in youre not supposed to feel like youre logging in to a happy happy fluffy fluffy lala land filled with fun and adventures thats what hello kitty online is forccp wrangler miati i think your kittey is puuurrrring for you
because theyre doing what they are supposed to be doing  represent the players wantsneeds  job well donelv if you take a look  this is one of the more active threadsissues clicky  16 pages worth far more than most of what seems to have been brought up otherwise here we are  one year later 
get it fixed pronto my eyes are dying ccp
blah blah yada yada everyone look at me im a tactical genius blah blahhes asking for a simple agression timer whats the big dealif you are allowed to shoot at the remote repper which i assume means he is a valid target that can be legally engaged then why not also penalize him with the aggression timerso you cant run away or dock up thats the price you pay stop whining about your dual boxed rr alt getting nerfed when in fact its not a nerf its a bug that needs to be fixedoh and stop using rr gangs as a crutch learn to pvp or go play with yourself you thought i was going to say go play wow

looks as if you are as loud mouthed in the forums as you were in alliance chat goddess fyi sukmanobov has never used nuetral remote rr i also know for a fact that rico felix sombra shan pb delzoun jared wolf and most of mbalm does not use them in fact i know of no one in mbalm that does if any one does please feel free to tell usi will admit to using my alt to rsb suk every now and then but thats no gonna help if im in a rupture and a domi undocks tho if i undock a rupture to fight a cruiserbc a remote nuet remote mega  logistic ship ie ggb would change the fight in the wts favourif privs are using nuet rr then you have every right to complain just dont go spreading rumors about privs using neut rr in fights as a norm because we dontps notice the word nuetral not corp before all the post about i seen privs using rr
not that i know of please name corps
ha ha ha loki the biggest nuet rr user in jita problem is that if you fight say phoon vs phoon both are around the 30 armor left then you target undocks his neutral rr domi then its pritty mutch all over for ya as there is no way your gonna burst the rest of that phoon plus the the rr domi so the fight then becomes a can i get docked before i pop then smack in local about how you gt docked in time the end because you wont undock and fight again because he has nuet rri agree with both proposals pb  aggrotimer and viktor vegas  that out of corp rr should not be alowedps i just read kailen thorns post about his use of neut rr i dont support this but its his choice if doesnt mind being a hypocrite
i so support this
lol fine i get them to join the corpalliance your scenario still fails if he waits to undock is in my corp and rrs me you gonna switch targets and kill him nope youre gonna dock same as you guys always do and didtry thinking around the problem and quit whining beating rr is easy and we do it daily this includes the privateers rather fail attempts at rreve forums if you cant beat em whine about it and ccp will do it for you
what are u on about man i dont use rr my main dosnt even have skills to use rr and plus i fly frigs so what is the point of itwhered i say that i did i was agreeing that rr was ok but they need to put a aggression countdown to keep them in the fight so they can be shot at and blown up for trying to help the fight
right firstlyjita is a big place your not the only war targets docked so you and 1  2 others sitting outside could mean bait generally theres 10 in jita and we do not know who is working with who and who is helping with the bait so we generally are cautious out of all the wartargets i have fought against your name probably stands out the most and its warning bells as to not give this guy a fight cause he abuses the ass outta rr thats why we didnt go to jita cause we knew it was a lost causerr is not the problem its the aggression countdown which is not their when someone rrs which is the problem please people need to understand that before posting rr is not broken and anyone can do it but the aggression countdown is brokenno see warping off takes time all rrs i have seen are battleships and they take time to align so a frig would be on bumping duty plus if that bs takes damage it must dock  repair but hey they cant cause of the new mechanics so they need to rep themselves and come back into the fight so that dosnt work
also if ecm is to be used to counter rr which if it has a good set up it has eccm and that will waste the ecm plus that will also give aggression to the neutral rr and if he is a player he can then undock in a dps ship and pop there rather weak ecm ship which engaged him to stop so again no that dosnt sound good does ityour little justification fails so before posting loki read that rr is fine the aggression countdown which is not there is the problem
repairing someone isnt an act of aggression and should never be considered as suchyou already get the ability to shoot said person for 15 minutes if he sticks his head into your war just be happy youre not dealing with people that use their rrs differently ie  have that alt steal from can belonging to their corp then when they rep them you get no chance to attack them i believe that is more of an issue than what youre complaining about not supported not to mention privateers use this tactic to get remote sensor boosters and reps for themselves as well so this is a bit of whine in my opinion
many in this thread that are for the change have expressed their view that this is a bug or an exploit but has that ever been confirmed by the devs if not i dont think its too far outside the realm of possibility that it is intentional i think its also at least possible that if intended it could have been meant as an alternative strategy to outblobbing station campers as stated by others you have to admit for a small group of players caught in a station by a larger force the options are pretty limitedif it did change would increasing the survivability of logistics ships helpit seems to me that if a change is made for the sake of consistency then the conditions should be plainly spelled out in a way that offers no room for interpretation would something like any action that harms or benefits a statistic on a ship flown by a pilot with an active one minute aggression timer triggers a one minute aggression timer suffice
umm kailen the top post is mine the 2nd one was from a corpmate of yours sukmanobov please at least read them and get your stuff straight before jumping up and down and waving stuff i never said you specifically used rr and to be honest again could care less
yea its ok loki it wasnt a rant at you it was a rant at sukman at the bottom of his post it says ps i read kailens the ps part was what i was getting at not at you
it really is kind of disturbing how many people dont bother to read what the post is about and just say l2fightrri think its been said here many many times that rr isnt the issuei think its also been said here many many times that the lack of an aggression time is the problemrr is a purely logical tacticlack of aggression creating god mode for neut rr is an exploit
kailenyou realize if you ran around and didnt sit at stations and gates you guys wouldnt have these problems with rr i can do whatever i want since i dont have these mythical issues a good majority of the time i dont even bother with rr since its not neededalso the tasking of a frig to bump people lol gl with that from what i saw with very few exceptions you guys and organization havent seen each other in years also try setting up a rr ship pick a logi bs hell i dont care drop 510 ecm drones on it and watch the 1 or 2 or even 3 eccms you crow about not do jack sht youre jammed m8 period and if youre doing it properly 12 jam cycles on the logi will let you kill your targets again if you guys bothered to test things you would know this but its easier to whine on the forums about ityou want to btch about something thats ed and op try the ecm drones lol those make me go ouch when i see them the thing you privateer guys dont get is most of eve doesnt like ya might be those decs against carebears and people that dont want to fight i dunno sometimes id get convos from people that hated the privateers and wanted to just stick one to you and theyd help out my group had between 13 guys that had rrs of some sort around some of the time could be 1 hs large rr on a mega might be 2 rr on a domi could be a logi ship sometimes i had nada tbh alot of people  jita and other places are looking for fights and rrsensor boostremote eccm boost people to get aggro and a fight hell i do it all the time to get fightsadd aggro counters to rr alts i just add stabs align add 12 rrs on each bs or go a new route makes no difference its just pathetic you cant figure out how many ways there are to beat it currently
99 of eve pvp is at a station or gate yeah all those 00 alliances
this  time to move on
as long as it doesnt summon concord supported
if youre allowed to shoot them then why not slap the timer on them as well
i agree completely i trained for the vengeance thinking it would be a fun little soloing af great slot layout great tank somewhat mediocre dps only to find out that rockets have a lower explosion velocity than hams what thethis is clearly a broken mechanic and i cant believe it hasnt simply been fixed as a bug yet personally id be happy if rockets simply had their explosion velocity fixed however id be ecstatic if they were brought in line with heavy assault missles and torpedos in terms of their damage velocity flight time rate of fire explosion velocity explosion radius launcher capacity and launcher fitting requirements relative to light misslesthank you dierdra vaal for taking this before the csm and hopefully a speedy resolution can be achieved next patch please

any communication between ccp and the player base would be very welcome simply saying this is a known issue or working as intended is not communication if something the player base feels is a bug is working as intended we would like to know why that is the intention and if there is a known issue we would like to hear what progress is being made on resolving itis this not the csms purpose to communicate on the player bases behalf with ccp and then let everyone know what is going on

i like itthis gives more flexibility to the players and we have a new wide area for productiontraining it seems also to be basically balanced  when you wanna use crews you have to sacrifice a rigslot but i hope that crews in the rigslot when they are all of the same type have a bit more bonus than the sacrificed rigslot would have with a rig of the same bonus type in it

you dont play fw do youreading wont help you much sign up and join a few fleets that are mixed with antimilitia cherry picked wardecsof the 2 fw forces youre fighting you only see 1 on a regular basis 2nd force is on other side of empire regardless the more you see the better more kills there is zero reason to try to avoid the wardecs as the wardecs are the whole aim of joining fwwe want more wardecs not less or the ability to actually return fire on those who attack our fleetscurrently if you join fw you already have to worry about the 3rd forces because they kill half your gang without you being able to return fire and leave you alone to be killed by the militia1 you already have to worry about all the forces even if your corp doesnt have wardec 2 the 3rd party is already at a massive advantage in the current setup of you cant attack them
sorry posting this on an altthis is a bad idea becuase it changes the fundimental idea of fw in the wrong way fw was from my understanding supposed to be a way to give a stepping stone for pve players to move more into pvp by doing this you have moved the whole concept of fw into the same basic concept as 00 spacefw is not complete and we all know it it needs help but this is not the way find a way to make capturing a system mean something that would be more help to fw give fw pilots points for plexes captured missions run and fw targets killed and let them spend those points on special items like faction ships and weapons ie reward them for the war effort that would help fw a loti would now take this thread a different way i think we should limit wear decing on fw corps not expand it fw is in some ways about rp this means that the focus should be on attacking the enemy not dealing with any petty bunch of bullies that want to get their jollies shooting some new to pvp pilotsto this same end i think an effort should be made to limit the corporations allowed to participate in fw a faction standing is all well and good but the mechanic is to easy for pirate corps that want to bully noobs to get aroudn it and use this as a fresh hunting ground cosmo i have spoken with you often in the past with a few different characters and i respect you so do not take this wrong but this proposal is doing nothing but putting more bullies with clubs amongst the baby seals to fix fw you need to fix the system so the focus is the fw and not the various side aspects give the players a reason to fight for their faction not give more players easy targets keep the alliances out of fw if they want to take part in the fw mechanice they can start a sister corp that allows their members entry and give them allied access to their alliance i mean the entire idea reaks of destroying the concept of fw when you think of it using sf as the example they want to kill amarr supporters great then run out into 00 space and take on cva but in faction war these supporters are supposed to be supported directly by the various factions would the amarr really let a petty bunch of pilots run muck over their people if you want to bew in fw then be in it not playing on the edge pick a faction and make a stand not pick and choose which targets get you the best publicity at the timeso as someone that has played both sides of the amarrmatar war no i was never a spy and yes i was in two different characters at different times i can tell you that i see no benefit in this proposal for the concept of fw in fact i would go so far as to say if this was adopted i would never play fw since if i wanted that level of action i could go to 00 space and things would be celaer of who my enemies wherethe fw concept as it stands is solid it just needs fleshing out and some moree control added do not alter it into another version of 00
check the amarr militia killboards bud
on the other hand people would be more willing to play eve and go on fleet ops because they wouldnt have to face 30 soul numbing jumps each way to get in on the action leading more people to play the game and stay subscribed
i dont support because this whole thing can be resolved by rebalancing the price structuresomething like 1005025 as someone suggested would work pretty well as the dev blog stated small rigs are slated to be between 100k1m but if you think about itits either a whole ship or a single rig for a ship that will die quickly regardless of what rigs it has on itin a way the rigs seem to balance themselves out because almost all rigs are percentages ie an armor pump rig wont give a frigate 10k more armor hp it would give something like 100200 now tell me is that worth the potential cost of another ship you could buy this may not make a difference for the rich but for people who try to conserve every single isk like myself its a huge difference small ships get blown up quicker so you end up spending more isk fitting ships anyway
ah but a speed rig of 10  will benefit a frigate considerably more than a battleship you cant argue straight numbers bc not all ships are equal in the same regaurd 10 more speed on a frigate can break tracking just like 10 more armor rep on a battleship can break some ships dps advantage do you know what 10 more armor on a frigate is like when missiles are in play have you ever shot an afterburner based armor tanked retribution with heavy missiles
in short agreedresized rigs need to be looked at very closely again prior to implementation
supported not like a support fleet can help the miners much if they get bbqd by snipers to begin with
there used to be an alliance that did pretty good for itself living in low sec behind a scouted pipe while they did missions and mined inside it took some scouts a good location while still they werent free from disaster they gave themselves a higher chance to make isklive there without much threati cant remember their names but living or operating in low sec takes more effort than endlessly sitting in high sec wishing you could go there waiting for ccp to fix low secnot supported becoming more dedicated as a corpalliance is the only really fix for this

t2 ships need to be far more expensive still that 300m sounds like a pretty good starting point
supply and demand sorry
still distribution of moons  weight in industrial process sucks
yea complaining about an issue that is player base driven isnt going to solve much too many people get rich and fund their efforts throughout eve in this mannernot supported
which drawback are you referring to
hes referring to specific skill meant to improve an inherit disadvantage to a weapon system controlled burst for example lowers the cap necessary to fire laser and hybrid weapons rapid fire in missiles reduces the rate of fire for all missile systems projectile weapons do not get a weapon specific skill like this
just for reference i believe the missile skill youre referencing is rapid launch which gives 3 rof per level turrets do have a similar version which is actually named rapid firing which gives 4 rof per levelas for the other two points i endorse them with every fiber of my rustbucket being
you have my ducttape
give the ghetto people some love too
duct tape has feelings too
wasnt there something that ac hit better at the edge of falloff so you go a bit further off you will run out of the lasers absolutely short falloff and they wouldnt hit at all there are skills which increase falloff something that autocannons benefit most as they got the biggest base falloff you broke your own argument heretrajectory analysis advanced understanding of zerog physics 5 bonus per skill level to weapon turret accuracy falloff as a side note rapid fire would be a turret skills skill at the rapid discharge of weapon turrets 4 bonus per skill level to weapon turret rate of fire missile uses rapid launch so the rapid fire benefits projectiles toocant really support this as it stands and before you start bashing yes i use projectilesedit added falloff skill
falloff advantage is a myththe mael for example only starts to outdamage a hyperion with same damage mod numbers usign that just to compare directly weapons at 42 kmunder 42 km the blaster ship stilloutdamages the ac one that both using long range t2 ammo with 1 extra damage mod on maelstrom only it outdamages the blaster up to 4km then drops behind up to 30 km aa yeahh so much for the range advantagethe apocalypse the damm no damage bonus ship outdamages the maelstrom again with same damage mod number from 15 km up to well up to infinitythe abaddon outdamages from zero to where the sun stops shinningso no ac falloff doe snot give any reasonable scenario advantageac would need to be like 40 larger to give us a realistic advantage over blasters wont even dream of lasers
acs are gimpedccp doesnt caretrain amarr
those weapons take capacitor minnie guns do not that would be like suggesting missiles are lacking this type of skill as well even though they dont take cap and to be honest you should be happy youre minmatar and dont have to train itnot supported
seishi maru do you have the numbers also for short range ammo
why should it its all chance based 50 base chance to hit for tempestmael using barrage vs 100 for geddon with scorch on 36 km is no good at allsigned somenthing needs to be done
quite a few folks have done the math regard this as well as actual trials done show that the damage done at falloff follows the start path of all weapons having falloff because of our supposed ability to fight in falloff our damage is nerfed again if we actually do sosecond as it currently stands if both pilots have equal skills and using similar style ammo amarr navy multifrequency versus rf emp l the mega pulse laser t2base optimal of 24km falloff of 6km  30km base can hit a minmatar pilot with their best 800mm autocannons t2 base optimal of 48km falloff of 16km  208km base in order to hit at all a minmatar pilot would have to be in the amarrs optimal ranges this is true for all t2 pulse weapons even if you switched out the ammo for the longer range proton l ammo you would still be in the optimal range for the pulse weaponsthat being said you are partially correct because you could outrange hybrid weapons in falloffthank you darius and seriously for seeing my mistake regarding rapid fire and rapid launch it has been fixedin regards to the acs benefiting most from the trajectory analysis this is true however this is cancelled out by the fact that laser and hybrid weapons get an equal bonus with the sharpshooting skill and to add yet another insult to injury the sharpshooting skill is a 2x training modifer while the trajectory analysis is a 5x traning modifer if my math is right that means traj a is 250 longer to train than sharpshootingfor additional mathmatical data large projectiletempest issueedit spelling errors giving credit where credit is due and additional data on lasershybrids
i am not minmatar i am caldarithere is no way the systems can be balanced when two of the three systems have a skill that helps them and ignores the third either projectiles are more powerful than hybrids and lasers if you dont have controlled bursts or they are only balanced when you max out controlled burstsall the other gunnery skills buff all the weapon systems as far as i can tell this the the swap of three arty calibers for acs and lasers idiotic design are the only glaring omissions of a specific system in the entire game i feel both are balance issues which can be correlated with available data pretty easily hell the focus on acs for minmatar would make you think ccp intended for them to be the brawlers but it sure doesnt work out that wayfor example lets look at a common mael vs a blaster rokhimaginary fit8 800mms 8 neutrons3 metastasis rigs 4 gyros 3 mag stabs2 invuln fields 1 coprocessor 2 rcus1 mwd 1 cap booster 1 warp disruptor 1 xlarge shield booster 4 berserkers 5 valkyriesthe maelstrom isnt bad but as a brawler it suffers bigtime from being incapable of fitting a good tank and maintaining the mwd point and websensor booster combo that you can do in an abaddon or hyperion all the while it cant do anywhere near the dps of a gank fitted abaddon or hyperion and has a smaller tank than a similarly kitted abaddon hyperion or rokh a similarly kitted blaster rokh has 11k more ehp and only 154 less dps this of course is only if the two ships are setting at optimal ranges unfortunately for the mael pilot his optimal is only 3kms with hail and the rokh is 10kms with void i see this as a pretty fair fight between two good pilots between a sniper frame and a brawler frame which just doesnt make sense the rokh would probably lose but the fact that it could hang pretty well is just crazy when it shouldnt come close any good abaddon or hyperion kit would have a webber or sensor booster rather than a cap charger and the mael would get flat owned in a fleet battle anyone flying anything minmatar is already at a disadvantage to any ship in its tier kitted for its role the rokh and and scorpion dont really apply the dom and apoc can take a phoon the tempest is the worst bs in the game and the hyperion and abaddon can take a mael pretty easynormally with only 3 tiers someone wasnt going to have a top bs in a tier but with the rohk and scorpion not even being applicable its pretty sad that the minmatar are 3rd in two tiers and 4th in tier 2 of course these ranks are my opinion and every ship has a counter but fitted per role the minmatar bss lose every timeone way or another controlled bursts makes the three systems unbalanced in game at some point or other so that point cant be disputed
theres a popular opinion floating around that all weapons systems should be equaland to lesser extent  that all ships should be equali think it is a wrong direction for eve we should have greater diversity stronger sets of advantages and disadvantagesi do want to see some kind of minmatar ship boost but i dont want it to be in form of more gun dps minmatar simply arent supposed to be the dps racewhat i think is valid is to take the significant disadvantages of minmatar weapons and argue for stronger advantages in other aspects of minmatar ship performancethe state of the game is such that there has been too much nerfingboosting that erases sets of advantagedisadvantage by averaging out and homogenizing everything we need less of that
i agree with ephemeron while projectiles do underperform at the battleship level they should not be fixed by making autocannons into longerranged blasters or artillery should not become railguns
yery nicei disregard most of the changes to make all of the ui moveable and feature richsimplicity wins adapt or leavei cant help feeling they are growing the game to the point it becomes barely manageable  playable for all the features
i can only support you once per thread and i was the first supporteralso the new forum protection breaks the link
just having them reuse the freighter model again would mean that this could be done very easily im not sure about a freighter being able to be both an awesome item carrier as well as awesome ship carrier due to their already low cost and high utility
a simple freighter with a ship hangar instead of a cargohold would fit the billno new skill simply a second ship in the same class
the most likely course they would take is just like you and vankul suggest a new ship of the same model and skills with a ship hangar instead of a cargo hold really though i dont think that allowing a single freighter to configure between one or the other would be too much it could either haul goods or it could haul ships but the two would be mutually exclusive on any given trip of course this would still require extra coding for a new game mechanism so it would be much faster and easier to make a new freighter with a large ship maintenance bay
venkul please i prefer a new ship simply because it will add a new item to build and give something extra for the marketnaturally it would use the same kind of components of a regular freighter but in different numbers
sourcei like the rig idea it could possibly work on both freighter and jump freighter also it saves art department lot of work on new modeltextures
ive done this proposal before and a lot of people kinda made some good points and alot made a mess of things and many went off some place elseso to make this simple and straight forward im not interested in doing anything else just simply thiscoding wise it should be simpleif your training a skill say warp drive operation vand you want to start training jump drive operation iyour going to finish warp drive operation v in 5 hours but your unable to inject the jump drive skill due to the fact you dont meet the perquisitesthis forces you to train other skills and delays your planned trainingi propose that we be allowed to inject skills that can be trained so long as the prerequisites are met within the 24 hour skill queue periodnow for that begging question of what if you change your mindif you try to change your skill queue and you dont meet the prerequisite skills for injecting the skill to begin with you lose the skillmuch like implantsthis forces you to make careful choices im sure some of you will cry over it but there is simply no way around the exploitccp is not likely to allow free injection of skills because of the potential abuse factor so please dont ask for it here make a seperate thread for itthis is a compromise a fair one at that and id be content with just this minor annoyance put to restno more no lesspros one less pain in the ass to deal withcons honestly the only one is if you inject a skill and change your mind and you end up out a good deal of isk well you only have yourself to blame
yes pleasei am so tired of having to put in filler skills just so i can make sure i dont lose training timefrankly the queue should have been this way in the first place
supportedthe proposed idea wouldnt be hard to implement at allanyone that decides to whine about losing a skill just because they dropped the training of the prereq skill needed to lose that skill what did we learn here todayand if ccp thinks that the above would be an actual issue then fine make the skill turn back into a book whatever
supported
too much work for something that will delay your goal by less than a day and occurs rarely you will be training another useful skill during that time anyway
supported allowing to train a skill when the prereq is in training and will be done within 24 hours is common sense
if your going to say why your not supporting it at least bother to put some effort into itto put it into terms your able to understand the time you spend training that other skill is time wasted when you could legally training the skill you wish to injectif you cant see that then your obviously new to the game if your not new then give it some time you will grow frustrated soon enough
i did say that the time it would take to implement this is simply not worth it i even provided two reasons1 this happens rarely and pushes back your skill completion by less than 24 hours2 since youre training another skill during that time you dont loose any training time you might get to your current goal a few hours later but you will get to your next goal a few hours faster you dont waste any time at allthis doesnt frustrate me at all simply because it happens so rarely and doesnt matter anyway as i said in my 2nd point i understand your point and think its a good idea but its not worth the time required to make it

either implement this or put serious restrictions on the sellbuy order forums as in only items that can not be sold using ingame tools such as services can be sold using those forums
hii think almost all alliances in eve that has a jb network has problems tracking the jb networkperhaps a good addition to the game would be a jb network fee this fee would be calculated based on the liquid ozone consumption of a given ship and subtracted of the char with a warning message that can be disabled if requiredthe jb can be configured to charge for the fee by lo or notthis would bring the concept of the jb to something much higher than it is jb could be public and allowed to be used by anyone and even perhaps shown on the overview this would help alliances to prevent or even charge the enemies that try to use its own jb network knowing the password wouldnUFFFDt be enoughtjust a few comments about the issue but i think the idea can be developed furtherattyu lee
extensive jb networks are really bad for small scale pvp only the large scale fleet battles benefiteve should be more restricting on jb networks with much higher costs and jb itself should be much more vulnerable to small roaming gangs

i dont support yet another one of your proposals i find you bash other opinions all the while one of yours fails from the start the amount of dps you can get with even focused medium pulse and faction ammo on that low fit is enough damage from something the floats around 20 to 25m iskits a battlecruiser there are only 2 of them you cant seperate roles or specify to much difference in them if you dont like amarr train something else
the proph is a durable beast it just doesnt fit into a need to be on top of the damage dealers list at my corps pvp gank ventures attitude
i know that i need to tick it to agree but i would like to see an actual proposal to what the boost should be i understand that the proph lacks in tankingbuffer ability right now but an added bonus  a tweak to armor amountwhatever could increase that role to where it should beabout the tier argumentlook at any cruiser or frigate line you will obviously notice the general increase of useability as you go up the tier linegenerally the tier 2 bc is better than its tier 1 counterpart with some exceptions such as the increased possible shield tank with the cyclonetier 3 bs are all gank ships with high dps that cannot as easily be matched by their lower tier counterparts caldari are an exception as their fleet bs is tier 3 and not tier 2 a tier 3 bs should be able to destroy its tier 1 counterpart easily with the exception being caldari again with the scorp the teir 2 ships are fleet ships
there was a comparison table on eve files some months ago that compared prophecy to other t1 bc in same class and to all it was inferior it realy need to be looked at
once youve seen them can we have evemail updated and alot of the basic problems fixed
how about a cyno jammer module that consumes strontium clathrates and effects an entire grid
thats also very possibly and doable the idea is to just give us the tools to have a local cyno jammer whether its anchored or module base really doesnt matter to me
supportedi personally like the idea to revamp the black ops to a more important rolefor example if you bring a black ops on the field it can balance somewhat the battle because a black operation can either go undercover and also jam on the other side sometimes
historythe problem was brought before the ccp during csmccp meetings 01  2023 of june 2008 the topic in assembly hall concerning the same issue is locked due to inactivity 
to be fair to ccp just because nothing has come out on the topic does not mean that theyve done nothing for all you or i know it could be getting fixed in the next patch
think about it how many password should the system remember 11010 all those you have input this session today this week how much more lag when you have a fleet warping around in a system with one or more pos if the system should try 10 or 100 password every time you jumpmove within the shield protectionsure it is annoying but i am unconvinced that this solution will be better

tracking disruptors are kinda weak compared to other forms of ewnot at all saying that other froms of ew need to be nerfed its td that are underpowered a lotif you compare  damps and ecm have a chance to 100 disable a ships targeting ability only fof will work in that case all scrambling webing ew effect is cut offtracking disruptors reduce the efficiency of turrets usually not disabling them totally even in situations where it would be the most efficientin most cases youll find its better to have a damp ship than a td ship damps are already not the best stuff around so it shows to the crappiness of the tdthe td values before they had scripts was not bad using that value as a reference for the scripted value would be a start it makes it half as efficient as it originally was but that kind of boost is what it needs
you cant be serious ever hit a gunboat with a tracking disruptor they are totally disabled kill their drones and then slowly grind them down as they wouldnt hit you anymoreand at the situations where you fit td 50020000m damps would be quite useless especially when fighting bigger ship which would be still able to lock you even after you damp them
i was wondering how long after the ecm nerf a topic like this would take to appear longer than i expected tbhso in essence the complaint is that an ew module is effectiveum yeah deal with itnot supported
they dont do anything to drones eitherand they take up a valuable midslot
i fly a pilgrim with 2 tdso td would be very useful when on long range but the optimal of td isnt that high damps either but whenever it succeeds youve got to lock againon shorter ranges reducing the range of blasters or autocannons is useless and reducing their tracking is not that effective unless they are shooting something the size of a cruiserusing 2 td on tracking scripts doesnt avoid a megathron to hit an orbiting bs it has basically no use at all theres not many options to disable a megathron shooting another bs tding doesnt help too much neuting has limited effect because of cap boosters damping is uselessim very sorry to say that but were left again with ecm as the only effective optiontd are too weak in their current state to be a proper cover for a bs being shot by another bs trying to td smaller ships shooting larger ships turns to be totally uselessso yes the td can be effective and sometimes cripple a gunboat but its very situational it only works on larger ships shooting smaller ones only if the target being shot moves fast enough and youre still defenceless against anything else than turretsps  i lol at the idea of td on drones what will i do cause one drone to miss half its shots its only 10 of the drone firepower
to those of you who tell me to quit complaining about them i am the one using them 90 of the time rather then being on the receiving end they are useful inside 10km against autuocannons you can web scramble a hurricane then sit at 7km and your 100 outside of there optimalfalloff or so deep into there second falloff increment as to make very little differenceim not complaining about how effective a td is on a arbitrator awesome ship btw i am saying that they are too useful on unbonused shipsthe difference between a td from a bonused ship and a td from a unbonused ship is too narrowbut whatever you guys must not be using them try it out i promise you the results are much better then they should be
obviously you fight very poor hurricane pilots  note that the following comes from the td rifter being my primary ship of choice look me up at gallenteevekillnetlets take small ships a webbing rifter wont be able to kill a good td rifter pilot who changes scripts and ammo types properly but the webbing rifter can always escape due to speedautocannons ruptures hurricanes neuts and a plethora of light drones destroy riftersafs that have tds cant td or rep without cap let alone shoot for the appropriate races you mention acs in your examples but its the minnie boats i fear the most as a td pilot due to the utility highs used for neutsadd in drone boats and missiles assault missiles make small ships cry manual flying kite the pilot around 23km in a small ship makes the range script meh and the tracking speed useless since you need to keep up and the recent agility nerf tds really arent overpowered the right setup andor manual flying destroys a gang of td frigate sized hullsif you are going to complain about a race hurting from tds it is not minmatar by any means utility slots for neuts and lots of drones does not a ship afraid of frigate hulls with tds make neuts are the counter to td small ships if you have equal ship sizes webs allow for disengaging due to slowing down the chaser maybe amarr have it rough with no drones nor utility highs but 1 you can always still put a neut there2 lots of people say that amarr as op atm but look theres a counterfinally this really applies to small gang warfare larger gang tds become rather useless since if the targets separate they can find something to snipe or focus multiple webs on one tding ship at a time and destroy it
did i claim i was killing hurricanes in a rifter its possible in a jag but i dont think the rifter has it in itno i said tds are effective against autocannons even inside 10kmwebs do not help you to completely disengage webs help you to get out of that initial 10kms range if they are still putting damage on you and the same speed once unwebbed you wont end up getting the required 24km away from them neuts only help you inside of 12kmapparently the majority of the community is fine with tds being as effective as they are on unbonused ships whatever i thought i would point it out that they are a little too effective on undonused shipsedited to remove unnecessary crap
just fyi my post was supposed to relate to all frigate sized hulls not just the rifter
vs mega 2 range scripts and orbit at 710k game overif he gets too close switch to tracking speed and rub hull with it tracking is  at that range without the td already the 2 td will make it toast
when jumping after you set destination to another solar system you see your current location and your destinationwhat i want is the name of my bookmark label location where i am at be displayedi have many bookmarks in a belt but i forget many times at which one i am at  i can always write it down i know but then i could also write down my current system location but they decided to show current location as useful
there was a thread about this here but it was closed due to inactivity and wasnt naming enough ships to show how much it is needed
cruor  vs sentinel or hyenathe cruor is a very unique frigate a unique mix of webifier and nosneut bonuses makes it strange or very appealingbut its hard to take advantage of the web bonus with only 2 meds its impossible to either mount many nos

this i see it now as a sorta rubber ducky in space however i do miss the antenae of the old heliosthe more important issue with the helios is the stupid 2 highs and 5 mids make that 3 highs and 4 mids please also fix damps or the damp bonus ships so i might fly the keres and have my antenae back a 5 bonus on the new improved through scripts crappy damps is crap crappity crapedit no antenae on the keres either ok that does it im supporting this just because of the lack of green antenae and dont bring up the ishkur i loved the old swirly antenae now they just look stupid
the point is that the astrometrics frigates are cargo frigates at the same time the imicus hull does look way more like cargo than the maulus hull doesgranted the imicus hull does look weird but you can manage to love a ship regardless or even for its pitiful looks give it a try also the model change did work out very well for the cheetah if swapping the models back would affect all of the changed ones i would strongly oppose it imo the vigil hull looks at least as weird as the imicus one and i didnt yet manage to find something likeable about it
better off using an interceptor esp as gallentenot only do they have better survivability over an eas but theyre a prerequisite for another useful ship type interdictors oh and they can point something the same distance the keres can
ambulation does seem to be wasted development effort its a game feature that barely justifies itself and offers little to no usefulness
dont get me wrong i totally agree with the idea and i was quite vocal about that in icelandthe issue specifically requests that the ownership system is changed let everybody on the killmail own a wreck we talked to ccp about it and its not possiblelet me state once again its a nice issue however given ccps initial responsethis isnt possible it seems like a waste of time

fix rockets hawk and vengance will be better aslo lol active tank rep bonus on a frigas for more bonuses for my already awesome harpy sure why not might as well use it to blow  up faster 
1 er they are frigates they are supposed to including this in the list is a joke2 fine lower the resistances a bit3 lol using the vengeance as a price comparison the least used af check ishkur prices lately 4 this is true for any ship5 again not an argument against or for just a statement true for any shipyour arguments are weak except perhaps the resistancest2 ships have 4 bonuses except af fix it plz ccp lower resistances to placate the whiners if you must
which is why they are now red to you it is still not an aggressive act only those who commit aggressive acts are locked out of docking for 1 minute and guess what if he was committing an aggressive act he would be concordedyoure right hes now red to all wartargets of the person hes repairing youre right hes now red to all wartargets of the person hes repairingyoure wrong hes now red to all wartargets of the person hes repairingdont fight on station
so rr isnt considered an aggressive act is that what im hearingbut i can shoot them because they are assisting someone who is a wt to me did i get that one right as wellbottomline the rr ship becomes a valid target in which he can be destroyed by me for committing a nonaggressive act in support of someone who is a wt to meeither people are really stupid or they simply do not want to see their precious nonaggressing dual boxed rr fleet be put in its proper placeits very simple see if you can follow some commonsenseif i am allowed to legally engage someone and kill them then they must have done something to deserve it they must have in some way either directly or indirectly passively or actively performed an aggressive act or assisted someone in performing an aggressive act which is reason enough for them to become valid targets sooooo if thats the case why not apply the aggression timerbut heres the real solution for those people that have no commonsense and cannot see the logic in thissimply call the aggression timer something elseso people dont get wrapped on the word aggressionthere problem solved its no longer the aggression timer its now called the insert favorite term here timer
they have not committed an aggressive act against a playerthey have committed a friendly act on a target who is at war thus rendering them a viable target for 15minsthere is a huge differencethere are plenty of ways to counter neutral rr use them dont whine to have something nerf just because you cant counter itthat way
signedhowever privateer alliance uses neut reps constantly heres a few of priv neutrepping alts and theres plenty moremichal cill mirosan zivy terc mirrabellapb i know you mean well but you should clean up your own shop
awesome possum think it through hero think it throughdont let the word aggression get in the way the game mechanic says it allyou are a legitimate target the reason doesnt matter therefore you should be subject to the penalty timer formerly known as the aggression timernow that weve changed the name of the timer we can get past the fact that remote repping is a lol friendly nonaggressive act that only affects the person being repped and in no way gives them an advantage or influences the outcome in any waybtw ccp if you do change the name i want credit naming a region or solar system after me would be payment enough
whats to clean up  ive never endorsed or denounced rr  i do recall somewhere asking for the mechanics on aggression and jumpdock timer to be looked at  and how is bringing up this issue not trying to clean up shop reposting this for those that are too lazy or too dumb or both to read the original post i am asking for this  once again 1 look into the change of mechanics of rr and aggression 2 a 1 minute jumpdocking timer

ccp definately needs to revise their sound engine if it is working as intendedfrequent loss of combat sounds 3d map flipping between mono and stereo sound as its rotated quiet guns compared to other sounds without quieter guns checked and the list goes on as the ops links demonstrateso i support this thread time for ccp to get their thumb out on the sound issues and the logic that this is working is flawed if ccp still thinks so they need to have a good hard look at what they define as working as intended as their current definition means that sound is not supposed to work without flaws that cause frustration and disbelief by its playerssigned
thanks for the ingame evemail i have experienced the whole gamut of sound issues described am baffled as to why they have continued so long i have also replied a number of times in threads about these issues as have my altsi fully endorse csm taking this on with a fervor matched by a medieval crusade or a jihad onward brave knights allah akhbar

i support the csm to bring the sound issues to ccps attention we need to get it across that sound is important to many players of eve and not everyone simply turns the sound off as many are lead to believeit sounds like theres 12 guys on the sound team i think putting a bit more resources into sound would be niceas for needed features the single most needed feature is giving an option for sound to be heard from the ship no matter where your camera is zoomed out to actually id like to hear sounds at my ship and at the camera so for example if im watching an enemy ship orbit id hear the missile fire and a few seconds later id hear it hit this allows sound to give situational awareness that even the hud sometimes cant provide
sound improvementsfixes are needed i use a 51 surround sound headset better sound more consistant sound would be much appreciated
i like the idea of crews one it makes sense two everybody complains about somebody getting a free lunch and having to pay for or support a crew fixes that ccp has already provided cosumables and commodities that look exactly like something that is intended for a crew foodstuffs supplies booze dancers party ship you get the idea crews can also fit into the costconsequence concept that makes this game popular and challenging also they would be an isk sink for both the economy cutting inflation and an isk sink for all players that takes the endless isk machine element out of the game that also damages the economy here is 02 isk from me on this for this that could help the crews concept 1 crews need supplies and commoditys that keep them alive taking up cargo space 2 the longer in space the more tired less efficient a crew is no more free lunch in wh exploitation 3 running out of supplies means a starving and demoralized crew which means a less efficient chip the ships stats should suffer4 crews would need consumer goods spirits etc to be more happier therefore items sticked up for needs and items for morale would be different and a pilot would have to balance this 5 crews are lost or reassigned when a ship is destroyed therefore it is more incentive to not get a ship blown up so often this could balance the ship capability between the careful missioner running lowsec with an experienced crack crew and a pirate who loses ships and crews constantly and has a ship staffed with green horns6 players who lose a lot of ships would have to pay more for a crew than a player with a better reputation who wants to work for a captain who loses scores of ships it would cost more therefore those who fly poorly would be punished for it 7 to keep with the storyline amarr ships could have slaves but the drugs used to control them actually mean something in the game and become sought after as commodities making drug running a career in eve which seems like it was once intended but never picked up 8 crews should have drug boosters like capsuleers but of course there is legality addiction etc 9 for the drama when a ship is at that level of structure where it loses control it would be interesting to see escape pods punching out but use of smartbombs and killing crew wholesale would at this point be a heinous security hit

still the best running idea to date on poss
well you were describing what would happen if there were more wardecs but really that is a description of the current realityin the current situation the 3rd forces only have to worry about 1 target while the fw need to worry about all 3rd forcesthe less wardecs rather then more wardecs approach could work but surely there is a balance that doesnt involve locking 3rd forces outas for alliances the sister corp setup doesnt work all that well it becomes a hassle when you need those pilots for defence of a wardecd parent corp in certain situations it becomes necessary to transfer all pilots from one corp to another to get around the games limitations kinda defeats the purpose of the corps even being related in the first place an alliance wrapping these very much related corporations would make the whole setup a lot easier to manage while opening up options for greater industrial support of fw
the damp bonused ships should have the strength bonus for both lock time or range reduction increased to 75 or 10but sadly that wouldnt even be enough to get me to fly them the grid and cap suck too add to it that a ceptor can do as good or better job tackling and maybe a whole rethinking of these ships is in order

as much as i think the concept proposed by the op is horrible since this is a multiplayer game you probably need to look a bit further out mining ships industrial ships they do not have a primary focus on shooting stuff making pretty explosions but like every ship in eve they have an inherent design to participate in pvp for a big part through teamwork againbesides i have seen plenty l33t wannabee pvp nano or long range roam get creamed by carebear ships over the years think outside the sandboxnow on topic the proposal is pretty much something between a pos gun and a sentry drone which uses consumables in order to let people be more afk then alreadywell the ganker in me says cool the more sleeping targets the betterbut come on please use a little teamwork stay active a little every seen a mad gang of barges eating a belt with drones  sentries packed and cloaked tacklers around the belt not to mention the scouts in the neighbouring systems
heres the kind of change i would supportremove the rof bonus from all minmatar battleships modify all large projectiles with 25 increased rof add a new bonus to ships that replaced rof bonus a new bonus that tries to make minmatar more interesting a bonus that is neither tank nor gank related
alas i must say im minamtar and it all i fly if i had known what i know now about minmatar ships i would have never chosen this race yes my maelstrom is one of the best lvl4 mission running battleships around with lvl5 skills but fails misserably as a pvp ship either as a long range or short range shooter 1400s for the fail acs have no tracking before the flame yes ive tracking rigs fitted i have however fitted a tempest for class 35 wormholes that works ok but tbh the dominix is better suited for this role after many fits and trying various options ccp should put in character creation if you want to pvp do not choose this race
something interesting not related to tank or gankbeing the noob i still am i really cant see there being anything elsewhile ships shouldnt be equal or the same they should be viable in the roles required to fill in fleets or smaller groupsthis thread seems to be mainly about autocannons but should be applicable to both artillery and autocannons quite simply minmatar ships cant really fill the roles that is common in fleetsglaringly obvious in sniperfights but also in close range since they in general has the worst tanks of all large shipsthat minmatar has some of the best small ships doesnt really apply since you cant balance a fleet around having rifters being the best frigate when you are up against a fleet sniping at 150kmso what kind of boost should they get which makes them useful to bringecm doesnt make sensesensors does that change anything or make senseleaves speedmanouverability does it affect anything on larger ships given that ccp seems to continously have been reducing both on large shipsim just curious what area would you boost that isnt tank or gank related as nigh on everything on ships are tank or gank related in some way or the other
20 per level increase in projectile weapon capacity
i would like to reference 3 active threads on the subjectships and modules  tempest needs changingfeatures and ideas discussion  minmatar battleships and their rolesfeatures and ideas discussion  how bad ac really are proof inside
i wouldnt mind something else as an optionhere are the problems as i see it thoughminmatar are designed for close combat they are generally the fastest most maneuverable smallest sig radius and only race with three close range weapon variants the problem is that there are very few examples of this being a successful design philosophy because its rarely enough of an advantage to get them over the proverbial hump even worse is when they are not the best at these categorieslook at the successful frames like the rifter its 19 faster than the next fastest frigate 8 smaller sig radius than the next smallest and 9 less inertiacompare that to a failure like the tempest its 14 faster 15 smaller signature radius and 45 less inertiathe problem is what works on a frigate doesnt necessarily work on a battleship they just dont fill the same role in a fleet these additional stats and the bonuss are nice but when its squaring off against three frames that can be great tanks its just not enough its the weakest tank with the weakest gunseven worse is that other than directly changing the ships stats any skill or module options open up the possibility of making other good minmatar ships overpowered with the exception of bringing acs up to snuff if you remove the rate of fire bonus the dismal dps gets lower i would love to see a module that reduces signature radius but that could significantly alter the playing field it is the only ewa that has no counter this could actually do the trick for the failing missile boats and minmatar ships however if you make it a high slot it further nerfs the dps of the minmatar ships if you make it a med slot it hurts the generally crappy tank and with the fitting nightmare on minmatar ships a low slot means sacrificing a damagetracking mod or sacrificing at the damage or tank level in high or midslot fittings not to mention how this would effect on the other races ships if they were easier to kit this would be a nonissue but of course they are also the hardest to kitgenerallyalmost the whole fleet is a mess imho the weakness of large acs is most of the problem for the bss though
just a quick reminder first remember if you support this topic select the support this topic check box you can go back and select it later as welli think a direct comparision needs to be addressed so that the issue can be seen more clearlythe t2 mega pulse laser versus t2 800mm autocannonsadvantages has a higher damage modifier 5x the optimal range instant clip reload ammo rarely needs reloadedequals rate of fire fittings requirements are within 5disadvantages 25 less tracking 50 less falloff uses capacitort2 neutron blaster cannon versus t2 800mm autocannonadvantages larger clip much higher damage modifier almost by 33 higher optimal range 75 longer optimalequal rate of fire fitting requirements are within 5 of each other near equal tracking hybrid superior by 001 radsecdisadvantages 40 less falloff uses capacitort2 seige missile launcher versus t2 800mm autocannons a full comparision with the torp launcher will take more time than i have right nowadvantages easier fitting requirements never misses ammo is purechangeable damage not divided by various damage typesequal no cap usedisadvantages almost double rate of fire shorter overall range not instant damage
i wouldnt put it in terms of rate of fire compare their unbonused dps
the rate of fire is just the same for all three turret systems  788 base missile system is 1440 base acs get no advantages in that regard over either hybrids or pulse lasers
as a minmatar pilot by choice i have to support this minmatar artillery and autocannons need a buff but especially autocannons the easy way to fix this would be to drop the terribly small clip sizes for artillery and to improve the actually performance of large acs either by improving the optimal but preferably by improving both optimal and falloff it doesnt have to be a huge amount but 5 to both would be a positive improvementthe upside for ccp is that they wouldnt have to have their statistician ask embarrassing questions as to why no one flies minnie bsesps for good measure fix the typhoons armour 5 here would be much appreciated as well

not supporteda cloaked ship cannot do much except look around  and thats assuming a covops all noncovops cloaked ships cannot do anythingmost of the desire to fix cloaking like this comes from people who just have to have that killmail the sort that will camp a station for days waiting for someone to undock a cloaked ship in their system makes them go into jan brady mode and its the easiest form of griefing this type to be cloaked and just sit there the better way is to remove local so they wont know anything is there at all that will help themof course it might seem like it makes things worse to leave cloaking alone and get rid of local but then the jan bradys and killmail addicts may actually experience the same feeling that everybody they target is already feeling and that would be a good thing leave cloaking alone get rid of local and if thats not good then dont undock
more balanced than the last time not that it was bad before fully support losing the skill if you change your mind though i would add a pop up warning if you are about to lose it otherwise we end up seeing omg i lost it and what happened to the skill i injected threads every day
naturally
wouldnt it just be easier if you could inject any skill book as long as you had already injected the prerequest this way youd still be able to train your plan without being there to inject the skill book after all prerequest have been doneif you then try and train the skill without finishing the level needed on the prerequest you then get the warning saying other skills need finishing 1st unlessed there already in the training queue
easier yes rational noyoull be allowing pilots to inject skills sequentially without restraintthere would be no more risk of forgetting to get that book or transportation of skill books from safer areas to dangerous areasthe only way it keeps it reasonably balanced is allowing pilots to inject the skill in question so long as you finish the preq within the 24 hour queue period of the window thus allowing you to train the skill you wish to train nextif you dont finish training that skill the new skill is deletedi think it would also be fair to suggest that you could change your mind about the new skill but only if your going to finish training the preg regardless in that case you just remove it and insert what you want to trainall of which must happen within in the 24 hour window

i know im throwing gas in the fire but i couldnt resist you posted a proposal about locking this forum to players who have less than 30 days of age on the basis they are posting stupid threads and then you make a proposal that has already been brought to the csm before and even admit you didnt bother searching the forum before you didwhos the noob

sorry for posting here as a new player i saw the thread that suggested players be at least one month old before posting topics in here but i felt this warranted a discussion and was directed to start a topic on it in the forums by isd tipenemy issue is with the god mode of the concorde police i find it very unrealistic and abusive that players cannot under any circumstances win a war against the concorde police someone stated that in order to defeat a single concorde ship you must be exploiting i realize without this rule a high security zone would be at risk but it is just bad design to stand no chance whatsoever in a war with the concorde police all zones should be able to be controlled by the players
i half agree i still think there should be some high sec space as is but it should be centered around the main empires not just the four main races but the khanid and the other sub races too each of these empires space should be 100 surrounded by low sec space to achieve this my suggestion would be to purely limit concord to 8 9 and 10 space alone adding 5 6 and 7 to low sec territory this would still leave ample space for carebears but amount to massive profits for daring traders who would risk region to region travel
the proposal i made is to prevent instaalt spammingobviously your not that type of personality so dont take it personalas for concordthis is a mechanic that has been in place for yearsits also in the eula to debate something like that is not going to win any pointsthere are many ways to win a war with any number of playersyou just have to find the one that suites you best1 make a corporation and wardec them2 suicide gank them youll get concorded but that doesnt stop you from doing the act3 hunt them down in lowsecnullsecthere are many creative ways to get it done but asking ccp to turn off god mode as far as concord wont workthis is eve online not pvponline not carebear online or hello kittyits for all styles of play of all kindsif it gives favor too much to one side you effectively ruin the game on a grand scalewelcome to the classic war between those who wish to kill unendingly and those who wish to make a living off of selling the very weapons of war
pretty much what drake said i think youll find this proposal gets split pretty much down two lines  those of us who enjoy playing eve the way it is and the people who would like to turn it into a demolition derbythe problem is neither group can survive by itself they each depend on the existence of the other and this is a fine balance that ccp has managed to walk quite well truth be told what youre proposing would essentially turn the game in goonswarm online  which is not a game i am interested in playing
my issue is not with declaring war on other players i am talking about declaring war on concord themselves policing should be done by the players not some artificial gods which are invulnerable for a new player like me it destroys the immersion and just leaves me feeling like im paying to be a slave under a tyrant that cannot be defeatedthats not the playerdriven environment that the game advertises itself as
the problem is that players cannot really police eve online just like raph koster experienced when he tried to have playerdriven justice in ultima online he found that it was impossible due to the fact that there cannot be permanent playerenforced consequences for those that break the lawin real life if you commit a crime you go to jail if youre caughtin an online game you cannot have players ban other players from the game and even if you could that person can always come back with another ip address and other account
your taking it a little too literal herefirst off under whose judgment and authorityeve online is not the wild west where you bribe the local sherif and get away with murderas a new player your overwhelmed with the game and all the things you have to learn just to fly the damn ship your not interested in running for your life and avoiding the local pirate gang while getting robbed blindconcords sole purpose in life is to enforce the high sec systems to allow those players who are not interested or not yet ready for the life of lowsecnullsec to function as they see fitkeep in mind high sec is not safe its just safertmthe player driven environment you seek is only achievable in nullsec there you will find no law enforcement and you can pretty much do whatever the hell you wantotherwise the player driven environment is mostly economic based at best everything you buy use destroyer tends to be manufactured or pilfered or looted by a player like yourselfwell not everything but most things such as your ship for startersall in all high sec is more like a starting pointi suggest you take some time to figure out the aspects of the game before you cast judgment on the system as it is now
playerdriven justice actually worked in the early days of uoi was there if you angered too many people you would be hunted down relentlesslyin real life if someone has the capability to amass a gigantic army no police force could stop them because police arent invulnerable in real life im not talking about removing concord only to have them able to be fought with a large enough force it should be extremely difficult to pull off but not impossible like it is nowim also not talking about giving players the ability to ban other players that would never work bans should only be given to hackers and exploiters
sorry to be blunt but this is not the game for you if thats what your seeking as a wholeall i can suggest is that you head on down to 00 space and you can enjoy the total freedom you seekbut that will never take place in high sec however there are ways to get revenge if you  off alot of people enough trust me there are waysjust isnt as direct as you think it isreputation and honor are very valuable commoditiesand tend to come in short supplyconcord is not the one you should be worried about 
ok go out in rl and amass an gigantic army to take over the us concord is not only police it is an army backed by all the empires as they want a certain level of safety as already stated in other threads if you want a realistic concord you should be capable of escaping or killing the local patrol but then all your empire clones would be destroyed all your empire assets would be seized by the police you would be hunted and attacked at every gate till you are caught and locked in a cell for 40 years or permanently killed as that kind of realistic effects would destroy the game ccp has chosen unbeatable concord and little long term consequences of your actions
raph also refused to implement a meaningful standings system in uo which made it impossible for players to tell at a glance who was friendly or not someone commented above about goonswarm online but the truth is that life in goon controlled space is way less complicated than in empire if someone is blue to me i can probably trust them if theyre not i certainly cant theres no weird npc mechanics to deal with just real justice served up by real people if a goon screws a goon hes out end of story
the problem with this is the fallout that would ensue from fleets being impervious to concord i would give it two hours from the time the patch that removed concords invulnerability till jita was a raging warzone from gate to gate
thats just the tip of the icebergin all reality the market would literally crash maybe not all at the same time or in the same daypvpers constantly ignore just how 1 stupid carebear can impact the entire gamethumbs butterfly effectthats valid theory folks no doubt bout it lot of people tend to have tunnel vision these days
those are good points youre right i know a huge war would break out but only because the mechanic was there to begin with it set up artificial boundaries which has impacted every other aspect of the game if concord was controllable from the start the wars would have been fought already and the corporate alliances could have established their own empires throughout the universe
and that would bge an absolutely horrible state of affairs i join the game as a new player and before i even know how to fly my ship im being accosted by some corporate pressgang saying if i dont fly with them ill be shot down everytime i undockyoud kill the game plain and simple
no it didnt i was there too while its possible our experiences were different due to the sharded nature of uo i dont think so the reds banded together quite effectively with no shards in eve it would be even less effective here anarchy leads directly to tyranny when the strong take over because they can
its ridiculous how some people here fail at arguing and providing arguments based on facts
its a gamestop repeating yourselfeve is pvp nonconsensual pvp is pvpthere are already consequences to shooting someone youre not allowed to stop trying to make it impossible because thats what youre aiming forthis isnt wow there are no safe zones except docked where you can get your character to and no ones allowed to hit you anymoreif you dont want pvp log even docked playing the market you have people out for your blood
im well aware of the fact that its a game thats why i am using the approved process to bring something to the attention of the players representatives that i dont agree with in the game mechanics if this was real life id have sued someone alreadydespite what other people may have said this is not what i am aiming for i am simply aiming to make suicide gankers suffer the same moment of pause when they undock as i do it only seems fair miners have to decide what to mine to maximize profits manufacturers have to decide what to manufacture for the same reason why should the suigankers get a pass on that decision just because theyre being subsidized by the systemall i want is for the suicide gankers to have to think before they shoot why are you so against leveling the playing field
last i checked this thread is about revoking of insurance for getting concorddwhat the  does this have to do with pvpstop derailing the thread or go make your own thread about pvping because this has nothing to do with it
for some suicide gankers the idea is to make them not want to mine that is the whole point in some instance yeah thats it with the prevalence of macros invading every system the only way to get the point across is to make their hulks and mackinaws go boom every 15 minutes they get the point and go somewhere else oh and btw you dont need to spend a lot of money to pop a tanked hulk or mack its almost a science and looting the wrecks is easy too including your teams wrecks you just have to know what you are doing for a lot of gankers that do this professionally removal of the insureance payment wont be that big of a deal hulks and macks still go boom and the salvage from one of those is in the millions if you get the intact stuff plus the modules it all sells
i dont recall quoting you when i made that posttoo many people here are equating in game mechanics to rl principles who cares what a rl cop or insurance company would do the cops and insurance companies dont make the game or the rules ccp doesyou seem to forget that a hulk can be suicide ganked by 23 destroyers in cheap t1 crap for a total loss of  even without insurance its not going to stop anythingconsidering there are already plenty of ways in game right now to keep from being suicide ganked why are you trying to get in game mechanics changed just to penalize one small section of the game play the game
the heart of this issue is that the proponents dont want nonconsensual pvp in empire
this
again what does this have to do with insurance voiding due to getting conocrded
i never suggested that it would stop suicide ganking i suggested that it might the gankers think before they act if they choose not to thats not really my problemyou very nicely dodged answering the question you quoted so ill reask it why are you bound and determined to not have this one mechanic changed since it does indeed impact such a small part of the game i mean if its so small it shouldnt matter right keep it as is change it  shouldnt make any difference since its just a tiny little part of the gamei just want the job the gankers choose to follow to actually reflect its true cost instead of having that occupation be subsidizedunless youd like to propose to ccp that they start seeding the market with free minerals so my chosen occupation can be subsidized too
isnt insurance not the same as concord meaning the insurance company could care less what you do with your ship theyre still going to pay for it if you have the coverage
who are less than 1 month old as an player on a per toon basisif youve not noticed weve been getting hit with spam posts of a nasty natureall you need to do is make an alt and you can instantly start posting without restraintand as a forum admin myself not these boards obviously i happen to know that your not exactly able to respond ondemandand its going to get out of hand until ccp decides to replace this miserable excuse of a forum board with something decent phpbb anyone let alone any others i think it might make things a little better and require these idiots to put time and effort into there attackshell this could apply to all boards except those needed by rookie pilots for that matterim sure a lot of you are going to whine and rant about alts but 1 month well at least you had 30 days to think about itflame away
how bout longer  people whove actually have some experience with the game who are suggesting changes in it supported
longer would be painful i think 30 days is fair but i get your impressionperhaps 2 to 3 months for assembly hall as far as making new topicsbut after 30 days you can respondproblem is its a bit of a can of worms issue
this

i admit that some newbies will sometimes post stupid things in this forum but in general its pretty good i dont agree with your proposal at all i think everybody whether they are a veteran player or a new player deserves a voice in the assembly hall if you feel that certain posts should be moved or closed theres a nice little report link you can use i have used it several times to report spam and moderators usually respond within the hour if they also judge the post to be inappropriatestop being such an elitist its not because you have been playing for more than a few months that your ideas are necessary better than a new playeri have been playing this character for about 2 months and ive made countless posts in this forum most of which have received positive support are you saying i shouldnt have been able to post at all who are you to decide
the spam problems are happening on every board not just ah and i dont see it removing the problem of stupid proposals because most of those are made by vets anyways
your calling me an elitist and yet you have the odacity to make such a baseless postthis has nothing to do with knowledge or experience it has everything to do with keep the garbage from hitting the forums at full forceive been playing a year thank you very much so i suggest you keep that in mind next time you start spitting firei dont know anything more than most pilots but i know enough to know that most people who start playing this game for the first 2 months think they know everything and start spitting all sorts of garbage on the boardsive had to stop screaming outright to keep ccp from nailing my mouth shut  o pi also know that some people know better and dont do such foolish things but they are not you and they are not the majoritythis is to make sure that the privilege of posting here is done by someone who has put at least 30 days and not some random half assed idiot screaming about getting ganked because someone stole his jet can
no it doesnt but it does eliminate about 50 to 75 of the problems that tend to come within the first 30 days  o
lol man calm down its not your place to decide who should be allowed to post in this forum periodright and youre going to tell me that this comment is not elitistish youre basically telling me i should be showing you some kind of respect because you have been playing for 1 yearokay ill stop you right there again who are you to define what constitute a bad post and what is not who are you to judge just because you dont agree with some proposals doesnt mean they shouldnt have been posted in the first placeif you really feel that a thread doesnt have its place in this forum use the damn report link and let the moderators decide its their job not yours
agree this is a good idea six months would be a good time imho
arent you just being a bit hypocritical hereand your taking this a little too seriously i suggest you back up and reread my post carefullyi said people like you who know not to post garbagy things are not like youthe greater majority tend to go off the wallsnow if you cant take a compliment like that you got some serious issuesi also said that just because ive played for a year doesnt make me any smarter than the next guy i also said people whove only played for a couple months tend to be very greenyou dont need to bow down to me or anyone else but i sure as hell wont bow down to your attitudethe issue is preventing instaspam alts not stopping people from being able to postget it straight and stop assuming
i doubt there is a need for shc approaches like ban 08s or similarwhat the assembly hall needs is better moderation really to differentiate threads sofar the assembly hall is doing much better then many people anticipated tbh but sometimes you see something wierd or something that just does not fit in with requirements for here
for those unfamilar ccp is working on some sort of system called cosmos to improve game communications  email contact list etc my biggest point here regards voice communicationsi think currently the eve voice program is run separately on a different cluster then the main client does i say this because ive had the game totally desync but have eve voice work until i am forced to restart the clientif ccp made eve voice an external application you would gain the security of authentication  corp  alliance based  with the added stability of not being directly tied to the main clientadding this feature to out of game evemail access and chat you could really add a valuable feature to the gamei do not initially see any game mechanic downsides since almost everyone uses an out of game voice program at the moment since eve voice is tied to the stability of the main client and you just cant lose voice comms if the cluster freezes up
o shadowandlight agree with you totally
i dont know about making it oog but i do know eve voice is vastly terrible for a lot of my corp we use vent as a resultmaking eve voice oog would be no different than using vent or teamspeak kinda a waste of timebut it would be some sort of improvement for certain
what about eve voice doesnt work well for your corp i find it pretty useful with more security and the voice quality is excellent
welcome to the 25 to 40 of the games populationthe problem is eve voice doesnt take into account every conceivable hardware configuration let alone securityand considering the ui sucks ass when it comes to making adjustments vent is a far better choice and in all honesty security is superior with vent due to the fact its on an entirely different server that wont go down when someone trips over an ethernet cable killing the db clusters running eve that and voice comms can be adjusted by rankteamspeak doesnt have the nice features that vent has but they are working version 3 and its still better off as far as functionalitydont get me wrong eve voice is a great thing from what ive been told but when the vast majority of your corporation cant get it to worktheres a major problem thereso as ive said any improvement is welcome here
not supported if you want true oog voice over communications then use teamspeak or ventrilothey cant make the voice client separate from the game client for the simple reason that voice channels work with chat channels when you join voice you actually join a specific channel corp fleet alliance etc an oog client wouldnt be able to easily sync with that info so the problem would still be the same if the main game client would be crash or disconnect the voice client would lose sync and disconnect from the channel
not sure if all this is possible but id certainly like to try to get it supported
speaking from experience of probing over 100 missionsss in lowsec with an alt using cov ops 4 probing skills all at 4 and sisters gear even for a battleship it would take me 23 scans thats after finding target on directional  without directional it takes even more and moving probes in between scans is another 1020seconds added on the 6seconds scan time per scan  so were talking about atleast 40seconds of probs in space if you dont scan atleast once every 30seconds in lowsec you deserve to diealso unless the piratesmission busters come in with a cloaker youll see them on short range scan go 121 au on scanner and if there is a gate there usually is the cloaker will uncloak regardless in non gate missions you can always drop a can on the warp in and be safe seriously i agree that the hunted should have a chance  but that doesnt mean that the hunter needs to be gimped  it means the hunted needs to stop being a ing noob and understand that lowsec  danger so be on your ing toesnot supported supporting the removal of bad words filter though cause thats the only way to get to carebears apperntly 
supported it really is ridiculously fast
ahh look its exlegion againstill trying make the game catering youafter failing in your first tryyou did improveno attention csmit didnt take you 2 days to notice you didnt support your own proposalbutyou still totaly fail at grasping the probing mechanics it only takes 5 sec thats a joke right  deploying will take as long as thisbet you never used a probe to scan someone down in your whole eve life please continue failing at playing eveoh btw not supported
relax my man im not posting this request to specifically  you off why are privateers and exprivateers on such a haterage most of the time  first i still would love for a csm to at least ask if the current probing mechanics is supposed to overlap in function with the onboard scanner second yes i probe although not yet an expert i probe plenty mostly exploration sites but lately ive been interested in probing ships as i feel it is a little overpowered in its present form and would like to add my opinion on how to make it better for all sides involved not just the prober but in the end it is just an opinion that i dont expect everybody to accept or like what i do expect is mature responses from all sides of the fence in other words if you have nothing nice to say but still feel compelled to add something to the discussion a simple no support will do now if you feel like adding an objective justification for your response that would be appreciated  to get back on track ill admit im not yet at the 5second probeandretract time yet my best record stands at 7 seconds and change after letting my onboard scanner do most of the work which on its own isnt too far off but keep in mind some of my probing skills are still at level 4 and i am not using sisters combat core probes i expect to be fully capable of probing someone down in less than 6 seconds within a few weeks maybe a month this translates to an alert prey having to spam his scan button every 5 to 6 seconds to even suspect theyre being probed
the idea of fleet formations has been thrown around here and there over the past 5 years usually after some discussion to decide what fleet formations would even be the idea is put at the bottom of ccps priority list and put off for a future release the reason for this is no one ever comes up with a reason the 100s of man hours shouldnt be spent elsewhere why program in a complicated new part of the game unless it really adds something those people could of been making something more important for the gamethis post is to put forward an idea that clearly outlines a goal for formations and hopefully gain public support to push the idea through to ccp in a way that makes it seem wroth the time and money for the outcome as i think ive come up with a way fleet formations could be used to enhance eve and not just become a sort of gimmicksafety in numbersfleet formations will be of two types each serving a different goal with different strengths and weaknesses keeping formations from becoming something have to do to stay competitive while still serving to give tactical advantages if used correctly to enter a formation one simply invites other to join or others right click on someone in range in their fleet and select join in formation this way a player can hide behind anotherthe two types will beoffensiveanddefensiveoffensiveso your flying with a small fleet of 4 mates in cruisers when you come across a fleet of 4 ships 1 hauler2 ecm boats1 battle cruiser with remote rep you try to take down the ecm 1st but they keep taking out your senors and seems like there is just to way to break the hauler and get the yummy loot yolk inside what do you do you have everyone in the fleet form up into an offensive formation this gives flight control to the leader and is done by right clicking the person you want to join much like forming a fleet right click join offensive formationyour 4 ships now all share their sigradius decreasing their ability to avoid attacks due to transversal velocity however what you lose in sigradius you gain in senor strength adding 50 of the next ships senor strength type in the order down with stacking penalties so you put your highest at the top as to not lose the big bonuses the offensive formation also increases the tracking of the whole formation by the level of skill the leader has in the offensive formation skillyou charge the ecm ship together the ecm ship is unable to break your locks and you can take the two ecm ships out however due to the increased sig radius you lose 1 cruiser while you were fighting the enemy fleet noticed you got into formation and took it as an moment to split up by forming a formation you lowered the area you could cover and the ecm ships lured you away form the hauler and the battlecruiser the ecm ship and the battle cruiser get away next time you should of keep another ship out free with lots of eccm to keep the hauler locked down defensiveso your flying around with 2 ecm ships1 hauler1 battlecruiser 1 logisticsyou already lost your last ecm ships to a pirate gang of cruisers so youve now brought a logistics ship along with you whose pilot has high formation skills suddenly you are attacked its a group of 5 cruisers back for bloodyou waste no time in having everyone form up behind the logistics ship into a defensive formationhowever in a defensive formation the smaller ships are allowed to set orbit speed or fly in a straight line following the defensive leader while in a defensive formation all of the involved ships combine their sigradius minus skill level 3per skill and becoming easier to hit like while in offensive however in a defensive formation when the enemy locks on to one of the ships they lock on to one big target that is all of the ships combined
more
the fleet has combined their signatures into one to confuse the enemy fleetwhen shot on a group of ships in a defensive formation will take damage randomly based on size thus bigger ships get hit more offen while smaller ships get hit less often thus hiding behind the signatures of the larger shipsthis protects the ecm ships and logistics form focused fire the ecm ships are able to break locks however logistics ships can not rep consistently either most of thier cycles go to healing the large ships so as damage trickles down the the ecm ships he is unable to to heal them more pirates join the fray and start forming into separate offensive formations they bring in 2 offensive groups of 3 cruisers each and one defensive formation with a logistics ship behind a battleship your fleet tries in vain to take out the logistics but the battleship gives it too much cover you are unable to run and slowly die to the incoming fire the smaller ships watch as their protection is blown away  like the shell of an artichoke you die in a glory of fire and pulp but at least you werent focus fired to death did i mention defensive formations share the highest warp core strength of one ship so one warp scram and your whole little group cant run awayon the plus side you could bring one ship with a ton of warp strength but then you would get multiple ships scrambling you anyways imagine almost dying in your frigate in a large fleet battle so you fly towards a group of battleships and quickly duck in behind them taking the focused fire off your back and letting you escape imagine forming together 10 frigates to spread out focused fire but if you get to many together the dreads on the field see you as a giant titan sized glowing red dot and start one shooting your frigate fleet imagine forming into a death ball of offensive might and breaking through ecm and causing mass alpha damagethe idea here is to have the mecanhic itself balance out the issue of forming mass death balls by getting balanced formations of big and small ships you can raise the sig radius to levels that arent too high but still protect the smaller ships from larger weaponsso one battleship and 1 frigate the frigate will almost never get hit with the battleship being 90 of the hit chance and the frigate being 10but one battleship and 10 frigates the chance of hitting one of the frigates would become equal thus you need another battleship to cover the smaller shipsobviously this idea needs a lot of work like what other bonuses should offensive formations get should thier be different types of formations in each
summary defensive formations to allow for smaller ships to duck behind larger ships or just to simply have focused fire forced out among many of the same sized shipsoffensive formations to cut through ecm boost tracking and combine alpha damage timing also offensive formations formations are based on range to leave a formation simply take control by issuing a new movment command and get out of range this allows for formations to be freeform and keeps the control of whats going on in each players hand if you were forced to not be able to move at all you would be unable to run awayalso in free form formations smaller ships could keep up thier orbits as long as they stayed in range formation size would be dependent on range
no
im sorry that you spent so much time writing something so elaborate  but i cannot support the idea you came up witha cause this isnt a tacticalccstrategy gameb cause other than the obvious difficulties applying it ingame it breaks the sandbox youve obviously played too many rts games but the only reason formations give bonuses is cause you cant control each piece individually with enough precision since in eve everyone can fly a ship in theory you should be able to utilize fleets to protect the people in the backhave people in different rangeshave a front tackle group with snipers in the backetc some of this theory can work in game obviously tacklers and snipers or ranges and some could have worked had collision detection worked better and the bullets flew in paths instead of just hitting but ofc this is quite hard to implement cause you cant manually control turrets or ships to an extent that this would be viabletldr versionformations are awesome and could work had ccp implemented manual shooting and movement and fixed the collision detection  but those quite like walking in stations are very very low in the priority list of a game with so many other bugs double overview bug for examplethe reason for this is no one ever comes up with a reason the 100s of man hours shouldnt be spent elsewhere  your reasons are unsatisfactory
i entirely agree with mashashige
i have to agree with the previous postersno support
as much as i love to force formation an fleet in parade formation for a fantastic screenshot the programming involved is just not worth it in light of the mass number of issues needing to be resolvedperhaps at a later day but that day is not nowand may never come 
theres a nice feature in the probe scanner where you can rightclick a given result and select ignore other results to mask everything elsethis works well when youre scanning using normal probes but not when youre using combat probes to scan for shipsthe filter only applies to the objects listed in the results at the moment you click the function that means every time a new ship enters the range of the probes it will be listed in the results on the next scan in order to filter those new ships out you have to find the one you wanted to scan in the first place and then rightclick again to ignore other results you have to do this every time you scan again and new ships show up this is extremely annoyingthis could easily be fixed by changing the filter system from an exclusion list to an inclusion list basically when youd rightclick a given result and click ignore other results it would translate into only show me this resulteither way something has to be done about this because right now that feature is not much use when scanning for ships
nevertheless a reminder to the ccp about the problem would be very appreciated as almost everyone in eve community is affected
supportedsome of the gallente station models are so borked that you couldnt bump someone off it with a mwd titan p
an official status update on this issue would definitely be appreciated

obviously it wouldnt just brute force all the passwords it knows maybe it would try the last known corp password then the last known alliance password of the pos then ask for the password i am sure some computer scientists can figure it out lol
no need to overthink this just have the client try resending the last password you entered if that password is incorrect you just enter a new one
only if the ability to fleet is disabled and overview settings dont allow standings to be shown either for the duration youre on your own bud annoyed anyone in your alliance lately watch out edit spelling note to self check spelling before hitting post
because imagine if someone plays a game different from how you it play the horrorit would mainly make sure they arent interested for the first 4 year in another pvp experience undocking and immediatly getting ganked by a large fleet
if you wanna gankkillslaughter nice faction ships just search in low sec or 00 youll find them there as well
carebearism is not playing the game its putting on a pink dress and singing im pretty oh so prettyhaving said that all those who complain about ganks and blobseve is a dark and harsh world youre supposed to feel a bit worried and slightly angry when you log in youre not supposed to feel like youre logging in to a happy happy fluffy fluffy lala land filled with fun and adventures thats what hello kitty online is forccp wrangler
i fixed your post no chargeasshat
lol personal simple answernosuggested amendment that might make me slightly interested have a day that does the opposite of this as well ie concord goes into lowsec and blows up the pirate aggressors there
most moons are not profitable to exploit so making a profit from that isnt as simple as it might sound
it is not only moon mining at the poses you can build supercapitals do simple and complex reactions every one of those activities give a revenue be it paying a lesser costs building your supercapitals than buying them or selling advanced materials at a higher price than the basic components so even barren moons if used the right way can give a profit if that is enough to make a difference depend on the corp organization
also r64s alone give an stupid amount of money for any alliance holding them they can fund fleet after fleet of bst2 cruisers for their members if they wanted to not that allways happensand the other moons would be profitable if eventually sov is moved to planets there is a lot of moon minerals flooding the market because all these sov claiming or reaction running poses
simple and complex reactions are not very profitable for the most partthere are 6 simple reactions that cover the costs and at most 5 complex that return enough profit to cover the large tower they are onof course it is a different matter if you hold the moons as they the profit margins can be higher but thats not the case and holding the good moons is most certainly not a 12 man jobsure a moon can return a profit but it is nowhere near what some seem to think
there is no point to wis eve is a game about internet spaceships the last thing i want is for my enemies and wts to have something to do as i camp them in a station
i do lvl 4 my missions in gallente space most of them are against serpentis and include multiple battleships the salvage is rediculous even from the battleships and im not talking about smaller shipscurious  the situation seem identical wait some week and we will see how the price change after the next patch

me wants to see an ishkur with scram range bonus inties would sh their pants
doublepost p
sorry i thought all you fellas were the whiners asking for a boost  so youre basically complaining that your af is too cheap i fly ishkurs and i can attest that i have never paid too much for one as for vengeances its because so many people are caught up in the boost rockets clrly they are broken bandwagon to realize that rockets arent meant to put out a ton of dps like blasters theyre meant to be an antifrigate platform which they do amazingly well as if youre dumb enough to get in blaster range of an ishkur then you deserve to lose your venge kill his drones then watch his tank melt to your rocketsincluding that afs are hard to hit is by no means a joke its an incredible tool and acts as a gigantic boost to their survivability and versatility hence 5 you can engage anything and leave if it goes sour whereas you couldnt do it as easily in a cruiser or bigger since its too easy to get scrammedwebbed if the other pilot knows what theyre doing
by now we know you dont agree with afs getting a 4th bonus tortugan
people should stop feeding the trollyou are not super pro by killing a lonly bs in a af the target simply was a noob or pve fitted if you doubt this you can check my killmails for afs that tryed to solo my megayou donUFFFDt even need drones for them the key is simply a neut rr works with any kind of ship and better for bigger ships since the got more bufferany kind of ship is effective when you bring bigger numbers by the ability to multitackle bigger ships are more effective since they can applay more dps and got more hp any kind of sigspeed tank of a frig becomes next to useless if you have several webs on them anywayor 1020 dronesif you donUFFFDt enter web range you will get preaty mutch owned by anything since you lack the buffer and at 20km you are a easy target even for bs gunsto afs actualy yes they could need a the 4 bonus to make them a more interesting ship classwolf enyo harpy retrebution should have a extra damage bonus they are ok in gangs to take down ceptorsa destroyer also performs well here with the drawback of beeing a better target for bigger shipswith this they also do better vs bigger targets like cruisers since the damage diffrence wouldnUFFFDt be this big anymore giving them a better chance to take them down before drones eaten thrue your tank or you run into serious cap issueseven without beeing neutedjaguar ishkur hawk vengance should have another bonus that helps them with tacklingtanking 5 signature radius reduction or 5 speed per level would be good since it helps the ship to reduce incomming damage and works with mwd and ab
seriously tortugan quit trying to say rockets are not broken its not that we want blaster dps out of them its that for the fitting reqs they should atleast outdamage 3 unbonused autocannons but they fail to even do that just about anything with a sar ii fitted can tank a vengeancethey are broken sure they shoot out to 10km but so do small pulse lasers also they are the only small turret  missile launcher that on average will have to reload before killing a frigateas for djego giving the vengeance another tanking bonus would be a bit overpowered those things tank like champs
if assisting a friend via rr is considered an aggressive act whos to say that using your own local reps isnt is your next suggestion going to be hi this nightmare came out and active tanked our whole fleet ccp pleaase nerf tanking so i may continue griefing miners kthxwhos supporting this change blobbers griefers and privateers all of the above whos opposing it people who actually know their sht and enjoy having a chance in hell of fighting outnumberedbottom line the current mechanic is fine how it is for several reasons1 rr is not an aggressive act just like running local reps vs running a warp scrambler rr is a defensive boost only2 there are numberous counters to remote rep try being creative about how you fight rr gangs in some cases more dps is best in others ewar is king 3 this would only serve to boost station blobbing by people like the privateer alliance and once again provide yet another nerf to small gang guerrilla style warfare4 everyone can use rr it has never been classified as a glitch an exploit or anything of the sort by ccp which seems to be the main argument for the change
dont take this personally but are you ed or just stupidin one situation you are repping yourself and in the other youre repping someone else theres nothing remotely the same about either situation see what i did there with remotelysomewhere theres a village missing its idiot maybe you should find your way back before they issue an amber alert
i dont support dockinggate aggro for repping the mechanic where the repper can be shot at in empire is enough
i too support removing rr in its entiretywell it may not be what was proposed but removing rr outright would solve the ops issue quite well
was running some numbers guys it seems that only ab frigate sized targets get damage reduction vs rage rockets provided the target is webbedmwd targets receive no damage negation once webbed and not very much before being webbedalso mwd frigates appear to receive no damage reduction or very little vs regular rockets even without being webbedinterceptors receive very good damage reduction vs rockets even when webbed due to very high speeds and sig radius bonusstill think they need a boost though bump
hopefully this is just growing pains from the new engine but deep down and i hope im very wrong i cant help but think the current sound is to help lag i hope this isnt the reason there were so many things i loved about the past sound preapoc i cant count how many times ive just logged off in disgust because of the subpar non high quality sound i would expect from ccp
supported needs some love asap
ok
i support this cause
supported because an evemail told me to actually i support this anyway
supportedsound bugs should get fixed and one should be able to turn off proximity sounds
supportedsound is broken since apo patch
please fix sound already
way way too complicated by this proposal crewing a ship becomes more complex than fitting it
i like it would add another level of depth to the beautiful ship customization
this is all very complex i think if such a system were to be introduced it would need to be kept simple45 crew slots on a shipcrew cannot be transfered and are lost if the ship is repackaged or destroyedas you fly around in space a crew division has a random chance to level upcrew give very basic bonus for exampleengineering 05 cap rechargegunnery 05 damagenavigation 05 velocityi like the idea but i feel it would benefit mission runners more the average lifespan for any ship i buy for pvp is usually less than a month a lot of people might not want to risk their vessel with an elite vector assault force crew etc etc the idea does have merit though
i agree
i just heard about armageddon day 5 mins ago so i read up on it this would be a great idea to have it like a yearly or monthly event it would give us something to look forward to id skip sex for this
support make it for the 15 tests
fix my race pleasenobody really wants a gallente recon in their gang damps dont do enough to be worth it on a bonused ship
supported
supported only cause i can see the break coming with speed and tracking we already have issues on some fronts so allowing it to just get worse would be a no noin the same vein youll need to make the balance on cruiser size rigs well enough also since some rigs slated for hacs are going to be all but required imho
not supportedsubbattleship pvp has needed a boost for some time the breakout of rigs into class sizes is a step in the right direction it increases options
i feel you have missed the point not supported
on the issue of market costive examined as many potential fights as possible on average between t1 and t2 frigates and dictors ive found about 15 to 18 of all rig slots filled lets low ball even that number to say that 5 of all frigate rig slots are used and lost upon ship destruction if the rigs on all tiers of frigates are lowered by about 100x their current build cost of goods and every frigate class ship from this point on were rigged it would affect market production as such5 is 120th of all frigate class ship rig slots on averagemarket build cost is lowering by 1100thmeaning that based on current kill board statistics which are very conservative for this argument you would need to see 5x the current death rate of frigate and dictor class ships with 100 rig usage to equal the current build cost of goodsyou have increased the demand in the market by 2000you have increased the potential supply with in set market by 10000 that is using drastically conservative numbers against my favor this is running the assumption that current supply of input materials remains constant and that current ship loss ratios remain constant so if after said patch frigate losses rise and bs losses fall because more people are flying smaller ships that has more impact on every rig market not just battleship not just frigatesif the prices fall then naturally demand for said goods will go up what will happen is a new equilibrium point will be met where supply driven by price limited to larger more expensive rigs and ships as were assuming 100 rig capacity on frigates will be lower than the current going rateyes demand increases but input needs drastically decreases
i fully understand the intent of the patch which is why im against it i also understand the original intent of rigs and am fully for that intentresearch assembly hall and tell me how many whines there were about rig cost and balancing before the announced plan compare that to any of about 100 other issues and topicsi think the system was fine before the developers created an issue out of something that was nonexistent i also feel the patch is a reduction in game play variety as it removes an element of risk and choice people attempt to counter me on that last point but theyre not comparing apples to apples yes i realize that ship setups are limited without the aid of rigs yes i realize that ship setups can be altered using rigs it does not change the fact that diversity of scale is lostif rigging becomes a necessity where is the wonder in how a ship might perform with andor without them the fast frigates will become slightly faster the tougher frigates will become slightly tougher the ewar frigates will become slighly stronger but everyone will be doing it so the new averages and lows of performance will all be slightly betterbefore this patch goes live the disparity of the high end performance of a frigate and low end performance of a frigate wereare much greater if rigs become so cheap that theyre common place youre just improving the low end number which ultimately affects the averageif for some reason the patch went live and both the low end performance of a non rigged ship were countered by the high end performance of a fully t2 rigged ship both improving id be all for it but when comparing strictly rigged ships using what amounts to equal quality of gear thats not happeningand for those who complain about benefits to the poor its not fixing that problem its just reallocating in into one of the other fields of diversity of scale rather than blow 60 mil on rigs ill instead throw 60 mil on faction gear where as you wont choose to do it or have the optionmoney to be able to do it the class warfare will still exist and a level of diversity will be removedthe question always comes down to why would i pay 15 mil or more to rig a ship that cost 500k or less the answer is because thats the intent of choice verse performance do i think rigs as a whole could be less tedious andor slightly cheaper sure but this patch is completely removing the point of rigging and the value it adds to a particular ship can you honestly tell me after this patch goes through you wont be more suicidal in that rigged frigate where as before you might have held off using it for another unrigged in that particular instance can you tell me you expect to face ships consistently who said nope no rigs for me the trade off just isnt worth it or can you tell me you wont continuously destroy rigs on ships at leisure just because you desire a different flavor that day where as before it was about having different ships for different abilities even the rich now arent stupid enough to destroy rigs rather than buy a new ship with a new rig setup because its just not worth it rigged ships no matter the size are a valued commodity in game that shouldnt be altered as suchhave you ever forgotten to upgrade your clones and realized it just before a really good fight was about to take place remember how the risk of going into that fight weighed heavily on you because you had to decide if it was really worth getting podded have you ever gone into the fight anyway and gotten the rush of adrenaline from doing so that is the thrill of this game rigs are just another take on risk
armor rigs will kill a frigates speed if the penalty stays asis which means that it wont have much effect anyway trimarks are so popular because large ships dont need speed frigates do and any decrease will hurt a frigate considerablyalso a 10 armor bonus is nothinga frigate has 600 armor hitpointsso a 10 boost would be what 40 more
what are you complaining about then go get those faction modsrigs give a  boost and with mods like that the cost of them should scale aswell fitting a set of 3 20m trimark to your 60m geddon will increase your hp by 45 at the price of doubling the cost of the hull before adding mods in the same way increasing the hp of a punisher by 45 should increase the cost of loosing the ship by 100 but with the current planned changes the price for a frigate trimark will be 4 of the current trimark price aka 800k so a full set would be 24m so on a frigate youre still spending 800 of the hull cost to increase hp by 45 for newbies that dont have the skills to fly a t2 frig instead that 24m is actually a big chunk of money and if youre an old player that can fly better ships and are just looking for a cheap throwaway ship that you can keep loosing all day long without having it make a dent in your wallet spending a few m extra on each one ruins the pointi can honestly tell you that only idiots would rig a t1 frig instead of spending the isk equivalent of 1 single rig on flying a t2 frig instead and t2 ships should be rigged anyway so nothing changes thereconsidering the groups of people that would choose to fly t1 frigs outside of comedy ops ala battle haulers yes ehm yes id rather switch to my second ship with different rigs then spend 23m every time i want to change a setuplike you said yourself people that like to waste money can buy faction mods instead and experience the same risk that also adds the excitement of getting good loot for the other side and the challenge of getting it back home safely aswell or the same thing for your own side if they manage to win the fight despite a few losses and can loot the field and bring lost mods back to the owners
do not supportthe status quo is that one always rigs t2 cruisers makes a personal choice on t2 frigates and bs usually depending on where one lives difficulty of logistics for example in empire and lowsec rigging bs is dumb in remote space it makes a lot more sense and never other t1 ships with the possible exception of a really cheap one or two on a bcmaking smaller rigs cheaper will increase fit variety by making rigging much more viable on frigates and t1 cruiserbattlecruiser since rigs are so varied there are a lot of useful things you can do with those slots although some rigs of course are useless theres still a lot of choice cap speed guns tank etcalso it will help solve the t2 problem the soaring prices of t2 ships have dramatically increased the richpoor power wedge and made pvp less fun needing to spend a couple hours to replace a ship is good because it adds consequence to pvp needing to spend 4 or 5 hours is bad because it strongly deters pvping as much except in a huge cheap ship blob which aint nearly as fun and adds an unpleasant element of extra grind for those who just pve to fuel pvp cheaper rigs will significantly buff t1 ships due to the extra rig slot which will bring the richpoor gap back down and return more fun to pvp its not quite as good as changing the moon mineral system to produce more and move around would be but its a good alternative to help solve the symptoms of the t2 moongold problemthe one and only issue i have with the proposed changes is scaling 100204 will make fitting rigs on frigates completely mandatory and make fitting the strongest rig possible regardless of price mandatory there too rigs will also become mandatory gear on bc and cruiser but it will still be worth choosing which rig to take based on price the 20 is too low too but not nearly as insane maybe 1005025 would be better maybe 1006633 whatever i dont know the exact numbers but the ones proposed by ccp are definitely too much
i dont know many instances where i couldnt take a t1 bc gang up against a hacrecon gang and not win consistently thats not an issue of t2 vs t1 price wars thats an issue of tactics t1 frigates are meant to be throw away ships rigs are not throw away devices that said good pilots can choose to rig t1 ships currently and make them perform insanely well why does everyone always make this boil down to class warfare
minmatar primary weapon systems acs and artillery need a serious rebalancing to make them competitive with the other races this has my total support
as previously mentioned this subject has been previously brought to attention several times yet no csm or ccp comment to be found next csm election i will vote for the guygirl that has this issue in hisher platform
youre doing the bonuses wrong its role bonus  racial bonus 1  racial bonus 2 having cruisers 5 for a requirement is also a bit steep so that really shouldnt change otherwise i support a good change to the other faction ships
keep in mind that csm 1 already brought it up and ccp kinda said nah we dont want tothe reason they gave was that they believe faction ships fill a niche and they shouldnt waste resources on balancing themthe argument you can use against them is that they released t3 modular ships which are even more niche due to their pricetag than faction ships and are even harder to balance
not supportedi know the feeling of having coverts hiding in your system and not being able to do anything about it  but ing up with cloaks mechanics is just not the solution there are the ingame and utterly annoyingbpring options of constant bubble gatecampsbaitingconstant home def fleet ready for action ignoring the reds  it might suck balls but you can combat the cloakerswhat i would agree on is when 00 finally goes delayed local if it ever happens you could have pos scanning arrays that locate cloakers with a 10min cooldown or some such mechanics but until then just learn to deal with cloakers
cloak is its own counterhow many times do nerf cloak threads have to be kicked into touch before you people get the messagefor the 5000th time no
remove local problem solved hell many problems solved
i like the idea of cloakingfuel so cos can become a rolebonus that reducing the fuel amount needet for cloak and stay cloaked for example 1 cloakfuel and other ships like a bs will need a huge amount of fuel 100 cloakfuelso the fuel wouldnUFFFDt take much cargo in covops and sbUFFFDs but much cargo in other not specialized ships like macroravensi realy think this would solve the cloakerproblem and wouldnt hit the covops and sbUFFFDs very hardjust my opinion
this not supported
thanks for the support guys keep it upthis is something that needs a serious lookat
agreed pos permissions need reworking my fear is that the sov changes will force this issue to be put on hold
how is that any different from being forced into an empire upon character creation the only difference i see is that the empire uses a cheat to control its sovereignty whereas in your scenario these accosters are other players that can be bribed convinced charmed blackmailed doublecrossed or even destroyed if the new player already has connections in game you must not have seen any pkk groups on your shard it was also possible to be safe from reds through diplomacy with other reds these games are supposed to be about socializing arent they
because i got to choose the empire i joined when i made my character if you dont like those choices dont play evei am starting to detect the strong scent of troll emanating from this thread
would it not be also feasible then to let the player choose the region heshe wishes to start in maybe have a map which shows player controlled empire sovereignty in the regions of the universe you mentioned earlier that you believe there is a split between people who want all out war and those that do not while this may be true to an extent i think you are ignoring the capabilities of players to police themselves reputation is everything in a true player controlled environment you can see evidence of that in this game with the economy i would just like to see that expanded to the rest of the game im actually kind of hurt that you would accuse me of trolling ive been nothing but constructive this whole time and i truly believe this is a serious issue in the game but i apologize if ive offended you in some way that would make you think i have ulterior motives
how does a truely new player know the differences between these playercontrolled factions to pick a starting areaif you are really as new to eve as you say you are ill give you the benefit of the doubt the rules you speak of with no npc police and complete player authority exist in the geographical majority of the galaxy empire space is a relatively small area in the center of the galaxy are you familiar with the acronym nbsi nbsi stands for not blue shoot it and it is the standard operating procedure of about 90 of the corporations and alliances that live outside of empire space its not if its a war target shoot it its not if its hostile shoot it its shoot it if its anything other than someone prequalified to enter this area this is eve there is no pk vs npk here there is no good or evil in areas with no concord theres only blue and everyone else and everyone else is a target if you have not spent time in 00 space frankly you lack the perspective to suggest this type of change brand new players should not be subjected to the absolutely impersonal destruction that the playerrun powers of eve would rule with this isnt theory the alliances already run this way this would not change inside empire
condord used to be weakerhowever the end result  lagso they made concord stronger with less ships spawning  less lagyoure missing some of the mechanics here like suicide ganking as well as the backstory
if that were the case youd be unable to undock until you were pressganged into the virus alliance holding u in stationnew players would not be able to see a single ship in space because theyd be instapopped on undocking until they joined the horde
so all new players have to have existing contacts ingame before being allowed to undock without being poppedwhat you gunna bribe em withsarcasmsounds like an amazingly awesome newplayer experiencesarcasmsomehow i think eve is a little more inclusive then thatmove to 00problem solved
i find it hard to believe that peace treaties or nonaggression pacts between alliances do not exist in eve also i know corporations do not always stay within the same alliance andim assuming here in 00 space territory sovereignty changes occasionally am i wrong about thatit seems you are also suggesting that every alliance is about absolutely impersonal destruction which just seems preposterous you do know that other players are actual human beings just like you with emotions and thought processes right in over a decade of playing online games i have never met a player who could not be reasoned with in any way
players are forced into the horde right now and this horde uses a cheat to keep players in check if it was player run they would all be banned that is the main problem with the mechanics as it is now there isnt an equal playing field you wouldnt need to have existing contacts that was just one example you would also have the option of joining with the virus since you decided to spawn in their region after that you could find ways of going to another alliance more suited to you or find a smaller corporation to live in a lowpatrolled region or use diplomacy to get a nonaggro pact with an allianceright now that small invincible alliance in the middle is undercutting every other alliance by offering players total security which is imbalanced
with a month in game and no 00 experience you are coming off like a knowitall tourist explaining to the locals how they could improve the local culture your 10 years of mmo experience mean nothing in eve my previous 10 years of mmo experience also meant nothing in eve get off your soap box and start learning before you start pontificating try flying out to goonswarm space or hell you pick the alliance and fly into their space and start negotiating with them as an independant newbie let us know how it goes
and cva space only counts if your a minmatar otherwise your pretty safe from them but please get of that soap box eve is nothing like any other mmo out there at the moment the only thing close is jump gate evolution and its still under development
the equal playing field is that anyone can be killed anywhere at anytime for good reasons or no reasonsif youre like me and generally  people off then youll findout soon enough that condord arent perfect protectors banned are you suggesting players vote on bans wtf you hey i just spawned in your space this game is cool can i jointhem  offyou hey can i get a napthem who are you go away
you disregarded the content of my reply without actually debating the arguments raised simply because of this rule youve imposed that i must have a certain amount of time spent in game before i can create opinions about mechanics which i think are flawedalso any diplomat knows to negotiate before entering foreign territory i dont see how namecalling is warranted in this thread im not trying to be dogmatic im just a concerned citizen
no i meant if concord was run by players and those players used cheats to make their ships invincible those players would be banned by ccpis that how you negotiate
concord is the default it fills a gap that players cant fill 237there is nothing stopping you from starting a police alliancecorp it wasnt possible early on because a certain critical mass is needed to make it worthwhile but it can probably be done now if you could find any players wanting to be police you just wardec anyone that causes trouble and come to defence of noobs getting can flipped etcthis is how someone with no position negotiatesyou i want a tvclerk rightoyou no moneyclerk credityou nope arent u friendly to noobsclerk  offedit youre aware suicide ganking is very effective rightinfluence map
lol run a bit around in low sec and reason to the people at the gates run in delve and reason with goonswarm run almost anywhere in 00 and reason with the guys there but before doing that be sure that your clone is up to date alliances ave treaties with other alliances yes that is what being blue mean look how standing workbut in 00 if you arent in a friendly alliance you are a target no one care what you are doing theremaybe you miss a point people can and will profit from your death and you will lose from your dead both good reasons to kill you if you arent a friend
but with your great idea all territory will be foreign territory so when you are born the first time you have nothing to bargain with and no way to do your diplomacy before meeting meso your choice will be join my corp for newbie players with 50 tax and 2 hours of mandatory mining every day or die
nephilimyoua re new so you dont know itbut there was a time when concord was beatabledo you know what happened some crazy guys just spend half a days killing everyone in a big trade hub yulai und killedtanke concord the whole time killing on and onenoone could stop them until the gms had to get active and ended itsicne thatd ay killing concords is an exploitthe story is of course longer and has more reasoning butwith todays thousand of players more yulai was a few years back such stuff would happen alot more oftenbad idea even if it makes a part of the game nonplayerdriven seeconcord is not unbeatablethey just have failsafe devices for your ships or something so they can even prevent you from jumping into wh spaceconcord is beatable if you had a ship not controlled by them
no man im disregarding your points because they are based on your theoretical model of how you think eve politics should work when you havent taken the time to find out how it works already its like youre explaining to eskimos the best way to keep warm in the winter when youve lived in florida your whole life and youve just reached the arctic on your first farnorth cruise the eskimos just might look at you like you have no idea what youre talking about if nbsi is the standard for existing playerpolicied regions what would make it different if empire was playercontrolled and how is it a benefit to a brand new player to be thrown into this environment on day 1
actually  concord as they currently are is quite immersion breakingif youre off in deadspace and youre a player and you shoot another player bingo youre dead period every timebut the angel cartel guys you were flying against before that other player showed up are entirely concord proofhuhconcord once upon a time could be beaten things changed and the mechanic changednow highsec is needed i dont think anyone other than a few maniacs want that to change concord is what makes high sec high sec  could that be changed and keep the balance while still improving immersion and opening up optionsthe answer is yes  by making eve even more of a sandboxokay  high sec systems  how do they stay highsecfirst  deadspace complexes should be hard to find like your agent is always telling you and things inside should be virtually impossible to find each system should have the potential for several thousand of them although the server should only pay attention to active onesthat would mean that your agent would send you to only inactive ones on regular missions and inside that mission space you would be nearly impossible to find however  that deadspace would be more like lowsec you could shoot at whoever you liked etc the key to keeping highsec missions safe is to ensure that the mission complexes are very hard to find not impossible  this is a sandbox after all  but hard enough that a player getting a mission and flying out to one is unlikely to be bothered unless he dallies out there for 812 hoursa subset of this is that agents would be able to give out missions to players to occupied complexes  resulting in pvp action if a group of players set up a pos in a deadspace area the agent might send some players out to deal with it these would have be keyed differently and rated for difficulty somehow but it could be donefinally  concord could be called if you were under attack even in deadspace you could yell for help and the nearest concord ship would fly to you using the ordinary rules accel gates etc it would be very tough but you could possibly beat it and get away the higher the sec the more likely as well that concord or the navy would find any occupied deadspace areas and attack if the players won they would know that a more devastating attack would soon follow but would have some grace time to escape although it would be under fire from concord and the gate guns if they fled the systemthe higher the sec the less deadspace areas the more concord and navy the balance would be to keep things the same devastating raids would be prevented by the navy and concord acting together for instance if 200 pirates jumped into jita they would have a helluva fight on their hands as the naval force in that area would be similar and there would be concord as wellthe idea here is  make it a sandbox make concord tough not by game fiat deus ex concord but by making them really toughsimple reality is that players with a big enough fleet should be able to do what the elders did and the reaction from the empires should be similarharder for ccp oh yes but much more a true sandbox players could then become fatal or the rabbit and expect to succeed if they were lucky and be able to do all the things those npcs donow thats a sandbox
you can trash concord all day long if you want just go to 00 and run some missions for the blood raiders tank kinetic for cruisers em for battleships
you completely misunderstand the topic of this discussion what you need to understand is that many people who play eve online are not interested in pvp and just want to be left alone to do their carebearing in peace yes eve is a pvp oriented game but it is not only about pvp you should not be able to come annoy me or blow up my ship every time im trying to mine or trade and just want to be left alone people should have the option to freely move around empire space without having local open completely carefreewe have a perfect balance right now over there in goonswarm controlled space you are king and master you make your own rules you let in those you choose and you kick out those you dont like you are free to be nice or grief nice people who are merely trying to make moneyluckily you cant project your power to empire space here you cant do jack to me in fact you can kiss my behind you cant interfere with my activities you cant hinder me in any way its beautifulwhat can you possibly complain about when you have access to better ores better rats and much much more money you might say that all this is at the expense of being in constant danger and having to protect your space but see you enjoy doing this stuff you gladly do it but many people simply dont want any of this and i see no problem with thatnot supportedalthough i think its ok that concord should not be invulnerable their ships should keep on coming until there is nothing left of the lawbreakers in questionthink of real life police sure you can kill a police officer even blow up his car and take his gun but you cant defeat the police they will keep coming and they will keep looking for you until they get you and kill you if necessary and if the police cant handle you swat will come and if swat cant take care of you the army will come and you will definitely be ed then if we didnt have something like this in place we would have ananrchy chaos and that would not be good
wow thats a lot of words i was just saying that you are more meaningfully protected in a player justice system like exists in 00 when im carebearing in nullsec the returns arent as good as empire due to the low population density that nullsec supports but i feel safer than i do in empire in empire anyone can suicide gank scam can flip etc without consequence in 00 that gets shut down hardi do agree however that the easiest solution for the ops problem is just for him to find a 00 alliance he likes and leave the rest of you alone
what i dont get is your concept that we are forced to join an empire from the time we startwhen you start your in an npc corp that does nothing for you and nothing to you and other than war dec immunity which is the whole point your a freelancer you can fly to any other empire and work for them or travel between them at willbeyond that what your suggesting is an entirely player driven system which you know full well doesnt have much appeal or there would be mountains of successful examples instead there are zero for a reasoni would set and discuss the intricacies of game theory with you but since you didnt take the time to learn enough about eve to have an informed position its not really worth my time
thisthread
as much as i would like there to be some way to get offices to come out sooner i am not sure this is the way corp a gets rent isk from corp b corp g takes over station and voids rental sounds like corp b has paid isk for something they dont get even if you refund the isk are you going to take it from corp g who never had it or forcing corp a to cough up isksecond why force corp b to pay impound again you are making corp b pay if as you say two months is adequate time to fight to retake a station under the old way corp b is back in business upon friendly retake because they still have the office the new way they have no office and have to pay to get their items backthird what about a griefer gone mad corp g has a spy who suddenly forces all stations it controls to unrent i see the proposal opening a new area to griefersi am sorry but the fact the present system maybe a bad mechanic doesnt make this proposal a better oneif you want to play with unrenting why not fix another aspect of it that has not changed since day one of eve to unrent you must be physically present at the station why not champion remote unrenting
supported if you just remove the ability for the rent to be renewedthat pairs it down to 30 days which is well within reason
if i was going to take over the station id gut it vent the damn thing to space and repair itfrak the offices and there so called rentersleave or die o p it now belongs to its new owneri have trouble understanding why or how this is acceptableinability to evict previous renters short of blowing the station to hell
i think there are a variety of options for a boost already listed by myself and others throughout the thread any time you deal with a thread like this its better to show the desire for change and not pin that change on a particular idea ive exprerienced that several times in the past where the message of change gets lost in the proposal for change i would be very happy if people would show their support for change and list out any variety of what could be better options that gives the devs a variety of points to work off of rather than put the entire burden on them
wrong we do get to dictate their policy because without us they will make no money and there will be no business whats up with your sheepish attitudetheir very success depends on us playersoff course they have to sift through thousands of suggestions and proposals and choose whats needed and whats not that is their job they get paid well for it and their wise decisions make eve one of the best mmos out there but we do get to tell them what needs to be done and they must and will listen to usi agree that walking in stations is unnecessary and all that effort would be best diverted into other directions there are so many things that can be done that would be much more useful
no
supportedwalking in stations is a nice concept but dev resources could be used in better endeavors
not supportedi am really looking forward to wis and i hope that they choose to integrate many ingamegames like poker chess and hopefully the best strategy game in history ever go
so if someone will not upgrade their clone its because of balls or something else and how can wingmen protect from focus firealright its just me i dont like this feature so i will just use something else but wtf with their prices
signed
the theory is that t3 ships are supposed to have a isk price similar to t2 ships but to make up for that you pay sp when you loose it unless you choose to eject right before it dies if you train the skills to level 4 instead the performance will still be very good and you only need to train a rank 1 skill back up from level 3 to 4 they saw that just having a high isk cost wasnt enough to make people capable of flying t2 ships utilize t1 ships aswell so they created a different incentive for it instead trough the sp loss not supported
dont fly what you cant afford to losenot supported
i think that feature is pretty good i wish they applied it to all t2 ships as wellit adds an element of hardcore to eve and it is not very strict if you lost all subsystem skills after death then id understand your complaints so just be thankful you dont lose all your skills just 1 level
why stop there have it affect all aspects of ship command or somethingif anything people would spend less time being suicidal in the game with there immortality complex and more careful and studious about how where they flypersonally id be a little bugged about it but if anything it would defiantly make the game more hardcore
the theory is tradeoff in investment here it is the benefit of a lvl 5 skill vs a lvl 4 skill in addition to risking your ship which btw its a ship with 10 bonuses rather than 2 or 4 you risk time invested in that skill trainingconsidering it takes approximately the same time to train hac 5 as it does all 5 skills for this ship to get more than double the useful bonuses id wager that youre pretty alone on this argument there are 1000 other ships in game feel free to explore those if you dont like the t3 model payoffspeople keep telling me this is hello kitty online sadly i agree more with ephemeron that those kittys need to have their heads cut off and ravenous dogs chasing them more often my apologies to all the poor innocent kittens out there
i have even better idea for more hardcore in eve no clones when podded you lose this unlucky account imagine how half of a fleet gets doomsdayed and register their new trials now that is hardcore
510 trollyou go first and then well see whose laughing
so predictable 
not supported i like the extra risk when flying t3
if youre about to die just eject and you wont lose sp duh
reading through peoples idea of what insurance is for is bizarrethat said  i can see both sides of the arguement pvp wanted or not is a strong driving force in market stimulation without it the high sec industrialists would have a much harder time selling the products and producethe stupidity of this is there is very little punishment for a ganker they fully understand the risk they take when they attack and can calculate the money outlayed versus the possible reward from the wreck the thing that is missing here is reality what insurance company in its right mind would insure someone at a fraction of the cost of a ship that is destroyed 2 hours lateranswer nearly all of them once after that you would pay far more for insurance in premiums repeated insurance mis haps would eventually result in no one wanting to insure youever againsure gankers take a security status hit  big deal  go kill some battleships and recover this higher insurance costs for repeat gankers on an ever increasing scale then place cheaper less reputable insurers in low sec systems where all the gankers tell industrialists they should be anyway  that charge far less but have a  chance of not paying out
i could get behind the idea of a sliding scale of ship insurance based on actual market value and pilot performance ie ship loss it might need some tweaking but the overall idea is intriguing and it accomplishes my main goal
give us the tools for player run insurance and this wouldnt be an issueriskier pilots would pay more gankers wouldnt get insured and your standard player would play and pay more or less how they do now

as a tool to filter out all the nonsense and scamsuspicous courier contracts which currently dominate the contract overview id like to propose the following additional filter options for courier contracts1 display only courier contracts with both source and target destination are in high sec yesno2 display only courier contracts with both source and target destination are npc stations yesno3 filter by a range of cargo volume4 filter by a range of contract rewardall four filters together with the already existing filter by collateral should be combinableindependent sorting by volume reward or collateral would be nice toothe currently available filter min pricemax price is related to the collateral thats ok but the fact that sorting by price is related to reward is a bit inconsequent and confusinga filter by range of the number of jumps between source and target would also be useful but i could imagine its not easy to find a performant implementation because it depends on the specific router settings and the distance probably isnt stored as a precalculated value in the database if i am wrong and it is easy consider this as option 5
yes
it is my strong belief that the newb tutorial system is still very insufficientid like to propose introducing intelligentscripted pvp bots for example a newb can choose to fight against a speedy interceptor or a heavily tanked heavy assault cruiser or any other class these ships would be fitted with some of the most common fits and have behavior similar to what a good pvper should be doing i understand perfectly well that this will not teach people to become expert pvpers and you cant possibly predict even half of the possible pvp situations but this is a hell of a lot better than what is available atm and this way people wouldnt have to lose ships while learning
but thats still pve and not pvp
i never said fighting bots constitutes as pvp i said it would help prepare people for pvp
they are called sleepers see the wormhole next door
this isnt really neededthere are plenty of corporations that are already willing to take in newer playerstoons and show them the ropes of pvp in an actual pvp environment eve university euni jumps immediately to mind and the way they keep getting wardecced there are ample opportunities to get the desired experienceno support
a wider variety of npcs to shoot at during the tutorial with your agent talking you through how things work introducing npcs with speed tanks and neuts and ewar and so on would help lay some groundwork for the basic principles that pvp works off i agree that would be a good improvement to seethis wouldnt be a pvp bot though and shouldnt really be advertised as such the whole point of pvp in eve is that its open and derestricted and cant really be emulated by a scripted rat except in the most basic terms setting up a newbie in a fight with a scripted npc and saying well thats how pvp works youre ready for the big leagues now kid will just mislead and frustrate players especially when they jump into lowsec00 thinking theyre hot stuff for pvp and immediately get owned by 20 hacs on a gate player vs player is best taught by players and newbies who really do want to learn how it works would be better advised to join one of the corporations like eve uni which give real pvp lessons
as anyone whose ever engaged in any kind of pve knows all the various factions have their own ship colorings stats and bonuses while these are well represented in the current faction ships with 4 ships for empire factions and 3 for pirate factions i feel it would be interesting to allow players to get in on the factional modification of their vessels by investing in these effectively as an extra rig you can tweak ship abilities and maybe give your vessel a new role thereby encouraging an influx of new ship setups into eve in addition to altering its appearancethe big ideaall t1 and nonefaction ships would get a new slot hencefor refered to has the overhaul slot into this slot a factional overhaul would be inserted which function as a sort of hybrid between rigs and t3 parts in functionalityat faction lp stores three new items would be added these would be factional overhauls for frigates cruisers and battleships at 1k 5k and 20k lp respectivly destroyers and battlecruisers would be considered cruisers for use of these modulesat the as yet hypothetical release of these overhauls one would be availible for each major faction and pirate group primary overhauls amarr caldari gallente minmatar can only be put on their respective races ships while the pirate factions blood raider guristas serpentis angels could be applied to whatever races skills are required for their faction ships other races and groups overhauls could later be added to their respective lp storeshow they workin most respects a factional overhaul is a hybrid t3part and rig in that it has major bonus relating to skills like t3 parts while being destroyed upon removal from a shipin order to ensure balance factional overhauls would not effect directly used modules and skills such as resistances damage and repair ammounts instead they would all have an ewar bonus a logistics bonus and a minor hp boost of around 5 for the ship in question pirate factions would gain an additional unique bonus relating to the faction in questioneach race and pirate faction would have a skill exe angels cartel overhauling caldari navy overhauling that affects the extent of the bonus the ship in question recievesexamplesfederation navy overhauldescriptive textskill bonuses  5 bonus per level to sensor dampening effectiveness 75 bonus per level to remote armor repairer rangerole bonus 5 armor increaseserpentis factional overhauldescriptive textskill bonuses  5 bonus per level to range of sensor dampeners 75 bonus per level to remote sensor booster effectiveness 20 chance per level for ship and cargo scanners targeting this ship to failrole bonuses 5 armor increaseadditionally a side effect of a factional overhaul is that it changes the ships color scheme to that of the appropriate faction for instance applying the serpentis factional scheme to a myrmidon would give it the black and gray camo pattern of the serpentis plus all shipboard lights become green were it a federation navy overhaul she ship would become black and white striped with flashing blue lightsoverallthe intended result that would be gained from these overhauls would be that ships could be optimized for unique roles to supplement those the ship already has by creating vessels that can preform many roles we can break out of the deadlock of fits and encourage some experimentation and creativity from players a prophecy that can drain capacitor to power its tank a vexor that can smuggle illegal goods without concord noticing and a remote repping hurricane are all possible with these overhaulsthis is my first assembly hall proposal so please tell me what you think

i apologize then i didnt understand that at all the way you phrased it some of the negations youve used threw me off

you nailed the can of worms thing on the head drake that said i tend to support this as it would help resolve another issue too people starting a new post for about a topic thats already been posted about ad nauseum because thay havent bothered to look and see if its been posted before admittedly these forums make it hard to look for things sometimes but still
supported also what id like to see in canceling instathread creation basically every thread will be reviewed by ccp personal before reaching the assembly hall forum that way well keep the spamnoobnessmultiple threads issues at bay but then again that will require ccp mods to be active about important stuff rather than the trollfest that is caod edit forgot to hit the support button

well as we have to gain higer skills for using these ships they should be worth it not only for better resistancesslightly better fitting possibilities so more slots or more interesting bonuses would be fine with me
i never really understand the logic behind ccps refusal to have that 4th bonus it really cant be their concern for game balance because hacs have 4 bonuses and they are much more powerful than af could ever bei think its just pure stubbornness and general aversion to common sense design practices once they set their mind on something no amount of petitioning and logical argumentation is gonna move them just give up and focus on issues that have some hope of getting fixed

having been encouraged by some people to put in the form of a specific proposal my own suggestions for accommodating nonaligned corporations and alliances in factional warfare fw gameplay i put it forward herei have taken the time to make an extensive argument on this in my blog faction warfare and third forcesi wont reproduce it here for reasons of space but i will present the offered solution in full i invite anyone to peruse the blog entry itself and i hope any interested csm members will do so to better understand my reasoningsimply put it should be possible to enter factional warfare in a fullyfeatured way by opposing a given faction without joining an opposing militia in other words a corporation or alliance should be able to declare against a given militia and the following should then apply they are at war with all corporations in the specific militia they may attack complexes belonging to the empire of the specific militia they are declared against they may not secure complexes belonging to the empire opposed by the specific militia they are declared against they will be fired upon by npc navy forces of the empire to which the specific militia declared against is a member any other abilities or penalties as may exist or be developed in future that may apply to opponents of a specific militia will be available but only with respect to the faction of the specific militia declared against a given corporation or alliance should only be able to declare against one militia at a timetaking the case of my own organisation the star fraction and the amarr militia what would this mean the star fraction and amarr militia corporations would be war targets to one another but caldari militia corporations would not share in this the star fraction would be able to attack and capture amarr fw installations but not caldari fw installations the star fraction would not be able to formally secure minmatar fw installations or any other for that matter the star fraction would come under attack from amarr npc navy forces but not caldari npc navy forcesthis is a consistent and coherent approach to the issue which provides a way to participate in fw with some useful options notice that it means people who wish to fight say the amarr militia but not the caldari will only be limited in their ability to travel and operate in amarr space and not caldari space immediately a much more nuanced approach to the wars between the empires is available to those who may indeed support say the gallente federation but have no big quarrel with the amarr empireit also allows for a much wider participation in fw by many corporations and alliances in a way that makes sense in rpic terms mercenaries freebooters outlaws minor faction loyalists loyalists who dont want to be in any militia and alliances in general can declare against whoever and get involved without the absurdities and impossibilities that arise from enforced membership of militias it squares the circle both for in character reasons ccp are right alliances are extranational entities ic they have no business being in anyones militia and mechanical reasons of alliances not joining militiaseve is a more mature and deeper game of war and politics than the current fw arrangements allow for and this suggestion seeks to improve matters to the benefit of the whole game there are more levels of detail it is possible to discuss with regard to this proposal but they are more properly a matter for ccp to consider what is presented here is the broad design suggestion that there be a fullyfeatured against option for entry into factional warfare participation without the necessity of joining any militiacosmo
thank you for posting this individually i believe this is well done the external reading on your blog is also helpful
makes a lot of sense and would get more people involved in fw pvp which is a good thing excellent work cosmo
this seems an entirely reasonable proposal
supporting
its a well thoughtout sensible and entirely constructive proposal that provides balance to the potential participants and moreover will definitely supply a boost to participation in the flagging fw arena and enable smallscale pvp to a wider audience while allowing rp entities to more properly express their opposition to specific causes id urge the csm to consider this proposal seriously and i hope that a champion can be found to promote and argue this concept to the current council and ccp in the formal meeting to come
while i dont participate in fw myself that is in large part because i dont want the baggage associated with being in a milita this seems like a reasonable and balanced solution to that baggagesupported
i actually quite liked this idea in the other thread  its a way for alliances to get involved in fw without them actually joining a militia with enough downside not to make it grieftastic ill give it till next wednesday for people to comment in here about it and if erik who seems to want to champion anything fw related hasnt picked it up i will
very happy to give this my support
definitely yes

id love to see this happen but i think your downplaying the effect it would have on trade yes its too much for a single trader to make an alt network to go hub to hub but if players can get together and form banks and stock exchanges do you really think its beyond possibility a corp could get together and form a jump bridge network and charge traders to use it a medium sized corp with alts all cyno v capable would do the trick just charge for fuel  a fee to use the bridge youd make billionsso id love to see it but i think you need some type of assurance we wont see traders using this to neighinstantly get from one hub to another
first  i think was asked above  wtf are you doing mining during wartime without adequate protection theres little to no advantage in this scenario because as it stands a good gank squad will just throw tacklers into the system and warp in on top of youif the cyno alt pops the cyno right on top of you pop the alt hes gotta be in wt gang for cyno so hell be shootable set your overview right if he pops a cyno at a nearby planet or something youll see your wts pop into system just as if theyd come in a gate and you can get your miners out the balance is held in that the target corp would effectively be able resume logistics with the same toolset theres littleno way that with effective cov cyno hopping you couldnt move your haulers aroundedit now with thumbs up also  took me 6 tries to post
the alt cyno ship so long as it has not engaged in any aggressive action towards you and has not given direct assistance repair to the wts will not be flagged even if in the wts fleeti agree with disagreeing here  but no the miners andor their protection would not be able to shoot the cyno if he is not themself a wartarget or conditionally flagged to you

i like more drone upgrades but not being able to add more bandwidth module would make every bs a domi with better guns
would be nice to have something to increase drone bandwidth perhaps a drone rig that increases bandwidth by 25 bandwidth but have an associated drawback i support the high slot module too1
very interesting ideas  maybe for strategical reasons some of this might be introduced rather as rigs than modules but right now 3 drone upgrades seem a bit poor to me as well
exactly you said it perfectlyyou dont have what it takes to kill the shipgood that youve admitted itmove along people
supported killmail should show pilot hitting themselves for top damage with selfdestruct as a weapon as a final blow and no fitting is shownas of why you were already dead due to being tackled and not able to get away you merely quickened the process you will still deny loot and fittings info to your enemies as well
that is not proper logic think before you posta killmail means you killed them you assume since youre attacking that youve killed them you have not if they self destructedalso a person could be under attack by one frigate themself in a battleship and could self destruct could as in may if theyre stupid this doesnt imply that the frigate killed the battleship or was causing innevitable death
if you dont have what it takes to get the kill you dont deserve any reward short and simple besides considering how eve really is a griefing game and looking at the wannabee l33t lads going up against the wall over this just for that alone its worth it btw you already are csm member now you won a seat no need to work the masses anymore
not signedself destruct take 2 minutesif you dont have the dps to kill it in the 2 minutes delay then you get no killmail
i think the whole proposal is a very good idea supported i dont believe there is a need to keep the timer updated between the server and the client so this wouldnt create more load on the server the timer can start when the serverside one does and then countdown on its own until its over unless its renewed by another agressionhowever as you said only ccp can confirm that for sure
i remember from my short stint in 00 the lack of the aggression timer and it annoyed me i agree as the client should take care of it it should be much less trouble than the module timers supported
definite support for some sort of timerfix
ccp listened to players earlier and removed it
support
why not should be simple to implement me thinks would be nice for jumping through gates as wellhave a red timer for two minutes display if you have nodockjump aggro and have yellow one show the remainder of the 13 minutes in the fashion of the gbc and the ratting timer
even if intended now as a gangfleet supporter that ship should be useful as well in solo so any more useful bonuses  fitting stuff should be given as an alternative a t2 myrmidon might be created to be another bcsized drone ship with good dronie bonuses stronger than ishtar
i think all of us have forgotten our drones at one point or another which brings up the topic of getting them back and the possibility of others stealing themi propose that if someone forgets their drones they can continue to view their drone info in the drones in distant space drone window if the owner warps back into the control range of his drones he can then rightclick his drone window and reconnect to them much like reconnecting to probes this would then put the drones back into his control this would also be possible and extremely more useful in the case of unintentionally disconnectingive had only a couple instances where i had forgotten my drones and they were still listed in the drones in distant space window and when i had warped back to them i still had control this seems to be a mechanic that to me should work 100 of the time  if its not working give us a reconnecting option please battleships are slow and flying around at 150ms to scoop up your primary source of dps in some cases is frustrating on another issue that has been mentioned here is drone stealing drones are never intentionally left and there should be possible repercussions for stealing themmy second proposal is on something else that doesnt make sense  drone damage ive seen some forum posts before about drone damage and asking ccp to enable players to view it please let us enable the viewing of drone damage there are many players whose primary damage source is drones and quite frankly it doesnt seem fair that they cant view it it also doesnt make much sense why drone damage cannot be viewed whether it be logical or technical players can see what damage drones are inflicting upon them why cant the owners of those drones drone damage was displayed in the log a couple years ago refresh my memory why was it changedlets hear it
while your proposal makes some sense to me i would be much happier if drones that were left behind would go instant rogue and started attacking all targets on the grid in order of weakest to strongest it sure would make the end of cap ship battles far more entertaining
supported  reconnecting to drones would be useful and reasonable
drones rely on targetting assignments once they loose their controller they are useless even so drones retain corp information  they wouldnt fire on corpfleet mates
well drone losses due to disconnects are really annoying i support the idea of reconnect with the new scan probe system it proved useful and functional so why not with drones whereas that prob with drone stealing i think its ok so far as when just forgetting them its not a technical mistake but our own maybe drones could be given free to scoop up for anyone only when the owner leaves the system or docks
yes upgrading clones is completely rediculous especially when you can lose all your sp by not doing so it is a feature that will drive potential customers away from eve resulting in lower sales for ccp if ccp had half a brain they would do away with itwhy risk almost everything a player has based on one little click of a button such a rediculous requirement
not supported this is eve
and loosing games like lets see how often we have to pod him before he looses that skill sadly that transport pilot still seems to have that skillnaw not support
not supported
you forgot drunk or highlost bc 5 and clarity 5 crew checking innot supported stupid idea
even a few ships using this creates a lot of unnecessary lag i cant imagine how bad it has to be in large fleet engagements maybe it could also be toned down to around the ship i dont see why conceptually it is this big large effect area id much better like it completely removed though
the effects are too visible imo aswell
the effect is large so that people who are using ecm know who not to target
module effects do not create lag lag is network related effects are not using the networkwhat you think is lag is actualy a low frame rate clientside only and will only affect people with lower end machinesif you want to prove this press ctrlf to bring up the performance meter and look at the fpsmost people playing eve online have decent gaming pcs so if you want to get less lag then just lower the effects slider in your graphic settings or upgrade your hardwarethose effects cause no problems for menot supported
i too disagree eccm is locallyrendered and thus is dependant upon your prefered settings and hardware i believe a great percentage people are capable of rendering this withou t a significant drawback ingame thus warranting no actions from ccp
let them provide an option to turn the specific effect off then something which would also be a big help with the clouds in space that sensor boosters create 
the options exist effects in general settings if you disable this however youll be unable to see other effects that are vital more specific settings may be required
changes to graphics options to customise what you view may be the answerproposal  more graphics options
the combat logs are missing a lot of useful stuffwhat is displayed   dps weapons project laser hybrid missile  warp scramblerdisruptor sometimewhat missing   webs  drones  ewarwhybecause the logs information can be useful for combat analyze after the combat but its important to know who fire ecm on who who got dampened by who we need the complete logs and not a partial oneyou can check why these log are useful here as you see on this macro podkill you have the timestamp for the start and the ending of the combat plus some information like the dps and with kind of wreaking damage i have done the warp scrambling entry is not always in the logs and need to be fixed too
drones i need to know if my sentries are hitting and for how much 
interesting i can see some real advantages to logging this stuff and not just the crazy uberkillmails youve put together there supported
sure why not weve seen what 27 ddds on a battlefield can do so clearly it needs a nerf make it so that 27 ddd2s will pop the titans firing them thats a fix right
more like 5 ddd2s will pop a titan wait no then itd only take 24 ddd to take down a cap fleet goons would exploit this
killing people is an exploitsigned
the problem is that adding t2 cap modules will just make them the new standard for cap pilots which makes it even harder for new players to obtain a reasonable base in cap shipsthe only reasonable request is for t2 cap guns because there actually is a difference in combat style between t1 and t2 guns with the extra ammo
shhh
agree with topic and with draith moms must get a buff there have been many things posted to chnage them many ideas but yet ive heard nothing from ccp about doing anything about it ccp if you think there fine as they are now ok but for the love of god make them bigger so i dont punch a hole in the wall when i see a dread thats the same damn size dock
yes that surely would be a nice thing to have not standing at the gates after hours of apjumping maybe selecting a specific station in the beginning would be even more useful might save a lot of ships flying in the systems an thus reduce a bit server load as well who knows
only if you warp to the station at 15km and have to slow boat to the docking point before dockingedit damm thumb
title says it remove any collision from acceleration gates it is just frustration when the game decides to play total  and warps you right into the frickin gate especially if you are in a battleship exhumer orca or whatever else it is you fly and that behaves like a brickany collision check can just be removed from that gate because there are no game balance issues with it whatsoever and the game does not get any better by getting stuck in the bloody thing
yes i am totally in favour of my suggestion especially since it is a nobrainer to code it into any future patch probably takes no more than a few seconds to get it done so priority should not matter at all
i agree this is extremely annoying but i dont know if this would be the way to fix it they should probably just fix the bounding boxes of the gates instead or make it so you cant warp that close to a gate
surprisingly i agree with kaylan especially that second bit i would be in favor of warp to 0 on an acc gate putting you at the edge of activation rangethat said this is even frustrating in a cruiser i cant imagine how it feels in an orca
i cant remember how many times i got stuck in this already be it in my starting days with mission and later on explorationsupported
y tu develdrinop is backwards the desired fix is the warpin distance youre attacking the result of a error not the error itselfbefore they restricted smartbombs next to gatesstations range of 5k at least the issue was that you could get instapopped in 00 by these smartbomb fleets was the fix to make you appear more than 30km away from the gate when you jumped in no the fix was to restrict the action not the resultsorry good callout but youre pointing at the wrong thing
supportedspending 10 minutes wriggling a battleship out of a gate is never fun
yah man whatever you be saying man it makes perfect sense but then who be carin about how it needs some fixing aight i be supporting dis topic as it be sounding like a good fix for me mission wingcheers manpeace out
i concede your point im still in favor of the idea of reducing the frustration of acc gates
it seems my purpose here is to point out the folly in peoples propositions and declarations of late i appologize with due respect in comments like such but they call for contextual debatesurely your experience being stuck inside a gate does not warrant the ops submission ingame either you moved your ship into that gate aligned or however or you landed inside the gates ring the first is a personal issue that requires user common sense the second is an issue and should spawn its own and new discussion
that is another way to fix the problem but i dont care which is used
well i agree a nicer possibility to harvest gas clouds would surely be nice  let it be for wht3 gases as for booster stuff or maybe future other materials made from gases in my opinion it would do if there wasnt needesd a turret slot for them so we could fit them onto bargesexhumers without problems if not that a gas harvesting ship not requiring much other than basic gas cloud harvesting skill might be nice as well
thanks for the suppoort d

part of the genius of the system is the diminishing returns its why newbies can compete with vets  a guy with 1m sp can fly a t1 frig about 23 as well as a guy with 100m sp instead of 1 as well you need more sp put into a field to be less efficient than the early sp investments because otherwise youre playing old players online if you have enough time to take a skill to 5  and believe me a lot of players do  you have enough time to spend that effort even if its only as good as level 1 was not supported
thishorrible idea not supported
i think this is a good idea over all and could be very balancedhowever the problems are in the details of your proposal and the main reason you dont have any votes at this pointif this was applied in the opposite fashion of what you are suggesting it could workyou are saying most skills should get a level 5 boost with a few being left alone for balance but actually for it to be balanced and not screw everything up it would apply to very select skills and not any othersfor ccp to figure out which skills should get this level 5 bonus would take going over the entire skill system and looking at many many different situations then forum discussions and talks with us the player base and thats before any programing or anything technical
herschel covered the main reasons why i am also echoing the no votesan additional reason is game balance not only would ccp have to go over the entire skill tree to identify which skills qualify for the boost they would then have to evaluate each of those skills and their effects on in game ships modules and other effects to make sure they dont unbalance the game
agreed no
herschel pretty much covered it and therefore not support
oh yes please want that make it so that older players have even more advantages thats brilliantbtw youre mistaken when you say 5 extra its never 5 or 3 or 2 extra its 25 instead of 20 believe me its different and besides look at it this waysmall hybrids lvl5 25 extra dmgsurgical strike lvl5 15 extra dmg total 40now add rail spec lvl4 total 48increase it to 5 and the total is 50trust me it makes a diference not to say that moar bonus is bad
i think the drones in distant space needs to be fixed if you forget them or disconnect and then come back reconnecting to your drones to regain control would not only make sense but would be very helpfulothers have stated that drones are free loot like salvage i disagree to this  maybe they are now but i think this should be changed lost drones and salvage are hardly the same thing salvage can be intentionally left however when drones are left i think everyone can assume it was not the owners intention in the case of disconnecting it cant be helpedi fully support the op
wtf youre in privateer alliance supposedly a pvp alliance stop crying
virus imagine if everyone in jita had their drones out which they dont currently cause of lag and loss of dronesjust consider iti know it sucks ive lost plenty and stopped letting them out what we need is quicker launch and attack for drones
not supportedhowever i do like the reconnect to drones option once you land back on grid
good to see you meissa
anyone else notice the cans you jetison are smaller but hold more then a gsc something is seriously wrong with thatedit a pod also seems bigger then a drake
agreedoh and to the op that merlin comparison for scaling seems a bit familiar p
for the umpteenth time ccp still need to get their art and ui people to fix the damned probing interface
maybe he wanted to say that for the same reason battleships can fit into carriers and freighters have much more cargospace than youd think possible when comparing sizes to industrials that may even be the reason why freighters cannot loot normal wrecks they cant can they i once read something like this because they employ a highdensity spacefolding technology that needs certain conditions to allow loading and unloadingand about the windows maybe they arent windows but sensors or shield emitters or whatever shiny stuff modern spaceships need to work properly i mean come on windows in a spaceship bigger than a 1man fighter why even with highend scifi material technology theyre probably weaker than the rest of the superstructure otherwise youd build the rest out of the same material i guess let alone armor and who needs to look out of a window if every angle of space around the ship is covered by camera droneswhat i want to say for me the current ships scaling works maybe with a little bit of imagination but i always thought this would be mandatory in a setting like the eve universe anyway
in the real world a frigate looks like a piece of junk barely capable of defending itself destroyers are slightly larger ships displaying decent firepower cruisers are good sized ships capable of holding their own in any modern battle battleships wereare large ships and one look at them said dont  with me carriers are huge ships and the new super carriers about to enter construction make even those look small please reflect proper ship size in eveps i work for the us navy
supportedthe archon example is classic and perfect battleships would not fit in that ship hull
the current scaling is really out of whack stations looking like they can only hold 3 carriers and carrier looking like they cant hold even 1 battleshipshowever this might take a long time to improve as scaling them down is not as easy as it looks the textures are made to exactly fit on the model and just simply scaling it down is not possiblehowever i really think that people should stop commenting that ccp should spend their resources otherwise guess what you have no idea how ccp runs internally and neither do i although i dont start talking out of my asssupporting the thread to have the art department have a good look at it
im hoping youre wrong itd be nice to have someone sedate to be the voice of reason on the council for a change

this is an angle that keeps coming up in my mind tooif a player attacks a militia player then they should take standings hit against the militia and factionthis easily ties in with other mechanics to do with navy npcs etc

ops original proposal is not terribly good but ill agree that something has to be done regarding the fw relationships to nonfw onesi dont have any easy solutions or even better ideas  but the fact remains that the current implementation leaves a lot of headaches for all sideseven though im not involved with fw i think its one of the most important things that ccp and csm should be looking at
read the triage mod info wheres the power coming from if it moves then the carriers ass agreed with topic jbs on motherships would put then into good use
omfdeityoftheweek why just give me one good reason you should ever wish to get out of your pod in here you are quite literally immortal to go consorting with  well  meat the flotsam and jetsam of humanity we kill without blinking a metaphorical eye in combat the remnants of evolution you left behind when we chose to become part of your varied ships come on now  its really dangerous out there you could get your remaining meat fried  totally killed permanentlyat least it should be if cccp do it right this needs to be the most dangerous thing any podpilot has ever done to make it worthwhile
there topic name changedand yes it will lessen some wardecs because main tactic used is shoot a bit rr deagress and dock rince and repeatnow once you have agressed your only way to get out of combat is to either warp out of station grid or dock at another station in the systemthis however wont be easy because you will have points on you so you would have to fit wcs this in turn lessens the buffertank some people haveyour actually facing more of a challenge that way and agressing people has more chance to get repurcussionsnext to that its insane someone can undock fly 50km away from a station and still be in dockingrangeccp increased the stayingpower of ships a lot the deagressiontimer however has remained the same docking range is way out of orderfix those things and voila if you wardec a corporation you have 2 choices stay docked or actually engage in a fight without hugging tactics
should name changes be allowed i can thinks of a few good reasons to allow or not allow it it would seem to me the most obvious reason not to allow it would be to hide your identity from other playersi personally think this could lead to new depths of game play and bounty hunting like one name change a year for an isk fee or something and you would have to make a post on the forums but you have a serial number keeping records of you new skills could allow different levels to tracking a person all names changes could be tracked or somethingthis would allow those who hate having a crap name the made up a year ago and are stuck with but those who are trying to hide are not really avoiding the system as they would want to at least from more experienced players which another point entirely
we can change our names
name changes are allowed  sell your old character buy a new one anything past that i cant support
well i have been a vicesecretary secretary tasks can take quite a lot of time but it is quite a special role when i was only doing the regular csm stuff i spent about one hour a day reading forums assembly hall speakers center and the hungarian forums who are primarily responsible for voting me in to this you can add about one hour a week to read and process all the issues being raised plus i spent about one to two hours discussing them with my experts depending on the issues then we had meetings lasting at least 2 hours plus preparing and maintaining my own issues and sometimes other peoples issues in the wiki thats another hour or two this is 13 hours so farand time to time there were special tasks as well ccp asked for our opinions about this and that needed extra preparation and there were times where we had to spend time doing internal organization like mailing around priority votes moving stuff from csm wiki to evelopedia etc etc you get the idea it can be pretty time consuming
it was in the blog announcing the csm but otherwise the csm got told at the first meeting
is that the first one seems there should be an online meeting around midjuly id expect
nope thats the first onewe do have the monthly qas starting pretty soon tho
could be worse  your pet issue could be caught up in limbo from csmccp 23 and you could have gone better than two months without hearing any answer seriously though i think meissas concerns are valid here people react better to waiting than they do to rejection without explanation

dont let them railroad you because they love to do that and i hope you would not fall into a trap like rest of the csm where the trip to iceland and a circlejerk at ccp plus their own petty concerns have outweighed the needs of the community or had them turn blind eye to something asked begged and demanded for almost 4 years now i am a very private person do not want anyone digging around my life or have copies of my passports or anything like that otherwise i would have ran for csm myself on the sole premise of fixing pos  thats it one main issue as a focus oh well
supporting this awesome idea
its come up on the other thread and do wonder how standings might be used for nonwardec situations alsothe game has sec status and the combat zones are lowsec which takes care of this to some degreenpc corps adjust their standings to players and corporations based on what you do for or again their pilotsit could be possible that there is some room here for the players in a militia to act much like npcs when it comes to standings allowing attacks on anyone who has shown 50 worth of hostility this would mean that the militia would effectively wardec anyone who makes a regular target of faction pilots npc or otherwise may have to actually trigger the wardec mechanic though could get confusing as 50 isnt actually a legal attack in other situations but just an indicator of the relationshipit gives an automated standings setup for a nonplayer controlled alliance which sounds handyfood for thought anyway i cant see a complete solution yet but all the pieces are out here on the forum
this is exactly what i was trying to say in the little bit in my post
thank you for taking the time to look this over oz and im grateful you are minded to pick it up if noone else doescosmo
oz picked this up before me so ill let him roll with it if erik doesnt looks pretty cool from my end supported
so youre proposing a method whereby corporations could take part in fw and be able to take credit for the militias successes without any prospect of also taking the blame for their failuresmaybe thats a bit harsh but theres so many other ways that fw could be improved such as allowing corps that are also in alliances to sign upthere might also be issues arising from one sides third parties not being able to shoot at another sides third parties
i will support anything that will let my rp minmatar republic loyalist alliance take part in the rp minmatar storyline though as the mechanic for letting corps sign up to the militia is already there regardless of whether or not they are in an alliance that might be simpler especially as the option to defend would be important for us
i dont know about harsh  i am not proposing this for any one sides benefit but to what i believe is a general benefit  but its not quite right it seems to rest on a notion that only conquests of systems can be successes and only losses of systems can be failures it may be that people are allowed to get away with such a portrayal but thats what counterpropaganda is fori think theres a level of detail to how things are interpreted that could be gone into but its both for ccp design and also ccp storytelling to take care of for example i would suggest that only full militia members should get acknowledgement from the empires in the form of medals and so forth on the other hand a really outstanding third force could get a news mention quite legitimately if they truly deserve creditallowing individual corps that are also in alliances to sign up is i think in conflict with ccps view of what alliances are and what the empires are as well as being problematic from a mechanical point of view though nothing should be insuperable i would agree  but it would also be fairly problematical in terms of such things as an alliance having only one corporation exposed to the dangers involved while the majesty of its apparatus as a whole can support them logistically and in other ways that is where the concord war dec of old retains its usefulness a particularly troublesome third force can be decced by an opposing third force this is an instance where the concord war is precisely the right tool for the jobat any rate i am flexible as can be on details and implementations the main principle for me is the against option for meaningful and active entry into fw and the suitable balance and checks required to make it work are a matter for ccps judgementcosmo
ok then lets consider the followingunder this proposal wed be left with a situation where corps in the militia would be getting shot at the oppositions militia the oppositions allied militia and the oppositionss third parties but the third parties would only be getting shot at by the enemy militianow given that 90 of eve doesnt like being regularly outnumbered why would the average corp join the militia rather than adopt third party status
you may have noticed that i havent suggested a specific hurdle in terms of enabling a corp or alliance to declare against a militia this does not mean that i think there should not be one it may be financial it may be a standing hurdle it may be both or it may be something im unable to come up with at the moment but ccp might thats an important element of balance that would i am sure be looked at and i have no problem with it being looked at i mention this before dealing withaside from not wishing to overcome whatever hurdles may or may not be involved with declaring against a militia in order to be able to defend their factions systems to gain the rewards and recognition that is only due to full militias and for all the important roleplay reasons that you and i would supporti do actually anticipate some shifting out of certain corporations to third force status i think it actually would be better for the integrity of the militias and make for coherent roleplay within the militiasnote that i dont conceive this suggestion as being implemented if at all and in whatever form on its own i would be startled and amazed if only a single change of this kind was made to fw in its next development cycle but im conscious that i cant suggest an entire raft of reforms with one proposal and expect it to be taken upi think people who care about fw should be making proposals on improving plexing and general occupationconquest mechanics making fw more meaningful and consequential dealing with the balance on attack and defence etcthis proposal is about unlocking fw for greater participation that makes sense with regard to the cases of a alliances and b corporations that dont wish for whatever reason to sign up with a militiaanyway thanks for the questions they are important to considercosmo
i think its probably the best way presented of enabling alliances to enter fw tbhthe only problem i see here is the inability of allied fw entities to aid each other in these circumstances however i cant recall the last time i saw amarr and caldari or gallente and minmatar joint fleets
in principle good idea i think however fixing fw lag should always be higher priority doing this wouldnt be usefull anyway when the only result is that alliances can now also get desynced if they try something more than fighting solo
brilliant in concept would love to see the bugs worked out and something like this implemented well done cosmo
yetif this were to happen youd see minmaxed domi camps rring each other with deployed sentries and sensor boosters that make low sec even more unattractive to the casual pilot than it is low sec needs a boost not more incentives not to go there
whether he jumps into a camp of the above nature or a current lowsec camp the casual player is still boned either wayreally how many of the permacamped 00 chokepoints are camped in such a fashion where people dont have to worry about sentries at all
are you saying miners are an unballanced lot nah youre probably right and right again sayng this desperately need fixing the hop from skill l1 smallest barge to l3 middle barge is fair imho but on account of the sheer time involved and their relative merits dragging yourself to l5 for the biggest barge is out of ordermotion supported

hii think this was already discussed before but i at least want to know why we have a new interesting cool and quite expensive ship class and bad thing is when you lose it you need to wait 5 days without training just to fly it again in all lv5 i mean why should be any unnecessary bad thing or good equipment proper pay to manufacturer and proper time to trainingonce for use this just like any other ships

because ccp  on old wolfs they love n00bs they dont giving as new thinks and we have day by day more and more sp what is simpler give us new better whatever  or take ours sp

i dont think every station should be a kickout there needs to be some chance of survivalbut i do agree glass windows would be very good
ill be brutally honest here there are enough station games going on as it isif you are living in 00 in a sov controlled system in a known kickout station then you should have enough people cutting about to give you eyes on any potential neutshostiles in systemim all for making all stations kickouts it would certainly make things a bit more saucy though would cause some havov for a lot of stations however increasing the dock radius on current kickouts will make a lot of things stale and just increase the amount of docking games going onzastrows concern seems to be with 00 outposts more than anything if youre unable to defend your space effectively then you shouldnt be therethe wily player knows which stations are kickouts and which arent its one of those tidbits of information that adds to what keeps those in the know apart from those who arent
first machinima movies made using video games is awesome just look at clear skies or day of darkness 2 walking in stations promises to greatly enhance the ability for players to make interesting movies as youll actually be able to portray the pilots and stations themselves instead of using half life 2 or only showing shipsas such i propose to ask ccp to keep machinima in mind when designing walking in stations especially with the wis camera controls perhaps this is already in the works we dont know and perhaps it isnt but as it is being implemented i think it would be a great loss if ccp passed up this opportunity for machinima

anyways just throwing this out here how does everyone feel about a one time in a lifetime or a one time every 23 years to redistribute your sp or only 50 of your sp i know quite a few newer players who have made mistakes on skills they trained up and now are stuck with skills that they dont use i myself have this same problem when i was a younger player and flew caldari i quit and came back to perfer minmatar as i then understood the game and its mechanics more but i was stuck with 4 million sp in missile launcher operation tbh i would perfer a once per lifetime of a character use or a once every 3 year use as this is a much bigger change then redistributing attribute points
well we have attributes remap once every year so why not skill remp
because this would just make people dump all the useless skills they trained and specialize them  so now everyone could be epic killing machines of doomyou trained it knowing you couldnt go back  keep it that way
that all depends on how much sp you trained for skills other then what you specialize in tbh most of the skills that we regret training happen when we are newbs this is mainly to help solve that issue also with newer players coming in and with so many regular players with 20m sp the newer players stand a lesser chance against all these specialized sp players assuming they have half a brain to fit the ships correctly especially when they have no clue what they are doing as far as what skills to trainsomething similar was said about attributes i believe
thistheres a world of difference between optimizing skill training time using attributes and redistributing actual skill points some of the things which would happen1 extreme specialization you meet a guy in a ship  he probably has perfect skills for it2 assigning roles once corporations and alliances can decide exactly how many tacklers cap pilots probers etc they want they will start telling people to respec3 fotm to the extreme all of a sudden everyone would start flying the 3 or 4 currently best ships and then whine after a nerf that theyve wasted their skill redistribution this is in fact no different from whining about wasted skills today but today it actually makes sensethose are obviously additional points to consider aside from the obvious character development has consequences youre shaping a specific character with a specific history attributes have always been secondary and easily manipulated learnings implants but skills are something elsesorry no support
nowell onli if you lose 50 or more of redistributed spbecause when you have 5 million of useless sp its not just oops you spend monts on this

proposal warp scramblerthe recent changes to warp scramblers have made them too overpowered imho i suggest a small change to decrease their power to something more inline and correctchange the warp scramblers ability to disable reactivation of mwd instead of immediate shutdown
this mod has ruined gallente blaster boats ruined minmatar close range boats its forcing people to fit an afterburner a 5th mandatory med slot module tier 1 ceptors have become more useful in fleets than tier 2 ceptors because of this change too
no no one is forcing you to fit an afterburner before scram changes a 90 web also meant you werent going anywhere and it had more rangethe gallente blaster boats with most issues are the megathron and the hyperion especially the mega but also the hype dont have any serious problems reaching the 9km scram range and that is not realistic that you are at exactly 9km tracking is their problem not range
why dont we just put them back to 2 points thats itstupid freaking change
when webifiers were 90 you at least had a chance to drift off with the warp scrambler change its instantdeath
of course no one is forcing you to put an afterburner on dont be stupid but its another mod you ideally dont want to leave the station without along with a scrambler a web an mwd and a cap injector lets put it this way a megathron with 2 1600 plates and 3 trimarks seems fairly normal to me goes 822 ms with an mwdwhen its webbed with 90 thats10  822  822 ms top speedwhen its scrambled and webbed with 60 web its top speed is 116ms thats40  116  464 msthats almost 50 of the speed of a 90 webso thats the problem with the current situationokgot the speeds from eft with all lv 5 char

i replied in the other topicand no one fits both mwd and ab you just basicly dont ever need it and if you need it it isnt worth the downsides
scrams are great the way they are now makes nano turds think before coming in range i am glad that made that change and 100 back it up keep up the good work on this one ccp
stopped reading a while ago there is a solution get a cruiser fit it with ois and a 10mn mwd start bumping macro miners as for macro missioners idk havent encountered any but im sure theres a simple solution

extra time sinks in my evereally all this will do is raise the bar for new cap pilots even currently you cant fly a capital unless you are this awesome in terms of jump skills drone skills adding an extra 45 months of training time so you can t2 fit your caps isnt something people will do willingly aside from specialised capital alts
i find that i am among like minded folk hereif i could wave the ol magic wandtm id put all the slots back on the bargesexhumers their removal was just callous cruelty to carebearsgiven that progress always tends to the lower denominators id love to see a mining barge and of course its t2 cousin with a really serious cargobay for such solitary souls as myself something that can take 10 drones to a belt to mine and to defendi support the concept of existing public belts fading awayafter all reall rock doesnt respawn does it butonly do it when a noob doofus of lotech ability can actually find scanned belts simply and quickly and without gazillions of sp tied up in scanning skills  isk sunk into scanning ships and techso bumping the two ideas togethertake away the public belts equip all mining ships and i suppose i include the osprey and scythe herewith asteroid scanning facilities add a fourth mining bargeexhumer with stunning cargobay capabilities the scanning could be accessible when skills arrive but which are not essential to fly the ship maybe the return of those slots should be included here  the supersizeminer might require an easytoobtain extra skill level 1 to use of course higher levels increase the cargobay further as with industrialsi am really glad to have found this thread and endorse our representation on the council through omber zombiemotion supported

giving my support here industry  walking in stationswalking in stations is alot less important than one of the main core aspects of eve
something to think aboutits come to my attention that there are some quite sophisticated hacks to the eveclient to enable autopilot to 0kmgiven that half the universe is likely using these the rest of the population should get this feature as well
the most popular one by far is not using auto pilot
if you know of a hack to the eve client petition it to the developers because the game might be hacked for a few nefarious people does not imply that the very physics controlling the game should be altered as wellas far as the autopilot to 0 suggestion its been suggested numerous times before and the answer has always been no it used to be that we had to move to 15 km all the time but that was changed to the relief of the players of this game the system works as there is now a penalty to go with the advantage of each travel methodnot supported
if you want to warp to 0 click if you want to use the autopilot you warp to 15knot supported
no support
not using autopilot is the most popularautopilot to 15km makes sense to mehowever if no one uses it it becomes a nonfeaturethen if some people are able to use it while others cant it becomes an issue that can easily be solved by giving everyone the featureworth some discussion if nothing else
no support here fly manually if you want to warp to 0
id support wtz autopilot in high security space
wow you really produce your stupid threads at an amazing ratewould you care to explain the reasoning which led you to believe that no one uses it and that half the universe is using hacksyeah i thought as muchits not high security that makes a difference its war or suicide ganking those are both viable in high sec and wtz would seriously screw with them yes there are many people flying on auto during a war
support because if you know how to play you can even stop players that are warping to zero besides autopilot still wouldnt be able to get you out of bubbles afk is afk is wishing for an early death

so with 2 mods used your mega is 50 slower than it used to be with 1 mod yes scram does also the disruptor part but most ships will still need an additional disruptor to get better range so now recheck with 2 90 webs
your other topic is of no interest to me however i can see this being a viable change that could make things a little more balanced and can appease both sides

changing the collision box to make it fit the gate skin tight change warp to 0 to warp to the outer perimeter of the gate or deleting the collision box i dont carei suggest to simply delete the collision from the gate because it is the easiest possible fix some objects in eve dont have collision and it does rarely break visual immersion getting stuck in the gate is much more annoying than having to cope with the visual impression that the ship flies straight through itlast time it happened to my orca it took me half an hour to get her out again and it was really frustrating i even discoed two times but whenever she warped back she ended up stuck in the gate again it also looked horrible because she was not visually stuck from the looks of it she was hundreds of meters away from the structure she still acted like a fish thrown in the desert making spastic manoeuvres forth and backeventually i got out using the same discomechanismexploit that some use in lowsec to avoid gate camps if that had not helped i would have had to make a petition and ask for a gm tugboat
i wonder where one gets a t2 tugboat from must be one of those jovian ships
true
very few people gas harvest as it is making people train another ship doesnt really help people get into this profession i dont see a real reason for making gas harvesting more skill intensive
perhaps this is because it seems like there is little support by ccp for those who do gas mine you see people gas mining in various flavors of combat ships moa was suggested earlier in the thread getting no bonuses what so evera dedicated ship would not only make gas harvesting more appealing new ship wee it might even make a gathering profession a little less painful bonuses
leaving aside the chickenandegg stuff my old brain wont cope with it before three cuppas there is a large investment of gametime and cold hard cash by a player willing to adopt these specialist skills bows to all the gas miners as well as that there are the risks incumbent with mining in the kind of systems where gas appears not thatkind of gasit is a matter of balance and respect from the designerseconomists of ccp that they are allowed some benefit from their dedicationwe are not all cut out to be chribba  gods love him and he i dare say should be given his due for what he brings to ccps dirty little secretsome people have to mine to keep the games economy going a few of those people well might actually enjoy doing it are prepared to support the rest of the game with their time and dedication and should be rewarded accordingly gas miners and tankers to haul the stuff would really stand out as would mining tools elsewhere in the game
what i only want bonus for one of ship we have hulk mackinaw or skiff maybe skiff is the best or strip gas miners why new ship skills
this is not a huge issue  requires a minor tweak by ccpi agree with others that the simplist is to include gas mining on the barges  exhumerswe curently work in a whc5 and use the ferox ship for gas mining can fit the 5x t2 gas miners and provide a tank as welli see no need for a new ship type just to cover this area
new ship class too much workeasy give us gas rigs for our moas and feroxes and then we specialize our ships to the taskyue
the ideas aer just general proposals and ccp would hammer out the technicalities themselves with devs andor csmim just aiming to get the idea out there and hopefully the csm will pitch it to ccp
i think it would be more fun to know who the market participants wereit would spark more conversations between players possible cooperations and likely more spirited rivalries sometimes prices might be driven higher due to collusion other times margins would be narrowed by more concerted efforts to drive a given trader outtrue this might encourage more trader alts as corps might not want to risk retaliation or traders risk discriminationi just think it would be more fun and give you more to talk about as a trader if you could see the names of all the bidders politics intrigue building a reputation arent these things that deepen a mmporg experience more important than maximizing isktheyer
moar options are always good
bump any news since a week ago i apologize for being a pest but ive been trying to find out how ccp responded to my issue if at all ever since they responded or failed to respond over a month ago and have been waiting for the issue to be fixed for quite a lot longer than that i suspect their answer was we lied go screw yourself but id at least like to know the answer
i was 1st alternate csm in the second council and had the responsability to replace a councillor most of the time yet i think i spended 12 hours a week minimum in order to be well prepared for the csm meetings and so be able to give my opninion and votes

hawk and vengeance both suffer from the inadequacies of rockets fix rockets and they move way up the list of good afsmatari afs with tracking bonus  talk about being overpowered near perfect resists for tank easy to plug very high damage for their class capless weaponry and high speeds  you want to add superior tracking to that listenyo is scary as is maybe allow for a pure gank fit by giving it a 5th gun slot similar to what was done for zealotishkur is the best af currently no contest drones just add so much versatility that nothing really comparesquantum rise gave an indirect boost to the af class due to the new speed mechanics but the class itself needs an overhaul as does so many things make them matter as a whole and dont apply bandaid which usually end up being all thats done when the cries stopno to deliberately overpowered ships
when rockets are rebalanced i hope ccp are sensible enough to look at the ships that use them as part of it a damage related 4th bonus for the hawk and vengeance couple with whatever rocket changes are made should bring them to around 140 150 dps seems pretty reasonable to meyour take on the minmatar afs is pretty staggering to start with the obvious your claim that they have very high damage for their class the wolf has the lowest dps of all the gank afs enyo retribution wolf and harpy defined by slot arrangements and weapon bonuses rather than tanking bonuses in fact the wolf is outdamaged by one of the tackle afs as well the ishkur which is frankly appalling the jaguar fares a little better beaten only by the ishkur in its category but only because the rocket using afs are terrible note that the ishkur puts out around 100 dps more than the jag in a typical set up a tracking bonus is the perfect way to address this as it allows the minnie ships to actually put their high speed to good use countering for example the retribution or harpy by flying in close and attempting to speed tank but when fighting an enyo try to stay at range and use their falloff to winthe ishkur needs to remain where it is and the other assault frigs should be brought to that level in my opinion i apologise to any ishkur pilots but giving it another good bonus like a drone damage bonus would just be crazy
in the current situation destroyers do not forfill there role the way they should they are suppose to be frigate killers but in fact you see them being used in pvp so rare and when they are used there efficiency is low except for those rear cases when people using them have excellent plan and amazing setups first of all lets look at the balance between destroyers what is the destroyer people love most it is the thrasheri find it stupid that thrasher dominates so much as a pvp destroyer i tried all 4 destroyers in pvp and realised that thrasher dominates i spent hours fitting catalysts and coercers and could barely reach any efficiency close to that of a thrasher does that mean that thrasher is overpowered no in my opinion it is the only somewhat worthy destroyerso lets figure out why thrasher 70pg 170 cpu tracking and damage bonuscoercer 75 pg 160 cpu tracking and cap bonuscatalyst 60pg 170 cpu tracking and faloff bonuscomorant 55 pg 210 cpu optimal and tracking bonusfirst of all power grid catalyst and comorant severely lack power grid severely catalyst has less power grid same cpu as thrasher why comorant is a disaster it cannot fit 7 150mm rails without any additional modules all other ships in game can at least fit highest caliber guns of there class conclusion n1 bring power grid of ll destroyer more inline increase power grid on catalyst and coercer second problem i see are the stupid bonuses lets start with a catalyst we have bonus to falloff and as a class they get bonus to optimal so if i shoot rails i will use them in optimal so the ship bonus is simply wasted if i use blasters then the optimal bonus is nearly useless as it gives me only extra 200meters which is virtually nothing conclusion if it is suppose to be a blaster boat which it probably is change the class bonus to 50 bonus to falloff and the ships bonus should be changed to bonus to small hybrid turret damage comorant comorant receives bonus to optimal range which means you would use it as minisniper boat with rails if you are using rails at the limit of there optimal you probably will not need the tracking bonus so it would be of more use if comorant would receive a damage bonus insteadthrasherminmatar frequently fire in falloff even with arties both close range and longrange setups for this ship would benefit if class bonus would be switched to bonus to falloff instead of bonus to optimal the third problem i see affects destroyer class as a whole and that is the 25 rof penalty destroyers are the shortest living ships in game they are easy enough even for battlecruisers and medium drones to hit and have effective hp of a frigate with a plate i achieved higher effective hp on a punisher then that you get on most destroyers so if they live so little at least make those few seconds they do exist on the battlefield worthfull let them deal some proper damage yes it will increase damage of most setups by 25 but i think this will not bring destroyers anywhere close to being overpowered in my opinion it is currently one of the most underpowered ship class in game they can neither escape the guns nor tank them so lets make there slogan kill or be killedwhy that might be good highdps ships are good in pvp fast highdps ships are good in pvp and destroyers are cheap to loose that will make them perfect if you need to bring more dps to bear and havent got much cash on hand this will also make flying destroyers more exciting they would unleash large firepower but would be fragile
slotsthis is the final part of the proposal and i do not view it as necessary and not everybody agrees on this but i think that this would be the final touch in making destroyers worthwhile ships all battlecruisers have more slots then any cruiser in game this enables them to tank additional damage they receive due to larger signature radius then why do destroyers receive less slots then there frigate counterparts lets have a look at tristan we have 3 low and 3 med slots a total of 6 slots all destroyers have 5 slots i believe every destroyer deserves an extra slot
yes to grid and rof no to extra slots destroyers supposed to be glass cannons
1 extra slot would not make them megatanks lets face it but as i mentioned above slots arent something i am conserned about that much if they are glass cannons let them be cannons
good basic idea as other have pointed out it may need refinement but it has potentiali am in favour
i agree because sentries shooting drones unbalances the races in lowsec the guys that fly ships that dont have large drone bays dont care or like it the way it is because they can launch a bunch of crappy t1 drones to help them tankmeanwhile gallente in general and all the racial drone boats like the geddon phoon etc get screwed if we all had the same proportion of dps in drones it wouldnt matterbut we dont
on behalf of the fading suns corporation i would like to add our approval of this man this veldatar and the services he provides he has saved ccp countless hours of development time and headaches by serving as a neutral arbiter and information clearinghouse and the thousands of dollars every month he goes through in bandwidth isnt even remotely compensated by the piddling ad income he getsalthough it really should be in rens the amarr dont deserve chribbas titan
simple suggestion make bookmarks linkable in evemails and chat windows just like items areclicking a link would open the add bookmark window and let you edit and save itto link a bookmark you would simply drag either its item icon if copied in a container or the bookmark itself from your people  places window to a chat input box or an evemail bodythis would allow everybody to share bookmarks simply without having to copy them as items which has been a wanted feature for a long time already it would also not require much development to do since it would be using the mechanics already in place link window and add bookmark windowi know some form of bookmark sharing has been requested in the past but i havent seen a post requesting simple bookmark linking without a whole bookmark sharing ui
yeah
good sense bookmarks as items have seemed insane to me for a while
no you might not notice it at first but theres a lot of stuff why it makes sense that you actually need to hand over the bookmark personally
and i dont see any of those reasons as being valid it just doesnt make sense to me that in a world so advanced technologically universe of eve online pilots cant share simple coordinates over a communication channel or evemail it never made sense to me
scenario a spy is with your gang in a safespot bookmarks it and links to a member of another gang in system he never leaves fleet to draw suspicion and the other gang doesnt even need to probe for youin this iteration i give an emphatic noi could support linking bookmarks in fleet only as it could be useful from a gameplay perspective i feel anything more could be too exploitable
i think thats irrelevant spies are part of the game and this would just make their role more realistic there are several ways to counter spies asking for the api key and retrieving all characters in same account for example all this would do is make it slightly easier for them to relay secret locations but i say again only slightly easierif youre that worried though i would be for a restriction on which channels the bookmarks could be linked i have nothing against it being only corp to corp or corp to alliance but not player to player
a bookmark is essentially either a system and three numbers or a system and a globally visible objectlike a station it makes perfect sense that this should be able to be transmitted via chat channels and its not like this is going to overpower spying or anything  spies can already do far worse than giving you a warpin

convincing arguments
repost this has been suggested many many many times already no need for another post for this
not at all previous proposals have not been successful maybe they were not good enough to garner sufficient support i see no use raising any from their gravesmy proposal is hopefully more wellconsidered balanced eloquent detailed and clear if it isnt itll be drowned by torrents of equally unfortunate suggestions in no time and swept from your dismissing gaze to page 27 of this section
eos is suck it needs love supported
eos is as sucky in a similar way than other similar purpose command ships like vulture damnation claymore theyre not meant to be pwnmobiles dps wiseinformation warfare bonus is just seemingly a bit less useful than other link bonuses shield armor and speed bonuses are easy to utilize in a way but not many ships get notable information warfare bonus maybe eos could have links for increasing drone hp range tracking etc damage bonus is big no no in my opinion though drones already do enough damage
this needs to be looked into  not being able to see what is outside due to change mechanics on now how undocking worksanyone with a warp ubble and a few friends can ruin your day when you cant do a thing about it
windows  kickout pleaseat the very least remove the 40km docking range around most caldari stations jita 44 and the like please
i agree also some stations have stupidly huge ducking radius people can just play docking games as much as they whant and you would have to smash them with mwd bs a few times to get get them out of range not sure if even thatwould help

lol noisaac
i think thats a great idea i would leave the balancing to ccp however
of course this is just a draft idea
no if you want to shoot other capitals and towers more effectively get a dread carriers already have enough roles they dont need more
pretty much this id be cool with other types of fighter drones if people had good ideas for them but anticapital is a field thats already got a capital class tasked to it
supported for the following reasoncruisers were once the biggest ship in eve then came battle ships then came caps then came super caps and now triple doomsdaying is far from unheard of what next mega caps that fire hacs as ammo
no to anticapital fighters but yes to new breeds possiblythe anticapital role is already fielded by so many ships a few battleships take out a carrier easily and with a dread it becomes even simpler the carriers are support platforms and by no means damage platformsnew breeds of fighters would be nice but it comes to mind that pretty much every role is covered maybe things such as logistical fighters could be a nice addition to add towards the logistical platform role
they should not be as effective as dread but more effective then current fighters
there might be a point in giving them a solid anti capital ship angle and only allowing motherships to be able to field them

recently ccp introduced a new set of faction cruisers to the game so that there would be a faction tier 1 and tier 2 cruiser for every race while thats fine there are issues when comparing slot layout caracal navy issuelow slots 4med slots 5high slots 6total slots 15osprey navy issue low slots 3med slots 5high slots 4total slots 12vexor navy issuelow slots 6med slots 3high slots 5total slots 14exequror navy issuelow slots 5med slots 3high slots 4total slots 12omen navy issuelow slots 7med slots 3high slots 6total slots 16augoror navy issuelow slots 7med slots 3high slots 5total slots 15stabber fleet issuelow slots 6med slots 4high slots 5total slots 15scythe fleet issuelow slots 3med slots 4high slots 6total slots 13as you can see there are discrepancies between the slots of the various ships when it comes to battleships all tier 1s have the same number of slots except for the dominix because drone boats always get one less slot than other ships in their category the same is true for tier 2s and tier 3s if you look at battlecruisers you see the same thing tier 1s have the same slots at other tier 1s etc the same holds true for t2 ships interceptors afs hacs etc so why does this category of ship get to be different especially when it unbalances the ships certain ships such as the nexequror and the nosprey have as many as 3 slots less than their counterpart the naugoror the scythe while still worse off than the naugoror at least is a slot up on the other two those are all the tier 1 faction cruisers the same issue can be seen in the tier 2s all have 15 slots except for the nomen and the nexor but thats because its a drone ship so why do some ships get more than others how is that fairmy proposal is make all faction cruisers have the same number of total slots as their counterparts i vote giving the nexequror another mid the nosprey another high keep the scythe how it is and remove a low and a high from the naugoror giving all tier 1 faction cruisers 13 slots for tier 2s i vote keeping them all with 15 slots that means only the nomen need be changed losing that excess high slot many people argue that slot layout isnt a means of balancing ships and thats somewhat true but if you homogenized the number of slots in each ship class i think youd find a natural balance coming through but maybe not i cant totally tell if that would balance them or not but preliminary evidence suggests that it would go a long way
on the surface i have to agree but i havent messed around with any of the navy cruisers so i dont know firsthand how balanced toward each other they may be your argument makes sense but i wont agree right away cause i would like to hear from some more folks who have used the ships
balancing ships by pure counting of slots seemssketchy there may well be a problem here but making your argument purely on slot count is unconvincing
slot number and slot layout alone mean nothingslot number slot layout and ship bonuses in connection to ship type tanking type weapon system and base stats means something so if you want to make a serious point research all that and try to make a comparison
why do you want to nerf faction cruisers wtf navy omen has the same slot layout like the old navy auguror but diffrent to it it is usefullwas intreduced in emperian age simply since it can match a zealot but got another focusmore flexiblity for solo and close range combat because of the extra high slot and the drones while the zealot is still superior at rangethe main problem is that all tier 1 faction cruisers are preaty mutch pointless atm since they lost her superior nano aspectnavy exequeror needs another med a bit more powergrid for a large shield extender or 800mm plate and doubled structure hpno you didnUFFFDt read wrong not armor not shield structure since the only real job this ships performs halve deacend is something like a cruiser sized taranisnavy vexor needs one more med and some more grid so you can make it more ganky at close range than a ishtarwhat is allready possible in a glas cannon setup also 50mUFFFD spare drones would make it more interesting
what made them  is their price cruisers costs from 3m to 8m current prices navy version is around 100m a price range of 20m30m would be sufficient as entry level before battlecruisers
alright let me talk about balance ill go into the tier 1s at the moment because those are the only ones that seem remarkably outofwhack nospreythe nosprey sounds great its fast and agile capable of pulling more than 2kms it sounds like a badass kiterthe cruiser version of a crow but its grid is so horrible that you can only barely fit a mwd and a full rack of launchers leaving no grid for tank or a cap booster this is assuming that youre fitting 2 bcus in the lows so that your damage can compare to that of a similarly fit caracal and the damage is respectableabout 340 with max skills and faction missilesbut this leaves the ship itself horribly fragile even if you fit it with 3 field extenders an invul ii and a medium shield extender the only kind that will fit you only get 13k ehp aside from the kite fit you could try a tank but even if you devote every slot to running a tank aside from one for the speed mod and one for the point you still only end up with tanking a little more than 200 dps and the kicker you cant fit a full rack of launchers if you fit the cap booster necessary to run the tank nexequrorthis is an interesting ship on the surface its slightly faster than the nosprey and a bit more agile and yet it has no real role you can try using it like a thorax but its outperformed in almost every waythe rax is tougher has better cap and matches the nexequrors damage alternatively you can utilize its massive speed for a kiter fit but its uses even then are limited as you have to use rails your natural speed destroys your tracking and so you cant actually use a speed tankits more of a range tank but more and more ships these days are fitting for range if you fit a mwd and a full rack of guns you no longer have the grid for anything remotely resebling a tank which means any minmatar ship larger than a destroyer will be able to put significant damage onto you from your desired range with barrage most amarr ships will be able to hit you effectively with scorch and all caldari ships except a few frigates will be able to hit you wherever you are that means the only race of ships you can usually beat is gallente and even then you run into problems with light drones because you cant outrun them and you cant shoot them yes you can get a respectable 350 dps at that range but only when you arent using your mwd also just to put this in perspective the nexequror setup that i use has 6k ehp scythe fleet issue theres no way to shorten thatthe scythe can only be used to kite its actually faster still than the nexequror and it uses projectiles and missiles neither of which run into trouble when tracking at high speeds but like the nexequror this ship is remarkably fragilewhile it can fit a lse ii it also needs to fit a pdu so that it can fit the falloff rigs necessary to push its range far enough to be meaningful unlike its cousins the scythe has a large drone bay comparatively and so can get the standard 350 dps without a damage mod this means youre free to fit overdrives or nanos in the lows leading to a very fast ship out of all the kiting faction cruisers well tier 1 cruisers the nomen and fleet stabber are different stories the scythe is actually the most effective though it does have the same cap problems as the other two it can fit a cap booster in place of the lse though it then becomes even more fragile than the nexequror however due to its fourth mid it can fit support mods such as a web so that it can kill drones or a tracking disruptor the scythe functions because it has the extra slotit has the highs to deal damage equivalent to its counterparts while having the freedom and grid mind you to fit support the nexequror could do this too if it had a fourth mid and the nosprey could do it with a fifth high
continuednaugororthe naugoror is not a kiter can it kite sure it has the lows to be able to fit nanosoverdrives as well as heat sinks and the grid to fit a full rack of heavy pulse iis along with those heat sinks if you want to kite with it you can get a fit that goes 2kms hits at 25km for 310 dps andheres the kickerhas almost four times the ehp of the scythe and three times the ehp of the nexequror but its still slower and less damaging than the nosprey so we can see that its not a kiter but it can tank its not the best damage dealer around but if fit for an active tank it can tank 400 dps with 30k ehp while dealing 210 dps and fitting tackle and a speed mod none of the other ships in its class can even come close to these numbers the nexequror can approach the ehp by devoting all its low slots to it but if it does so it nerfs its dps down to that of the naugoror fit hereessentially you end up with a naugoror that has no active tank moreover if you fit for a purely passive buffer on the naugoror you can get more than 130k ehp while still fitting a speed mod tackle and dealing 200 dps again none of the ships in its class can come close to these numbers it seems to me that the extra slots are what unbalances this ship as losing either 2 lows or a low and a high would mean respectively that 1 it still tanks harder than the other ships in its class but doesnt come near the bizarre numbers shown above or 2 it tanks significantly harder than its counterparts but loses more damage to compensate as it is this ship outperforms all the other in almost every way
the day they announced the new faction cruisers i was discussing this issue with corpmates the navy omen is like a gift to the amarr from the benevolent devgods while the navy exequror is like a slap in the facenavy exequrors damage and rate of fire bonus but only 4 turrets and tiny drone bay ensure the dps will be mediocre no matter how you fit it it cant tank it can dps a bit and it cant remote rep which at least the nonfaction variation can do why bring it over a thoraxi see tons of navy omens around and even in the alliance tourny which makes sense navy omens a great ship i think ive seen only 1 navy exequror ever turn the navy exequror into a navy thorax with decent stats please
this
yup 
this post actually changed my mind on the subject pointed out exploits and issues that i didnt see at first good post
ok where is the problem here if you meet me you will meet extreme specialization do you honestly believe that and people will comply so is this the fault of sp remap or the players being ed no player with a sense of brain would remap to fotm they would remap to what they want to fly of course some will remap to fotm but that is their problem and not the systemthat is where you are wrong attributes are pretty much the same catagory there is the same amount of whines for sp that there is for attributes the choice of attributes too is considered development process and the choice you make is the consequence you live with but with attiributes remap you can just role over no different from sp remap
this would change the economy a lot fotm and an instant increase in market competition with wasted sp put into industryscience you train what you need i would support a different kind of sp redistribution though if a skill is less than 10 completed you can put the sp into another skill those few thousand sp that are lying around in uselesscurrently useless skills with limitless uses and maybe a 10 penalty ofc the sp would have to be recalculated based on the time needed to train the skill spmin would keep people from training a specific skill for which they have good attributes and putting the sp into another skill
no
there is no valid reason why you should be able to spend skillpoints again if you trained some useless skills then that be itredistributing skillpoints towards skills you dont have isa not fair towards others who have trained the skills and are happy with the way they are and have no skillpoints they want to redistributeb not fair towards new players as they as well just like you will have to train the skills to actually get something while your taking the shortcut your time in eve should not mean you get an horrendous advantage over the new guys as seen with exponential skill training timessure you will spend a few sp in a few skills you never use but this shouldnt be millions otherwise it is your own damn faultlets drop the idea of matrixstyle skill injection now please
this  scrams turning off mwds actually made abs worth using in pvp and as it is lots of people still think that abs are a lolfit
the whole great speed nerf patch was a horrible design change i still have trouble understanding how that monstrosity was allowed to go through and considering that it has i dont believe theres any hope left in talking sense into ccp its over we lost
yep no positives came with this changeafterburners are are still lolfits 99 of the time
the speed nerf had a lot of dumb parts but this was one of the good ones scrams used to be lolfits now theres actually a decision to be made this proposal is not bad per se but its unnecessary and i dislike tiny changes just because theyre hard for players to keep up with
so whats the difference in terms of speed between an old 90 web and a warp scrambler
did you fail first grade read the thread quoting what shouldve been obvious
wouldnt the better solution here be to boost abs such that theyre not unusable on ships other than frigates
needed
the only party that is effectively and efficiently able to stop macros is ccpunless they decide to really do so it will not work without breaking the gameso instead of suggesting and debating means that dont fit the ends you should run a campaign to make the csm put pressure on the issue on part of ccp even though ccp usually wants suggestions from the csm that include a clear solution this is one of the issues where the only thing that has to be done is to tell ccp that it is their frelling responsibility to fix iti dont think they will do so however they make too much money from the macros which makes the decision to remain inactive quite understandable from an economic point of view
everyone with more than 3 active brain cells can understand that ccp is losing alot if money due to macros without macros rmting all those isk buyers have to use gtcs which results in more profit for ccp
more time to sink somewhere else
topic is apparently raised from the deadshould be implemented like this
that idea i like a lot
good idea supported
you were given a rorqual and orca to fufill this
lol you ignorant
definetly supported
definite support removal of chance based invention would reduce pain even if datacore requirement went up in proportion
there is no such thing as an autopilotto0kmhackthe only trick i know is this one1 set your autopilot settings to stop at each waypoint2 set a destination of your choice3 rightclick the yellow gate in the overview and warp to 0km4 rightclick the yellow gate in the overview and add as first waypoint5 activate autopilot6 as you come out of warp on the gate the autopilot jumps for you automatically7 as you come out of the jump the autopilot stops deactivates8 repeat steps 37 until you reach your destinationthis in a covert ops ship fitted with a covert ops cloaking device is a way to travel pretty much undetected anywhere just activate your cloak asap after step 3 as soon as your ship starts moving and again after step 5you still have to be in front of your screen the whole way though so this is not autopiloting
not true there is an executable that appears to manipulate eves memory to change the warp to 15km command to 0kmid like to use it but i dont cheat others can use it with no fear of being caught because they want tolevel playing field would be neat like i said just something to discussonly idea ive come across so far that doesnt break the current timesink is a warp to 0  jump on contact button or the ability to tell it to jump midwarp means youre through the gate and 15km away from safety but in lowsec to highsec boundaries it would allow someone to go afk for that warp knowing theyd be in highsec or a home system at the end might just add some usability without making a fully automated ap to 0 not perfect but another tool that might workas said above afk is afk regardless of how autopilot worksedit btw i really like the 5 click solution posted above lolthis isnt about a way to travel undetected or i want it to be easy its about some people having autopilot to 0 while others donthow to fix how to level playing field
i totally dont support this yeah sure it would make sense for an advanced autopilot to warp to 0 but it would break the game as we know it suddenly 20 jumps is not far anymore freighters arrive at their destination an hour earlier than now which would cause markets to level aka destroying local markets which would be terrible annoying for the thousands of people who earn their isk with that low sec ah what the hell lets just auto pilot through it while watching a movie on one screen and eve on the other no
no this is about you making ridiculous claims based on hearsay or not based on anything at all you just had a revelation and now can see how half of eve is using a modified executable to update their autopilothave you reported that mythical exploit to cpp because thats what you do not spawn yet another thread in assembly hall
im sorry but reality does not require your beliefthe exe exists is in somewhat widespread use and functions very wellim simply posting a thread so that possible solutions to releveling the playing field can be discussedas for reporting it im sure the devs are aware im not here to take this tool away from anyone i think its a good feature and for some it might be critical to their accessibility of the game i choose not to use it but have no problem with those who do as said above afk is still afkyes i am a bit sick of what ive seen from the csm and have been trolling it up as i found the serious approach to be a bit of a joke around here so you can take that personally if you like that can be your problem
so theyre doing that now using this exploitlooking for a solution or a balance for nonexploiters to that not a cause
not supported this would make hauling in hi sec even more easier than it already isalthough op has a good point it is probably pretty easy to automate warp to 0 route with macros and bookmarks p i would not be suprised if some people had been using it from 2003 or so already p
if by hack you mean the old trick of assigning your mwd to f1 and putting a weight on f1 with autopilot on
well i just did a quick search on google for eve online autopilot bot and surprisingly found a lot of results im not going to test any of them because i dont need such a thing but some seem like they are in deed working or were working until recently im sure ccp is well aware of those however
no no and no actually fly your ship if you want to wtz
i would also like this as long as you come out at 15km from the station same as for stargatesi do see one problem with this change though which could make it more complicated for now the autopilot waypoint system only takes system ids and not station ids this means they would have to allow stations as a final destinationdont get me wrong id love to see this happen but i dont think it will be high in their priorities
no support afk ease is not eve
agreed not supported
which is stupidif you want to make a point compare it with dualweb
might be interesting but it seems unnecessary
it sounds like something that the thoraxdeimos should have i dont fly them but it seems that the people who do adapted themselves very good wasting a low slot for a 1 mwd sounds ok but then people just fit dual scramedit can you stick to one thread for each proposal please i got another one at
the suggestion is simple and resembles the send to context menu in windows for the ones who know what im talking aboutbasically the context menu would allow you to move items from your cargo to your personal or corporation hangar without having to open both containers side by side and dragdroping the itemthis would be especially useful for haulers or when you want to quickly offload something in the corporation hangarfor the corporation hangar the context menu would show all available tabspossible destinations would be cargo hold current ship personal hangar corporation hangar  hangar tabs
oh and i support myself woot
as part of the overhaul to context menus this could work yes
x the ninja salvager should be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because the mission runner owns the wrecks and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamicccp  please take this situation seriously i play with many mission runners and the current rules cause them and me a lot of greif we all think its unfair i am sorry to say that this is one thing about eve that i hateto the salvage ninjas stop being carebares and hiding behind concord at least mission runners take the time and risk their considerably more expensive ships running missions and it is not so you can freely and safly steal our hard earned salvage the bring up bogus reasons why you should be allowd to continue if you want to excursize your criminal sides there are plenty of low sec systems oh wait thats right all ninja salvagers are lazy cowards last thing any one who is opposed to this is a salvage ninja or dose not understand what we are taking about i cannot not wait until this injusttice is fixed
this is quite true and for this reason if for none of the others the suggestion to increase times is a valid one  personally id go for 3 minutes and make gates the same i think this will result in a lot more corpies hiding in next system shenanigans but so be it docking games  especially with capitals could do with a shake up and this is a great sugestion
supported what about using the old effect but have the capital slide outta the worm hole effect like it fly threw it not formed the worm hole around it
apocrypha effect is lame bring back the lightning
signed seriously new effect is lame
bs v in 10 days but i wont be training caps before they return the old cyno
signed
supported of course the actual effect is soo bad jumping a capital ship should not looks like jumping through stargates
new graphic is worse than lame
i want thundering lightning 
signed
please return the old cyno effect
signed
definitely signed

i think the biggest issue with afs is that everyone seems to be addressing them according to eft outputs while a vengeance or a hawk may put out a very small amount of dps on paper when you consider what rockets can do to other frigates you might be inclined to change your opinion again as ive stated time and time again in this thread the different ships fare better against different targets and there is no instawin button considering how ridiculously fast rockets tear t2 frigates apart as it is a damage bonus or addition of launcher harpoints would make them ridiculously overpowered and upset what little balance has been maintained by ccp through all the complaints from players who dont bother learning how to fly their shipsand again as linked from a previous pageevidence that vengeances are fine as is

destroyers are used in faction war minor plexhard to find a good fleet pvp fitting without adding power or cpu especially for catalyst
extra slot would be good other stuff also good the catalyst really needs a ground up rebuild tbh it has no direction
indeed i see people using it with both blasters and railguns
yup destroyers are awesome but then i tried to fit one and i thought aha you mean destroyer as in destroying the morale of the player that wants to fly itsuppport for destroyers that can destroy something other than my morale
signedi bought my destroyer to help with npc rat frigates but i never noticed that it wasnt nearly as effective as the description of destroyers touted
i agree fw lag needs to be fixed though i would be inclined to view it as lowsec lag or even more nonhubnon00 warfare lagthe basic problem is that when battles occur beyond a given scale in systems that are not resourced for it horrendous lag happensits actually a more general problem and in my view a very longstanding problem brought into sharp relief by fws mechanics tending to lead to lots and lots of skirmishes punctuated by a short series of escalating large battlesat any rate while lagfixes should be given high priority i dont think they conflict particularly with this type of game design consideration particularly as fw development must be done as a package of reforms and updates of which my proposal is only onethanks for the input thoughcosmo
bump
back up to the top ccp still havent fixed this
please for the love of eve boost those poor gallente recon ships theyre so fail with their weak rsd bonuses and overzealous stacking penalties that youre better off fitting ecm on the arazu and treating it like a falcon
csm want to say a few words
just thought id give it a bump and also mention the love needed to be given to the rsd rigsbefore the nerf the rsd rigs had 10 bonus to strength now they are 5  and the penalty stays the same  there is no incentive to fit these at all  especially with the stacking penaltiessomeone please fix thema single acknowledgement of this thread would be nice  just so we know your at least looking at them thanks
wow the arazu looked to be a sweet ship on first glance then i trained for it and noticed how much of a fail it isso i come here and see that this thread is alive and kicking for a year and no response or hope in the foreseeable futurei get the distinct impression that this council is as much fail as the arazu drink a lot of coffee and chat i assume good for starbucks business great job councilsarcasm of course wont further the cause i suppose but then neither has reasonable requests and patienceanother patch today and no love for the gallente reconsfull support for this long standing 8 pages of support year long thread

with so many topics about the mom tytans problem still no comment from ccpis it worth posting those problems
they dont need buffs they need to be used in the way they were intended they are not solo pwnmobiles they are support ships you wouldnt take a oneiros or a falcon on a solo roam would you supper caps are support ships made to assist off grid more then on grid of a conventional capital fleet they support with either bonuses like the titan or with massive swarms of fighters like the mother shipsthink of it this way would you want to put wheels on a aircraft carrier and have it drive on land and directly support tanks and troops where it would be a huge lumbering target or maybe would you keep it 5 miles off the coast and hundreds of miles out from the war zone delivering death from afar if your answer is death from afar please then why would you want to do this with a mother ship thenthe biggest effect titans can have on a large fleet engagements are not the doomsdays its the fleet bonuses it can supply to the fleet and the logistic support of the titan bridgehow often do you see titan death mails with gang links attached or mother ships with clone vat bays neverit would be absolutely scary to find a null sec alliance that understands how to use a super capital and uses their super caps the way ccp intended
yes after all that chribba has done for eve he should be allowed to bring his new ubermining barge into highsec

i could not say it any better myself
yes because without chribba eve would lose a piece of its soul
faction stuff is a relic from old times before t2 messed the whole balancing thing up right seriously if you think faction stuff is cool to be collected and never taken out of the hangar then stop reading right here i for one would love to field one of these rare and expensive toys but as it stands t2 is always way better i think we can all agree that pvp is pretty much t2 just take a look at the various killboards interceptors assault frigs recons hacs dics and hics battlecruisers are the only valid eco pvp class vessels bs and above i consider pos warfare tools  agreed there are faction ships which do ok faction bs for our mission carebears navy caracal and fleet stabber do a pretty good job in pvp as well as the phantasm but what about the restcynabal 160m right now less dps slower less effective hp less drones and med slots than a vaga making it less versatile  actually it does nothing better than a vagabond all at the same time it just looks better vigilant just some sort of black deimos with crappy statsgila totaly uselessnot to mention all the faction and pirate faction frigs i would ask the csm to support a review of these faction ships to make them actually viable for pvp to be clear im not saying those faction or pirate faction vessels should match t2 but if they dont and somebody would say for some odd reason they were went to be between t1 and t2 then rebalance them by adjusting bpc drop rates to get a lower price tag according to their power
vigilant guardian angels minmatar  gallentebeeing mixed galminni and gallente lacking a real sniper i see the vigilant as a deimosmunnin mixrequired skills gallente cruiser 5  minmatar cruiser 5gallente cruiser skill bonus75 bonus to medium hybrid turret tracking speed per level and 5 bonus to medium hybrid turret damageminmatar cruiser skill bonus10 bonus to medium hybrid turret optimal range and and 5 increase to microwarpdrive capacitor bonus per levelthe rest of the values would need some eft work to get it balanced between the eagle and muninn just with slithly different roles obviously the dronebay has to be smaller and in order to just not have a muninn that looks like a deimos we need to make the vigilant fast with the wmd and tracking bonus it would differ of how a muninn plays alternatively you could just say lets make it faster like deimos cause its minmatar give it some more versatility with the 1 med slot while removing some dps and voila there goes your dedicated vaga killer just a little tweaking here and there
gilagurista caldari  gallentewe allready have the cerberus drake and navycaracal with all those missile bonuses right eagle and cerb are snipers pretty much so it could either be a dps boat navycal with assault launchers does that job pretty well i assume or a drone boat with a shield tank which would be uniquerequired skills gallente cruiser 5  caldari cruiser 5gallente cruiser skill bonus5 bonus to medium hybrid turret damage per level and 10 bonus to drone hitpoints damage and mining yield per skill levelcaldari cruiser skill bonus5 bonus to shield resistance per level and 5 and dunno yet maybe something for activepassive tanking depending on final slot layout or even 5 medium hybrid damage depeding on dronebay we wont get the gila to close to the vexorishtar me thinks
100 support would love to use my dramiel as something other than a paperweight and a gila with hybrid dps and drone dps bonuses would be superbthe navy osprey could do with some love in the form of extra pg and a couple of low slots for nanos
id much rather see their cost lp tag etc reduced so that their price more closely reflects their ability which is between t1 and t2i do firmly agree that these ships should not be collectors items and that the game would benefit a great deal from the added variety that having more reasonably priced faction ships would bring i am in favor of them receiving sufficient love to bring the other faction vessels up to par with the sansha ones so long as they remain essentially tech level 15 why not on par with t2 because i hope to see t2 faction equipment at some point as an aside i think a drone bonus on the gila is a horrible idea but primarily for immersion reasons
yes pls its about time
the csms job is not game balance thats held by the qa people at ccp the most they could do is ask them what the story is on these ships as they are rare drops by commanders the only real way to change anything about the cost is to have more commanders drop them but then you get into market saturation and suchim sure the qa guys have their hands full with the strategic cruisers right now but the csm could advance this issue still perhaps in one of the csmccp qa sessions while i support this measure dont expect a quick response as ccp has their hands full already
they are available from the relevant lp stores the gila is acquired from the guristas just as the navy caracal can be acquired from the state excluding the vastly increased risk of missionrunning in npc 00 that is same applies to all of themedit they are also dropped by certain npcs so your not wrong there though commanders arent the only ones to drop the bpcs
while i agree with bunyip i also like the overall idea of making the faction ships more viable making them fully insurable could be a waythey are pretty they are cool they are tied to the world of new eden arent factions supposed to be important ehnow all those sexy ships are mostly gathering dust subsequent changes in mechanics nos for example and the introduction of t2 and new modules warrants a closer look at faction ships lets leave the specifics to ccp but imo they should put this on a todo list at least
relevant to our interests linkagelooks like the devs intend to look into the issue but its on the distant horizon so long as the priceperformance ratio works out better in the end i dont mind which side of scale is tipped though im still of the opinion a bit of both would be ideali still support this issue as i dont think the devs realize just how long many players have been waiting for a full review of these ships nor the importance they have for those representing the outlaw factions
yes indeed i thought i was the only one thinking this on another note i also think faction gear needs a revamp as it stands theyre only expensive toys for mission runners and the same goes for the faction shipsi say remove the artificial price tag barrier in the lp store no isk for bpcs and let the players decide the price tag increase the drop rates as well after all this is a pvp game no then shouldnt the best gearships also be geared towards pvpsupport with additionsps btw battleships are pvp rr bs gang anyone foty anyone
god bless you yes and yes again
fully supported although i doubt that the ccp will do it
you should be pushing for is a string of player editable commands that would allow players to modify colors font font size and font color and other minor things like that it should not include skinning of in game objects creation of executable commands or changing of in game sounds you should stay away from using players to create addons for the game interface because it sounds like you want to allow players to create custom uis rather then modifying ccps by using ccps own scripting environment you expect them to create ccp sees the entire client as a ui to the database server that actually runs the game
this is very much like my commercial cynos and jumpdrive idea for the jump freighters which you can read if you check my sig below
on one hand its pretty much the same as when they changed cov cynos to be usable in cynojammed systems so theres no reason not to support it it has nothing to do with the ships themselves it doesnt change anything about black ops at all all it does is allow the ships to be used in an area where they cannot be utilized currently just like the change to allow them in cynojammed space allowed their use in sov 00 regions with const sovprevalent cynojammed space it allows a subset of players empire war dec corps access to a ship class that they currently lack along with their unique tacticsabilities and opens up another subset of players highsec carebears who get wardecd to being victims of a whole new world of griefingganking tacticson the other hand do corps who run around decing highsec corps full of carebearsnewbiescasuals really needdeserve any new toys especially ones which can be utilized to such devastating effect in an environment like empire vs the types of unsuspecting targets that inhabit highsec do they really need even more advantages i mean come on youre seal clubbingbaby seal clubbing at that the hardest part of empire wars is finding targets who will undock during a wardec at all which is why i understand whyd you be interested in adding black ops to your toolbox they enable so many options and enable you to exploit opportunities for kills that you couldnt accomplish otherwise but thats kind of the problemif they allow covert cynos to be used in highsec space the first war dec corp that actually uses them properly is going to create so much drama and result in such a massive amount of carebear tearsforum whines to the point that eventually ccp will have to change something and ccps method of balancing something is to nerf it and everything associated with it into the stone age then on top of that they also do the simple minor change like whoops ok lets roll that back you cant use cov cynos in highsec any more ya know the thing that would have solved the problem alone without destroying several entire ship line ups in the process but by that point youre left with a ship that has 3 highslots a 1ly jump range with jdc v that requires 500m3 worth of fuel to jump itself to a covert cyno which lasts 5 minutes now pulses an ecm burst every 20 seconds jamming everyone on grid can only be lit by blockade runners who can no longer fit a covert ops cloak which also broadcasts its location in the local chat of every system in the constellation every 3 seconds to remind everyone what youre doing and where then ccp will say ok highsec carebears stop crying we fixed it the bad men cant light covert cynos in high sec anymore to which everyone responds gee thanks but if you didnt notice with all the other nerfs why would anyone ever bother to fly a black ops or light a covert cyno anywhere much less in high sec which ccp will respond well see there you go why did we waste those man hours implementing these changes when the problem solved itself anyway we cant justify allocating any more devreview time on this until winter expansion 2012 and by 2012 we of course mean 2014 which is when well actually get around to adding the fuel bay weve been promising wed add for the last 4 expansions in a row
i find this highly intriguing but i think one relevant point has been missed drug running those blue and red pills would be super easy to get into hi sec now not sure if that should be made easy i will reserve my option to support or not support until somebody addresses this possible issue
if you fly enough strategic ships that this is a problemyou need to rethink your strategyno support im glad they added this featureisaac
yep useless feature that adds nothing to the game less meaningless timesinks and horrible features
actually i like the proposal ive always been a fan of the idea of being able to color all or part of our ship hulls and i definitely like the idea of corp and alliance logos on themyour proposal to have these colors and logos load last under load is sensible  this keeps large fleet battles from lagging more than they do already to this i would add the suggestion that logos cache so they dont have to be reloaded if the client already has them
supported i for one would like a bit more personality in ships
1 from me
ok
id like it if you could opt as to which logo went where corp in the big slot and the like a lot of people associate more with their corp then a larger entityeditforgot my thumb
nayas much as the server hardware for this game have been very impressively stable thus far im not going to support any initiative that is going to strive towards putting more stress and strain on the network and hardwarei am also speaking from the perspective of a roleplayer who may have the most reason andor cause to support something like this but for the greater interest no thanksfurthermore for all practical purposes when i want to shoot at someone its mostly zoomed out anyway all manner of noticed personalisation is a your name b your shiptype c your relative veolicty d your loot and fittingsim not going to be impressed with how youre going to express your sexual orientation with how pink your ship isso once more nayedit furthermore endorsing your own proposal  fail it doesnt speak well for your confidence in what you proposed
i heartily endorse this product andor servicei would like to see this optin only that would reduce the strain quite a bit under high loads the server and client should neglect the extra information prioritizing the normal informationregardless this addition would take a substantial amount of effort to implement and i would sooner like to see ambulation take off
as i see this the main problem will be loading the textures and the man hours put into accually finding them places for the logos dont discurage i think this idea is totaly awesome someone mentioned that throwing the logos into the client this is a rather smart idea as it would also let ccp control when the logos is realeasedapproving them ccp does regular patches they could be realeased with these patches however i think there should be some costs added since this will take manhours away from ccpanother issue is the logo it self most gallente ships are graysome greenish colour and the minmatarian are redrust to blakish should a logo accually be glued onto the ship with epoxy point is that a logo sitting on gallente ship xy just may not accually fit on minmatar xy id like to see this idUFFFDa introduced damn i can almost sign my self up to work the graphics to make this work
since you get uncloaked as soon as you come within 2000 meters of another object it would be a good thing if we could see cloaked ships that are in our corp or fleet as if they were not cloaked or with a limited transparency and that they show on the overview as wellthis would make stealth bomber operations a little easierjust try to coordinate a wing of stealth bomber to get in position in order to alphastrike the same target without risking coming too close from your own wingmates it can be a little tricky if you cant even see themwe should at least be able to see their bracket in space and in the overview
what he said
i concur having never flown a cloaked ship i didnt realize this was a problem but it seems like a huge liability to me if you need an rp backstory call it computer overlay based on fleet transponder positioning or something
this would be a great addition and really help coordinate sbs and recon shipseven if just the bracket appeared and the ship remained cloaked it would be usable
no thank you i can just see the mittinanni whispering into his mic go left brosef no harder left idjut you went past him
im a fan of cloaking i think cloaking is already nicely balanced no change needed no support
why do you have friendlies on your pvp overview
im fine with a redesignrebuff of info war in general as a stealth eos bonus but something needs to changeprobe strength bonus drone speedtrackingrange improve the  increase for the sensor strength link or broaden it to include targeting rangespeed and tracking speedrang etc etc theres a lot of ways to go about it
fully support giving this ship a bump increase the drone bandwidth for a full compliment of heavies balance by not giving drone bonuses give it a self bonus to sensor strength and the game finally has a counter to the ecm recons people might actually fly this ship again right now the only sub capital ships i see flown by gallente are vex domi mega myrm and ishtar we need more than five ships gallente command and recon ships are total fail everything else is merely toyed with while training to get into one of the five
i am not flying the eos until it has been fixed 1
either the eos or information warfare or possibly both need some adjustments
its be nice

1 for this
i support this credit to the pilots who were good enough to fill the logistic role
agreed
what about giving these to motherships to give them a better defined role curious as to how others feel about this before i cast my voteedit seems the poster above me had the same idea
hi id like to propose that a neutral logistics ship be flagged with the same combat agression mechanics that prevent docking when remote repping targets involved in a war factional empire whatevercheers
i think this was proposed recently it received a lot of support not sure where the topic went
supported changing to a hybrid bonus rather than a medium hybrid bonus it wouldnt affect existing medium users and allow a slight boost to small hybrids very minimal i dont think you can fit a large hybrid so no issue there
op how about proposing that it be changed to something rather than just leaving it open ended i see a disturbing trend happening in this section where someone will point out a problem but not pose a real solution to it and people will blindly support itfor this forum to work there has to be proposed fixes as well as pointing out problemsso change the bonus to what exactlyits not like either of the ships are exactly in need of a buff both perform quite well when compared to their peersnot supportededit  also changing the bonuses to all hybrid turrets would mean that the vexor hull was the only hull in the gallente lineup to receive a bonus to all hybrid turret damages instead of being size specific like every other gallente ship i think that any ship that isnt limited to its size of turretbay should possibly be looked at
you dont need to forward a solution to believe theres a problemsince the job of the csm is to put issues before ccp often having no solution may be better as people might agree that there is a problem but not agree on the solution and so not support the issuetheres nothing wrong with either approach in my view nor with an op with multiple possible solutions or an op that calls on the community to suggest solutions we dont all feel we have all the answers
no support there are enough foolproof forgiving childrens game let us have one for ourselves 
i like to see prepay new clone body make clone is for 100k or so just add column for buying bigger version there when you buying new clone you can buy bigger one at once
no eve has risk real risk associated with some of it welcome to it embrace it its not like its a difficult task to update your clone every third month or sono count me as one who does not wish to partake in your autocloneupdateything
all i had to read was the topic i agree d
inspired a bit by this threaddrone hijacking a ship or module specifically used for hacking into an enemys drone signal the success rate would have to be very low like 25 tops i dunno i pulled that number out of my ass long cycle time limited by ship bandwidth  concord off and fighters should be immunelets say i fly into a fight against a domi that has some hateful ogre iis tearing into a corpy of mine i start up my little drone pilfering module up on my drone pilfering ship and get to work trying to take over the domis drones first cycle fails second cycle fails  dammit third cycle nabs one of the bastards sweet now i set this drone against the owner being a domi of course he just launches another and blows his former drone to piecesin my little drone pilfering ship i can hijack drones that are outside of my skillset honestly the skillset for this should be very high so theoretically i should be able to fly all drones anyway but i cant launch them if they arent in my skillset in otherwords i would only be able to use the drones i steal in the one fight if i warp off i lose control of the drone if i collect the drone i cant launch it because i dont have the skillsmaybe have the counter be some kind of drone link encryption module that works like eccm except the part where eccm doesnt work this should not be a wtfpwn against drone boats and as such it should be a total pain in the ass to pull off but i think it would add another interesting layer to small gang fights this is just a rough idea if there is interest ill flesh it out this is also in the new feature category therefor is not as high a priority as the fixin  category
supporting my awesometacular idea
this is useless because it is uselessif you can fly a special ship with any decency that is able to snatch a few drones every once in a while you would do much more good if youd be flying even the crappiest destroyer in the region and simply shot at those drones directly
why would anyone bother with this
i have a cool idea too how about a module that lets you disable a pilots guns with a low chance of success only 99 and a long cycle time 2 seconds this would clearly be balanced because i say so
well i am not real sure why i should give you sensitive business information as to how i and my corpm8s pay for our nice shiny toys or rather those interesting arrangements of 0s and 1s that look really cool on my monitor either way im just curious as to wether any of you have managed to locate any noob corps that we have griefed i rather doubt it as all those who have recieved a successful visitation from us are probably not going to talk about it i also know that i really dont want any competitors in our business figure out your own way of making isk please
well is that supposed to say dossier with news that will oh man was i tempted to stick a z in there
i have a navy exequror because i collect ships it would be nice if i could actually fly it without looking making an idiot of myselfhowever i still think that fixing these things is more complex than slot layout the ship bonuses and stats also need to be reviewed
unless i am mistaken the reasons ccp gave some time ago for not reviewing and adding faction ships was only a few people use them so we are dedicating our work to more important mattersnaturally as long as the faction ship are mostly overpriced and inefficient showpieces the will not be used and so they will not be changedand not usedand so on i am for a generalized reexamination of all the faction ships so that they become really a useful intermediate step between t1 and t2
the fact that all pirate ships are incredibly shi tty is a clear sign that everything is fu cked make them better than tier 1 ships please fix minmater
im no longer making this all about slot layout because thats sparking too much debate heres what im looking for balance all i want is faction cruisers to be reviewed and balanced i personally think that changing the slots as ive laid out above will go a long way toward doing that does that mean ship bonuses shouldnt be reviewed too not at all
or maybe a penalty is added whereby the cost is 2 to 1 ie you lose 50 of the sp you want to redistributeeither way dont believe i could support this
this way it can be supported and tbh had the same idea not too long ago with really useless skills that 50 loss is not that much while the boost of it is still nice but that will gonna stop people just switching their complete skill tables every day 30 is enough imo but 50 sounds just as goodso conditional support from me sp loss
also no
i want to be able to unlearn mining lvl1 trade 3 etc i dont even care about the sp i just dont want an ugly skillsheet have a 2 day waiting period like the 1 day for character deletion to protect hacked accounts etcthis ability would be quite similar to real life i often get incredibly drunk and forget how to do things
yes because you consciously devoted real time to train skills to 5 id love getting hit by that maxed dps people who didnt train those skills shouldnt be just as goodrealtime training is the only measure of dedication in eve thank god its not grinding or playtime per week lets not take that away its happening in so many different mmos just look at world of warcraft and the required specialization drama when respecialization resetting the talent build was available freely people were forced to play a specific role or not be allowed into guilds at all not all guilds did that but the majority of the best ones yup and it worked on so many unhappy people blizzard did their best to remove that problem but wow has different ways of player progression which eve lacksplayers being ed is the reason behind sp remaps worst case you put all the attribute points into charisma and want to train gunnery you always have the option of implants and learnings to boost your other attributes and you can work to train your dream ships anyway attributes were never choosing one thing over the other they were a matter of preference and the world of new eden makes it plain that attributes can be manipulated by ingame incharacter meansskill training on the other hand is a final choice you can never ever train two skills in the same amount of real time its exclusive and retains story and unique traits of a character completely reassigning skills would make us play faceless irrelevant chars like in a typical fps where each character can use any gun
seems i might have posted this in the wrong channel this one looks better d something i would really like to see in an upcoming patch would be the ability to manually move your ship doubleclicking in space is getting annoying considering its a bit glitchy and slow to respond perhaps a game mechanic that would allow you to hold the right mouse button or hold a certain key down and point your cursor in any direction and your ship will go that way this would be extremely useful for speed tanked ships most of minmitar much luv d as it would allow them more maneuverability around the grid this would allow speed tanked ships more ease of use considering their only option is to orbit in a battle which can be easily countered
this has been proposed several times and it always comes down to the same thing it would create too much network traffic and most probably severely contribute to lagi would love this as well though but i think its wishful thinkingmaybe a csm can still bring it up and get an official response from ccp but i think theres higher priorities than this maybe they would however have a way of implementing this so it doesnt cause problems you never know
no i mean it would be nice for maneuvering in asteroid belts as aligning can be a pain when theres an asteroid in your way but i dont think its really needed
youre comparing a single modules effect 90 web to 2 modules effects scram  60 web if you want to compare apples to apples then you should have 2 x 90 webs in your first example
i completely endorse this new feature of warp scramblers i dont think it undermines gallente blaster boats at all this is a whole new way to deal with nano f4gs and the arazulachesis now make an excellent tackler in this sensei also agree that the person who stated the difference from before and after with websscrams was comparing 2 mods against 1 you do in fact need to consider that youve got 2 propulsion jamming mods there
heres a more detailed comparison regarding the scramweb changes mind you a battleship is the worst example to use a because theyre not fast enough to worry about decreasing their speed that much using multiple propulsion reduction modules is usually used vs smaller ships which are fast enough to either run away or evade damage otherwise battleships arent going anywhere and b because the impact of the changes primarily impact engagements between ships of different size classes ie it allows smaller ships to fight inside 10km of larger ships without exploding the moment they are webbed and to check that the next step up from a battleship is a dreadnought alasdual 1600 plated triple trimarked megathron ehp total also includes dc ii 2xeanm iistechnically max mwd speed was higher prepatch but i dont feel like looking it up besides its not relevant when measuring the impact of the scramweb changesmax mwd speed 822ms sig radius 2400m2 prepatch2x 90 webbed speed 18ms sig radius 2400m2impact on mobility 2 of max mwd speedimpact on tracking ion siege blaster cannons from a sieged moros  75km range from the megathron each have an 845 chance to hit 3xions deal 365k raw damage per volley every 65 seconds before hit quality is factored in actual damage increases 35 when chance to hit is around 85 factoring in hit chance and hit quality the 125k ehp vs dmg profile of faction am xl megathron explodes in 13 seconds on the 3rd turret volley the mwd cycle itself lasts for 10 seconds so depending on when during the mwd cycle the megathron was webbed unless he was able to deactivate the mwd in time its possible the megathron explodes before he can do anything about it engagements where your ship explodes within moments of being webbed to a couple of turret volleys is better known as what happens when you fly a frigate within 10km of anything preqr and the mega is just as helpless vs the sieged dread as a rifter would of been had it been dual webbed within 10km of the mega this is simply from turrets btw it does not include the 1k drone dps from the morospostpatchscrambled  60 webbed speed 46ms sig radius 400m2impact on mobility 55 of max mwd speedimpact on tracking ion siege blaster cannons from a sieged moros  75km range from the megathron each have a 66x1018 basicallly 0 chance to hit vs the same moros out of siege ion siege blasters have an 80 chance to hit dealing 750 dps after factoring in hit chance and hit quality which is less turret dps than the megathron the megathron explodes after 2 minutes  41 seconds again ignoring drone dps allowing plenty of time for the mega to fly out of scramweb range of the moros if he so choosesnote this ignores the massive impact that webs have on a ships inertia and ability to turn change directions etc
in short not only did ships move slower while dualwebbed prepatch they also did it with a signature the size of a whole planetwebs scrams mwds and afterburners became a lot more interesting postpatch
the issue is really that warp scrambler is overpowered in the way that it immediatly shuts down the mwd a more balanced effect would be for it to disable reactivation of the mwd instead giving the pilot at least minor chance to get out depending on how long he is into his activation
agreed
this sounds like an interesting idea
this shouldnt be a skillthis should be automatic when you disconnect you should be able to reconnect to your drones on reentry during the time youre disconnected they should be susceptible to the usual pilfering and getting shot at while this issue needs looking at creating a new skill for it is the wrong way to go about it not supported
you shouldnt need to train a skill or use a module to compensate for an out of game issue disconenctingwhat next training isk laundering to level 5 and gms wont ban you for selling it on ebayit should be an existing game mechanic if you dc youre drones warp back to the dronebay or at least go inert and drop agro so that the pveers can catch a break
fully supported why cant we reconnect like the probers can to their probes within a set time i can launch a bunch of probes leave the system return and connectcollect my probes why not give drones the same functionality one would think that drones are nothing more than larger attack versions of probes

i want to say this has been raised before but i cant find it offhand yes this one is desperately needed
it was raised as part of the industry ui overhaul
i support this idea but what about having just another align button that sets the speed of your ship to a very minimum something like slow align and it sets your speed at 1 ms
this too

wait what if people are buying isk and then buying gtcs with that isk then ccp is not losing money at all because they had to buy the gtcplex from somebody who spent cash getting ityoure not making a whole lot of sense here
supported
thumb up
keep it up  its very important topic i doubt however that ccp cares
i think it would be cool to walk in a station as long as they dont screw it up like this could easily make the game or break itps wouldnt it be cool if your guy could have armor or a wepon idk something to think about
something i would really like to see in an upcoming patch would be the ability to manually move your ship doubleclicking in space is getting annoying considering its a bit glitchy and slow to respond perhaps a game mechanic that would allow you to hold the right mouse button or hold a certain key down and point your cursor in any direction and your ship will go that way this would be extremely useful for speed tanked ships most of minmitar much luv d as it would allow them more maneuverability around the grid this would allow speed tanked ships more ease of use considering their only option is to orbit in a battle which can be easily countered
no one got an opinion on this  
wonderful idea start a fight and you have to actually finish itperhaps modify the time to redock by standings better standings  faster while negative standings would be longer more immersive that way
docking games really need to be fixed especially where capitols are concerned a set three minute timer is a bad idea because it would have negative effect on pvp in general as you cannot have a fight and leave a system or kill a gangs light tackle on a gate and warp to the next gate not being able to dock without leaving the grid first or waiting out a longer time that resets once you leave the grid sounds good but there is a slight potential problem as grids can be manipulated and there could be some funky situations involving 800km grids or mini grids within gridsmaybe a hard fixed limit of 2050km outside the docking radius would be less exploitable using grid manipulation so once a ship aggresses it either has to fight it out or try to escape by leaving the area or evade its attacker until it can leave the area and reapproach

supported but only in the general sense that destroyers need some serious attention they were fine when the only t2 ship was the intercepter these days they are coffins unless flown extremely carefully ie warping out after shooting once or twicemajor issues include1 sig to ehp ratio is waaay off when compared to frigates and cruisers let alone bc 2 dps is too low to kill a t2 frigate quickly even if you spend as much on your destroyer as that frigate costs yet speed and slots do not permit tackling your target alpha is only acceptable on the thrasher due to arties with damage bonus and this is the reason that ship is popular 3 you cannot afford to use a mwd to counteract point 2 and tackledps at close range because it blows your sig up to bs size and you are quickly instapopped once you realize youre locked by an enemy hacbs and about to be vaporized your agility is too low to abort your run and escapeyou just die4 your range even with double smallgun range is insufficient to play escort to larger ships it takes enormous work to make any destroyer other than the cormorant shoot out to 30km the rails which are used with longerrange ammo for the cormorant to accomplish this can be tanked by an interceptor at that range 30km is the magic number because thats the normal unoverheated point range for the tackling interceptor line 5 the 25 rof penalty is supposed to make the ships into alpha creatures but that doesnt work anymore unless youre using small artillery which do alpha rather well against frigatesized targets with a damage bonus the penalty accomplishes this by trading cost more guns for that alpha but since most ships have more hp now than when the destroyers were first introduced and the proliferation of t2 ships and equipment render the destroyer so fragile it just doesnt work and needs to be rethought6 following some deep thinking about how to accomplish the purpose of the destroyer class there needs to be another hull model or at least another ship introduced for each race destroyer is the only t1 class that has one 1 ship in its category even haulers have 2 or more t1 ships using different models though the differences are often too small to matter to pilotscomments on specific destroyersa coercer  i love this ship its sexylooking uses lasers and you can actually sqeeze some dps but not alpha out of it if you make it a complete glasscannon you used to be able to get 30km range from it if you rigged it into a 40mil ship which i did and really surprise arrogant inti pilots but the locus nerf killed that coercer does not need another midslot it needs a 60m sig radius removal of the rof penalty reduction of turrets to 6 and movement of one high slot to lows could also use about 30 more cpu but dropping the number of guns would help with thisb cormorant  good in its role which is very light sniper it cannot do anything else however and rail alpha at range is a joke if you attempt to tank it you sacrifice range and damage and become completely irrelevent except as 20 seconds of distraction for one 1 enemy cruiser cormorant also needs 60m sig radius removal of the rof penalty 6 turrets and movement of one high slot to low fitting should be reviewed c catalyst  you can actually get a small amount of damage out of this ship as well if you go with the glass cannon approach its actually almost as wellregarded in some circles for this as the thrasher because you can mwd point and pray that can get you a kill on a t2 frigate before someone notices and vaporizes you this ship needs again 60m sig radius removal of the rof penalty 6 guns movement of 1 high slot to low and switching of the falloff bonus for a rof or damage bonus really falloff for hybrids wtfcontinued
continuedd thrasher  universally regarded as the best destroyer out there because of the damage bonus slot layout artillery alpha and speed  smaller sig radius in other words almost everything this ship needs little help what should be done is to harmonize with the other changes without nerfing it or namely decrease sig radius to 55m drop the rof penalty reduce turrets to 6 and move one high slot to low review the fitting stats accordingly the thrasher alpha would actually decrease unfortunately even with adding another gyrostabilizer but it would more than benefit from increased dpsin other points the destroyer class as a whole needs a dedicated t2 antilight support ship capable of keeping af and interceptors off larger bc and bs it needs to be gunbased not missile unlike the interdictorsexcepting the minmatar one again and it needs to be a new classnot an interdictor interdictors die instantly because of their superdangerous role bubbling to an enemy fleet an actual antisupport ship does not need to be saddled with that burdenkrum
destroyers need love indeed a lotit says enough that 99 of the new players are advised to skip the destroyers and to skill towards cruisers insteadedit to check the supportbox
they need either there dps increased so in the short amount of time they do survive they actually do some damage or effective hp increase since the ships are cheap i think making them highdps boats with paper armour would be interesting therefore i support the idea of getting rid of rof penalty catalysts and comorant do need more powergreed all other ships can fit all highcaliber guns includiong coercer and thrasher another destroyers so why are catalysts and comorant so handicapped there fore support here as wellextra slot would make them more effectivetherefore full support thats my question as well i also dont get thatyon krum most of your ideas correspond with that of the topicks author except for the author whants to make all destroyers glass canons with highdps and you try to adjust there slot layout so that they actually survive for a while but reduce there dps by reducing guns those are 2 different directions but whichever is chosen would solve the current situation
not quite correct actually the coercer needs substantial fitting mods in order to fit either medium pulse lasers or medium beam lasers the highcaliber small guns not the cruisersized ones mostly it lacks cpu to fit them though if you use a mwd you run out of grid as well but if youre fitting a mwd you last a maximum of 30 seconds so why do it the thrasher otoh can fit a set of 6x 280mm artillery cannons and still have enough cpugrid for decent sniping mods and two salvagers its damage when you do this is slightly superior to the smallercaliber cannonsi love for the destroyers to be able to make use of the more powerful tier of small gunswould make sense after all since theyre supposedly so much larger than frigates that tier of guns by the way is generally only usable by cruisers downgunning looking at you thorax or t2 ships destroyers really need both they should be terrifying ship to frigates and last long enough to cruisers to be able to warp out unless tackled as it is they dontmy suggestions are a bit more subtle dropping the sig radius to an average of 60 would reduce damage from larger guns by 25 dispensing with the rof penalty is a 25 dps bonus which only offsets the lost damage of reducing guns to 6 but moving a high slot to a low on each ship enables them to either devote that to a damage mod or a tanking mod cormorant could go with a dcu its more flexibility franklyi dont honestly think the game needs more glass cannons at the small scale destroyers however are so underused and useless that they make the old stealth bombers looks like flavorofthemonth ships so if a change did make them decent cannons id not refuse itbecause i love them so but id hope a t2 spacesuperiority version would add more survivability along with that firepowerkrum
fully endorsedi love destroyers of all races except the lackluster catalyst lol falloff bonus unfortunately theyre easily outclassed by a t1 frigate i get kills regularly against thrashers using a plated riftersignature far too largehitpoints far too lowrof nerf reduces dps to frig levelsfor the coercer need 1 more mid at the very least theyre the highest raw dps destroyer going but cant pin anything in place with only 1 mid thus get almost no kills without being in a blob
supportedi think its more important that the slots be fixed to be honest especially the coercer and cormorants mid and low slots respectively the only ships in the game to be restricted to a single slot in any category are a handful of the really light t1 frigates so its frankly ridiculous that ships a whole class heavier than frigates have such strict limits the coercer especially cant even fit an ab and a warp disruptor at the same time while at the moment the cormorant has to use its sole low slot for a micro auxiliary power core if you want to fit any decent weapons on it
destroyers are awesome alreadynonminmatar interdictors however
destroyer costs 4 times the price of a rifterin many intances it can loose to a rifterit gets instapoped by anything bigger then a frigate sure they are fine
good ideas
yah i got that on my mind too if thirdforces were to have a big enough impact then of course the fw enemy would be wanting to utilise their allies and should be able toaside from that looks great edit forgot the thumbbutton
fail
what you dont get is that ccp has continuously enhanced the problem of blobbing now for most ship classes this is bad but not impossible to work against for motherships especially it isinside of a cyno jammed system motherships do fine in their intended use outside of that they cannot hold up well at all unlike titans moms dont have a dd saving grace they are an on field tool if you want their full effect the problem with that is 10 dreads focused fire can pop a mom quite fast 20 dreads can break it fast even if its receiving significant remote reps 30 or more dreads and youre talking 30 second deathyes its a problem with blobingbut more to the point for a mom its also a show of its flaws titans to a lesser extent unless they forgo the proposed changes in which case theyll be just as suceptable moms cannot hold up at all on the front lines outside of very isolated situations they are far from useful in any capital engagements and theyre just a joke when used outside of a jammed systemnow i differ from most i hate remote repair especially on carriers with their huge range boost i think spider tanking is a shameful cry for why people choose to blob in cap warfare i would rather moms get a significant bonus to personal tanking to make up for their lacking atm
yes guys battle bestowers to the front lines moms to the backi always spend 1540 bil on a ship so that it can pos park get a fricking clue dude all ships have a huge issue with hp and blobbing moms just get the ass end of it so you can either petition here for ccp to revamp their entire failure of a combat and 00 system immediately or you can ask for a momtitan revamp i think the latter is more reasonable baby step
proposal increase npc belt bounties 00
agreedid like to have audit log giant secures as wellalso the ability to repackage station hangars without that stupid 3 week old log crap getting in the way after ive emptied them just give me a warning repackaging the station whatever will displace all items into the corporate hangar with the least access rights or your personal hangaralso this container contains items that have been locked down please unlock these items to repackage the station whatever if a person can unlock the items they can steal them anyway once they access the container
yes yes a million times yes
u didnt know how it work right in reality
since no capital can use a covert cyno i dont see why this could not be possible
it is possible to make more isk in the safety of empire by grinding l4s than ratting and helping concord in 00 i always tought eve was a game of risk and reward the more risk u take the more u get out of it why isnt this applied on the npcs in 00 it is time to increase the bounties in certain areas
yes
yes
noempire rats in missions already have their bounties nerfed considerably by upwards of 50 on the up side you can in relative safety loot and salvage all of your wrecks while that is not always possible or feasible in nullsec so if you loot  salvage your nullsec wrecks you still make more on ratting alone than an empire carebearand no i dont rely on missions for income i might run 1 or 2 a month for some faction ammo
10 true sec space is fine 001 not in general ccp should make all high true sec 00 better
some regions have entire consellations that are between 001 and 015 sec belt ratting makes about 12 mil per hour of bounties some would say well go mining then but thats also impossible the other solution is plexing there aint enough around since wormholes were invented so basicly its wasted space that nobody can use or its used out of boredom and a waste of time from a economic point of view
00 ratting need improvement less stupid grinding more fun also too many wrecks to salvageloot for solo npcs should be more intelligent these days too were living 2009 furthermore chaining is stupid profit should stay same but rats should spawn more intelligently and yeah also make ratting in low 00 more profitablei support general idea of making ratting more interesting
right problem wrong solutionisk inflation in the game is already a huge problem  while i agree that l4 highsec missions paying more than 00 ratting doesnt make sense on the riskreward scale this is not the answernerf missions  dont boost ratting
well since there are bs rats in low sec i see no other option than boosting ratting im not sure but i think the lower 00 sec sytems 001015 are as good as the good low sec 01 sec  systems maybe both options will be a good idea boosting 00 bounties and nerfing l4s bounties lets get the risk vs reward more inline with each other
who sayd inflation is a problem i have never seen ccp saying that we suggest features and point out imbalance ccp makes them real and solves problems where it can and deems nessesary i stopped ratting in nullsec because i make more money on lvl 4 missions dont have to do 20 jumps to get to the place and back at the end of the day and it absolutely safe in addition i get standing and loyality points that i can spend on alot of interesting stuffratting needs a bootswhen you kill pirats you recieve loyality points towards concord give them something interesting in lp stores something exclusive look at concord bs for example make pirats drop more loot like guns that will be supply of meta lvl items for nullsecincrease bountiesi always salvage them i use murm with mwd 4 closerange guns dual repp tankmy drones do more then half of dpsi have a tractor beam and a salvageri salvage bs and bc wrecks i still make less then in missions not even taking lp into account so yes in needs a boost on the other hand you need a wellfitted bs to do lvl 4s wellyou can do ratting in a speed tanked crouser bc is perfect so i suggest making the rats in nullsec tougher increasing amount of highbounty balleships make them smarter not sure if we whant them to be as smart as sleepers but they should be smarter for sure my personal opinion is that every ai should be as smart as sleepers they just should shoot drones less with t2 drones its expencive
i would welcome this some ships could use a lil flare as for the logos i do not think they are needed many ships already have their faction logo on them if you look hard enough i know my hyper and legion do the idea to give a choice of color schemes whould be nice though
suported anyone who dosint support is to poor to afford a comp with good specs
i wanted to reply and to support but i made a new topic danyway this idea got my support just like last time
i agree with this the idea is super old and the additional server load would indeed be tragic i also think that the need to personalise your ship is not really in keeping with eves military themes
full supportwe should be able to choose our hips colour cheme from few predefined layouts many games have that option would barely add serverload if they whant to decrease serverload they should crash mothership into jita station
spies anyonecloaked ships are cloaked
supported for this very reason
how about a tickbox option to show yourself or not to show yourself to fleet only instead itd be like broadcast signal to fleet or something so youd show up as an empty purple bracket
thatd be great but thats only one way to do it seriously people i really dont see how this would break balanceit just makes no sense to me that you cant even see not visually not on scanner not in the overview cloaked ships that are on your own side in your corp or in your fleet theres just no way to maneuver a gang of cloaked ships properly if you cant even see them
quoted for truth
if fleet members can see them they must be broadcasting something if they are broadcasting something it makes sense that ships not in the friendly fleet could also find them cloaking is currently balanced it doesnt need boosted it doesnt need nerfed
its neither a nerf nor a buff its common senseyou could say that cloaking fields all have a coded frequency and that your fleet has the key to see through it you dont have to broadcast anything
how is adding an ability that isnt currently available not a buffperhaps were working with different definitions of the word buff
so improving visual appearence of lasers would be a buff to energy weapon how is making it comfortable a buff its like saying that if they make it so refining window does not lagg its a buff to refining
its not a buff because it doesnt add any advantage its only practical and logical to do itstealth bombers wouldnt be able to deal more damage or cloak longer that way it doesnt change any of their attributes either so this is not a buffits like calling an option to hide all cans in space a container nerf come on think about it for more than one second
ive never had an issue with this and would rather my fleet mates didnt see where i was ive been able to effectively coordinate stealth ops with good communication
why wouldnt you want your fleet to see where you are anyway how would this change your gameplayits one thing to vote a suggestion down because it would break your own gameplay somehow but its another to vote it down just because you personally wouldnt benefit from it or wouldnt use it
if cloaked fleet members not seeing each others location is a disadvantage the removal of that disadvantage is adding an advantage not all buffs are pure numbers the ability to know where cloaked fleet members are could be a significant tactical advantage for a recon blackops stealth bomber group its a buff and its not needed
if you want to do something in this vein say that the reason for the decloak is sensor emissions from the object youre near being too strong to evade and since cloaked ships dont do the sensor emissions thing cloaked ships dont detarget each other itd also mean you could finally remove the asinine gascloud decloaks seeing each other on overview though seems kind of silly
i guess you do not get the idea of spies in your fleet compromising your positionyou want to have the ability to see your cloaked mate for your fleet ops so you can coordinate a sb strike ok stop step back and think about it you have spies in fleet most of the time anyway ok always now what stops the spies from outing the cloakers answer me that what prevents the cloaker to be compromisedno absolutely not
if you always have spies in your fleet then your corporation really has a problem spying is part of the game and having this feature or not wouldnt change it in any way theres a ton of ways to counter spying for example force every member in your corp to give their api key so you can list any alt not in your corp i dont think this is a valid argument sorrybesides if you would only see cloaked ships in your own fleet then all youd have to do if you want to move without being stooled by a spy is to not be in a fleet get in range of your target and fleet in the last second if you fleet needs to warp on you or something
this is hilarious too ing many people complain about the idea is great and make coordination easier either have a broadcast location or show bracket for fleet members in gang menu

duhits just common sense
theyve got a tough balance they have to hitwhile i definitely agree that they need to worry about bug fixes first if they dont continually introduce new mechanicsfeatures they start to see subscription numbers fall off people especially on eveo are gonna pitch fits about how things arent working the right way no matter what so if you give them shiney things to distract them theyre easier to deal with thats my speculation anyhow
though maybe not entirely fit for this thread some serious reworking of missioning might not be a bad idea seen as the mission system in eve is the most boring ive ever encountered in any game ever
fix before feature
ccp tried this once they released a patch dedicated to fixing 100 of the most common bugs in the game want to know how much positive feedback they got for itzeropeople dont tend to notice or enjoy minor bug fixes right now ccp seems to be splitting their focus on each expansion one part introducing new content the other fixing a major gameplay mechanic that was broken they just fixed scanning and a sovereignty fix is due out soontm as welli like how ccp is working on things as it is sorry but no support here
bunyip sums it up pretty well not supported

true perhaps maybe there could be a certain amount of time before drones are free game say 5 minutes
lol i would love to see that people undocking in dominixes droping anourmous amount of cheap t1 drones in jita and abanoding them and dromes killing all the haulers and miners and concord chasing every drone lolor hundreds of drones being abandonds at gates so that first person who jumps in gets slaughters before he knows what happened
supported on both counts
supported but i also rather like treeloxs idea
agree on the reconnect to dronesabsolutely disagree on the drone stealing part there needs to be some repurcussions for leaving in the middle of a mission andor fight it also provides a level of opportunism for other players and drones are not that expensive what it seems like you wanna do is afk mission without consequence and thats not acceptableslightly disagree with damage reporting for drones i dont believe drones were ever intended to be a primary damage source but more of a supplementary damage source i have nothing to back that up and am pretty sure its something i heard somewhere at some time that i cant remember so dont take that as fact the more legitimate reason is that drones fire every 2 seconds  the notices that 5 drones would flash across the screen even grouped as salvos would be quite a bit to process and make it difficult to read the alreadytoofast turret notices while it would be nice to see how much damage theyre doing you can test that with a corpie  annoying but not that hard to do if there was a way to do this more passively ie just show in logs with no notice id be a bit more inclined to agreenot supported trying to do too much in one ticket
reconnect to drones is exelent feature
seeing that the bug where the drones sometime arent damaging the structures because they orbit too near and probably inside the structure and we have no way to know if the same is happening when we are fighting other ships knowing what damage the drones are doing is mandatory plus rate of fire has been halved making it 1 attack every 4 seconds several months ago at the same time damage has been doubled sadly drone damage is mostly theorycraft as it can be calculated but not verified in real combat situations seeing how they have a lot of bugs and they are a primary weapon for several ships hoping that they are working right is not the way to go
i like the idea of reporting drone information my argument is that eve tends to be information overload quite a bit and this wouldnt help the problem a configuration option in the journal or something would helpmissed this  thanks for bringing it to my attention
yay
logistics definetly deserve their spot on the killboard as they often turn the tide of battles i am not a logistics pilot but i was saved by them few times 
hai naoko
good idea somehow ccp could modify the current coding to record a logistics repairing a friend in combat and on a kill mail the same as if you assigned your drones to assist a friend in combat and got on the kill mail granted assisting with drones does damage to the enemy applying the same code used on the drones to the repairing module may be the easiest shortcut

my proposal is thisgive the roqual an additional role the ability to fit and use a capital moon harvester module when in industrial moderestrict its use to a region around the warp in point of a moon big enough away that it can be outside of the range of a death star but still be on grid for easy detectionthe roqual would have the ability to do standard moon mining and in the presence of a hostile pos it would cut off all material being gathered by a tower harvester as it will be harvesting that material for itself the objective of this proposal is as followsallow smaller entities a slice of the moon harvesting pie which has been currently snapped up by larger entities and secured with death star possprovide a more active mechanic for gathering moon material and requiring an alliance to actively patrol the moon pos empire to ensure nobody is stealing from themmake low sec and npc space more difficult for an alliance to guarantee a passive high profit income ie far easier for a smaller group to secure access to a moon for a short period of time multiple times dependant on their time zonesadd a new tool to 00 warfare and bring attrition back into playget more caps out into the field and in harms wayideas to toy withmake the industrial reconfiguration time could increase when the harvester is online ie from 10 mins to 30 mins or more meaning that the roqual reduces the fuel it consumes but more importantly increases its risk substantially give a roqual based harvester a higher efficiency than a pos module meaning that an alliance may choose to deploy a roqual outside their towers to increase yields with the risk that roaming ops may catch a roqual outside shields or better yet multiple roquals on the same moon to increase the yield allow an industrial configured roqual to be spider repped meaning you might have a carrier escort i dear say most roqual only go in to industrial mode inside pos shields currently so i dont know if they can already be remote repped in industrial modewith the requested changes to make moons deplete and generate new veins of ore using a fleet of roquals to force a quicker depletion of a hostiles moon resource will make an interesting situation

the problem i see here is the poor bastard who sits in the rorqual the whole time its a good idea in theory but talk about suck factor for the rorqual pilot this is a game for fun not more boring time sinksisaac

mining revampthe overall concept here is to remove the very passive game play nature of mining for a more hands on approach i realize this will ruffle more than a few feathers the general approach here is to reduce the quantity of rocks and belts in a star system for a more realistic and more thoughtful approach to mining and resource farming rather than have 500 rocks in a system of various types instead you might have 1020 asteriods or comets in a close proximity to mine each containing various levels of all resourceshow do we do this ive never understood the need to have 50 veldspar roids in a belt and 10 belts in a system not only do asteroid belts not fit in realistically with how a solar system works functionally they are terrible and boring and overly passive approach to gaming especially when we look at high sec we see that mining is very much a set it and forget it part of this game most of the work in mining comes from gamers hauling ores rather than actually mining them and lets be honest hauling isnt the epitome of fun in gameso the idea is to condense mining into much larger more complex rocks added to this is a real drilling technique where mining almost becomes a puzzle of maximum utility rocks of different types would have different density and pockets of any or all types of ores your own approach to mining that rock determines the actual value and resources you derive from it 2 different approaches to how to mine the rock can easily result in totally different outcomes whats even more fascinating about this style of mining is that it could be a great reason to create temporary wars of resources much like and unlike moon mining today imagine finding a rock or concentration of rocks of unimaginable wealth hidden away in one small corner of space they wont last forever so the first and fastest to this area will be the largest benefactors in this new format there would be 2 basic kinds of rocks similar to real asteroid belts 1 type of rock would be the standard dense solid rock we see today but its design would be that of quadrants and layers i leave it up to the game designers to form the actual system but essentially you choose to mining a spot of the rock as you deplete that spot you go deeper into the rock uncovering more and varied types of ores obviously with mining theres waste so as you choose the path to mining the rock it affects what is wasted the 2nd type of rock would be a cluster of smaller rocks in this scenario theres less waste and in a lot of ways less skill required to mine through the asteroid as its already broken into small chunks held together by gravity only theres also the higher likelihood of more mixed minerals within the conglomerate of rocks the trick with these rocks is not so much about waste as it is about time how do you remove the junk rocks fast to get to the higher value in either type of rock there has to be waste waste would essentially be junk dirt ice or whatever that cannot be effectively refined or salvaged and would therefore be discarded pockets of waste would play into just how fast areas could be minedthis same idea could be translated into comets andor ice harvesting
miningso we know how the rocks are setup and the basic premise to mining but what does this actually mean for the guy training to be a miner well skills are very important part of mining right now all skills really do is increase quantity mined and reprocessed they really do nothing to enhance your actual talent at mining much like accuracy falloff orbital velocity and ship speeds affect missiles and turrets so the new concept is to have skills help with scanning and breaking down the new rocks astrogeology for instance my help you more accurately scan densities in a rock to get a better determination for what is in it mining might help you break down the rock into smaller portions so as to help you speed up mining and path creation advanced mining skills might help to improve time or gain from x y or z type of ore in the rock t2 miners might help you focus on areas of the rock better so as to not disturb surrounding ore and waste as much strip miners might very high speed but with wrecking consequences to the surrounding ores in a rock etc ultimately what youd see is short and long durations of mining sometimes it might be 10 seconds sometimes it might be 5 minutes it would be up to both the player and the rock to determine the exact nature of the minethis idea would also help transcend this game into system wide asteroid belts and more defined industry talent it would also add to mining a level of experience over skillpoints it wouldnt be about maxing characters skills to net the greatest amount of harvest instead it would be as much about his understanding of his trade very generic simplified rock scanoverall tldrremove the redundancy and repetitive nature of mining no more waiting 1 or 3 minutes til a beam finishes only to repeat no more fields of tons of the same rock but rather fewer rocks and more technique on how to harvest the goodies by the very nature of this rather than have ore types be the determinant between empire and 00 id rather see asteriod size be a more relevant factor smaller size lower quantity due to high mining fatigue in empire more size more complexity more reward in 00
well you were right about one thing this is going to ruffle some feathersi agree that mining needs a change but i am not sure this is that change i am withholding an opinion until i see some more discussion at the momentone point to consider though you cannot make mining too skill intensive or too hard to learn to do effectively or youll lose a lot of new players that want to try it early on as it stands right now if i can fly a frigate and have mining 1 i can mine which means that with most characters i can mine right after the starter tutorials whatever changes happen to mining need to leave that intact so that brand new characters have a chance to make a start for themselves without shooting at things if thats what they want
anyone can mine with lvl 1 skills in this system too the only real difference is how the rock is mined for a new guy he might take a little longer to get through a pocket he might waste more but at the same time he can learn how to increase his load even with lvl 1 skills by planning out how to mine a rock how to map concentrations in the rocki mean whats the real difference bt a thorax mining currently and one mining in this new system when it comes to take ultimately youre going to mine its more about efficiency and competitionimagine 510 guys mining the same rock rather than the same belt it would be more strategy based how to mine said rock bc their actions would ultimately dictate yoursi mean how is that idea not more fun and interesting than sitting in a field and waiting 9 minutes for a hulk to fill up
an interesting proposal but it might be a little bit too much of a minigame remember what the targeting system in eve looks like  its slow clunky generic and has a craptastic ui attached youre trying to turn it into something out of red faction which sounds really cool but im not sure the game can handle it well if the game can do itand do it in such a way that it doesnt freak out the newbies im all for it but i dont think it can

the harbinger has 7 turretsthe brutix has 7 turretsthe drake has 7 launchersgive the hurricane its 7th turret back please
naturally i support my own proposal
whyi mean in all due seriousness you havent actually made an argument
you toook into account the fact that huriicane is the only battlecrouser with 8 weaponsi dont fly hurricane but from what i saw and what i fought hurricane is nowhere near being underpowered i dont see need for a beef
i currently do fly a hurricane for level 3 missions and so far i havent met a mission i cant tank i literally fly into the middle of the mission space and start destroying enemy ships one after another while they try and get close enough to shoot back i get close to 260 dps from it which is probably be a little low but i tend to overtank and i agree its really quite an effective ship the way it is
no hurricanes are pretty badass as is
outdamaged by the brutix and harbingerouttanked by the drakethe small speed increase and versatility from split weapons do not make a good shipadding a 7th turret would bring it in line with the other tier 2 bc and the brutix
it is outdamaged by britux because thats highest dps bc in gamedrake is the tankiest bc in gamehurricane has reasonable tank and reasonable dps drake has good tank but it has  dpsbritux has good dps but  tankhurricane is in the middle and it speedtanks bss better then any other bs
dude if youre looking for damage and have tackling support go for 6 turrets 2 launchers a shield buffer and 3 gyros the hurricane is like the dominix its extremely versatile it can be anything you want just fit it decently
the cane is a great ship and needs no additional love not supported
truetrue on paper yes when fighting in falloff  noonly if youre doing it very wrongagain only if youre doing it wrongyes it is a bit faster  but not that much faster dps wise yes on paper no when you consider how much dps is lost fighting even 50 into falloffsplit weapon systems are an evil that would never have been introduced would people have accepted the drake if it had a launcher removed but had a turret addedi disagree giving it a bit more dps would bring it in line with the other battlecruisers remember how much dps is lost when fighting in falloff
what are your dpsdrake and tankbrutix fits so far as i can tell the drake is a brick that occasionally annoys you with missiles and the brutix is a glass cannon and ive never seen a fit for either that does much to fix their holes without throwing away all the advantages of using that hull in the first place
dps drake does shy 700dps
i know that part of being a good pilot is to be able to recognize the class of a ship just by its type name but practically i dont think anyone here knows every single ship type by heartthere are 30 ship classes in the game if i counted correctly some which are further divided into roles however all we have to differentiate them in the overview is the overview icon and the type column the icon consists of a white bracket of different sizes for player ships and redgray crosses of different sizes for npc ships and only give a hint on the size of the ship not its class or roleyou can also enable the type column but since its showing the whole string it takes more space and most people choose not to show it at all because of that you can also see the type of a ship by hovering your mouse on its target box itself but you have to do it one by one and then remember which one was whichfor new pilots this can be a nightmare this system was fine when the game started in 2003 since there was much less classes of ships frigate cruiser battleship industrial and shuttle that was pretty much itwhat im proposing is a new overview column that would display an abbreviation of the classrole of the ship in uppercasefor exampleic  distance  class  type  name   50 km  bc  hurricane  player 1   51 km  bs  typhoon  player 2   100 km  sb  hound  player 3   121 km  frg  rifter  player 4   134 km  int  claw  player 5 note i added the type column just so you can see which type each class matches with in my examplehovering your mouse on one of the type would show a tooltip with the full class name in addition that same abbreviation could be overlaid on top of the target ico or even completely replace the picture of the targetim sure some of you will argue that this would break game balance in some way but i have yet to see how
i like candy
ahh you already have that with the icon one glance and you know the hull class youre facing frigdessy cruiserbc bscapital industrialgranted they can modify the icons slightly to make destroyers distinct from frigs ect but please not another damnable column the overview already takes up 30 of the screenspace or more
useless
not a bad idea but this that and i cant tell you how long me and the corpies have been going back and forth on the designation for battleships the military folks still call em bbs rather than bss damn blackbirds are messin it up for em
the icons are not different enough and they dont tell you the class of the ship only the hull size and without a base for comparison you cant tell what size it is ie someone mostly playing in high sec will have a hard time differentiating a battleship from a carrier if he never saw one especially for player ships it looks all the same to me and im sure im not the only one knowing the hull size alone is pointless when there are over 40 different player ships in the game a t1 frigate will show the same icon as a t2 frigate but the t2 one might rip you apart in seconds while the t1 one barely scratches youas for the screenspace well every column in the overview is optional so if you dont want it just dont check itwell if ccp makes an official legend for all classes that would settle it wouldnt it there would be only one official naming convention for all classesbut calling battleships bbs is wrong regardless wheres the second b coming from anywaywhat is your comment absolutely
yet another feature that makes me want a moddable ui that said yeah if they can do this without too much difficulty im all for it wouldnt use it myself since ive got pretty much every class memorized but i remember the days when i didnt and would have loved this feature
actually me and many others do know what shiptype all the shipnames are connected with aswell as a general idea of the capabilities and usual fighting style for iti still cant see any reason for this not be there though shouldnt be hard to implement and doesnt hurt anyone so it still gets a thumbs up from me
ishtar as many other gallente ships needs only some more cpubonuses are good
the ishtar should get more damage bonus to the drones instead of turret bonus currenty with good skills u can get 450 dps out your drones that is not high enough for a hac if it would be its role
i like my gun vexor dont touch it
plexes should be nonresellablethey should only be possible to contract to different chars altsonce a plex is sold it should not be possible to place a sellorder on itthis would create a real supplydemand situationcertain entitys buying plexes low for billions and then reselling at a higher price is only manipulationmanipulation is ok with normal ingame items but i doubt ccp had that in mind what is happening now with the plexes
i disagree a plex is an ingame item and even if all i can do is contract it that doesnt stop me from selling it for more than paid for itno support
its fair game i dont see a problem with playing the market
belmarduk your post has a serious problemyou did not explain why what is wrong with the plex market and what is wrong with people making lots of isk in itwhat would be gained from weird market regulations and why would it be beneficial to the game as a whole
you have neglected to elaborate why manipulation is a bad thing for the plex market especially when you think manipulation for normal items is fine system seems fine as it iskeep the free market freeno support here
indeed personally i believe the suggestion stems from nothing more then a frustration that he cannot afford plex

at one time the various pirate factions enjoyed a substantial technological edge over the empire forces which allowed them to maintain their factions in the lawlessness of nullsec with such strength that they could continually send frigate groups deep into empire spaceunfortunately that time has passedthe blood raiders have seen their cutting edge technical advantages supplanted by the introduction of force recons huginnrapier  web range and the curse in capacitor denial rangeit is time for the raiders to rethink their core technologies as the sansha did years ago with considerable success rather than competing with the min  amarr recon ships it is time for them to rethink their entire approachin what ways there could be many options but many are already covered by existing capsuleteer technologiesone idearemove nosneut ammountrange for a cloaked velocity bonus using standard cloaks not covert ops of 30 per base racial ship skill levelremove web range bonus for laser bonuses 75 rof to all lasers per base racial ship skillbase hull bonuses25 laser tracking 50 to laser energy use20 resistance bonus to armor bonus to armor amountexample cruorhigh 5 41mid 2low 4velocity 475sig rad 27this is only an example of the many possible technologies that the blood raiders may approach with the advent of t3 and the awakening of the talocan they might even embrace some of this new  deadly power in their hull linesbut admit it the blood raider faction ships are pretty poor with the advent of recons except maybe for the bhaal with a fully factionofficer fit
i fail to see the reasoning for making a criminal organization that lives on the fringes of society more technologically advanced then the empire governments
or to nerf recons because theyre more powerful than their faction counterparts that doesnt make any sense what would be interesting is if faction boats were a bit more prolific so that prices dropped
i agree that blood shipsand also guristas are in need of some major work but i dont think that this proposal is how to go about it the problem with the blood ships is that the bonuses just dont work together at all and force you to go in three different directions at once it needs a set of bonuses that let you build a single ship while still using all of them and not having a weird frankenstein knockoff come out the other end how about something like thisrole bonus 150 stasis webifier rangeamarr 10 energy vampireneutralizer transfer amount per levelminmatar 10 stasis webifier effect per levelew support with kronos webs upsized neuts and everything hitting a 25km range off t2 gear or if you want to get really crazy you could try thisrole bonus energy vampires ignore targets current capacitor levelamarr 5 size energy turret damage per levelminmatar 5 size energy turret rate of fire per levelits a bit wacky but it gives us a bit of retro coolness on ships expensive enough that people wont exploit it to death like they did before and it manages to justify why anyone would ever put lasers and nosneut on the same ship give each ship 2 utility highsim thinking bhaalgorn gets 6 turrets ashimmu gets 4 and cruor gets 2 and go to town you can also replace the amarr bonus with armor resists just as easily in any case keep it faithful to how the faction normally does thingswhich in the bloods case is defined by energy drains but make it a cohesive whole instead of a grab bag
oh so there is a price level that automatically makes customer service viable dude you may only pay 15 bucks a month but some of us have 3 and 4 accounts and have played since 2003 and 2004 i can tell you this responding to your customers in a reasonable amount of time is not a strategy successful companies ignorethere might be a reason that for a long time there was alway over 40k logged in and now i see less than 25k more often than not

warning lots of words in this post beware of hurflet me preface this by saying ive never lost sp to a nonupgraded clone although ive had some close calls so this should be interpreted as a criticism rather than whiningthe clonesp system is a terrible bad terribad horrible horribad horriterribad violatesthefirstthingtheyteachyouingamedesigncourses mechanic that serves no purpose except to act as a disproportionately punishing gotcha for players that forget to click two buttons on the way out of the stationlets pretend that eve introduced a new feature where you had to go through a startup sequence every time you undocked and if you forgot to activate a module during that sequence its nonfunctional until you redock or activate it inflight one by one due to the capacitor cost sure it might be more atmospheric and add more rp or worldbuilding or whatever but in practice its nothing but frustration with no plausible positive effect on the gameplay experiencebut you say other things in eve cause frustration too like losing your hulk or bpocarrying shuttle to a suicide ganker in empire we dont eliminate those things why eliminate this the answer is that those are actions taken by other players which means that while you might be dissatisfied with the result theres another player somewhere who is proportionately satsified and having fun whereas the clone mechanic benefits no one in any way shape or form the other player doesnt know you forgot to upgrade your clone so they get no satisfaction out of it as opposed to knowing you lost umpty billion isk in mods and cargo from the killmailthe fact that you forgot to upgrade your clone makes your game experience frustrating while providing no tangible or intangible benefit to anyone in addition the penalty for a nonupgraded clone is sometimes weeks of training time thats an entirely disproportionate mechanic for something so easily forgottenin conclusion this is probably one of the least defensible game design decisions up there with pos mechanics and doomsdays and the only muppets who could conceivably support it are those who blindly reject any and every possible change without any critical thought
by this logic any mistake that causes a loss in pve is a terrible mechanic that causes nothing but frustration and it should be removed from the game forgot to activate your tanking mods while those rats attacked you well no other player got the fun or benefit from it so its a pointless loss and a terrible game mechanic rightwrong its also wrong when applied to clone renewals
aargh something went wrong here
please tell me more about these effects you speak of
they have those already theyre called target disruptors cause you cant shoot what you cant lock
as much as i like this idea the amount of server load it would create in even small fleet fights would be overwhelming this works for smaller games like freelancer because fights tend to occur in way smaller numbers whereas in eve numbers are well big
i like this idea i think servers could handle it we are not living in 90there are plenty of mmo who support this and they dont have so much trouble and most of the eve lag issues are bind to completly different things

x the ninja salvager should be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because the mission runner owns the wrecks and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamici may as well join the great debate not that my vote here will change anything ninja salvaging is too much reward for too little risk ninja salvaging is the closest thing eve has to an automatic i win button therefore it sucks the second closest is l4 missions but thats another topic 
while an interesting idea it seems like a lot of development effort for only a visual gain im all for prettier visuals but especially since you dont have as much manual fightingdogfighting in eve as in some of those examples i think the overall effect wont be quite as grandplus i think ccp is already working on upgrading pew pew graphics
i do like the idea of the station docking comptroller having a brown stain in his pants when he sees ships exchanging high energy at the discharge end of his catapult and saying hell no you cant dock hereforcing station huggers who undock to plink at someone and then redock to warp to another station is the ultimate its fixed especially if stargates do the same no more jumping shooting and running back to the gate to jump out after the timer rolls overif you want to chicken out tank and dockjump otherwise shoot and hope you can get off the station before the blob that just jumped in warps to you
