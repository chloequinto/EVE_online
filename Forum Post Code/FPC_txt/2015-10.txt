nopenope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope next someone would ask for a hit f1 option on the fleet menupeople should fly their own ships
firstly you really need better fleet members not a way round their incompetence and secondly what is so cool about being lumbered with doing someone elses flyingnext thing you know youll end up wanting to be able to lock their targets and shoot their guns for themnot supported
next time just leave them repeat until irritation stops
bwarp speedconceptually adding more differentiation to ships via warp speed was a wonderful thing having them be faster or slower relative to each other makes lots of options open up tactically and otherwise 1meta already punished big things this was and is basically sulfur in open wounds yes the warp rig changes were good but there is still the lingering philosophical issue that you should not need to fit a certain way to make the ship viable take fitting mods  you generally use these when you want to use something beyond the normal bounds of the ship sacrificing slots that could be used in one way to open up fitting a bigger tank bigger guns or some sort of fiendish speed getting around at a reasonable pace should not be considered something beyond the normal bounds of what ships were made for yes different speeds for different ships but how slow the baseline is could use some adjustment when travel becomes too much of a chore it inhibits small gangsolo content especially when people want to fly medium to bigger things that are selfsufficient and need every slot to be able to upengage think of the charm of a solo battleship pilot charging into the barleguet of yesteryear neither the pilot nor the response squad would probably have a bad time here this needs to be supported more2modeling a successful new eden  interaction is its lifeblood the more time people spend in systems where nothing is going on the worse experience they will have likewise the more gangs they roam into the more and more complex interactions they can have and this usually results in a more eventful play session play sessions they will remember and tell their friends about you know the sort of stuff that makes eve unique in that the combat does not take place within the bounds a staged arena you definitely want the depth provided by variable warp speed so that gangs can use interesting tactics to catch each other but you dont want the base warp speed or the warp speed of bigger things to be so restrictive that the become impractical take oh black rise or syndicate and assume you have 5 entities on at friday or saturday prime time  if all 5 ship into t3ds or light cruisers their chances of engaging or even finding most of those other gangs is very high if all 5 ship into heavy things these chances are far lower by the time they get a reasonable distance from home its time to head back and fleet is over multiply this by the spread of population all over new eden and its no wonder that players are making choices they are i completely understand wanting to reign in projection but there needs to be a compromise here i think the time in warp should be drastically cut down its a downward spiral of content degeneration when every time you bring out big things nothing happens you know those ships that were expensive isk wise and high sp requirements you get the opposite effect if gangs continually find good fights in comps they enjoy flying 3veteran pilots do not want to be restricted to cruisers and down yeah i havent really experienced the full impact of the bc changes yet they look promising even if they are much better and more relevant on grid you still need to be mobile enough to find other people to play ball with and warp speed sorta plays into that
this wont take long for the dead weight in your fleet to end up back at base via pod express the plus side is they only have themselves to blame and if you keep track of where the fights actually happened you can deny them any srp

kindly explain yourself rather than just trotting out inane oneliners to be honest one would expect more than this from one in an elected position of responsibility
sure i disagree with any method that would hand full control over to one person for an entire fleet active players need to be there inactive need to be left behind the ability to drag folks through a trail of tears is in my opinion bad out of curiousity would you also favour a fleet lock button that allows the fc to force all in fleet to lock a specific targeta fleet fire button would be the logical follow up to that fc pushes the big red button and alpha goes through the roofslipppery slope straw man all of the above but the basic objection is that i fly my ship you fly yours i was and am in favour of even curtailing the fleet warp and even more so the fleet jumpmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
seeing a few people in this thread who i respect which is awesome even though i havent known joffy personally have seen him in space and seems like someone who has no problem diving into pvp also 1 for low sec you shall have one of my votes at the very least sir o7
i really wanted to like erika last year because i think the csm could use a voice representing null sec industrialists unfortunately i think she got into the csm x campaign a little late and really didnt get a chance to create and present a polished message hopefully with her early start for the csm xi election shell be able to have a better showing by the time most players start paying attention to the campaign sometime in january or february
because yes thats exactly where that kind of proposal is headed to the wonderful land of fckn drones everywherein case irony was not subtle enough thats a 1
i think you are forgetting somethingmoon size vs planet sizethe moon around earth is only 16 the total volume of earth also mining moons beyond a certain point would become nonfeasible due to the fact that they would loose coherence because of other gravitational influences orbit issues from the star  other planets and on themselvesas an example lets use our moon as an example 12 iron it would take an extraordinarily long time to mine out all of the iron on the moon but it also would not be possible to mine out the entirety of it the moon is in orbit at the distance it is because of the mass of it it moves earth  earth moves it as we orbit now if we remove part of the mass of the moon leaving it in orbit at the same kinetic energy level it starts to go faster meaning it pulls away more from the earth or puts more force on its own surface because of increased centrifugal forces currently the movement is 3cm per year if i remember my pointless trivia right that would increase or we would see more falling rocks from the moonnow if mass is removed from one but the total energy is not changed the object will speed up e  ke  u think of it like if you are spinning in a chair with your arms out and then you suddenly brought your arms closer to you  you spin faster then if your spinning with a weight and suddenly let the weight go can you keep spinning in the same placebut in reference this would mean an increase in velocity of the moon or that earth could not hold on to it as well it would be a matter of statistical modeling to see if the moon would fly off or break apart first from the potential increase in spin and at what percentage of mass removed it would occur
the day 4 minute pdf closes with this is the end of day twoother than that thanks lots of nda but thanks
this is fixedthere was also an entire session missing which has also been fixedsorry for the confusion ccp falcon  eve universe community manager  ccpfalcon
which section was missing the pdf version has not changededit info about faction warfare and pve was missing in the first version per the new post
still not the new version for me
with regard to the comments on headshotting fcs being an issue has anyone comsidered simply not showing the pilots name on the overview that is a very strong piece of intel which is not necessary ship names could be displayed instead tags and broadcasts used to designate the target i cant think of any military reason a pilot would want to share that intel
still no mention of when t3 cruisers are going too get a nerf bat rebalance its sooooo overdue and neededlinks should be a permanent bubble invisible that buffs anyone inside it from say 50km upto 75km maybe as the different types of links could have different ranges say siege and armour links could be shorter ranged than the info and skirmish links
1056 gmt still showing the old version looks like you might have an issue with the cdn
it seems to me that despite module drop chance being a thing that hi sec crime is still very rewarding with nothing in the way of long term consequence for criminals contrary to real society i understand that since its a game and subscriber numbers etc etc that ccp wouldnt want to impose permanent consequences for crime thats fine what i think would be a wonderful gameplay mechanic and give noncriminals a way to get back at hi sec criminals is to have access to craftable dummy modules that you can transport in your hull to fool with the profitability of hi sec crime for the sake of balance i can see it being reasonable to include a  chance of success at fooling ship scanners
if you hate high sec so much that you want it nerfed yet again why bother living there go live in low sec or something
this is my alt i live in wspace id love hi sec to be more dangerous but there has to be some relatively safe place for newer players to eve and with the current status quo criminals have every advantage in hisec with almost 100 controllable risk vs reward and easily computable profitability
hello csm members and other pilotsas we are looking into forming an alliance with support corporations there does not seem to be an option to do that fully in other words it is not possible to have a faction warfare alliance with eg industry corps that are not part of it many alliances have build a workaround to create this similar thing i simply ask if its possible to create an alliance and let all corps fall under the same banner and choose if they want to take part in faction warfare or not this would be better then creating 2 or more individual groups that are linked by chat channels and what not pilots also have to jump from one corp to the other with all kinds of problems such as waiting time new roles dropping roles etc so please gives us more options when doing faction warfare and more options to try to stay under one bannerelayae vindacar
while i support the idea of separately joining fw instead of a global join we have the same problem as our school corp would appreciate to be a part of the main alliance but cannot because gallente side woudl pretty much break logibros access to jita im pretty sure it wont happen because it would mean reworking the whole wardec system which fw is based upon and i expect it to definitely not be on the soonUFFFD list
ok im primarily a solo guerrillafighter type player myself so i want to like you however you havent actually detailed any kind of platform what are your thoughts on oh lets go with highsec wardecs
dont mind me just popping in to laugh at this thread some more if theres a better example of first world problems i havent found it yet

so the tribute system is daily quests really and indeed its an isk faucet im very disappointed that sugar kyle apparently doesnt know the difference between faction police and faction navy but still thinks they should be buffedno mention of pinning lp payouts at tier 5 for kills whats the holdup on that
im also concerned about this tribute system paying players extra for being where they are and doing what they decided is worth doing doesnt seem necessary if certain content does not seem incentivized enough already maybe increase loot or payoutsi could make this work in a way that doesnt inject new isk to the ecomomy but its convoluted i offer the idea but dont really like it a new tax and refund scheme reduce rewards of loot or isk depending on the dungeon being completed dont advertise that this happened ingame like an encounter surveillance system penalty then pay back what was held back as a lump sum tribute at the end of the day some people irl enjoy and even set themselves up for lump sum payments such as income tax refunds at the end of the year letting their government treasuries hold onto their excess tax money like a bank and lotteries sell more tickets as the payout rises
well we know the pve plans at least namely the tribute systemand i have to say thanks but it wont work because economy 101if you artificially increase the monetary mass prices adjust to the rise and inflation kicks in until purchasing power diminishesif ccp tells the market that pvers are going to get a n flat increase in their income the market will mark up prices to exploit that extra income this will mess with the purchasing power of people who dont do combat pve can a miner buy a replacement exhumer if the price goes up proportionally to how much more are earning the level 4 runners even worst those who will be hit harder are the newer players who dont have savings to afford higher prices and since theyre running level 1s and 2s cant compete with prices marked up to the extra income for level 4si know its everything in the air and very theorical still but whereas the concept is good reward player activity the implementation looks catastrophically wrong since it appears to ignore some essentials of human behavior you shouldnt start with a square wheel and then improve it so it turns betteri am a staunch highsec pver and i dont need more isk what i need are the mechanics to leave a footprint in the universe and generate pve content for me and other players by playing my way
good no more t3d in small plexes somehow good some webbing frigates in fw missions though i would be more hardcore there suspect for neutrals upon entering fw plex finally bad cagali  have you guys considered tackling the problem of afk frigates in plexes and warpcore stabbed ships orbiting beacons etc affinity  the changes with patrols will hopefully help with thisi dont see how this can help unless there is really lot of those patrols but then again active plexers will be probably screwed by that as well there was many sugestions how to fix this afkstabbed problem in plexes but patrols is it seems like lets wait and see ill go cry quietly in the corner in the meantime no mention of broken tier systemlp payouts no mention of ogbs  just wait till your new guys meet some linked fwpirate guys they will enjoy that fight for sure
what about low fw is not all lowsec or maby it will be with the 4 way fw

as far as tributes i have no idea what that is are they just paying out more isk for all pve except mining are they paying more isk if you do more pve in a single day they said it is like dust but i dont play dust so i am not sure what that means is there another post or or session that i should read to understand what this ismake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
it was mentioned in the fwpve sessionshort version first time you trigger dungeon completion finish a mission hack a site clear an anomaly youll get a higher payoutactually theyre rated 1 to 5 if you do a 5 youll get the 5 payout immediately if you do a 1 youll get the 1 payout then do a 5 youll get the 5 payout minus the 1 payout do another 5 and you wont get any other bonus
so we get a splash of isk when we complete the first dungeon of the day and the next ones pay nothing well that certainly would prevent inflation due to inceased revenue for pve as the increase would be neglectable
ok thats not so bad sounds like a carrot to entice players to log in on a day when they wouldnt normally log in i dont think i would care as a long term player but it might be motivational for newer players edit it appears i misunderstood if this is a bonus for every dungeon completion i refer back to my comment in this previous post
dust has rotating dailies one of which is usually win one battle and rewards a key for their ridiculous lockboxes other objectives include killing x amount of people getting x amount of assists that kind of thing sounds like they want to do a similar thing with complexes in eve complete x and get y no idea why they think it will work if content isnt worth undocking for now a handful of isk isnt going to change that fact sounds to me like a bandaid to cover the festering wound that is the rest of eves content while they continue to fix null
pay nothing extra just to make sure its entirely clear
i think that the antifaction missions should be more frequent in highsec i mean how are all of these supposed pirates safely setting up shop maybe shift the kill pirate missions to low sec where there is less concord
1 sure you live in wspace mr carebear those pesky highsec gankers must really bug you there to make you post this thread2 there are already relatively safe places for new players in eve they are the rookie systems and ccp takes a very dim view of people harassing new players in those systems3 true new players will be totally uneffected by your idea therefore your only reason for bringing them up is to attempt to derive an emotional backing by shouting but think of the children4 criminals only have the advantage because carebears would rather whine on forums trying to get the rules changed in their favor than to take the required measures to ensure their own safety5 what the highsec gankers have done is learn what it takes to minimize their risk this is no different than you looking up a mission guide so you know what the triggers are and what resists you need to fit in fact considering most people who get ganked are not actively playing the game i see very little difference between them and the npcs in your missions6 easily computed profitability seriously two words for you mr carebear loot fairy
while i am for more information warfare gameplay this proposal is just a straight nerf to pirates it gives haulers a tool they can use at no real cost to themselves to make life as a pirate more difficult something that has already been nerfed heavily in recent years to make it balanced such a mechanic would have to have a fitting cost so haulers have to choose whether to fit something that messes with cargo scans rather than just always toss a bunch of dummy modules in their hold having that ability needs to come with a trade off against cargo capacity speed andor defense or it would offer no actual choice to a hauler to use it or not further there should be some counter to the mechanic that also requires a trade off for the scanner so they can see through the false information so 1 as proposed however some additional cargo scanning gameplay perhaps built around a revamp of the underdeveloped smugglingcontraband aspect of the game sure
just one more nerf and it will be balanceddestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
thanks for the reply yes indeed i think its difficult to implement however my hope is that the attribute rework will make it possible in the future
just read the day four csm minutes that were released a few hours after my post and it seems they are already looking at it wait and see
you can check what i was supporting last year even if some of my thoughts have evolved since theni am still working on my platform for this year and should have the high level items up within a few weeksi am far from being an expert on high sec wardecs so i will not delve into details of current rules i am not familiar enough with as i mostly operate outside of high secthis said there are some principles i strongly believe in that would educate any input i could provide to possible changes the game is a sandbox for all play styles if the wardec mechanics cause highly risk adverse players to stop playing until the war is over it is not a good system  low risks should always mean low rewards and the highest rewards should always come when competing against other players  high sec players should be able to create social groups without opening themselves to wardecsnbas a note i have little sympathies for code and what it stands forfighters preying on high sec farmers that are not looking for a fight has never ranked very high on my own scale of values and is certainly not guerilla which involves fighting stronger forces
whereas flying in space are interactions and events mainly at a grand scale both for the interactions and in game politics wis would allow for politics and interactions at a different scale none is more important than the other but they would complement
hi no bye
dear csmit is a sad thing but someone has to do it the csm member uaxdeath has shown little to no participation in csm activities recently after his rather unexpected entrance to the council he has definitely been active but after several flashy public appearances including his so called nullsec petition which resembles more a selfpr action than a serious csm initiative he suddenly disappears nothing is heard from him in public  no forum posts no blogs no articles  not a single line anywhere he was expected to take an active part in csm summit recently but his name cannot be found in summit minutesof course i understand that csm membership is completely voluntary and the csm whitepaper does not restrict in any way nor sets a minimum level of communication between council member and community but a good representative is expected to be sort of a public person and somewhat talk with the playerbase dont you agreein summary recent actions or rather lack of actions of uaxdeath let russian community consider him as inactive csm member so i ask the council of stellar management consider the possibility of removing uaxdeath from the council and rerunning the election script once againa russian version of the petition is available here
i double never heard this xix guy do anything on public how can he represent players with that attitudeinb4 leeloo damage control him to the last drop of blood like she did on russian forums
all kick out and the good old eve shall come unto us back again these russian creates drama end of time im not fanatic im just a servant by her majesty the empress jamyl sarum i its time to leave this world to me yc111 to yc1171210 2000
yep its fair to remove uaxdeath due to lack of activity firstly he actually didnt chose secondly communication with people whom youre represented is a matter of common sense so why he should stay in csm
1 uaxdeath not active
10
on behalf of the gorgon empire i declare full support on this proposal
drop that meatbag from csm
i wholeheartedly support this proposal
just posting for updates i want to see where this will go
please small request to csm and ccp count only those votes who voted for uaxdeath during csm electionsthis way we count people who voted for him and really gets disappointed and wont count those who have never voted for him voted for another member or even didnt participated in csm elections at all and now decided to sign this petition for dirty csm wars move their favorite candidate into csm or to implement personal hate to uaxdeath or his alliance
isnt xenuria next in line
nice try xenuria
dear sweet mother of god
and by dungeon they mean any pve combat content agent missions included right
thanks for the comments i did read the minutes but i still didnt understand what they were talking about but now i think i do so this is going to be a sort of 24 hour cycle it rewards logging in one hour per day as opposed to logging in for hours once per week as for faction war there wasnt much there i am concerned about these patrols i hope we dont go back to the days where npcs will be powerful and force militias to fit for pve thus acting as a deterent to pvp also tweaking npcs has proven to be a red herring its the actual pvp players who need better tools to make the sov game pvp focused the four way war may invigorate faction war for the short term but none of the changes make the actual mechanics of fighting for sov more funpvp oriented it seems that ccp forgot many of things they said they wanted to do in faction war to make it more fun and pvp focused eg such as timer rollbacks and better intel tools its not just a matter of warp core stabs make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
so did i understand it correctly the fw goals from day 4suspect timer for entering plextd3s out of small plexesyou can join fw even if your corp does notdecouple fw and standingwebbing npcs in missions4 way warusing fw as testing ground for more intelligent ai and engaging pve generally all over evethat is how i understand theese roaming patrolsnot change any fw mechanic untill the pve test experiment is overif this is the case then at least i know why fw and pve was in the same session i will give ccp the benefit of the doubt and wait and see how this plays out i am mildly disappointed and nervous though that at lot of the concerns that fw players and some of the csm raised is basically answered by ccp with  good point but we wont look at it because i am sure theese npcs will solve thisnpcs taking care of stabbed farmers  i am not convinced this is the way solve the problems of fw it still seems like the wrong medicine to me naively one could think that having more people doing pve in fw space will lead to more pvp but i think all the farming in fw has shown the opposite fw people get tired of hunting people who do not want to be engaged to engage in casual pvp is why a lot of people joined fw in the first place out of interest does this resumUFFFD of the fw session include all the discussion that went on about fw and pve or are a lot of stuff omitted
someone just linked your post in a channel and asked me if you are my alt since we seem to fully agree with all points at this point i am however not sure if ccp forgot about things or if they are intentionally ignoring them both is possible since the devs dealing with fw must have changed four times by now as sidenote null sov is getting timer rollbacks in one of the next patches they only call the feature a little different
fw plex acceleration gates should refuse ships with warp core stabs these are dedicated combat sites not lp farming spots if you want to farm lp go and do missions is that simple fights between opposing militias fights for plexes should decide who owns the system not stabbed farmers i really cant comprehend how this can not be fixedthe most sad thing in fw clicklisted under business what do we talking about here
id like to be able to join any faction at will regardless of standing i would also enjoy shooting at my own side a lot since that wont cause a problem with standings
we have both been asking for this for a few years now here is the link were i quote ccp fozzie saying they still wanted to have rollbacks in october 2012 it just seems to have slipped through the cracks
good changes with t3ds good making a daily login award good making attempts at fixing fw missionsas a roleplayer i dont like the 4 way war thing but i can see how it would bring more pvp into focus bad letting players switch without standings hit are you guys high if you do this then you need to loose 5 standings with the faction if you kill a friendlies all this lets people do is hop militias killing new players the people your trying to save here without any any consequences if you do this you will find that role play in fw will come to an end because we will literally be drained of isk trying to maintain wardecs on every opportunity killer so we dont loose standing without our chosen factionif your going to fix fw bring back the god damn  battlecruiser restricted major complexes you just redid bcs and we need this bc plex back please stop releasing new ships and just fix the broken stuff interdictors blow to hard t3 balance has been long overdue logi is way to prolific
jsuburbanization of lowsec i cant find exactly the right word for this but ill stick to suburbanization heres what i mean since fozziesov you have had lots of previously successful sov entities moving or breaking up into lowsec groups the why is easy lowsec is more content rich much less of a logistical hassle both in moving stuff and day to day operation and has comparable or better income streams this ties into other things i want to talk about specifically about the entry bars to sov as they are but it also tells a lot about what players actually want and what sov actually offers them again if you can think of a better word im totally gamelowsec has a ton going for it especially for players who want to shoot at each other i am actually curious on numbers of capital losses in whnull vs lowsec as its pretty obvious where players are choosing to fight some would say where game mechanics have forced them to fight essentially you have deep null where people go to pve in peace and lowsec which is a crowded content thunderdome i dont like this at all as distance combined with the phoebe changes has basically left entire regions all but impervious to attack essentially condemning them as purely pve areas  they are for a particular purpose which again is bad for a sandbox one of the goals of fozziesov was to regionalize conflict  well it happened but basically people collectively raised their hands and said lowsec is that region so we get a concentration and the same sort of politics and alliance structures in lowsec as we used to see in null sov has become territory you fill with newbies renters or newbie renters just to hold and maintain protected by distance as much as anything whereas lowsec has become the pvp zone i really do not like having this partitioning of space where places are pseudo purposed for one particular activity distances have to be shrunk a little bit to prevent this isolation and essentially zoning and the bar for sovholding is obviously way too high for a large majority of experienced players even if more carrots are added to sov as more of these changes get implemented what is likely to happen is people just sticking alts in the big null alliances and keeping their main characters doing whatever  this is already happening it shouldnt be that surprising though  people putting their pve characters in pseudo pve alliances holding pve regions just has so much synergy to it i suppose some of this belongs under the income heading but this partitioning of space mitigates so much risk as to be one factor in part of the economic woes we have now holding sov now is more about pve than pvp so again you are going to attract vastly different crowds lowsec will continue to grow and more and more exsov players will probably consider moving to the suburbs as their once proud hubs of pvp are transformed into glorified high sec theres maybe a few sov regions which are actually functioning as models of aegissov but these are far and few in between and their success could largely be pinned on proximity to either low or npc nullstill looking for a better term for this phenomena

eve  esportsthere have been many worries and justly so about the future commitment from ccp to evesports after losing the neo tournament and the diminished format of the alliance tournament i understand this completely however the level of cost to ccp needs to be justified in its return or perceived value evesports are important to the community as a whole there is content for newer players in many forms but for those that have been around a little longer its tournaments and highly skilled events like this that still feed us that buzz and excitement eve online can deliverthe cold hard truth is the future of evesports lies in our hands us the players some great examples have already been set in the past by rvb and i intend to build a network of likeminded volunteers with an excellent mix in skillsets to provide a viable future for evesports despite ccpUFFFDs budget having been cut for this side of eve there are many things that they can do to assist this merry band of volunteers at zero to low cost to the company social media boosts of playerorganised events and or prizes organised in the form of ingame items will boost the viability of these kind of projects and ensure the future of competitive eve gameplayas the owner of event collides and having a deep involvement with those in the competitive circles i feel i am very well suited to represent their concerns and work hard together with ccp on evesports future as csm i further want to push to bring the competitive scene to eve and providing direct assistance to ccp to take advantage of the range of marketing opportunities at their disposal to allow those who are missing out on this game to see the light and become a pilot in the storied world of new eden ive flown with and against nashh these last few years and have had many dealings with him including several ingame events and always found him to be dedicated and knowledgeable he certainly gets my support as a candidate for the next csm council as an event and esports representativejoffy aulxgao  aba director diplomat csm candidatewhen nashh asks for two minutes he gives you 10bei artjay producer event collidesevent collides is literally the worst ccp logibro tech on event collides 1apothne  pl crossing zebrasevent website wwweventuk blog

excellent candidate and a real nice genuine person who is nothing but a pleasure to work with i love what nashh is doing for this community and hope he gets the chance to do more via csm where im certain hell do as great a job in representing players as he has done in entertaining us with event
what i love most about event nottingham and other events is that players form all different backgrounds come together put their ingame differences aside and have fun regardless of who you are or where you come form as the meta game in eve gets deeper and deeper as layers and layers of history of wars rivalry and split allegiances make things ever more complex in game i think we can almost all agree that stepping back from tq and chatting  about the universesportwhatever is super important and being given the opportunity to do this with a network of people who are the same level is super cool nashh is dedicated in making these events happenfor the event collides project i initiated he has proven to me that he can work patiently and tirelessly as an intermediary between ccp and others and this reason alone i believe he would make an ideal candidate

wow no ive personally seen you show a level of ignorance on these forums that i simply would not trust on the csm you lack understanding of game mechanics and interactions but feel entitled to lecture on them from that position of ignorance anyway a voice like yours is the opposite of what this game needs
uaxdeath could have had a valid excuse we dont know not to attend the summit considering the leeloo incident and the controversy surrounding how and why he got elected for csm i really hope he has valid reason for not taking part in the summit
one day
i think u misunderstand the meaning of representativerepresentative usually represents the views of part of the community who voted for himgiven that trolls from everu overwhelmingly voted against him hes not your representative so stop whinging
guys cut him a breakhe has a competitive mmo business to runlol
1 to 1 uaxdeath and 1 xenuria
a rare collection of dissatisfied playersi prepared with beer and popcornjita burn and more others
just sums what i wanted to say herebunch of trolls who were recently stimulated by a war that just waged by me xix against ra and co who happens to be in same time and pretty much active troll group in everu
really so you havent been absent for three weeks without letting anyone from ccp know about the planned absencebecause ccp leloo directly confirms your inactivity lack of communication with developers etc for at least that time
of course but xxxdeathxxx did not tell the community about their work because that the red spy can find out what is unnecessary
of course it is always about poor uaxdeath being attacked by trolles there is never anything wrong with him being mostly offline for the last three years but what about that time when uaxdeath asking his friend who as i know now is the ceo of xix and ccp leloo to damage control the critique of uaxdeath ignoring community and being offline when he was trying to get back to csm who was xix and co at war at that time other than rogue drones of course
mommy ill keep in mind next time ill have to ask for permission to do so thank you and where did i say i didnt absent
you are so well informed why arent you run for president 
you didnt i presumed so from your tralls tralls answer to the op which the op obviously stated your now confirmed by ccp inactivity and requested you to either be removed or for you to start being activeso ill presume again that you wouldnt want to be removed and suggest you get active with the developers mate unless you exceed some sort period of inactivity that others exceeded before you pip pip cherio
so he is alive at least someone log in under that account i can consider a part of the job is done although a really small onethe main question still remains will you uaxdeath be active at csm and inform players of your activities
i glad to see you back and what you already do something as csm attendee just one question why you need this csm member status if you was totally inactive for at least three weeks and came to us only after little storm
yes yes to blame rawe believe in a fairy tale end of time im not fanatic im just a servant by her majesty the empress jamyl sarum i its time to leave this world to me yc111 to yc1171210 2000
why dont you stop trying to derail the topic stop trying being sarcastic and start answering the questions the community has about your activity

t3d are getting kicked out of small complexesthe problem is with the ship class not where they can and cant go it can be narrowed down specifically to the svipul which is still quite broken im actually fine with t3ds in smalls but bringing their access in line with t3cs is still a good ideafw missions are being reworked by ccp red dawnthere wasnt much to go on other than throw some webs at it removing bombers from the equation only encourages people to run missions in cloakfitted ishtars which are at even less risk than a bomber nigh on invulnerable on gates thanks to the coakmwd trick by the time youve noticed them opening a mission theyve volleyed the npc off the field and are leaving system youre also raising the bar significantly for new players expecting them to shell out for a hac instead of a bomber it would have made a lot more sense to make all of the racial missions runnable by bombers especially since i believe only one race struggles to do sofw based npc patrols are being addedwhile i like the idea as a bit of fluff i fail to see how these convoys will act as a magic bullet for all of fws woes how exactly will these npcs deal with both highsec gate camps and the swarms of stabbedunfit farmers spread across both war zones short answer they wontthese convoys will fight each otherthats nice how does that help anyoneallowing individuals to enroll in fw without the entire corpalliance having to gojust no why would this need to be a thing so your alts can quickly dip in and farm some lp without screwing up their employment history kill this quickmaybe making it easier to change militia with the standings stuff up to decoupling standings and being in the militiasee above stupid idea militia membership should mean something not be an allegiance you throw away the moment your opponent looks more profitable you should be encouraging people to stick with their militia not making it easier for farmers to switch sides this is ignoring the obvious blueonblue shenanigans that standing hits help to keep in check4 way war between militia it is a true 4 way war not just the removal of allieswithout quick and easy access to their space why should i care about capturing amarrminmatar systemssuspect flagging when entering fw complexes ive made my opinion quite clear on this already so i wont repeat myself herefrankly im disappointed the level of ignorance displayed concerning fw by csm members is staggering i dont believe ive ever heard anyone suggest combat ships should be prevented from fitting stabs just what do you use your fw alts for if you think pvp here is the same as anywhere else i think the brief discussion about lp made that quite clearccp fared little better oh yeah thats an issue but were not fixing it you never cease to amaze me
i see this all the time in militia chat someone new comes is happy about giving intel about some enemies trying to fleet up with others going to most contested systems to fight  hour later he finds out none really cares much  never hear of him again
if you care about rhat person its up to you to take them under wing blaming the game for your apathy is sillyalso just remove fw missions from the game stop enemy fw pilots from docking in hostile empire stations in lowhighsec and remove any csm that thinks npc buffs are a solution to anything
crosi this is not what is important to discuss right now in a csm minutes thread imho i am afraid that this will derail the discussion and remove focus from the imo really important questions being asked if the fw minutes contain all the conversation that was done in this session i wonder why no one of the csm raised concern about ccp not having a long time plan for fw and its gameplay mechanics just adding npc patrols and say it will probably fix things should raise some kind of critique from the csm imoi am also dissapointed about that people have used so much time thinking about how to improve fw and give it to their respective csms and then so little of it is even discussedps i appreciate the smaller changes like going suspects upon entering plex but the lack of goals and direction for the future annoys me a little best regards
in reading these notes it is clear that ccp and csm are severely underestimating faction warUFFFDs potential the changes are not the worst but they demonstrate a lack of understanding the big picture with faction war and eve the comments are focused on isk for new players but people are not leaving eve because they can not make isk they are leaving eve because there are no fun wars to fight isk can only be used in game so the people no longer logging are not really going to care about it but i bet many would care if eve suddenly had allot of fun pvp wars to fight in ccp is clearly trying to shape mechanics in null sec to create fun wars for players but the stakes of null sec and the will of the null sec leadership to make isk as opposed to war all make this a bit more challenging faction war on the other hand is the perfect venue for ccp to really create a fun war where players can blow their isk fighting what do i consider fun frequent quality pvp engagements how frequent i think a faction war players who are fully engaged in sov warfare should be able to get about 10 decent fights in 3 hours of play it is very disheartening to spend the time to get the isk spend the time to figure out your fits and and fleet comps and then you just spend another 2 hours online with few decent fights good fights happen but they are not frequent enough and they often are just random with no context of achieving any sov war aims what do i think is boring having several alts orbit buttons ready to flee at the first sign of trouble yet this is the best way to gain vp in faction war and vp is the best metric to see who is winning the sov war so currently if you really want to win sov for your faction then get alts out there what can ccp do to make faction war sov more fun and exciting they already said they would do it october 22nd 2012 ccp fozzie said
cearain thanks for remembering all those things and writing it down i entirely forgot that we already had some devs on our side regarding timer rollbacks i had it somehow wrong stored in memory and could not remember any direct dev replies on that topicbtw timer rollbacks in ageis sov for those interested
it makes me sad that nullsec gets rollback before fw we were asking for it since years 23 still nothing but i am very happy that nullsec is fixed maybe we should stop asking for it and we would suddenly get it as well
the lack of any serious mechanic is worrying i dont think it should taboo or forbidden by alliances to be discussed i rather see a quarterly respawn mechanic but eventually its something for ccp games with the help of csm to work out imhomoney moons are massive conflict drivers and therefor ideal content creators if you want the moon money you have to work for it no more one time investment and then passive income t2 goods compared to tech 1 should cost more because capsuleers should pay more for better value items they call it kicking the anthill stopping any established status quo ante is a good thing for content creation so hell yeah yet another example
updated my agendas because the day 4 minutes announced that t3 destroyers will be banned from small fw plexes soon
i have known nashh for many years and am wellacquainted with his ability to organize and promote events rally people to his causes and make a wellreasoned arguments in support of the things he believes in and has expertise in some of you may remember his entertaining celebrity death matches from years pasti had the great fortune to participate in one of those and it was one of my more memorable pvp experiences in eve even back then nashh was great at putting events together and publicizing them more recently his widely applauded event player meets have raised the bar for player meets everywhere and nashh shows no signs of slowing down or resting on his laurels nashh is a doer with high energy and great enthusiasm for eve and the community hes well organized extremely knowledgable about the game particularly the pirate play style and low sec life and he is personable and communicative i feel confident he will be an excellent csm member and he will definitely get a top tier vote from me
nashh has done awesome things in the space of player gatherings and event is one of the most respected events in the world his community focus is needed on the csm and his expertise with tournaments and evesports makes him an even more valuable commodityif i was on your ballot for csmx nashh should be on your ballot for csmxi heUFFFDll be 1 on mineeve down under  a community for players in the autz
on my list bro while i dont know nashh personally his community work speaks for itself we need someone like nashh with his manifesto on the csm
he also has a thing for micro breweries which automatically propels him high up on any list of mine
nashh baby is the man you just cant argue with his passion and enthusiasm for the game i know him well and i thoroughly recommend giving him your vote he is a talented speaker writer leader and motivator he will listen to your ideas and will put them forward in the most suitable way1
you have my autocannon
and my axeknowing nash for 2 years already has been a thrilling experience especially considering how much time and effort he invests into anything he does it is safe to say eve would not be the same experience for me if it werent nash i vouch that because of his dedication his wife has threatened with divorce multiple times but he never caved in endjoke he will be 1 on my list not because he is my ceo but because he has proven time and time again that he is both willing and capable of good work
ive known and worked with nashh almost as long as ive been playing eve from way back in the celebrity deathmatch days when i clobbered his myrm with my drake the guy has a tattoo on his back that i designed for him so needless to say we go way back seriously though i cant think of anyone id rather curse with a csm seat than nashh hell do an awesome job and represent all of us well on the council he is easily bought and influenced and will truly uphold the very best of our pirate traditions no one can deny that he has a heart and a knack for eve and for ingame and out of game events so his platform is one which deserves our support and more attention from ccpnashh will be on my list this year
was looking out for this one nashh is an awesome bloke and what can i say i owe him one for shouting a taxi for me to get back to my hotel in the evening after helping set up for the first ever event the scale of the event hes created from scratch shows exactly what this man can do he has a good group of people that support him and if anyone will give you a chance to speak to him about your ideas itll be nashh he knows his game particularly the low sec aspect which is always good to have on a csm hes a genuinely nice bloke who always replies to my tweets and puts up with me asking him all sorts of things about event all the time p short of an alliance mate applying highly unlikely nashh will be my 1 vote and he should be yours too
yeah no
in my dealings with nashh through our crazy nullsec deployments and the at he has been nothing but an awesome person to work with i believe he has more then earned my support as his platform is exactly what i want to expand and improve in eve i have absolute confidence that nashh will be a cornerstone of the next csm and hope others share the same sentiment
like many i cut my pvp teeth in lowsec and still enjoy the odd roamhunt around from the few conversations weve shared outside of eve i get the sense that he is someone who knows the difference between when to share views and press matters and when to listen and take other views and ideas on board his dedication to what drives him is pretty evident and id be very happy to see that continue on as a member of the csm
that would be a great set of skills to bring to the csm confirm that nash is a nice person to be on comms with
fair enough is why i invite people to bring questions and counterpoints i took and will continue to take your comments seriously and reply accordingly while i know of some of the main discussions you talk about i recommend sharing links to specific talks let others decide or i can find links as wellit is a good opener for my campaign shows how i approach issues and communicate interestingly enough my conversations with you actually inspired me enough to finally take the full step to campaigning to be part of the csmactually here is the post and follow up conversation that made me decide to fully step upi have no interests in hiding who i am i am running to be part of the group that works with ccp to get the player feedback and opinions to them it is a year i will not be playing eve if and when csm appears by my name then that will be my play if there is an issue i will take that issue on see it from both sides cannot do that if tied to a corp or alliance
i refuse to give credence to a post by a throwaway character in an npc corp grow a pair and post under your main or keep your fingers off the keyboard keys
but then again who cares about the credence that you refuse or otherwise to give when we had a ccp representative confirming the motive of the op and even had the man himself crawling back from inactivity to report in with the developers
op is known in russian speaking community and gaming communities like everu goha for his englishrussian translations of various official devblogs newsmaking and other related stuff in a sense he is more useful to the game than your main or your petty alliance
oh cmon uax is sitting in csm only to have timely intel on sov changes and attempts to keep sov useful for current empires i believe csm in its current state is awful overall not only due to uax
okay as former xix member and uaxdeath voteryes im really vote for uaxdeath blame me i support topic starters question will you uaxdeath be active at csm and inform players of your activities
thank you for the support 3 i agree that i was a little bit late during the last election and i wished that i had put up my campaign thread earlier so i decided to make sure to get out there much sooner this time around its still early but i dont think theres a case of it ever being too early being early never hurt
nashh has an insane amount of energy he ploughs into projects all over the place with a bit of luck a year on the csm will bring down to normal human levels and let the rest of us keep up with him
well this is good news nash would be a real asset to the entire player base he has great energy and expertise and i am certain will give his all
nashh gave me a fantastic handy at event hes got my vote

hjump ranges and jump fatiguejump fatigue fixed one thing and broke several others UFFFD these need fixes the collateral damage is simply far too great eve has literally gone from being a place where 100 man super fleets are omnipresent within 15 minutes to a place where it is better to self destruct capitals rather than move them surely there is a goldilocks zone where things are reasonable and we should aim to get there sooner than later1black opsso i am completely unsatisfied with the current jump fatigue on black ops jumps and bridges they are one of the few tools available to actually fight a much larger entity and at least garnish some token victories or out harass large bloated empires one drop is like 2 hours of fatigue if you jump backand lets be realistic any competent defender will make you do so considering the extreme isolation that null affords much of it multiple jumps away from any npc systems to stage from blops really needs its fangs back UFFFD the threat of a blops drop needs to be something that can be projected any place at any time guerrilla tactics are some of the only realistic ways to generate content between entities of grossly asymmetrical size yet both the range and the frequency of jumps really kills good blops play capitals arent not supposed to be infinitely manoeuvrable but blops are supposed to be extremely manoeuvrable so i dont get why the hammer was pretty much thrown at both i can understand not wanting to risk feeding projection more but the defining aspect of the ship class was basically collateral damage when trying to reign in capital projection what it did was make some regions totally inaccessible to blops and make the play style about waitingin a game about waiting black ops ships themselves i really do not find poorly balanced but they could use the promised rebalance tweaks they definitely do not not need tii resists UFFFD manoeuvrability damage tank pick two and you have a well balanced specialized ship and they have extreme damage and manoeuvrability giving them straight tii resists would make them hilariously overpowered more scan resolution and sensor strength added to the base hull slightly better fitting or an overheating bonus for a set duration after jumpinganything to make them better at ambush tactics but they are not meant to be toetotoe champions of slugfests that is what marauders are for you want them fast and high damage but impractical for other roles either the jumpbridge range needs to be extended or the fatigue needs to be lessened to allow realistic use of midssafes to hit areas that are farther away2movingyes it was important to make carrier apex forces not infinitely motile but moving to new areas is currentlyterrible the ratio of work to content is just becoming excruciating causing many to just give up you sort of know theres something wrong when it is just better to massself destruct a capital fleet and buy another one rather than try and move it the same applies to moving subcaps to new locations in an age when you are trying to make sov empires vibrant malleable and shifting it is hilariously bad in my appraisal to make the act of moving to new space to miserable and taxing sticking your sovaspirants with yet another bar to entry yet another reason not to try and live in sov null is not conductive to building or showcasing the play style space is literally just too big now much better of an idea to just shack up in lowsec where most things will be accessible3local capital overdominance hyperlocalization invent your own buzzwordthis one is pretty easy in a world where capitals are bound to at most a 10ly radius contesting local capital power particularly in deep null is basically impossible this hurts people looking for capital content makes their use in deep null extremely hard to punish and makes local capital bullies hard to deal with in certain areas basically movement is so restricted that meaningful interaction is greatly inhibited yeah a spate of big fights happened in quick succession when the all seeing eye of super blobs was blinded which is good but other areas are on the other end of the spectrum pretty much the only places where dropping capitals is risky is in and around lowsec where the population and system density is high enough i suppose some of this is pending the capital re balance but generally if a ship is undocked it should be vulnerable and i just dont feel this is the case with the size of the map vs the range of capitals capitals need a tad more projection UFFFD not too much just enough to let groups play sheriff on other groups capital usage 4more npc null pockets are needed one of the reasons for this is to allow actual capital movement between regions and make more places accessible to move through or move to generally npc pockets lead to much more interesting times for local sovholders with how big the universe is now and with the recent wh nerf actually getting at people and providing a healthy amount of risk is a bit of a challenge logistically whereas these would really help i do think the jump ranges and times are way too strict but a few well placed systems could really accelerate movement my making more direct travel paths
i think it is positive that you have a lot of experience in eve and that you want to represent players no matter where they are based in new eden and working in the it industry i think would be a real advantage in understanding the devs point of view that you are a fantasy author is also a plus
i tried to read this i could not might want to redo this
if you dont know nashh hes an amazing beacon for connecting people in the eve community  ingame and in real life  especially through his organisation of the event meetup his corp is a familiar name if youre based in lowsec and rightly so ive had the pleasure of meeting nashh and his alliancemates on several occasionsi can honestly say that csm xi would be a hell of a lot stronger with nashh onboard his ability to reach out to the eve community coupled with his integrity and his passion for this game and its players make him an excellent csm candidatei have no doubt that he will listen where the community speaks and speak on the communitys behalf rather than for himself something which so many csm candidates have failed to achieve in the pastgood luck nashh rekkingcrew
subtlety increases immersion on a grand scale the subtle interactions on stations the backroom or back alley dealings would take on a whole new meaning and the reaction to other players based on standings would be pretty ing cooli am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
every time i turn around somebody is either leaving or being kicked from the csm maybe its time for somebody consistent to have a seat at the table its time for xenuria
last i checked csm members arent paid by ccp so they arent employees
this is like being in the cafeteria of the esl school where i work watching the students fight
i can confirm after personal experiences flying alongside nashh and meeting him in person that he has a very welcoming personality and engages very well with eve community and others always there to listen and give a hand i have personally witnessed him in placing the best interest of others ahead of his own and always offering to assist when and where possiblefurther in my experiences working with him as part of the event collides team he again displays his nature as well as immense energy for putting the community and others first and providing for them using the collides platform as another way to provide and address what the eve community wantfor that i lend my support to nashh
hi all i would like to bring up a matter that i think its very important not long ago i have been the victim of a scam when i was trying to buy a supercarrier and i am sure that i am not alone on this now buying a supercap its serious business because they cost a huge amount of isk the super caps are the only ships in the game that cannot be bought on a normal market and there for it attracts scammers i also do know that there is a system of so called UFFFDUFFFD third partyUFFFDUFFFD that will ensure the player to player transaction and that there are a few players with a proven track record of securing these super cap transactions but are we safe the answer is no because even them can one day stop being trustworthy and scam youit will be happening once because after that his reputation will go down but stillon that day you can loose as much as 100 bil so what i propose is a safe way of buying super capswhich could be done in several ways one of them i am going to present to you here todayin high security space in every major trade system a super massive station where any alliance that has a toon with the requiered skills regardless if they have sov or not can come and build super caps and put them up for sale any super cap undocking in that system will not be able to shoot their guns nore deploy any king of fighters or fighter bombers but only be able to jump into the nearest low sec or null sec to a special covert cyno that only super caps can lock onto and only from the high security spacethe way super caps are built and sold needs to change give the small alliances the power to build their own super caps or buy thier super caps in a safe wayi urge ccp to make this change because i think i have a strong caselooking forward for replys
chribba just saying cribba is safe and if you dont want to use a third party you deserve to be scammed
chribba just saying cribba is safechribba is not safe as long as hes got the free will to turn around anytime he wants to say thats it your 100 bil is mine now
quote if you dont want to use a third party you deserve to be scammedquotewhat do you mean a third party is not safe all together why would i want to use it as long as the posibility exists its not safei would really like to hear the opinion of people that got scamed already
has this ever happened and just how likely is it bearing in mind he makes far more being honest than breaking his word and never being trusted again so noedit oh and reported please dont cross postdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i cannot stress this long enoughas long as you cannot buy a super on a market safely just like everything else and the posibility to get scamed exists its not safe
have you at all considered the possibility of thats the pointyou are trying to buy something that is for all intents and purposes an alliance level asset it is not supposed to be easily moved sold or stored1 for this idea being a trusted 3rd party trader is good profession and a good example of how reputation is supposed to matter in this game
i cannot stress this long enoughas long as you cannot buy a super on a market safely just like everything else and the posibility to get scamed exists its not safe quotehave you at all considered the possibility of thats the pointyou are trying to buy something that is for all intents and purposes an alliance level asset i got my own alliance if its for all intents and purposes an alliance level asset why canUFFFDt i build one thats my pointi wanna build supers without having to have sov or buy a super safly without the danger of being scamed
have you at all considered the possibility of thats the pointyou are trying to buy something that is for all intents and purposes an alliance level asset i got my own alliance if its for all intents and purposes an alliance level asset why canUFFFDt i build one thats my pointi wanna build supers without having to have sov or buy a super safly without the danger of being scamedquoteok so nobody supports my case jesus i feel like iUFFFDve only been talking to alliance members and leaders that have sov in null sec and thrid party service providers
so your point is that you want to be able to build or buy a giant space coffin without having to risk yourself or your alliancenopefor the same reason you cant have a poco or pos without having a corporation or buildbuy regular capitals without being in lownullsec or own sov without having an allianceor build a supercap without owning sovor buy a supercap without having to go through 3rd party tradersif you want more powerful assets you have to put yourself at increasingly higher levels of risk and the possibility of failurethis is a theme in the game get over yourself you are no more entitled than i am to score a kill or mine in safety or not fall prey to scams or have the market manipulated under you or not be gouged out or have your way of doing things disrupted etc
everything you mentioned above apart from the section UFFFDUFFFDor buy a supercapUFFFDUFFFD has nothing to do with the subject in talks also erelevant so no point in bringing them up because they cannot be examples to your pointless say and iUFFFDm gonna explain whynone of your examples above have any relevance to the danger of being scamed for 20 bil isk to 100 bil isk ok
you can the same way anyone else can take sov get the strategic index up far enough install the relevant ihub upgrades put a csaa on a pos and build your superwhy should you be able to build the things in complete safety let alone trade and store them
because my alliance is not big enough to take sov and it will never get big enough to take sov thats my point why shouldnUFFFDt small alliances be able to build thier own supers why only the big allinaces should have that power
anyone that wants to know more about joffys character take a moment and read this post
because you arent risking as much as they are

i cannot state enough how strongly i support joffys run for csm this fellow is active at superhuman levels always participating in this event or organizing that event his dedication loyalty humility and openness have made him an invaluable asset to aba as an alliance and to the eve community as a whole
greetings to all of new edenmy name is kyle aparthos and i have finally made the decision to run for csm xi as some of you who read tmc or cz may know i have been writing and publishing columns about the state of eve online under the moniker of opinionated analysis for some time where we were how we got to where we are and where we might go from here if you havent read any of those and youre still interested in what i have to say by the time we get to the end of this post then here are a couple examplesto condense a whole lot of longwinded writing into a few short statements i am an analyst writer currently retired diplomat for spacemonkeys alliance and general guy who goes out and talks to lots of people and gets their opinions on things most relevant to the csm is my ongoing role as an analyst who studies the mechanics of eve online in a very indepth sense publishing diatribes and making suggestions for the future as a result of this role i have gained quite a lot of analytical experience especially pertaining to eve mechanics beyond just the surface level of this sucks and i dont like it because it inconveniences methis has been especially useful when combined with the communication skills gained from all the time spent talking to people on platforms ranging from sma comms where people love me to reddit where people hate sma and thus it takes a little more effort to note be hated by associationover the course of my career as a result of many of these roles i have gained a fair bit of insight into group interaction as well as how medium and large groups have reacted to the changes to eve over the last year ultimately this leads to me having a solid knowledge of how to put player behavior together with the actual mechanics of the game my experience has led me to believe in two things that player agency both at the level of the individual and the group is the single most important aspect of eve that player agency can only be enhanced through combining little things qualityoflife changes to be exact and broad sweeping alterations to the game as a result when i examine announced changes to eve my primary concern is how groups of players will react to these changes the human element as it were i feel very strongly that many members of our community have focused too heavily on analyzing these changes from a mechanical perspective only  how the mechanics fit into one another and trying to make the people fit into the mechanics rather than give equal weight to both the mechanics and the players using them because of this belief i am basing my campaign on the notion that player cooperation is the mainstay of eve be it in huge alliances or smaller groups more importantly all of these groups deserve a greater sense of agency and individual involvement and more tools to further their personal goals no matter how large or small the group is while there are a huge number of different ways to achieve this goal i shall at least initially focus on a few of these in my campaigncontinued in next post
continued from previous postone alliancelevel management deserves some love currently just about every mediumtolarge alliance must rely on out of game tools in order to support themselves some of these outofgame functions such as teamspeak servers and alliance websites are spectacularly useful and hard to emulate however alliance leadership also finds itself forced to utilize outofgame tools for such tasks as blacklist management tax collection for those who do so and srp in addition the existing ingame mechanics such as role management and hangars simply do not exist in any fleshedout state at the alliance level i firmly believe that if we can overhaul and add to the number of ingame tools available to prospective alliance leaders both old and wellestablished alliances as well as those who are struggling to get off of the ground will prospertwo player customization of space should be an integral component of the investment in sov while the upcoming structures due to be released in spring of 2016 are slated to be usable just about anywhere some of their possible functions specifically those proposed at fanfest 2015 that would allow for serious customization of space such as alteration of security status rat type and warp speed within a system should be specific to players who have invested in their space not necessarily invested a boatload of isk but rather invested their time and effort in acquiring a sov system and living in it and defending it the more time and effort you put into your little slice of paradise the more you should be able to customize and alter it to suit your particular playstyle so long as those customizations are still occupancydependent  this would allow the ability to utilize enjoy and defend your space to be more dynamic than simply how much have you ratted and mined in your space in the last week and how high is its strategic index while simultaneously retaining the underlying theme of occupancy sovereignty three players should have multiple different avenues for taking and holding space as i detailed in one of the columns linked above while fozziesov certainly has its merits and i am not advocating for a return to dominion sov i do not believe that entosis links should be the only method of sov acquisition this is especially pertinent given the current usage of entosis links to destroy sov structures outright it simply does not make any logical sense in my mind that a sov lazor should be capable of making a huge structure detonate as a result i think that ccp had the right idea with how they treat stations currently entosis links cause the station to flip once all levels of node contesting have been completed with the announced return of a partial structure grind to destroy the new structures it is my belief that the most reasonable way to proceed with sov is to allow entosis links and node contesting to be used to capture structures and the limited structure grinding to be used to destroy them when combined with the different force multiplication tools that are possible with the new structures this produces a much wider variety of ways to engage in sov warfare and thus more ways to engage the player base in short we have succeeded in making sov somewhat more accessible in that an enormous blob of supers is no longer required to hold your space however we have not made either holding sov or fighting for it much more engaging at all the updates that the next year holds must make being part of an alliance sov or no more engaging for everyone involvedif youre interested in getting in touch with me to share your ideas comments or concerns you can contact me ingame at kyle aparthos via tweetfleet slack under the same name or via redditi hope to hear from you guys soon d
first replyobligatory grr goons
since the first two posts are essentially filled up the reserve post is where ill put my interviews thusfar so you dont have to go digging to find them csm watchscc loungeeveguardian same interview as scc loungeevent and more to come
kyle for csm
you do know that structures wont be affected by entosis right not talking about sov structures things like citadels
i do know that as of the latest devblogs on the topic they are not slated to interact with entosis linkswhat im saying is that they should but not in the way that current sov structures do rather the new structures assuming that they are all destructible like citadels should be captureable via entosis and destructible via the alreadyoutlined dps methodid like to think that such a system if done right would offer multiple different avenues for sov warfare and thus make the process a little bit more nonlinearinteresting if youre interested in reading more about this idea even if solely for the purpose of telling me why its a dumb idea i encourage you to read the 2nd page of this column
i just dont see a reason to vote for you there is nothing that stands out that says hey we need this guy on the csm sounds harsh but its the truth ive read some of your stuff but it is rather bland not to mention i had to put up with that eye cancer web layout you continue to blog at  tmc the other things that cant be ignored is you are part of the cfc the worst offending coalition that prides itself on keeping the status quo when null desperately needs more things to shake it up to break up the cancer that is giant coalitions you brag that sma is a force to be recorded with but everyone knows sma has been nothing but cannon fodder for cfc since the beginning and would wither away and die before the sun set on their first day on their own in null sma couldnt win a coin toss on their ownnot to just bash on your alliance but we need people with fresh ideas to help put eve back in the fun zone and grow you simply have nothing to offer
so what would your response be to someone who asked why a person who actively sold his alliance mate out and straight up lied in a article on tmc to appease the goons and then instantly back tracked why would we want someone who so clearly lacks a back bone on the csm
joffy our hero i will have a tiny ballot and this guy obviously gets my 1 genuine and considerate can trust your vote there
so ive responded to this one about a thousand times before but not usually in such a public forumthe evidence placed on my desk at the time showed that he was in fact a defector and i agreed with his purging with a heavy heart privately i was as close to heartbroken as you can get over a space video game though publicly i honored my obligation as a reporter who was on the scene at the time and reported based on the evidence and statements that i had in front of me less than three days later new evidence showed up that exonerated him  i was one of the first in line banging the pots and pans calling for his exoneration and i could not have been happier when sma leadership as a whole agreed that he deserved a full apology and a reversal of the previous decision i have quite frankly never been so  happy to be wrong in the entirety of my eve career and the first thing i did when rayonar got back onto our ts was pull him aside and beg him to forgive me for making the mistakes i did the second thing i did was immediately go over to tmc and write a retraction of my previous statements i had a ridiculous smile on my face the entire time i wrote it because i got a chance to make things right and not lose a friendrayonar was and remains a very good friend of mine as far as im concerned if he managed to find it in his heart to examine the words coming out of my mouth and determine that i was worthy of his forgiveness then why should the rest of eve make a shitshow out of it
hi pilot in questionthis stigma really needs to end ive grown very tired of everyone outside of the imperium even pretending they know how this all ended lets go ahead and try to end this entire political nonsense right here and now mistakes were made and we will probably never be able to live down what happened but the sad fact remains that regardless of how little it comes up 95 of the time it comes from an outside entity that would just use it as grr gons fuel until they turn red in the faceim honestly super tired of hearing about it i will in no way ever change the stance that in my 10 years of mmos i never had a worse few irl days from a video game but lets go ahead and end some notions like i was cold shouldered by everyone in the imperium let alone sma blarf the skymarshal at the time reached out to me within 12 hours of it happening he tracked me down on skype personally to touch base and to get dialogues started on what exactly happened as he wasnt present at the time kyle widget zombie various other sma directorate the brothers specifically and countless others were on my side and had my back and support for every one person that even believed what happened wasnt bullshit there was a herd of others than didnt kyle to this day apologizes to me for having to write the article im not mad at him really im not people act like i should be gutting him and spreading his entrails over the streets it gets boring when people decide how mad or upset i shouldve been kyle again to this day still receives threats outside of eve harassment all sorts of  over an article for a video game with these things said to base someones entire candidacy on a single mistake that he openly regrets to this day and has worked hard to move past is pretty narrow youre openly avoiding the fact that he is very well versed and informed in this game despite not being a 5 year bitter vet player just to turn about and  on him for grr gons and lol sma burned his friendi would vouch for kyle for csm regardless of whatever the outcome was hes proven to be a great neutral ground on almost everything hes written article wise something most people pitching for csm should probably take note on these days guy does his research and isnt afraid to approach something from different angles that people refuse to chance to look terrible in public eyes guy has a lot more spine than the people that harass him as far as im concernedtldr  stop digging up the past didnt happen to you and i dont really care any more id vote for him instantly especially based on his knowledge ability to learn and his willingness to compromise on most topics that most people just dont care to do more than bury their head in the sand on
quieroeveenespaUFFFDolsupport making a eve client in spanish and i will consider your candidacy
i think it is absolutely appalling that there exists alliances that empower a person such as digi someone that knows no bounds on where the meta should end he is in fact the one who claimed you were a spy and thus cfc blindly following his every word had your titan killed you seem to support such actions with no shame same as op who is wanting to be on the csmunfortunately for you and op guilt by willing association with such scum is something the player community does not need on the csm i fear that you and op have been under the yoke of the cfc for so long you have stockholm syndrome and cant see the evil that transpires in front of your noses digi survives because cowardly players feed him information on other players that he uses against them in and outside the game worldbreak your ties with the cfc and stand on your own cast aside trash like digi and then maybe then members from sma could be seen as a legitimate candidate for the csm and not just another sock puppeti mean how do you think this image was made
thats not an sma problem that would be a goons problem if they continue to support digi than that is there prerogative not ours yes he claimed i was a spy turned out he was wrong eh but it turns out i wasnt and my assets were replaced and i got back to doing the things i wanted to doguilt by association is easily the most halfassed excuse for not liking someone just because im in the general area of someone you dont like im as bad as said person pretty awful we walk amungst criminals daily yet were not labeled for what they do the stockholm syndrome line is also very old and boring i love how everyone just cant get over the fact that i wanted to continue to help an alliance that id been a part of for many years grow above all else youre a member of brave who has collapsed and rebuilt countless times over endless drama and yet you dont see me calling you a masochist because some people do have the respect for someone who has the willpower and charisma to keep a good thing going where others would call it mental illness out of spitein respect to my friend who actually wants a chance to make this run i will no longer be posting in this thread if you want to argue your personal gripes with me evemail me i really dont care to see this level of sperg on an open forum but since you want it here it is enjoy it i guess otherwise reach me by other means
this may actually been the nicest thing ive ever heard you say i really appreciate knowing at least one person has this opinion of me 3
kyle youre a great guy and have done a lot for us i really love your articles on tmc and support you some people may only see cfc and grr goons and thats fine thats how they choose to see the game but some of us dont let that get in the way of seeing the people behind the character sma has amazing people and youre one of them kyle2016
nashh is likely going to be number one on my ballot for csm11the perspective that he holds is one that is desperately needed on the csm and someone with his depth of experience could do wonders for this game as a whole by being apart of the council best of luck nashh and if you need any advice or have any questions regarding the csm please dont hesitate to ask1
i once had the pleasure to listen to nashh after a sweet kill in our home area ramble on about some other eve story and i didnt want to sign off until i heard it all i dont really know this person much or about the event related things but he sounds really level headed and gets eve i support this
im no fan of sma the brothers specifically i hold in great contempt for reasons that will become apparent if you ask them about my corp but trying to hold the whole rayonar thing above kyles head is pretty damn childish i wish you the best of luck but as long as you are affiliated with sma and the brothers i cannot in good conscience vote for you
si are non goon cfc members still pretending that they dont direcctly benefit from digis blatant doxxing and that he doesnt also dox their own members
to be honest it has nothing to do with pretending i literally dont remember the last time that digi was involved in anything to do with an sma member  he was only tangentially involved even with the rayonar business and that was the one time during my tenure as a member of sma leadership that i saw his name crop up on my desk as rayonar already explicitly stated digi is a gsf member not a member of sma what digi chooses to do with his time has nothing to do with my work in sma and more to the point my work inside sma has nothing to do with my csm campaign other than that my time working as a diplomat has exposed me to thousands of people and i have learned something from listening to so many people talk about how they feel about eve which is hardly smaspecifici am not campaigning as sma guy who wants to advance sma agenda i am campaigning as analyst diplomat columnist and guy who tries to solve problems through reasoned discourse so with all due respect i think it is fair to ask that critiques of my campaign come from my ideas  there is certainly no shortage of writing available where i have been very open and honest about what ideas i have for the future of eve in fact i continue to publish new ideas at least once per week so rather than examine me from some preconceived notion that an sma candidate must be a dirty goon puppet examine the ideas that i have put forth and shall continue to put forth i promise you wont find any shortage of material upon which to base your opinion
in order to retain and reflect some of the eve style gameplay in wis like player interaction and areas with different content like the different secs there could be different sectors in a station i think that there could be three sectors but not with functionality like high low and null beacuse the point is not to make eve again with a station setting it is better that it adds something to the experience of eve as a whole another layer for more possibilitiesthough wis should be optional to take part in the natural goal with wis should be to improve the experience in eve both for pvp and pve one thing i think is beneficial is easier interaction with other players that are outside your corp or alliance because unless you are in a big corp chances are that there will be times when you are the only one on or that you are in another part of the galaxy with too little time available to travel random interaction with others isnt really possible in space as talking in local usually isnt advised in many systems but being in the same station it is much easier to suggest for example participating in fleets together on an instation channel where you know the others are docked in the same station you have of course the guest list today showing those docked but there isnt a channel for those the idea isnt that you have to walk up to someone as you can just broadcast your message on the instation channel but with peoples personas visible you could probably get some idea of what kind of people they are and if they are busy with other things or another way is that you could put yourself on a list for interest in different fleets with preferred mission type and experience desired from those wanting to join you i think it would be better for making random fleets and in that way make some more interaction without having to be in a big corp or allianceanother thing is that wis could reflect the activeties in space and put them in a context in other other words the choices you do in space will affect you here be it positively or negatively that could be such things as which npc missions are available to you and visibility of rewards more connection with the eve world is a use too many of the entries about stations that are in the lore are just there though i enjoy to read about it and imagine it to see it visualized would be interestingthere could be three types of sectors in a station where one is a tiein with legion if that is coming part of the point of having several of these sectors is to make station gameplay interesting on a wider level and in that way make fis more interesting as well because of the connectionsthe first part is an area for sociality the air in this area is appropriate for capsuleers and so mainly the ones you meet here are other players except for maybe service personnel like someone attending the bar the lighting is relaxed and soft perhaps with some slow shifting of colours here you also find shops for apparelthe next area is an area that is a basis for pve in space here you meet npcs offering storyline missions not found through the agent finder and npcs telling you about ship and fleet tactics and some npcs just telling you some general news information screens shows relevant news the point of this place is to get special missions that were activated through completing certain pve missions involving security mining exploration or faction warfare in space and as a place for learning more about new eden the political issues cultural and trends flying and ship tactics being in parts of the station not designed for capsuleers one has to wear a suit to be in these areas both for air and security despite this capsuleers want to show their uniquness to station residents so the suits have changed to be more than just necessity instead to be more design oriented or even to be intimidating though pve focused this is not a single player area so you could interact with other capsuleers just as in the capsuleers areasthe legion part is naturally for pvp but different to what you see in dust these are in spaces of the station not currently at least supervised by station security here are buying and selling of contraband items these areas are lootable pvp though so it would be necessary to have a dust type soldier there can you get in or out to buy or sell the items you want before someone take you down i guess all areas should have some restrictions on the number of people in one area so to make it technically more achieveable
im going to have to disagree with opim against cyberbullying but ganking does not fit the definintion of cyberbullying losing spaceships in a spaceship combat game is not bullyingstretching the definition of cyberbullying so far out of whack so that you can squeeze hisec ganking in eve into it does nothing but cast a shadow of ridiculousness over the subject and cause harm to the effort to fight cyberbullying please dont take a serious issue like this and turn it into a laughing stock by misapplying the label to things that should not have such a label attacheddo some research on actual cyberbullying cases and see for yourself how ridiculous it is that you would even attempt to categorize hisec ganking as cyberbullying
dude what you are ridiculousi dont think in any court in the usa anyone is going to penalize someone for ganking ships in eve get freaking serious you would never even make it to court the prosecuting attorney would likely laugh in your facelearn what actual bullying is and shut your hole
thisseriously if youre feeling hurt over losing a ship in a video game you need to turn off the game and get a grip on reality
so i have been fairly frustrated with evelopedia which i would point out appears to be ccps official wiki as it is on the eveonlinecom domainmuch of the information in the evelopedia is outdated and contains many innaccuracieswhen googling for information many links are found to evelopedia and as it is ccps site or so one would surmise one would expect to get accurate information from this resourcethe fact that it shows up near the very top of google searches and contains bad information is a serious here is your rubiks cube go fk yourself to the new players who are trying to find information about the game they are playing having a terribly or not at all maintained resource out there cannot be good for new player retention and even as a player with a few years under my belt i find it annoying and nearly worthless as i have to fact check everything i find in this wikiwould the csm please consider leaning on ccp to make some sort of effort at updating evelopedia when changes are implemented in the game or just get rid of the damn thingif i misunderstand how evelopedia works and it is supposed to be community updated then that is a failure of concept in the first place and should be addressedno matter what the case that site is not doing anyone any favors by giving outdated and false informationfor the love of bob please think of the new players
you can make edits to the wiki right
that is what im not sure about which is why i mentioned that i didnt know if it was supposed to be community maintainedthe point is that it is not maintained appears to be a ccp product and not everyone understands the wiki process so either an effort should be made to maintain it or it should go away bad info is worse than no infoand seriously it wouldnt take much more time than writing a devblog for ccp to edit changes considering that there is no manual for this game that site is the closest thing we have and its in really bad shapemaybe i should push for a community effort to get it cleaned up dunnoalso it would need active community participation on a constant basis to ensure that what is being edited or added is actually correct you know this community as well as i do and im sure you can see the possible train wrecks in allowing players to maintain it
again you are able to make changes to the evelopedia yourself find the entries you know stuff about and change them not difficult at all
you can edit many pages within the wikiso you should use your frustrations to correct faults that you find start fixing the wiki then come back and say hey csm im fixing this wiki all by myself its a big job and id like some help people will listen to you that way dont cry about a problem youre not willing to have a part in fixing
has ccp games discussed this new plan of theirs with the csm source
my guess is yes they have seeing as the majority of csm members in that thread so far are against itin fact isnt it all of them so fardestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
joffyim glad to see someone from low sec runningyou mention a few things about faction war there have been 2 things that players pushed for and ccp said they would do years ago to encourage pvp in faction war plexes but they never did those 2 things are timer rollbacks and better intel tools so we can defend plexes preferably the latter would be some sort of intel tool that would allow faction war pilots to have real time intel on where plexes are being taken so they can go defend the plex before the timer expires here is a post that discusses this a bit more in detail
hello cearainim glad you came with constructive feedbackive lived in factional space the last 2 years as a pirate shooting everybody so im aware of all those farmers and i want to somehow make it better to fight for your plex than run away whether its timer rollbacks or rewarding pvp more something has to be doneim a bit unsure about the intel thing because if it will be tied to notifications every guy in fw will be spammed to hell and back it will not be much else than annoyingif you got time one of the upcoming days feel free to convo me ingame id love to hear more ideas and feedbackjoffy aulxgao
thanks for the response joffy i think the intel may have been through the use of the map as opposed to notifications i dont really care how they do it if people wanted to turn off or filter the notifications to be within a certain jump range that would solve the problem of spam imo it doesnt matter how they deliver the intel i certainly agree not everyone in faction war would use this intel but those who like to fight for sov definitely would imo ccp needs to follow through with their promises on both of these measures so rabbit plexing can be constrained that is the key to making fighting for sov fun and i strongly suspect eve would do much better if there were some fun sov wars to fight in as opposed to just random pvp giving people rewards for pvp in an unexploitable way is unlikely to change much but it wouldnt hurt im happy to talk about all sorts of faction war proposals and topics but imo most of them wont change very much the two proposals i mentioned are the most important proposals to change fw sov warfare from the fightless alt grind it currently is i would be interested in knowing if ccp still would like fw sov to be won by pvp or if they are happy with the current alt rabbit plexing system they seemed pretty content from the csm x minutes btw the top 3 vp gainers for faction war in the last week are1 orn lorn2 monkblack fast3 xfleuryxi cant post killboard links but feel free to look these guys killboards up yourself vp is gained when you complete a faction war plex it will either increase the amount the system is contested if you run offensive plexes or it will decrease the contested level if it is a defensive plex so these warriors did the most to help contest or uncontest systems for their faction is that the visioni get the stats here
well its a wiki
sup joffy you have my votes
option nr 2 please
silver dagger kondurthank you very much for posting your support to this proposal option 2 is definitely the bestdmc
i think you mean get people to stayi played a long time ago took time off came back and now im done for goodand this is why there is nothing interesting to do that doesnt involve getting messed with by jerksive watched pirates camp markethub stations with only two cruisersthis is literally the only game i can play for 50 hours in a week and make no meaningful advancement at all and thats why eve is losing players and thats why ive no cancelled my three accounts for most players its a huge learning curve leading to a miserable experienceo7goodbye
time for another massprotest after incarna greed is good debalce ccp games still has not learned the lesson source
i fail to see why a proposed idea is reason to start pitchforking and acting like spoiled babbies
ccp just needs to admit that the recent changes are a failure just like the incarna expansion was i mean give us a reason to log on this winter roll back the phoebe jump changes bring back dominion sov let us slug it out all winter while they figure out something better but please lets stop the lunacy of the current mechanics dominion sov wasnt perfect and yes it was ridiculous that a fleet could travel from one end of eve to the other in minutes but it was fun    not tedious boring mindnumbing work
uhm no it wasnt fun and yes it was tedious boring mindnumbing work
its like ccp arbitrarily giving one nullsec corp double bounties and double income from moon mining if one faction has twice as much isk as everyone else they can afford the better ships and they will get more members etc and everyone else in the game would be up in arms might not be deliberate policy but the reslut is the same caldari at a big disadvantage because of the lp store something entirely out of their control
while the analysis is globally correct you forgot to include a few fact galcal is twice the population of minamarr been that way for what 34 years caldari has been t1zoned for what 13 year at least and no the occasional t2 was not that frequent which explain the crappy lp values sadly minmatar ships are a pile of crap because autocannons have low dps compared to blasters and worse damage application than pulse and close range missiles also artillery are way to hard to fit with a decent combat fit the problem is most likely no the ships by themselves but because of the weapon system they use also vni is indeed op versatile can be tanked as the vexor with active shieldarmor passive shieldarmorhull fits and best of all the fact that it can deal bslvl dps which is the reason why its used as a farming ship in null and also the fact that it is included in lots of doctrine as both a damage dealing and antisupport cruiseryou may ask why not just fix it by downgrading the dps capabilities well by doing so youd end up with a vexor it is actually not possible to balance the vni because it would mean making a vexor or a totally different ship which is also not going to happenalso on a side note day four of the csm contained things about fw missions going to be rebalanced which means it will become easy to farm crapload of gallente fw lps behold vnis everywhere is comingare you speaking about goons regions before the moon rebalance also mordus angel or soe stations not sure which ones in goon space have preferential lp stores while they dont earn twice the lps they still do pay twice less
no because that isnt arbitrary goons can fight for high value moonsmore valuable null space in fw we have absolutely no control over the crap ccp put in our lp stores its more like ccp giving goons a global 100 buff to all incomealso lp prices go up the lower the tier your in which is kind of the whole point of this thread so if you were right that caldari have been stuck in t1 while gallente are in t3 which isnt true then caldari lp should be worth several times as much as gallente but the opposite is true the fact you have consistently been flooding your market with far more lp than us and getting higher lp prices means the lp store is not balanced  its completely bustedbut you make a good point on the size of the warzones twice as many pilots should mean twice as much sales so the problem is not that gallente should be getting less but rather that caldari should be getting more if you really wanted content if you really wanted an enemy that could afford to fight back you would put your role playing to one side for a moment and support this
hello friendsi hereby announce my candidacy for csm xi last year i ran for csm x  i didnt make i did however end up 22nd out of the 76 candidates which was an amazing accomplishment this has only encouraged me further as i know that i can make great contributions to the csm and that is why im running again for csm xiwho am imy ingame name is bobmon i have been the ceo of evenews24com for 2 years nowi started playing eve online in 2010 following an introduction by a couple of my friends who had their own dutch corporation this corporation was part of an alliance that had an active war going on at the time i joined i was a brand new player and back then you couldnt really get involved with pvp so i decided to make a new alt fly over to the location of our enemy and see what they were up to after a bit of chatting i got to know them and they asked me to join i then began relaying intel to my friends and so im very proud to say that my first task in eve online was to be a spyfrom those humble beginnings i have progressed in my eve career and experienced many aspects of gameplay includingall of these aspects have taught me a lot about the game and the players who play it and i think that they will help me a lot as a potential csm member focusi think the most important job of a csm member is to be a bridge between ccp and players players are the ones playing and can help ccp discover problems with eve online that need to be solved eve online is in a state where a lot of new features are being released and so its exciting to see what the future holds for us the players my focus will bethese are not points i will purely focus on i will deal with whatever is necessary however i do think that the above points are very important for the future of eve onlinedo you have any points that you find important please contact me details will be at the bottomwhy do i want to join the csmover my years of being active in the eve online community ive come to the conclusion many times that im deeply in love with our community this is a key reason to why ive always kept playing eve online and it has often put me in a position where i had to explain to my rl friends why im so passionate about the gamewhile being active ive also been in a ton of game related discussions and through my work at en24 ive been in contact with a lot of different types of players from the best fcs to the pilot who can barely fly his retriever in highsec iUFFFDve spoken with those players a lot and iUFFFDve learned about their ideas or concernsthis is my ultimate drive to be a csm member i feel that sometimes changes are made to affect bigger groups of players to the detriment of the lone members i would like to represent those individual players and make the game more beautiful for them and everybodyways to get to know me better1 feel free to ask me questions in this forum thread2 check out my twitter3 check out my past articles4 check out bobs corner where i talk about stuff that interests me5 feel free to mail me at bobmonevegmailcom if you want to talk6 watch my fanfest presentation7 watch me on the meta show

bobmon for presidenthuzzah d
this is what i said last time and nothing has changed i believe that bobmon will be bringing some fresh air to the csm he will also be able to improve the overall communication abilities of the csmwill vote for bobmon
good dedicated guy with the knowledge needed would vote for
to add a little detail on that 22ndits more complicated than that there are people who ended up closer that bobmon would get in in front of if other people were to leave the csmfor example xenuria came in something like 18th but requires many more people to drop out before he stands a chance to get in this is because he doesnt have many votes cascading down to him from other candidates bobmon had better support that waythis isnt an endorsement of anyone just a little clarification on the process
thanks for the clarification
ill be voting for bobmon with all my accounts you should too hes passionate about the game and hell put in tons of underappreciated unpaid work for the community and ccp

thanks for reading joffy i would be happy to talk about any of the faction war mechanics in the meantime have a great vacation make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
counterpointi have heard many many many people express their approval of the new sov mechanics not everyone thinks it is badremember we mostly only hear from the upset people in this game
this is the new sov learn to accept it or dont log on it isnt going away
that right there pretty much sums up the crying
well no  sherlock i was unclear as to whether or not this was a communityeditable wiki and where did i say that i wasnt willing to take part in it quite the assumption there asshatmy second point is that a communityeditable wiki with no oversight is bound to get filled with troll entries if its ccps then they should do something to try to ensure its accuracy otherwise it is unreliable i could trolledit the whole damn thing and nobody would notice
then go do that the wiki is filled with outdated information not malicious information thats evidence that despite people being able to troll the wiki they still dontif its a community updated wiki its up to the community to ensure its updated it wouldnt be the responsibility of the csm or ccp to do that
well im of the opinion that there should be something like this that is ccps responsibility as there is no manual for this game there needs to be some info that is kept current is accurate and is not susceptible to trolling anyway as i push that idea ill see if i cant get some community effort behind the illconceived site that we have
closed
i am certain that bobmon would be a good voice of the people in the csm 1
from working with bobmon for well over a year i can attest that he both values and listens to the community and his colleagues has a great love for the game and supports it with the help he gives organizing events and giving exposure after the somewhat troubled run of csm x it will be good to see a csm member who has his ear out not just for a tiny segment of the community or hisher interests but the greater eve community and bobmon is that personthus i am fully supporting his run to csm and hope he gets elected consider this my endorsement
bobmon is enthusiastic and an asset to the eve community he does however drink chocolate milk instead of beer on the sunday of evesterdam despite this i will be supporting his run
its the best cure for a hangover
goodchap in or out of game met the man and he stands for what he thinks is right got my vote d
have you got 2 minutes1
1 will be the top of my vote list
how about 2 hours
loves dck jokeswill make an awesome csm representative  both for his experience and his point of view will not bullshit what he doesnt know but will aspire to understand everything to the best of his abilities is always considering how to make his alliance better and i have no doubt he will bring the same enthusiasm to a more global rolealways has 2 minutes for anyone that asks could not recommend a single person more
fixing and maintaining evelopedia might be useful for retaining new players and making this less of a rubiks cube for them
its true that there needs to be a reason for new players to stayi have seen fairly high retention rates of my own referrals but mainly because a lot of them specifically join the game and train to sign up for wingspan corporationsif media personalities were to act as ads for eve they would most likely need to helm corps to capitalize on their fame and retain players who want to fly with senpaii have tried to convince some of my youtuber fans with decent followings to play eve but have not been successful they see it as a niche game they wont make money on with youtubetwitch monetization i would like to be able to tell them theyll make money with the eve affiliates program but the program website is in shambles so good luck selling anyone on that
no member of the game we love deserves my support more then bob you have my sword and my support i can only hope you dont burn out and quit all of the dirt players will be voting for bob thanks for your efforts in making this world of eve a better place black
bobbob gets my vote 100having had the pleasure of sharing a beer  police on a horse  also an ambulance what a guy and a close call with a canal i can honestly say you need this capatain to represent your views and opinions in our beloved space pixel universealso the fedo must have better representation and you should add this to your commitments for csm 11
dominion sov was not perfect and sov grinding sucked agreed but the fights made it worth it imobeing that ccp has changed the sov system multiple times over the course of the game thats ridiculous to say it isnt going away maybe it wont go away today or tomorrow but eventually it will the question is how soon will it go away for all of the complaints regarding dominion sov it was hugely successful people have turned to the forums myself included because we enjoy the game unsubbing or not logging on should be a last resorttrue UFFFDupset peopleUFFFD are most likely to fill out surveys or provide feedback complain while i am sure not everyone thinks it is bad judging by the threadnaught this has turned into the dwindling subsactives etc i would say not enough people think it is a good idea or find it an enjoyable way to play o7deeebo
after knowing bobmon for 4 years i can say that he is able to get a job done his aspirations to become csm are made very clear to me and other at how hard he is trying by working in the community already en24 has been a great source of news to keep informed with current affairs in eve and i believe this kind of hard work is what the csm needs not people who will flake out after achieving the title bobmon can only contribute good ideas at a time when i believe eve needs them most
im gay
so for those who dont know this happened during the assault on akidagi dust514 mercs had an effect on the overall conquer percentage and managed to invul the ihub mid fight now im personally tickled pink that we dust mercs had an effect on the eve world that was totally tangible however uanurendark from reddit and others voiced some valid complaints about the system in generalthey mentioned that such effects feel like rng due to the nature of how dust514 fw works we cant decide on where we want to fight we just get sent places however where we get sent depends on system activity so we normally end up in that system if enough is going on the big problem is that we cant control it its all a matter of whimi have posted something similar to the dust514 cpm as well from what i gathered in the reddit thread everyone was happy that dust514 got involved with the fight albeit in a rather frustrating wayi would like to ask the csm to work with ccp on making fw easier to coordinate with both sides we want to be able to choose to attack or defend where the militia needs help we want to work together with the militias to be able to systematically push our influence farther to couple that uspikeinlocal a member of pfr also had something to say on the matter summed up he wanted a tab or menu so that both sides could see dust514 district activity so that they knew where to go for bonuses or lp opening up more room for content as both sides race to grab these benefits in summary for a game that is all about player content and freedom we cant believe that such an important choice is left out of the players control we want to be able to coordinate with capsuleers and fight with them capsuleers also want to make finding and helping dust mercenaries easier as well we want to help you guys out in space all we need are the tools to do so thanks for your time
1 this could use some visibility
1in akidagi we had a hint of how good dusteve interaction could be while we had a dust player on our comms with us he was so excited with every ob that came in and was really calling for them saying things about how they were getting torn up down th
that sounds awfully like bullying tbh
1 bobmon in csm should at the very least prove to be interesting
good luck in your campaign bob youd make a great csm and i hope you succeed
bobby has my vote as well he has a good head on his shoulders and cares deeply for the game and us the players
last week i had the pleasure of having a short conversation with joffy on slack i had first heard of him at eve la when lantana grey and lanctharus were discussing his candidacy joffy is extremely articulate and thoughtful and is willing to listen to other view points that conflict with his own my only worry is that he will have a difficult time getting his voice heard during remote calls at the csm summits ive heard this voiced by a few other people that ive talked to joffy can you address this founder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
hello bebop i admit it might be a bit difficult but ill contact other csm members and see how they have done it so i can overcome issues before i get inill write again when ive more information

yes absolutely weve actually been asking ccp for a mechanic to choose battle locations for players who pledge loyalty to a faction for years at this pointthe old corp battle system that existed before planetary conquest was released actually listed every single faction warfare district and allowed the corporation creating the battle to choose from any of them as soon as that was done that battle would show up to all directors of every other corporation and they could jump on as the defenderthe mechanics to allow location selection were actually in the game back when it was on singularity they only need to bring them back such that we can work better with eve players to fight over systemsrattati senpai noticed us see you in the next fps
1it would mean i dont have to jump around so much just to drop obs
1i dont do fw but this seems really obvious as a thing that should be
there is actually a fairly simple fix to mitigate the rng issue which would avoid to make your 50 man fleet wait at the ihub because some random dust match changed the system vulnerability even if you have a dust team matches are still fairly random from eve perspective since a matchmaker is generating them your team might not get picked for examplecurrently dust influence changes the total vp needed to make the system vulnerable the proposed fix would keep the total vp needed fixed but change how much each plex contributes to the vp pool based on dust influence once a system is vulnerable it would stay vulnerable until someone flips it or deplexes  no surprises at the ihub the overall dust influence would be still identical to the current implementation and would influence how fast you can flip a system just like it does now
i would like to see more tangible links between eve and dust i am not quite sure how but growing dust 514s player base may be a good startmore playersmore content and i do not think ccp have done a great service to dust in this regard i love when the dust modifier is in my favor but i would like to see maybe a little recap of battles that happened to give me that modifier something more than a notification and a little number in the upper left hand part of my screenagain i dont have the fixes but i know ccp is smart and good at creating good games they can think of something
dust side at least got a responsehopefully we can see some progress towards this in the future
been wanting this for years
the beacon in space for a district should become visible when a battle is taking place not only when someone warps there
according to multiple sources within cpm 1 including soraya xel who said as much publicly eve devs pretty much dont care about dust integration some of this is due to perceived personal bias some of this is because for a long time doing anything to support dust was considered lost development time as they figured the game was dying spoiler its not going anywhere and some of it i imagine is simply because they dont know if theres any legitimate interest coming from the majority of eve playerscsmi hope there is enough pull to show them the error of their ways on this particular topic
at last the details of my campaigns platform have been published scroll up

having spent much time with erikayumene in the broadcast4reps channel i can say she has my vote
as an industrial candidate youre going to get a lot of loud voices in your corner that essentially want to make mining safer for them how do you balance gaining the support of the people you want to represent vs avoiding the trap of wanting to make eve too safe or do you feel that the safety first industrialists are a mostly small but vocal minority you can afford to ignore
like everything in eve there should always be risks what id like to see if more options for industrial ships for instance because of how vulnerable they are with not really being able to have real way to fight backso one of my thoughts is this taking the skifprocurer for instance the ships that is made to withstand damage and take a beating have an extra high slot to be able to fit something that would allow it to fight back in a sense you would not be able to fit another mining laser on this slot it wouldnt be something that would be on the ship so you would have to choose basically make the choose between that extra high slot or use another mining ship for more yieldore hold so in this example you can basically fit a cap drainer for instanceso i dont feel that this would be something that would made eve make safer in the sense youre referring to taking out risks involved in my example its more to give more options i bring up mining ships in this example because well they are easy targets i think it is finding that right balance but i dont think that it should be no risks involved risks is one of the things that make eve what it isso adding more options is what i would like to see hope that answers your question
considering the extremely effective damage application from drones why would a proc or skiff need a turretfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
she said nothing about them getting a turret
exactly zerinia thank you i did not say it was a turret slot and it shouldnt be
if youre a cfc endorsed candidate this whole thread is more of a formality for you than anything but in any case id like to know how you would differentiate yourself from other cfc csms or if you will just echo the party line what is unique about you compared to your peers
what would you want to see changed about whsi canUFFFDt say i would want to jump in and tackle major changes right off the bat there is many changes and adjusts ccp is already in the works with and plenty of suggestions hitting the table daily there is also a large player base in wormholes nullsec and high sec that each change impacts my focus would be as csm to find out how change choices would impact different areas and then present the information from player concerns to the table representation of players is my focus on issues and working with ccp to address player base concernsdo you have the time it takes with a full time job and alltime is always going to be an issue with any csm or representative i would make time to do the job and to do it well and what is it that you think you would be better than the current csms thats representing the wh communitythis is a great question there are many people that are out there that would make a good csm i think i would be a good csm because like i said above iUFFFDve played eve since release my professional path is much in tune with the game and have a flare for fantasy desiring this game to excel for player experience
thank youx
i admit to having and interesting writing style if you have a direct request or concern ask and i will address it thanksx
i was asked UFFFDwhat is something that could benefit newer players coming to the gameUFFFDsome are salivating at the prospect of new noobsandwiches hitting space to prey upon for a new corpse in the corpse locker though i think like many we would prefer for a good fight out there in space growing player base numbersmore out there to spar with and stronger game economies there is a need for the retention of new players it starts with not bringing the bar to the new player but bringing new players to the eve online excellence bar the biggest complaint i have ran into regarding this is the learning curve for a fresh player that has never seen the game they hit the ship make a toon and start being thrown through out space the as they fly they experience multiple pop ups and notifications as they attempt their first flight i understand we have a current system but i think it could be updated a bit to be a little more fresh pilot friendly not only would this address new player to game but to corps provides an information source and training source for all areas of spacemy thoughts are a flight simulator in station youUFFFDre already able to walk around as a character which would be awesome if you could have player stations and ships with space barpubsloungesUFFFD i digress and get back to the point the game is based on advanced technology so why not use it tutorial systems that go through step performance in flying mining and game dynamics have it searchable and drop downed in a friendly format that newer pilots can adhere to it could be built upon the current information provided out there and would be using much of what is already in place taking that current information and putting in a simple and direct delivery system quick simulator tutorial as it end the snap back to the listing and can read more in depth simulator also allows for the ability to demo ship systems and target training for people trying to figure out what they want to train for the looming questions for many new players areUFFFDwhat style of ship should i flywhat professions are out therewill it fit my play stylewhat happens if i devote all this time into one and find out i donUFFFDt like itwhat is a cap chainhow do iUFFFDinsert the many possibilitiessimulator also opens the door for training benefits and educating players and pilots in all areas veteran corps and players could use it to train pilots one the challenges each corp faces is taking in a corp member and getting them to mesh as a good combat pilot some pilots that have been here for a while might want a new avenue to train towards the ability to jump in and try a couple logi mission to see if it is a good fit goldenthis just my 2 isk worth and one idea i would throw on the table of possibilities i would love to discuss with both ccp and open forum of pilotsthanks x
you claim you want to help newer players what experience do you have doing sofounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
can you clarify something somethingfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
i talked with rattati today in the skype chat apparently they are both discussing changes to fw not sure what changes but he definitely looked at the thread when i asked him too i hope they consider these changes as for the underlined that is the point of these threads if eve and dust want a better link we need to let them know about it
i am not sure if you want me to compare my experience with members of csm x even if they may or may not run next year or only with the ones that are currently campaigning for csm xithis said i started playing the game in 2009 and outside of a six months long lull i have played regularly with one account first then three when i chose to live solo in a wh and now with five accountsi once have been part of large alliances and lived in null sec for around 2 years then left the sov holding coalitions when b0tlrd accords were signed i also lived for around two years in wormholes mostly solo living off sleeper sites hunting in null sec and wh space and performing pi i have built my first capital myself participated to multiple fleets small and large and have contributed to faction warfare in low sec i have been mostly flying subcaps so far and these days i like traveling light and pvping all across new eden nearly half of my playing time has been spent as a mostly solo playerthis is overall my ingame experienceout of game i used to be an it project manager and now own and manage my own business eve online is my main hobby i could be building and flying rc models but i chose to fly internet spaceships in an exciting and challenging virtual science fiction universe
well i think drones already fulfill that role mining ships arent suppose to be able to really fight back to any serious degreeor else theyd just be combat ships a few of the mining ships can also become extremely tanky and can be fit to even solo frigates and destroyers in fact since some mining ships are as tanky as they are you generally need to attack with several ships before the enemy forms up a reactionary fleet and kills youright now you havent really given a fulfilling answer something should be done according to you but you arent giving me any sort of scale should mining ships be able to fight off a pirate cruiser if not a turret then should it be a missile system what would you see as fair
no they shouldnt be able to fight off a pirate cruiser unless some reason the pilot flying it just fails maybe fight back isnt the right term to use here maybe a counter would be the better term cant find the right term im looking for  anyways that extra slot would not be a turret launcher or anything like that itd just be a generic high slot to use it also would not be used on all the mining ships i think that would be too much there its why i only mentioned skiffs and procurers
a counter like a cyno oralso as an avid blueprint collector i noticed you are missing a triage bpo i happen to have a highly researched one blink twice if you can be bribed
i can always be bribed when it comes to a bpo that im missing   stares at blue paper
as for a cyno counter erm i didnt really consider a cyno i was looking at other modules that could be put there like a normal cloak cap neut a drone augmenter and so on theres a lot of options what that slot can be used forand yea as i said before about the bpo i can always be bribed 
as of right now i can only reply to this in one way if there is a cfc party line i dont know itall of the ideas that i have both published in this thread as well as those which i publish in my weekly column are my own the short version is that i believe that sov warfare should be asymmetric and engaging with most of the options coming purely from player agency rather than a predefined you must do x y and z to contest this system the same theme of player agency stems into my other beliefs which are primarily that the upcoming structure and capital changes should give individual players a lower barrier towards group action as of right now it is very difficult for small groups to create an organization worth a damn and a greater suite of ingame tools offered by the new structures as well as applying some of what is available at the corp level to the alliance level would allow for much easier collective organization by those who cant afford out of game websites teamspeak servers etc if you want to know more you should consider reading some of my weekly tmc columns which are linked in my op
fair answer can you expand upon what you mean by asymmetric and engaging
to expound upon it a bit imagine a game of capture the flag in halo 3 i pull an example from my own youth simply due to nostalgia this can be applied to so many other games obviouslyin a game of capture the flag you can play on a couple dozen or so different maps each with different terrain some are asymmetric some symmetric in terms of their physical terrain the asymmetric ones tend to favor the defender giving more defensive tools to the defensive side and more offensive tools to the offensive side the symmetric ones offer equal quantities to both but thats just the terrain of the map currently we cant even begin to get into that as the closest we have to terrain are fundamental things like wh effects and constellation layout so lets address that laterthere is another layer of asymmetry vs symmetry which is much more prevalent the number of options you have for how to capture that flag and return it to your base in halo if i want to capture the flag from the other team i have a huge number of options i can opt to run and gun my way in in which case i will run into a greater number of defenders and die i can group up with a bunch of others and turn it into a bloodbath halfway down the map i can sneak in the side door and make a break for it i can grab a powerful weapon like a rocket launcher and blow apart a group standing in my way i can take a land or air vehicle laying down cover fire or using it to quickly get in and out on the most fundamental of levels eves terrain is inflexible and there are limited numbers of options but on a broader scale with the number of ways to catch that flag you have only one you entosis the node until it goes into ref and then you contest the node in warfare throughout the constellation the fights change of course but not by much considering that there are a few select optimal ways to do this that people who are better at military tactics than i am can explain this means that sov warfare is fundamentally not particularly asymmetric as you are only afforded a limited number of options for core gameplay sure on the more surface scale of fleets and fleet fights you have a broader scale but there is a limit to the number of options available at the core no physical mechanics that i can use to undermine the defenders adms or weaken their infrastructure beyond force them to stop ratting and blow up their ihubs nothing i can do to screw with the attackers its this asymmetry and the sheer number of different ways that you can capture the flag in halo that makes it so much damn fun while fozziesov is an improvement it lacks that true variety that makes no two ctf matches in halo be exactly the same so what im saying is that less symmetry and more opportunities for play vs counterplay would make eves sov warfare much more engaging  even something as simple as you can entosis the sov structures to capture them or shoot them with dps to destroy them something i recommended in this column would make it more interesting just because it creates more options for attackers and defenders hope that helps
to go along with that it would be nice to have a possibility to actually raid the enemy for their things perhaps any minerals you mine have to go through a deployable structure before getting to your in station hangerdo you believe the csm is a passive reactionary group for ccp to bounce ideas off of an active initiative taking group that is there to suggest ideas based on their player experience maybe a little bit of both how do you view your role
it would be an interesting idea yes theres a lot to be said for stuff like that nullarbor talked a lot about asset safety at eve vegas and we had a lot of conversations at the round table about the appropriate amounts of asset safety with new structures i would have to say that it should be the latter passive reactionary groups are not hard to come by  thats what we have things like public critique of devblogs and sisi for in my honest opinion the csm should be a proactive group of different people from different backgrounds who have proven that they can both propose innovative ideas for the future of the game and directly critique ccps ideas before they even hit the devblog stage and do so in a way that actually encourages us to be trusted as qualified individuals with a vested interest in the game rather than promoting the interests of a specific alliance these reasons are why i stay explicitly neutral when i write my columns  it would be very easy to write or spin them in a way that only proposes ideas that benefit my alliance but thats not what im about  im about creating changes that are good for the game as a whole not solely good for one group of people
really good answers ive done this sort of critique thing for a few years now and this is one of the better ones most people give such half assed answerswho do you agreedisagree with on the current csm
i appreciate the positive feedback  ive put a lot of thought into my answers and am determined to be critiqued based on my ideas not the fact that i am a cfc candidate as far as the csm agreementdisagreement i could write a lot about that but its currently 4 am in my tz i shall leave this comment here for now and edit with an update expressing my opinion after a good nights sleep
there are just so many good ideasi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
low skill point base for new players a major hurdle i know old dead horse here maybe an injection of more skill points over a period of say 5 months an injection of 2 mil skill points each month for 5 months under the condition the account is continuously subbed by traditional billing methods and not plex to cut down on alt farms this would allow both income for ccp and an incentive for new players to give eve a real trytv advertisement would be a good way to generate more players i do not recall ever seeing an eve commercial on tv here in the us
oh rattati has been all for itunfortunately its the eve devs you gota win over 
hence why this thread was made ccp listens to the csm more than the dust department
i believe the depletion of moon resources would not be such a bad idea for the reasons mentioned the rotation of moon resources around various planets would do 2 things i think1 generate more conflict2 possibly shift control of rare resources the smaller corpsallianceswhat i do not get is why everyone is scared of such a rise in prices i do not moon mine so would only effect me as a consumer it would make it similar to pi where you have to move the extractor heads around as resources deplete on a planet except on a regional scale rather than a planetary scale i do not see where the problem with the cost of moon goo going up which would increase the cost of t2 ships which i fly a lot of there are so many ways to make isk in the game and lots of it why not have a way to spend it too
ive flown with joffy a couple times when i used to live out in placid great guy who actually dropped what he was doing to come help a couple of my pilots with some trouble we were having definitely got my vote matei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
oh awesome nashh is running for csm dtheres very few people as passionate or invested in the eve community as nashh is and id totally vote for him on the csm
a compelling case ill see if there is anything i can do though i dont know much about faction warfare
whyever notin a previous thread in sm i enquired as to which lp store these might be obtained from and was informed that these were removed from the game after an unknown length of stay that would explain the collectors value of these things and the prices they command  in jita theyre going for about 200kunit which clearly puts them outside any sort of sane everyday usewhy not bring them back there are already faction variants of the other missiles of all types so why not these was there some rationalisation for their previous removalanyway would like to hear your thoughts 
ill be voting bobmon and ill be explaining why hes the best choice to all my space friendsto put it briefly hes got a pragmatic view of the game and from when i have spoken to him its clear he tries to see things from all sides but most importantly for the csm he is excessively active and incredibly committednice guy too despite being pl
bobmon will have my supportbob is a people person and has easily what it takes to communicate players feedback and ideas to the developer team hes young and enthusiastic but what he lacks in experience he makes up for in his energy and his capacity to take guidance from others ive experienced this first hand whilst hes been flying with me as part of rekkingcrew he definitely has a buzz for the game and its community i feel he would be a valuable addition to csm xi
hello bebopive talked with current csm member steve ronuken also known as fuzzysteve and he said that itll ofc be a bit annoying but as long as i butt in it should go ok  its no different than a business conference and ppl do that over the world remotelybut no matter what we need to remember that the summits is just a part of being elected on the csm its about discussing changes listening to player feedback and warning ccp if they do catastrophic things xd hopefully that doesnt happen ill also help motivate fellow csmers or devs if they feel down or sad we all have those moments and we can just as well admit itjoffy aulxgao
no there really isnt you want to hang out in a not real pub with not real beer and get not real drunk your playing second life not eve
yes there are you want to hang out in a not real spaceship with not real weapons and make not real kills you are playing already a kind of second lifeits called evewalking in stations is just one important part of making this game more versatile
