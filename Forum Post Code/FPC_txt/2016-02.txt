here is the csm watch interview with mr hyde113 aka mr hyde for the csm 11 electionenjoy
good luck with the campaign mr hyde ive always enjoyed your videos and im sure youll bring a interesting point of view to the table if youre elected on the battleship topic ive always liked the idea of ships having rigs or maybe a module for some sort of anti frigate weapons i guess im thinking about how navy carriers have miniguns on them like this before anyone jumps on me im not talking about an insta blap frigate weapon but something balanced to put a battleship into perspective against much smaller ships
this  
so you have no idea yet what you are actually going to do and to what end but you are confident that you can whip something up as soon as you are in
some people might think youre weird and theyre right you can be but i voted for you last year and also this year because you are also a smart dedicated player
another reason i wont be voting for youi made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
your reasons for voting are very petulant
as are yours for runningi made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
considering you run a media site and refer to yourself as a journalist im really not sure why youre even able to run no offence and all but it makes no sense
had a brief chat with bobmon and i endorse him for csm good luck mate i will be voting for you
yes i run evenews24com which is considered to be a media website however i have always looked at our site differently in my eyes the work i do for evenews24 is purely a extension of my hobby eve online i love to write about things that happen within eve online and i love to manage my team im not working for evenews24 to be this journalist im simply a player who likes to write stories hence why en24 is registered as a fansitei do understand the underlying concern that might be out there however i want too im already used to dealing with a same type as situations right now as that i might run into as a csm member im a member of pl and the feared rekkingcrew both organizations have a zero tolerance rule which means that you are removed from the alliance if you do anything that is considered leaking both pl and the rekkingcrew are heavily involved with daily events that happen within eve online and has also resulted in me running into situations were i knew something big but i couldnt write about it this is not a problem for me again im not here to become this known journalist im purely here to write about stories that interest me and not here to screw over my own fun in the game an example of this is the time when pl decided to sell brothers of tangra to xix and go back to a nomadic lifestyle this was a move that would later have a lot of impact with other alliances doing something similar as pl did this move was something that pl members including myself were told about long before it actually happened and still i didnt talkwrite about it
i passed the test  thanks bro
its not about whether or not you are likely to leak sion has already been in the csm and since hes not been kicked for leaking its safe to say thats not why hes been disallowed the point is that members of gaming media are not allowed to run one assumes because of the increased risks should a leak occur so the rule should be applied to all gaming media en24 isnt a simple blog or fansite it is a media site so theres no reason it should be exempt from those rules ccps acceptance of your campaign reeks of bias and inconsistency in the application of the rules and your election would only exacerbate that should you be elected it would be good form to push for more consistency during these processes going forward otherwise the integrity of the entire csm is undermined
en24 is not involved with any other games and there for seen as a fansite this was confirmed by ccp leeloo there was always a rule which disallowed other gaming company employees from running as csm so i see the rule change only as a smart update as it makes sence to not have other gaming media staff on a team which sees everything that happends internally feel free to poke me on slack if you want to talk about it even more
thank you for the opportunity 3
a few quick questions to rabble alliances first csm candidate 1 what do you think could make wars more interesting to non predator types and something worth engaging in obviously some people wont want to fight but i mean more groups like ours of which there are a few2 villainy is important for without it we cant have heros  but being a hero doesnt really pay the bills well what kind of incentives could be offered to players for playing the hero of highsec and killing those evil 10s3 troll question would my package fit into your corp
hello im new in eve and in circleoftwo but a lot of people say me than he is a great pilote and a good pilote he has my votevote the judge for csm
well ive only been in co2 for just over 4 months and since day 1 the judge has been nothing but helpful if there is ever anything i need clarified or need more information on the judge has been nothing but helpful same goes for whenever i have a problem he has always helped out with that he has been there since day 1 and i think that is something that is very important for a csm id also like to add that he is the kind of player that leads by example which is just another one of the judges many leadership traits i hope he wins because after all the hard work he puts into the alliance and its members if he applies that to the csm position as i know he will he deserves to be a csm
i believe csm is a bunch of corrupt sycophants and that the judge will fit right in as he comes from the evilest place on earth australia vote the judge to bring back poisonous wildlife to iceland 
i dont like eve in its current state i dont like the judge either but i heard his ideas so im going to support himvote the judge for csm xi
i endorse tora with all i got very few commit as much time to others content as this guy and i think thats the kind of guy i want on the csm the experience with empire space is also invaluablenow for the questions 1a do you feel it is possible to generate a meaningful experience in the war dec system past present or future to a newbronewbro corp if yes1b what do you feel would provide a meaningful experience with the wardec system to said newbros that would ideally help with player retention2 do you think emergent content is in a good place at the moment or could it use some help if yes what do you think needs help3 troll question are my glasses cool enough or do i need a monocle
thanksif there are only newbros probably not much but if you mix them with a few more experienced players then they can do a lot of damage in a war a thousand bee stings will still kill the lion biggest problem with bigger fleets is to actually get a fight but many for example merc alliances have customs offices or posses start shooting them and you will have a fight you do need to do your homework first and find them there should not be an easy here it is optioneffort and you shall be victorious and yes always have a monocle 
this is why i like tora for csm too is because he doesnt panda to would be supporters clearly leading in their questions 1
looking much better than last years campaign good luckwould it be correct to assume your main focus would be on wardec and highsec aggression mechanics
thanks yes those two but when you would ask my alts i also would like to be involved with the industry subjects with a bad industry youll have less affordable ships modules etc which will probably give you less good fights so if you want to pvp and have fun you also need to have a solid industry base balance its always about good balance
i have removed a couple of posts for the reasons listed above
thank the lord imagine if he pandered to pandas
bump
a great and knowledgeable person who will serve the csm well
i am announcing my candidacy for csm xi based on a hisec platform what makes me different from any other hisec candidate i am not a carebear i want to bring together and represent all forms of hisec content i want to represent the carebear the miner the station trader the newbro the incursion runner the relic runner the ganker the war target hunter some of these groups have little to no representation in csm alot of hisec players are independent and feel no sense of community to those who play differently then them how many incursion runners out there have stopped playing for a week just because marmites war decd them that week how many miners run to a station every time a code operative comes into local how many station traders get mad because someone crashed a market they were in i see all of this as content we all need each other without the miner code doesnt exist without the station trader how are prices kept in check if we do not have content or social interactions the game diesi do not represent a block i am not looking to change the way nullsec lowsec or wormholes function or operate i am here simply because after years of playing i am still blown away that hisec has virtually no sense of community what makes eve so great is the social aspects and the butterfly effect every time an incursion runner loses a vindi some indy guy who builds them makes a sale some kid who just bought his first t2 bpc gets to sell some t2 blasters etc etc as for the vindi pilot well he learns to appreciate what he has and now he has a reason to grind even more maybe he will get a scout alt or maybe he will start an intel channel and get people involved in it and get everyone more organized so less vindis will be lost then the ganker in turn will need to become even more dedicated and more organized if he wishes to score that next sweet kill people are what make eve great so lets play together any questions concerns suggestions or anything please send me a mail about me i have done a bit of everything i have been in nullsec blocs i have been in fw ive mined ive ganked miners i was a hisec mission runner for a while i lost an incursion fit vindi to verge of collapse back when vindis were actually expensive i started my own corp and know the pains of building something from nothing and as of late i have been station trading while deciding on what i would like to do next
i am a little confused why you say there is no sense of community clearly there are sometimes even large communities of players that have appeared in highsec i am referring to incursions communities hauling and trade channels ganking and antiganking groups and so forth do you think there should be a single unifying community where everyone who lives in highsec should identify with if so what form would you envision this to take and how would you go about bringing such a community into existencei will also take this opportunity to ask some more specific questions what are you thoughts on the current state of incursions do you think the current reward is balanced for the amount of effort and risk that they require and what are your thoughts on the new drifter incursions do you think they should replace the sansha incursions in highsec or continue to live along side them
reserved for amendments mail me ingame or leave a post with your thoughtskilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better
i heard about holey long before starting eve his stats are immaculate over 1 trillion in isk killed theres been some obvious drama surrounding him but he seems to know the gamei like your ideas and you have my vote i would love to see eve have a revival in numbers ccps subscription information should tell the story and give us some clues
reserved for retrospective analysis
ah a carebear at heartits like a tea party but for alts
you make some um ideasthough im not sure if this is a real campaign for csm or its like the time code went to the at to gank ppl a lot of your ideas seem to only be relevant to the undock of a trade hub and i dont think that speaks for the majority of other eve players also cheaper war declarations most players who actually start and fight wars would agree 50500mil to start a war is nothingi fear that a vote for holeysheet1 would result in a wall being built around all the trade hubs not allowing any outsiders in unless like holey himself you already have a jump clone in all the hubs to avoid moving through those things we all call star gates that being said best of luck to you 
i think your analysis is incorrect i think you may be biased by rumours and fiction about me im an opportunist i am more interested in bringing in fresh players and bringing back some who left because of game changesboredometc my campaign is for the new player who wants to experience what i did 8 years agoa sense of excitement wonder and mysteryi look back at my industrial ventures and am proud i can pi and extract moon goo with the best of them i once made hexite i believe more players should have access to this income source hence the wish for rarity 8 and 16 moon stuff in high sec it isnt worth much after all even the reactions i do realize mining is integral in the eve economy so why not raise the price of veldspar for examplemissionslow sec and null pve could have some improvements in my opinion hence why i made mention of an interdiction nullified ship that has more than 400dps for pve applications more ded sites are needed for each faction to keep thing interesting i mean once youve done the maze a couple times it gets boring maybe make 23 sites for each level of ded rating per faction faction would be nicei like the old war deccing system i say we go back and analyze the worth of the new one i want new players to experience the heart pounding excitement that i did for a long time finally im not the only one who would like logistic mechanics put back the way they were retribution was a terrible patchhow many players did we lose on that onealso i do enjoy popping ships on the undock no excuses i also have no problem roaming or hanging out in my new house in uedama talk of walls is silly like i said youve been manipulated into believing things that just arent true thanks for the endorsement fellaedit  i read over my first post theres nothing about undock popping do you have some other motive herekilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better
no motives i was referring to 2 of your ideas a dock timer on logistics ships but no suspect flag except to the war target  seems like its an issue only on a stationare you saying that all neutral assistance should be removed from having a suspect timer everywhere or just on hubs with the addition to a dock timer as logistics are mainly used to rep poss and assist fleets and really should be open to attacked by anyone on grid if it is neutraldock timer on suspect ganknscoop haulers  also seems to be an issue for hubs but not really anywhere elsegankers go criminal not suspect so this is mainly for those who steal loot this happens everywhere in space so a docking penalty isnt really a big deal to can flippers mission loot thieves or anyone but those who do it on hubsjust wondering why you feel these specific issues need to be looked at over the same issues for the parts of hs that isnt on a station and what do think can be done for new and old players in terms of wars that is an issue only in hs i would like to hear your thoughts on the issues with the current wardec system and why i should vote for you
i liked events questions so much i thought i would go ahead and post my answers here event i hope this is okay1 please start by giving us a short introduction to who you are and your history within eve online include how long you have been playing and the groups you have been involved withiUFFFDve played eve online since beta i think iUFFFDm one of the last remaining UFFFDbrokenUFFFD characters that is in a ceo role iUFFFDve met a lot of folks from different groups but i am neutral since i love small groups my space profession thrives on neutrality 2 who would you consider to be your key constituents who you would best represent within the playerbaseeveryone neutrality means that i donUFFFDt have any agenda preference and i prefer the best solution for any problem 3 please summarise your platform preferably using key bullet pointsthe noplatform platform is not a reform platform but a return to the intent of the csm the csm was developed to keep ccp in check not to push changes that only certain groups want4 why have you decided to run for csm this yearit was time it seems that every year there is a controversy with the csm changes also donUFFFDt seem to happen as they should and it seems like the csm is more of a token piece than what it was originally intended if ccp is simply going to use a single playerUFFFDs idea without consulting the csm why have it at all 5 have you run for or been a member of csm in the past if so please list each year and if you were elected never have 6 what makes you a unique representative when you compare yourself to other candidates i think my platform is rather unique iUFFFDm an older player that has seen a little bit of everything and because i am neutral does not mean that i donUFFFDt have strong opinions or that i am oblivious to the politics 7 do you have any out of game experience and skills that make you a good candidateiUFFFDm technical and i have project management experience for the csm role i think the project management experience is critical8 what areas of eve are you weakest at knowledge wiseevery single area if you think you know eve there is always something new to learn referencing question 7 part of my technical expertise is problemincident simulation testing ie recreation of a issue or as i call it building a puzzle if i run across something that i need to know in eve i usually test it on the test server 9 if you were offered unlimited development time  whats the biggest change you would lobby for in eveiUFFFDm not a developer and it is very hard to say i think the changes need to be linked so itUFFFDs really a design thing rather than a developer thing best example would be the jump changes in my mind it made more sense to increase fuel costs rather than add incremental timers why increased fuel costs meant that miners would need to mine more creating more targets for pvper all professions would receive a boost and the cost of the fuel would normalize as long as miners were able to provide product that would ultimately leave power projection in the players hands because opposing forces could embargo fuel or send small teams to hunt miners i believe that all sectors of eve are linked and it is bad design to change something in one single area high sec players often lack excitement due to this and if high sec changes are made nullsec players are often gripey make changes fit everyone because this is a single universe the economy as it sits is a brilliant control if used properly 10 if you could wind back the clock  what feature or change would you remove from evewarp to zero change and mines i miss mines 11 if you could pick one candidate to be elected with you who would they be and whyiUFFFDm not sure on this the large blocs usually send good folk but they see problems that smaller groups donUFFFDt iUFFFDve always been fond of sugar kyle 12 what is your favorite memory in eve and whya client contracted me to evacuate their assets from delve it required two freighters two jump freighters two orcas and about 10 characters staging for the job took at least two days and the owner of the assets was very antsy since his stuff had been trapped for a while it started out as standard run until my jump freighters hit lowsec on the return and a small gang of battleships caught me on a undock i thought for sure that i was going to die and lose the assets but i made it through i had to wait them out for a while but my pulse was pounding like nothing else13 what platforms do you use currently to engage with the wider player base if someone wanted to contact you what is the best way to do this include twitteremailsskypeslack etciUFFFDm still playing with this and it will probably be why my campaign fails iUFFFDm not extremely social because itUFFFDs hard to be neutral when you spend a lot of time around other eve players human psychology means classifying people into buckets and i just want to be nice and outside of someoneUFFFDs bucket i have opinions and these shouldnUFFFDt be drawn into the wider metagame but simply considered eve players are passionate and sometimes extreme in their views iUFFFDm mindful of this fact14 if people wanted to find out more about your platform  where is the best place to do so include blogs forums posts and podcastsmy csm campaign thread ask me anything within reason
15 in short  what is your closing statement no more than 500 words pleasei really want the chance to represent all of you iUFFFDve met some brilliant minds over the years but i think the spirit of the csm has been corrupted and it needs to return to what it is a council i donUFFFDt have the answers i donUFFFDt have any way to force ccp to do anything or even a way to reform the council all i can do is change my approach make it different than the other approaches and hope that it adds value i will need at least four players to help me each of the four will represent their respective areas of highsec nullsec lowsec and wormhole space these players will farm bugs and issues i plan to use trello to track each issue and i plan to issue a report on what i will take to council each reported issue must have the problem described and a possible solution if there is a change that affects multiple groups each group can have a potential solution and the csm can bring it up to ccp iUFFFDm not tied to any problem or solution iUFFFDm your advocate i hate campaign promises and they always go wrong but this is my single promise if you bring me the issues i will take them with me no matter who you are or where you are from thank you
this would only indicate you do not like any of the candidateshow could you indicate your disaproval of the system as such
voting for a candidate with a plausible reform manifestowhy you could even run yourself
salt wouldnt it be better to actually ask a question about his platform rather than making a snide remark also hyde doesnt need 30k subs to ensure that people will vote for him people will vote for him because his videos show that he understands the mechanics of the game and his ability on understanding the game gives him the skill to be rather good at it which in turn makes it entertain to watch but the vote would come from his understanding not his ability to edit and commentate thats the key hyde understand the game he wouldnt be a swagyoloposter boydeletetheweak
i noticed that you have your corporation and alliance disabled in the forums care to comment i made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
thats probably his way of showing he is there for everyone not just for his own alliance
nice assumptionhowever i think hes trying to disassociate himself from goonswhichwould be a smart movei made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
surei feel that what a person wants to do should be more important to their candidacy than what ticker is under their namei think grudge matches between people of different space flags have a place in eve that place is just not here i am a member of the imperium but i do not feel that should be a factor that determines who will or will not vote for me i have hidden my corp and alliance ticker because in my view it simply has no place here in this thread and if elected should stay hidden this is a personal choice not something that all candidate should be forced to do
do you honestly expect people to believe that you wont bring the doctrine that you share with the goons to the tablethats like saying i was born into and grew up in the x party but i promise not to bring that partys agenda to y organizationit just doesnt work that wayyou have a lot more growing up to doi made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
the imperium isnt a political party its a hegemonic power blocwhat doctrines do you think i share with goonshave you ever looked at my employment history
factyou cant work in a fish market and come home at the end the day not smelling like fishi made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
are you going to answer my question or just talk about the smell of fish
i made an analogy hoping you would be able to understand my mistakeyoure running based on reform youre a goon you cant expect people to buy that you wont bring goon devalues with you why would the player base that mostly despise goons want you to mold the game to give them even greater favorand since you brought up your corp history wowyou know what that shows people that you have a very hard time playing well with othersjust another reason you should not be a member of the csmi made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
you still have not answered my questionif you are going to make a statement or accusation against somebody you should be ready to defend it a certain former member of the imperium made that mistake recently and it cost him
ive answered your question more than oncelol i know using threats have worked for you in the pasti made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
so that is a no then you wont defend your statement or answer my follow up to it glad we could clear that up
please dont have a temper tantrum on my accountthe fact that youve been in 200 corps in 5 years should be enough to disqualify you in my opiniondo you get along with anybody so much corp drama cant be good for business gotta keep the rent coming ini made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
the fact that you refer to your masters as the imperium is seen as an insult by mostmerriam webster defines imperium as1  supreme power or absolute dominion  control2  the right to command or to employ the force of the state  sovereigntythats how you see yourselves as masters of the universemost players simply view you as glorified bullies and descendants of bobno votei made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
i have no mastersthe imperium and its directorate are not in charge of me they do not order command or demand anything of me i am not a servant or an employee of goons the notion you are attempting to perpetuate is that i am some sort of plant or goon shill that will only ever perform functions for my masters this is a very silly notion as you yourself pointed out by referencing my corp history to learn who rules over you simply find out who you are not allowed to criticizei have no gods no masters even the most basic research of my history in eve online will show you that
you have made my point absolutehow can you serve the people with this attitude ill answer that you wontyoull do whatever you want whenever you want as evidenced once again by your corp historyim not saying that youre a bad person or even a bad player im just saying that youre too immature to be a leadercome back in five yearsoi made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
i am not going anywhere
bob you have my vote you have always been a good guy to work with and from what i have seen during my time with en24 you put the good of the game ahead of personal gaini hope this year you make it all the wayps if you do and you find any spare tickets to fanfest just laying around the ccp office feel free to send them my way
met joffy many years ago when he joined the corp i was in out in null a really nice guy the corp closed shortly after and he then joined sf and i dosed into skill queue online but still kept my ears open and followed the politics via different pod castsso to see you running for csm xi is just fantastic cant wait for the csm watch interview godspeed  iUFFFDll be voting with both accounts
updated the initial post to include a few of my previous links and my interview with event will be keeping it up to date as things go live and get edited
here is the csm watch interview with toxic yaken for the csm 11 electionenjoy
1  it would be nice to see some sort of reward for highsecers to stay active during war to some capacity maybe even provide some corporate benefits if they can meet thresholds for activity in highsec similar to indexes in null if they manage to maintain x activity they get a day free of the war shorten the overall length of the war or something else of that nature new feature ideas aside players that dont want to hop into a combat ship can always try flying logisitics scouting spying or stalking as well wars can have as many dimensions as you want to put into them and you can make some fun out of it 2  i feel like youre alluding to some sort of functional bounty system or something personally id also like to see facpol no longer chasing criminals so that players could do that themselves and provide standingslpisk for successfully destroying criminals in highsec the obvious flip side of that is that the payout cant be so excessive that players can kill their criminal characters with alts and reap insurancecriminal killing rewards that exceed the value of ships perhaps there could be some sort of diminishing returns for destroying the same character over and over to prevent that 3  isnt your package that big thing i always see cyclo flying around with as far as im concerned its already an honorary member
thanks again for having me stu d
i am really enjoying your ideas on bounty huntingi do have one idea for a mechanic that might make the system i dunno workif we had a bounty mission agent this would solve 95 of all bounty scams that would happen the mission agent gives you a particular target and if you manage to hunt them down perhaps you become able to collect the full bounty for the kill as well as some sweet lp and a bonus these of course would have to be week long missions the flip side is avoiding getting caught in hisec is rediculously easy for anyone who isnt a ganker so this mechanic would mostly apply to catching gankers i support this in conjunction with removing faction police so that the bounty and the bounty hunter have a meaningful fight and not just pointed you waiting for faction police now to do my job for methoughts
we would have pandered pandas now if we took the pandered pandas to a beauty salon
sorry for the late reply tora this pretty much sums up how i feel my biggest desire to see you in csm is directly because you know war decs and high sec shenanigans proper and you have a well placed desire to see equal game play i cant say much more than post abovegood luck tora
good luck tora lucas is right certainly seems a lot better than last years do you plan on focusing all your efforts if you make csm on highsec aggression mechanics and wardecs if so do you have any other idea pertaining to or can you elaborate on a suspect baiting how do you feel about suspect baiting as a mechanic do you feel it allows too much freedom on the baiters side do you feel it should lessened or do you think it sits fine as it is b loot stealing since you do not receive a weapons timer for stealing from wrecks it makes it very easy in highsec to quickly snatch loot that doesnt belong if that wreck is in docking range although most people will say that this is a station campers problem i know that you understand that most actual wardec based fights more often then not happen near or in the undock radius which makes ninja looting from wars a very profitable and easy thing to do opinions c neutral logistics a lot of people complain about neutral logi being a problem with highsec others argue that as soon as the neutral logi becomes active in a fight it is arguably in a worse situation then it would if was incorp what are your opinions on the matter should neutral logi incur more penalties should it stay the same or should it be lessened d further detail on ganking why do you think it needs to be looked at in further detail do you have any ideas on how to fix the issue is ganking itself the problem or do you feel it is bumping or criminal status not incurring enough penalties to the gcced characterdeletetheweak
last year was my first attempt still a bit green and less connection with the eve player base main reason i have been more active on twitter and tweetfleet slack this year not just highsec agression i also want to be active in lowsec industry as thats also one of the things i do in evea i think suspect baiting is a nice feature in eve as it is i personally dont like the ship swapping with an orcabowheadetc while you are suspect if thats still possible but am ok with it if you do it in a stationb loot stealing in space is ok as it is but i would like to see a short 5 sec timer when you do it on stations if you sit on an undock all day and you want the easy life thats ok but then you also accept the down side of it losing lootc im ok with neutral logi as it is right now use neutral logi then you go suspect and become useless for fleet fights you take a risk and you have the option of a reward nice in balanced ganking takes effort and skills and anti gankers have options to not get ganked but i want to see more pvp fights between them currently gankers undock insta warp and when you see them again is on the target no time to even have a small chance of shooting them not sure how to improve this yet but its something to look in tobumping i am fine with too unless you continue this to long bumping a freighter for 1015 minutes is just annoying bumping preparing to gank fine maybe someway to have a max bump time just a brainwave bump fatigue 
a few reasons why i wont vote for tora1 a while back he declared war on my corporation on behalf of loyal  company during the wd unless i was flying a bathtub and jumped into 10 marmites they would run every time now they are at war with loyal  company2 i paid tora 600m isk for a weeklong wd the results were laughable3 i dont think the two are so different im not saying that a pirate in eo is a bank robber in rl but its part of your personalityvote for someone that will improve hsi made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
it seems to me that the ability to provoke such tears as are in your post is in itself a compelling reason to vote for tora the whole you are evil in the game so you must be a sociopath in real life shtick is pretty tired i am more than willing to consider tora again for the job this year i eagerly await his csm watch interview
the whole tear shtick is pretty tired id hardly say that my saying he was a waste of money is crying he wasnt effective acting for me or against me as evidenced by his crumbling alliancevote for whomever you wish but would you care to make a wager on the sidei made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
why would i want to bet on the outcome of the csm electioni just want to hear what tora has to say i dont care about your petty ingame dealings with this candidate or any other if he crossed you beat you made you sad or whatever it has no bearing on what tora can bring to the table as a csm memberplease save your pouting for other threads more appropriate to such sentiments this one is about what experience and platform tora can offer to the community if you have nothing to offer but innuendo and sore feelings it might be best to just remain silent
you want me to be silent while you prop him up thats richhis in game behavior good or bad has complete bearing here if he failed to properly execute a wd that i paid for how can i expect him to do what he says as a member of the csmyour argument is null and void siri made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
ganking is a topofmindissue for highsec carebearscarebears make up the majority of voters come up with answers before the vote even holeysheet1 has answers for gankers poach his ideas you are deliberately avoiding this issue and it will cost you votesthieving pirates discuss integrity anarchist gankers give us laws and whoring mercs cry then blow off clients with insults
vic vicman jefferson also known as general dic hefferson among his fearfilled opponents is a cunning warrior who inspire a great deal of trust in his allies you should vote for vic because vic is a vic you can rely on to be your vic in your time of need v o t e v i c o t e v i c vt e v i c v oe v i c v o t v i c v o t ei c v o t e vc v o t e v iv o t e v i co t e v i ct e v i ce v i cv i c i c c

when i started playing eve in 2003 i was not keen on the mmopay to play genre at the time i did not see much value in paying a monthly fee for a game between that and a general sense of confusion over what i can do in eve i stopped playing after my first month out of beta i was drawn in again a few years later and played for a longer period before i stopped playing for personal family reasons and over several more years started and stopped again until picking up full time play of eve in 2010what stands out to me in all cases is that i came back to eve due to the intro movies and later the alliance tournaments showing up on youtube the idea of eve being this big universe full of danger and adventure was attractive the idea that i could fly with other people cooperatively and fight others was attractive my decisions mattered and effected my wallet in interesting waysi am interested in making this game attractive to new players for the reasons eve is attractive to the older players a dangerous universe where you are not tied to any one thing you can become something more and become something better you can get kicked in the face and learn so that perhaps one day you can return the favor the story line in eve is a good solid story line it is not one that pretends you are the center of the story  to be that you have to make it yourself in eve to be a band of brothers a mittani a pandemic legion etc you have to work at it to make yourself part of the narrative these are good things i believe maintaining risk and depth of play is crucial to player retentionmy focus if elected to csm 11 will be to seek improvements to the player experience as a whole to make eve less safe overall while improving the interactive experience of the player to the game the scarcity of something brings strife and conflict the vulnerable seek the strong to protect them or hide where they may be safe for a time the story line of eve should progress the universe as a whole adding content making the excuse of why something exists the way it does and otherwise giving those that roleplay a solid focus without turning to the foolish model of making the story of eve online about the player itself the pvpers should have the tools and resources to get into action whether a long roam hunting for targets or jumping online to take someone out in a prepared way pvpers should find their combat challenging and in the end gratifying no pvper likes twiddling their thumbs searching for combat and their combat records should be easier to find in game for their fame and glory in combat the mission runner should be able to fly missions but a concentration of missions should deplete the availability of missions from a given agent making it necessary for the mission runner to seek out other agents until the prior agent has something again in turn this can increase the value of lp for a given group by scarcity and ccp can equally increase mission rewards so that the casual mission runner gets more for their effort this depletion is based on everyone obtaining missions for that particular agent so potential pvp situations can be created between mission runners seeking to monopolize an agent agent y offers up to x amount of missions per time period and finds z many new offerings over a period of time my apologies capsuleer but i gave out my last available mission to some other capsuleer for what purpose do war decs exist except for most structures all things can be destroyed without invoking a war dec code is a prime example of this i would say the war dec mechanic as it is now is broken should corporations without anchored structures in high sec mtus excluded from this be subject to war decs when their blingy ships freighters and mining ships can be destroyed without one unless a player corp plans to anchor a structure then perhaps they should enjoy the same immunity from war decs a nonplayer corp enjoys in the spirit of promoting conflict null sec anomalies should be treated as a commodity that can suffer from overharvesting why do more npcs decide to go to a system where more of them have died too much harvesting of anomalies be they mineral or be they npc should result in an overall decrease of their availability over time the advantage to this is it will require movement out of a system and into others by ratters and miners empires may have to look at expansion to obtain more hunting grounds and pvp seekers will find targets with greater frequency as there should be less empty spacei believe in the integrity and responsibility of the csm as an organization representing the interests of the community as a whole in dialogue with ccp a vote for me is a vote for the items i represent above and most importantly an independent voice it is one vote less to certain large power blocsthank you for your supporti would also like to thank my fellow toger doggfather for his valuable input and critique
i mean community in a broader sense there are some great incursion communities out there i personally have flown with tvp and tdf and had a great experience with both groups there are some great indy corps out there good mining corps some great chat channels what i am referring to is the fact that typically hisec dwellers tend to gravitate towards one thing they may be full time incursion runners or they may multibox a bunch of skiffs in an ice belt but they tend to spend most of there game time doing that one thing there is nothing wrong with that nor am i looking to change that what i am looking to do is bring people together in such a way that they really begin to understand how every single person has an impact in eve i would like to see more honest dialogue between people of different play styleshere is an example ill look at the solo miner and the solo minerganker ganker kills the miner miner sends hate mail ganker posts the hate mail on minerbumpingcom gankers laugh and end of dialogue now what if we streamed a show where we took a few miners a few gankers through them on comms together for a while and let them talk about eve how interesting would it be to hear about the challenges that both sides face how cool would it be if a few miners actually became friends with a few gankers this is just a small sample of the type of interaction that i think would change how at least some players feel about hisec in a positive wayas far as your incursion based questions i personally feel that sansha incursions have an adequate payout and here are a few reasons why its risky to fly around hisec in a bowhead with 2 blingy faction battleships and a logi cruiser in there you lose that bowhead you are out 6bil easy all told nothing to scoff at depending on what incursion community you run with you will average somewhere in the 150 mil an hour mark while running the incursion up or down depending on some factors so to make back that 6bil that will take you 40 hours of running incursions that does not factor in travel time waiting for fleet invites times where no incursion is up etc for hisec this isk seems excessive but it is the only way for a single account player to make real isk in hisec l4 missions are ok isk usually you upgrade from there to incursions to do better mining income in hisec is horrible if your a solo account you basically need to multibox to make any real isk hisec mining hisec explo is a crap shoot and has tons of competition hauling pays not that great in hisec you have to be a nullsec jf pilot to make real money doing that so by comparison since incursions are the only real isk maker in hisec for a single account player let them print isk doing that as far as drifter incursions i do not feel that they should replace sansha incursions it is up to the player base to decide what they want to run so if the players decide to ditch sansha for drifters thats on them but if ccp eliminated sansha incursions and forced us to run drifters or simply not incursion i would be upset with that that said i ran in a drifter incursion fleet once with isn we used suicide caracals then did a reship to bombers and it was a blast i think i am going to run more of them personally i highly recommend everyone try them at least once i see no reason why both incursions cannot live side by sidebefore anyone says it yes i know station trading is technically the best isk maker in the game i left that out on purpose when i said incursions are the only real isk in hisec cause station trading really is its own thing
yes i think almost all of us can agree that more player interaction is good in this mmorpg about player interaction i am asking if you have a specific ideas on how ccp could facilitate that would regionwide chat channels be a good thing playerbuilt advertising structures cheaper wardecshow can you encourage players especially from different groups or professions to interact more in highsecfrom a game design perspective how does it make sense to leave the sansha incursions in the game along side the new drifter ones if the drifter ones are harder everchanging not completely minmaxed and thus pay less than the current sansha why would anyone choose to run them as an iskmaking activity if no one runs them aside from the handful of groups looking specifically for a new challenge  most sit unrun until they expire then why should ccp spend significant amounts of their development effort iterating on and expanding them dont you think it is a waste of time to ask ccp to develop new pve content that is just going to be ignored by the majority of the pve playerbasepersonally setting aside the overall economic issues with incursions runners capturing so much of the economy outlined by ccp quant in his devblog i think the stale sansha incursions are well past their bestbefore date  the content is old completely beaten and hasnt been updated in a long time from a universe perspective the sansha have spent over 5years attacking without much success and i would think them ready to give up and try a new approach anyways those are my thoughts as a highsec playerthanks for taking the time to answer my questions  i have all the information i need best of luck on your csm run
questions for holey 1 why do you feel pve is currently not profitable enough what would you see increased2 would your proposed suspect mechanics not make neutral reps insanely unassailable as they were in retribution3 low sec industry struggles compared to high sec or nullsec thoughts 4 troll question ive been thinking of getting face piercings how many is too many
well im surprised that you actually went through with it why do you think pve activities need more isk as far as i was aware its quite profitable ive made billions on incursions and even stealth bomber running fw sites also how would you propose a sink for the faucet you are proposing for also all of your ideas add the ability to make isk more effectively which wouldnt really make things any better asides with market skullduggery being a problemdeletetheweak
my dear noragen i have some answers i hope you will find satisfactory1 pve should be more profitable because basically all prices inflate except pve income i remember buying a dominix for 32 mill way back when and plexes were 250 mill when i first bought one running lvl 4s will make you max 40 mill per hour with loot salvage and bounties with the inflation weve experienced this doesnt cut the mustardded sites can be great but it depends on the boss drop completely which is random also rated ded sites are few and far between i would like to see more spawn more ded sites would be great toosleeper or jovian maybe plus a variety of new faction onesincursions seem fine but there seems to be a closed community that does them i cant sit popping npcs for hours i have housework and i drink lots of coffee2the suspect mechanics hit many in the face and many more unsubscribed due to their logistics toons becoming targets for everyone a person at war prior to retribution would have to plan ahead to neutralize logi or kill it i conceded with the dock timer because the logi should be made to flee or die this was the game i knew for 5 years before they changed it with the retribution patch and it worked for me interest in the game was higher and everyone had a logi toonso it was kind of a level playing field imo3low sec industry seems worth while mostly theres moon googood luck finding a decent moon btw some decent ore and if youre lucky maybe a 610not industry sorry you dont have to deal with bubbles like in null and lets be honest bpc copying can be risky in low sec pi can be worthwhile but the concentrations on the planets are meh plus a group of bad asses in dreads can come along and vaporize your pocos very quickly4as with several things done in my youth i regret the facial spikes i think my avatar looks mean so ill keep him that way if voted in as csm i will address the issue of facial spikes i reccomend as many as will fiti hope this answered your questions satisfactorily norrykilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better
as a science at heart economics is basically the study of scarcity and how to assign the resources we have in the most efficientbeneficialwhatever manner possible generally  high supply and low demand equals lower prices and lower supply and higher demand results in higher prices you would like ccp to step in introduce more pve content in order to increase the supply fine but be prepared for market crashes if you suddenly introduce numerous new shinies outlets which im not sure you want to happen if your goal is to increase the supply of shinies so that carebears may continue to grow richwhat are you on about apart from bounties the selling of pve loot normal loot faction drops whatever is absolutely subject to inflation  check out the trend of say cn bcus or gistpith deadspace invulnerability fields those are most definitely a part of pve income
thanks for the economics lesson did you ever watch that loony toons cartoon on economics with the 2 mice i did and from that i understand the basics the fact remains that inflation of goods hasnt stayed in line with earning of isk an increase in rated ded sites would benefit manynow bumblefck if youre just here to troll i have no interestkilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better
you have well considered answers for ganking exploits reducing the price of wardecs would only benefit mercs keep thinking with your carebear hat onthieving pirates discuss integrity anarchist gankers give us laws and whoring mercs cry then blow off clients with insults
i pointed out a serious issue in one of your platform items and you just come back with some crap about cartoons an increase in ded would benefit no one as the supply rise assuming no changes in demand will just lead to crashing prices  not extra income for everyonewhos trolling its obviously you by the way
maybe bumble n holey could run a join ticket you both have been best m8s for sooooo longi think you both balance each other out like man n wifethieving pirates discuss integrity anarchist gankers give us laws and whoring mercs cry then blow off clients with insults
ded sites are like fun missions with some risk if you get a bad drop its worthless i remember the kul zatath monastery site i made 500 mill one time then 5 mill on the next one its random more ded sites  more fun and faction stuff if the prices crash well still have fun sites to dokilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better
any other ideas or input because ive seen a lot herei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
that depends on the definition of pvp eve is a pvp game as in everyone has an effect of everyone else its not a pvp game as in everyone has to be involved in shooting each other i dont agree with the op but at the same time i dont agree with this entire sentiment that everything should involve the firing of the laserswars as they stand are pretty broken since they have the opposite approach to risk and reward the weaker the target you go after the lower the risk and the higher the reward going after a pure pvp corp will get you tough fights and bad loot while going after an industrial group gets you easy kills and plenty of loot there should be better ways for groups to compete and fight and they shouldnt just involve groups of mercs hiding behind concords skirt picking off easy targets
seems reasonable enough but still has a problem where its not really encouraging fighting it just encourages endurance a noncombat group would still have no reason to switch to combat and to make things worse aggressors would get locked in nothing would stop people from creating a corp baiting in an aggressor then dropping all important characters leaving it in the hands of a couple of alts and moving to a new corp wardeccers would still need content so they have to dec other people eventually wardeccers would end up over invested in attacks with no ability to get out of them without losing their bond so i think this would still encourage them to go after weaker targets with lower bonds it also makes wardecs cost less over time making permadecs no longer a costly endeavour and removes wardec fees as an isk sinkfrom a content standpoint i think the most important thing to remember is that if people dont want to fight they wont so dont build the system around fighting those people and giving them reasons to fight instead build the system around fighting people who do want to fight and use the people who dont as an unwilling resource if someone could take over an area and takes say 20 of the mining yield market tax and bounties for example they would have a reason to take that area and other people would have reasons to fight them for it kind of like how the pocos generated a whole bunch of warpeople who didnt want to fight would either have to put up with the taxes in the area they are in strike a deal with the owners or move people who were willing to fight would do so wardecs would be as simple as buying into the fight making your corpalliance legal targets for anyone else optioned in for that area it could be something like kills by your corp in that area give you points and whoever has the most points at downtime flips control as long as the areas of control were quite fluid in their ownership and demanded constant fighting to maintain control rather than being stagnant like sov content then there would be a constant stream of fights nonpvp content like rattingmining would have no effect on control and would be generating funds for the owners warchest

here is the csm watch interview with joffy aulxgao for the csm 11 electionenjoy
hi joffyganking is a topofmind issue in hisec esp in the carebear communitythe key feature of ganking is a profit motive there is no profit motive in antiganking also with the current game mechanics ganking has become low risk for high rewardwhat would you do to restored the balancethieving pirates discuss integrity anarchist gankers give us laws and whoring mercs cry then blow off clients with insults
thanks to everyone who has shown their support for my campaign both here on eveo and on twitter it is very much appreciatedfirstly i would say that the perception of ganking is very different to the reality of it i would also say that it is not necessarily the primary concern of mission runners and most haulers know ways to reduce the riski have had highsec alts doing hauling mining and other activities and whilst ganking is of course something to be aware of it was not a problem for my charactersto answer your other questions i dont believe antigankers do what they do for profit however i think it is a shame that antiganking is purely reactive at present that is after seeing intel antigankers have to sit on a gate waiting for the gank attempt to begin and hope they can assist in timei feel that there are things haulers and miners can do to reduce the likelihood of being ganked but as with everything else in eve if someone really wants to take you out they will as to the risk vs reward there is always room for change in mechanics but i am not really sure how i would change this particular one but i am open to suggestions from both sides to improve it
hey so as well as me nash gorski and hyde you should totally vote for my man jintaan
why should anyone in highsec vote for you do you like codethieving pirates discuss integrity anarchist gankers give us laws and whoring mercs cry then blow off clients with insults
its been a long time since i have lived in hisec 3 years my hisec activities are mostly restricted to station trading in jita which is how i make my isk i am interested in the development of war dec mechanics and have recently gotten involved in the new war dec group proposal i am also providing consultancy pvp knowledge and tactics to euni fcs to assist them there i actually started my fcing by fighting hisec wars with euni of varying scalelargely speaking people in hisec should vote for me because they think even though i am a candidate who is not from their space i am one who is open minded and can come to less familiar issues without an overriding bias one who will will listen to and consider their issues and concerns rather than just representing what is best for the group of players i am most closely affiliated with in the game regardless of how it affects everyone elsecode seems like a fun rp group for players who enjoy hisec warring
just because you have blond highlights does not mean you are a girlyboy you could be a surferback to the questionsone or two word answers are okwhy should anyone in highsec vote for you do you like codethieving pirates discuss integrity anarchist gankers give us laws and whoring mercs cry then blow off clients with insults

then youd have pampered pandered pandasleadership is something you learn maybe one day youll learn that
you should know me well enough by now to know i am pretty direct in my communication holeysheet1 is a troll even in his csm post and thats a big nono to me the csm is a serious matter and also everyone here who replies and complains about how evil i am as tora from the marmite collective please dont vote for me as you still dont see the difference between real life and role playand im not going to tell gankers i will make eve a ganking heaven just as i wont tell antigankers i will be your carebear saviour what i am saying is both sides should have options in eve to counter each others moves if they put enough effort in it
you are so misguided your socalled carebears have no desire to do damage to anyonethat is so two dimensional and nearsighted of youthe non pvp players have no desire to hurt others they just want to play the game in their own way to create is something you just dont understand you force your way of gameplay onto others and think its funny to be destructivelike most criminals youre too lazy to work for what want its just easier and second nature to take it from someone who didand now youre asking carebears to vote for younot gonna happeni made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
1 the key feature of ganking is a profit motive there is no profit motive in antiganking 2 the game mechanics favour a cluster of ganking ships all insta warping from station to a bookmarktgt making it neigh impossible to interdict3 ak freighter pilots cant warp anywhere when bumped by one or more machscombine these three points together an you have a mighty unbalanced hisec no matter what whiney entitled gankers sayif any candidate addresses these three points a block of carebear votes will follow thieving pirates discuss integrity anarchist gankers give us laws and whoring mercs cry then blow off clients with insults
come on tora have to make some compromises in politics dont want one of those null sec types winning  because their alliance votes in blocks like sheepthieving pirates discuss integrity anarchist gankers give us laws and whoring mercs cry then blow off clients with insults
1 ganking can also be used to get revenge and industrial warfare for example2 i agree see my above posts for change3 i agree see above posts for changeimprove option 2 and 3 and youll have a nice balanced feature in eve
really howan industrial pilot is strolling through hs in a freighter when a 30man fleet of 10s descend on him after 1560 minutes of being bumped by a machariel and destroy his ship and probably his podyou think he can with no pvp skills go track down all 30 pilots and gank them one at a timethats ridiculousno one believes that youre going to try and fix the ganker favored mechanicsi made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
you dont have to like it but its part of eve online it would be the same as me telling all nullsec players we need to remove nullsec just because i dont like it so wonder yourself what the core of the problem is me jumping through a nullsec gate in my freighter suddenly 100 men alliance waiting for me in your mind we should probably forbid the 100 men alliance because i stand no chance against such a big force of power in my mind i should have played smarter and used a jump freighter web alts andor scouts joined an alliance blue to them eve is a game of risk no one is safe anywhere if you can not handle that youre doing it wrong
tora honestly that argument has gotten so old you are saying that hs isnt safe so get over it but you want us to vote for you so you can change something that you dont have a problem with in the first placepick a sidei made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
i have always picked the side of eve onlines balanced content you get the most fun when both sides have equal opportunities currently i think attackers have more then the defenders this is what i want to rebalance
you are comparing two different mechanics of a game and saying they obsolete each other thats like saying in call of duty why have guns in the game when the player can just knife every one by your logic cod should remove one or the other completely or make one completely and utterly different or how i can go to lowsec and pvp and that highsec should be completely safe your idea is just less extreme wardecs need to be tweaked they are not broken they need to be refreshed and given a new coat of paint like almost all of highsec but adding arbitrary limits to a sandbox is not what a sandbox game needs by definition it should be left open npc corps are fine as they are with wardec immunity they have proven to be more than enough for players to commit to daily every day gameplay of eve cas being a prime and active example other npc corps are of course not like cas but that is player driven content and the tools provided by the game is obviously enough for other npc corps to flourish as cas has also npc corps are arguably worse as one man rolling corp is even more effective because you can a zero tax rate and still dodge decs with no consequences your idea is just another one more nerf and itll all be balanced if you want to focus on tweaking wars you should think more along the lines on how to make wardecs better not add more and more nerfs regardless good luckdeletetheweak
which is why i bring up the question whether one thinks that wardecs are broken or need tweaking is a matter of opinion however regardless of ones opinion changes can be made to improve war decs ultimately how this is a discussion that should be had i do not think that adding a class of corp that cannot be war deced if they choose not to be and have no assets in space would be considered a nerf when a very large population in high sec exists in npc corps which by default cannot be war decced nor can they have assets in space the difference is that the corp can segregate itself in a distinct way that npc corps do not allow and retain the benefit that npc corps give protection from war decs but how would you look at tweaking the war dec system to improve and refine it
i personally believe that every action in eve needs to have consequences thats why i personally like the game remove consequences you remove risk a core part of eves current philosophy as such a social corp as you propose is in my honest opinion a way to shierk past some of limits of an npc corp you get your own name and your own tax rate while still avoiding the possibility to be wardeced by another entity npc should be a place for player who dont mind restrictive play at the price of less content social corps or your idea is a away to allow more to a player who doesnt want to risk while maintaining the same amount of protection that an npc corp offers npc corps would be functionally barren as all the current npc hold outs would make there own corps never put up a tower and go on there way this is a nerf to wardecs as it allows players who wish to avoid them go on with no change in their lives but severally cuts the wardeccers content down by a large amount i personally do not believe that wardecs should be centered around structures structures are tedious and you yourself want to avoid tedium also i would assume that your idea would make it impossible for a agressor to dec unless he owned a structure himself yes so your idea would force wardec alliances into becoming bigger more so than they are now because small entities would not be able to properly defend their own structures making it that the only wardec alliance around are those who can pull enough members to properly protect their own means to content while systematically destroying others it would be an arbitrary set victory condition who ever whips the other structures first wins the war off the top of my head 1 pricing needs to be worked by taking total corp sp into account high total sp mean less isk corp age into account older corps should be cheaper and total corp members if you have more members it should be cheaper currently it cost more to dec a corp with more members corps contain dec immunity for a week after creation however corp creation prices are increased to the mean average of the price of a dec however if you are a new player the first corp creation is free 2 corp creation tutorial teaches you about corporations in eve and along with that wardecs and how they function this is also show when a new player enters a corporation for the first time details what a corporation does and how you can be effected while in one 3 wardecs are limited to 2 allies only for the defender 4 introduction of a declaration bounty pool if the defender destories assets that belong to the aggressor it isk paid to the defender at the end of a war if aggressors do not lose assets or at the completion of a contract based dec see below or kill more than 50 more than the defender the isk bounty is not rewarded 5 introduction of contract based wardecs contractee can offer real binding contracts to mercenaries the contracts have goals set by the contractee and if goals are not met contract defaults and the isk is not paid to the mercenary these goals can be isk destroyed certain players deaths or removal of assets contract decs will be paid by defender at the start of the dec and refunded back to them at the end of the dec if contact to not met from the aggressors wallet if the corp wallet goes negative the corp will go bankrupt and automatically close in a week during the week other contracts can be fulfilled bring the corps wallet saving them from closing edit defender is notified about contract and can pay a small fee to see the details of contract however the contract issuer is not available for viewing if a contract is a player based kill that player can not leave corp during the dec if a player contact is completed player can not be targeted again for two weeks by any corporation by contract however the player can still be fried upon if another he happens to be in an active war after contract is met 6 after war has ended either contract based or paid dec the corp enters a stasis mode if the defender wins by kill more than the aggressor the war they enter a wardec immune state for a week if neither corp kills anything or the defender losses more isk than what they killed they enter stasis for 3 days my ideas are not perfect and be minmaxxed and exploited however im not the one running for csm p regardless those are somethings that pop into my head when i think about tweakingdeletetheweak

region wide chat channels would be cool i know years ago people were talking about how interesting those would be but it never went anywhere more methods for player adverts should be implemented i have alot of ideas on wardecs to benefit both the war deccer and the carebear and a change in cost structure is one of those ideas since i am on the topic of war decs i will say that due to seeing so many new players quit the game over a war dec since a 16 day old account sitting in a retreiver has no idea how to deal with it i would like to make it so accounts that are under a certain age say 30 days or 45 or we will be exempt from the war dec they can be in the corp that is war decd but they wont be flashy red to the war deccers or anything like that unless the account has aggressed someone in hi or low sec thereby voiding the war dec immunity since at that point the account is being used to pvp as far as getting people in hisec from different professions interacting i think chat streams are growing in popularity and alot more people are listening to them so those can be utilized also i would like to organize more game wide player events the last event i remember where the whole game was invited was burn amarr i would like to structure various types of events open to the whole game but probably will be attended mostly by empire dwellers and run them relatively often get people out of there normal day activity and doing something with alot of people as far as incursions go i agree sansha incursions are dry and need an update so i think an update should come drifter incursions are such a different play style i honestly do not understand how they can replace the sansha incursions its kind of like saying why run ded sites in hisec when u can just run l4s and get that stable income while both are combat oriented there are very different pve content incursions are similiar sansha sites are run in blingy faction fit ships that ourside of incursions most players will never fly drifter incursions are run mostly in suicide cruisers and catalysts and bombers and that kind of stufff if both incursions were being run with fleets of vindis and scimitars i would say yeah we have redundant content but as of the currents state we do not plus drifter incursions are still kind of new it took people a while to get good at sansha incursions anyone remember hour long tpphs in drake fleets and people are still feeling out the drifters in time we will have a better idea of where the relationship between the 2 incursionson a side note i agree that storyline wise sansha has failed for years now so i think some interesting plot twists could happen if sansha incursions were updated properly and some things change and we got a cool scope video or 2 of new sansha rats invading to drive the plot

so this is an idea that i had seeded from a reddit post concerning the iapetan class of titans the post was not concerning gameplay it was simply fun concerning their scale and size but it made me want to see one not necessarily make them available to capsuleers but i wanted to see one i then molded an idea for how they could be brought into the game which i proposed in that reddit thread and got decent positive feeback oncurrently incursions are kinda stale sure the drifter incursions are new but they are crazy difficult and broken due to the amarrian navy not participating in the fight the only way i have seen them done so far is by whelping thrashers into them until they are all dead not the hottest of gameplay on the other side sansha incursions are so stable that losing a ship in one is very rare and they feel more like a grind than level 4 missions out of this i gained the concept for a new incursion possibly replacing the unsuccessful drifter incursions it was brought up in that reddit thread that one of these super titans is owned by the serpentis now would any self respecting pirate organization own the largest and strongest mobile battle station so to ship it while it is docked of course not thus i reached the idea of the serpentis incursion these incursion sites and scales would greatly trump that of the current sansha incursions as the serpentis are looking to carve out a piece of empire space to join in with the big 4 since this is more than just a little power struggle that is the sansha incursions the smallest serpentis incursion sites would be equivalent to the current sansha hqs in difficulty from there it scales upnow getting more than 40 people in a fleet with the sole purpose of earning isk is difficult enough as it is so i dont expect the sites to demand a much larger fleet to run them mayhaps 50 for the medium sites and 60 for the strongest sites more of a focus would be put on proper use of fleet tactics such as electronic warfare damps for sniping ships that will boat closer when their lock range is reduced or requiring bhaalgorns to neut out the triage carriers that the serpentis would be using oh didnt i mention there has to be a mom site the big one after 24 ish weeks of the incursion duration tbd the mom shows up and that iapetan class titan that is the mothership of the site that would be the reason why capitals would be allowed back into highsec i think that a simple balance solution of forcing capitals to not be allowed to shoot at players and player owned structures even it safety green allows it wardecs and allowing high sec cynos only in the sites for the purpose of getting the caps onto the battlefield to take down the iapetan class titan i would guesstimate that 200k250k dps would be needed just to break its tank meanwhile you have it literally trying to use a slightly weaker but faster firing doomsday maybe 750k damage instead of 2 mil on a 2 minute cooldown but it does not like to choose the same target twice in addition you also have a perpetually spawning wave of serpentis ships coming to defend their titannow for an incursion this difficult and this resourceintensive there needs to be a payout naturally you get isk and concord lp for the normal sites maybe also with other goodies like serpentis faction loot and bpcs but for the mom whatever fleet gets top damage gets a xl citadel bpo dropped in a secure container so it cant get shot or stolen specifically for the fleet boss that kind of a prize is sure to get people chomping at the bit to try and get top damagenaturally a proposal this large and expansive will not happen right away and maybe its too late for a xl citadel bpo to be the best prize for the last site there would also need work to be done to actually model serpentis capital ships and the iapetan class titan also to create the sites and add special code for cynos to be allowed in the sites i have no idea is this will get anywhere beyond a dream but i want the lore to live and i think this is a good way for it to breathe the air of new eden once more
i support this candidate
good dayi have been a member for co2 for 2 months nowthe thing that struck me at first when joining this alliance is i always see the judge roaming around in his loki chasing neutrals and reds everywhere he canat first it felt kind of strange i had only seen his posts on the forums but then it struck me our alliance senior diplo actually does undock and shoot bad guysand after the first few weeks it felt normal as it turns out this guy is a true eve player and not just a skill training online playerand i believe that that is actually what we need in the csm a player that knows how to do small gang pvp and large scale pvp not to mention that after speaking with him for a few times he actually knows eve mechanics quite  welli will be voting the judge for csm xi

there you go again limiting eve to two sides do you live in a society where there are only two sides i doubt ityou say i say defend the weak for together we are strongeri made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
we were discussing ganking and yes then there are only two sides no need to bring in irrelevant societies in to the discussion and you can say anything you want if you want people to take you seriously then also try to respect other peoples opinions have a nice day

quoted for irony
i always felt if you cant own up to what youre saying perhaps you shouldnt be saying it
in real life i agree with this in a game where people are know to be extremely petty not so muchbut hey keep propping up your homies by trying to shoot down valid concernsanyway is there any proof of the csm actually changing anything that the player base has asked forand by player base i mean across the boardi made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
its fantastic that you compare yourself to shakespeare and its at this point that you lose any and all credibility that you mightve had
youve got my vote for making these statementsnot to derail this thread too far but yes there is plenty of proof of topics that the csm andor members of the csm have advocated for being implemented by ccp the csm are not game developers theyre an advisory body the actual development cycle and implementation of changes is completely at the discretion of ccp however that doesnt mean the csm doesnt have input into pushing for priorities for ccp to focus on and by assisting ccp in fleshing out ideas proof may be found by using this
you missed that one by a mile friendi was merely saying that the content is what should be weighedto be or not to be that is the question i made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
i am currently working so i am unable to respond in full but quick answer to thisno the idea only applies to the defending corp all corps would have the option to be war deced as well initiate war decs by default it should be set to allow or turn it off at the sacrifice of accepting the same limitations that npc corps have with regards to structures and maybe even corp hangers etc it does not fix war decs but expands options for players yes it would mean that marmite and other corps would not be able to war dec that corporation but it is no different than had the individuals remained in an npc corp one could add further restrictions to balance it out while it will result in fewer decable targets you should be more likely to get a decent fight from a defending corp rather than waste isk and time decing a target that will turtle or simply reform as another corp after all you want a fight when you issue a war dec rightill expound further later on when i am not working
you have some interesting ideas concerning empire i wish they did have more events that were game wide in highsec i might actually be tempted to leave null for a minutegood luck with your campaign

well after a night of hard station trading im quite tired i think a vote for me is a vote for a higher standard of intergrity in the csm community most are biased in one way or another but i believe in impartiality as far as the subjects at hand its the voters who own the right to choose ive explained my platform to the satisfaction of some and probably the disgust of others being quite experienced at most aspects of this game i think i would be a good voice for our community 8 years of experience with ups and downs like a rollercoaster leave their markin this we can make a compromise and find the best solution to bring our game back into a golden age that would nerf any otherlets forget about skins and new mechanics and look at what everyone wants not what is imposed on uschoose wisely i say because this is a critical time to save eve online and make it an awe inspiring experience for everyone lets turn 20 thousand players on average to 50 againkilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better

hi chumsim tubrug and im announcing my candidacy for csm xias we all know there are significant problems facing eve today from the great evil that resides in the north to the metastatic cancer that has infiltrated every region of space known as the UFFFDsvipulUFFFD someone needs to stand up and nurture the game to better healthi believe in eve and come to the table with some ideas i believe will make new eden a better place too many people think the csm is a joke i donUFFFDt i know how serious this spacejob is everyone has good ideas on how eve can be improved and i will listen to every single player in eve from some random highsec guy to a russian who keeps calling me a UFFFDcykaUFFFD in localthe following are my main policies that i hope to delivercsm reformbloc voting remains an issue to counter this i will change the voting mechanism every time someone says something intelligent in game on the forums on reddit or on twitter they will have a ticket with their name added to a raffle 14 names will be drawn from this raffle if people reject the position a name will be drawn againthe nude player experienceobviously improving the nude player experience is important itUFFFDs something that affects us all weve all played eve when we were nude and by improving the npe weUFFFDll be able to capture the demographic which will help keep eve alive one of the ways in which we can do this is to help feel them more welcome by allowing avatars to not wear clothesnullsecmany people chat a lot of  about ccp fozzie and how he broke nullsec but the same people have absolutely no ideas on what to do differently thus as we cannot agree to disagree we will have to compromise im not going to tell you what this compromise is itUFFFDs a secret but i do have oneif elected i willbuy ccp fozzie a beer for his brilliant work on sov introduce a good posting career agent as part of the tutorials make deklein an npc region with no playerowned sov introduce npc dreadnoughts and titans so they can kill ratting carriers ask jk rowling if she wants to write a book on wizards in the eve universe profits will go to me nomad pls implement radical supplyside policies to improve the production of memes build a wall around highsec to keep them out i will make them pay for the wall and i will make them build the wall why should you elect me im only half as autistic as the most autistic candidate this year i once made my own fit for a svipul which i thought was pretty good i can switch between good posting and  posting at will with a ten second cooldown why shouldnt you elect meim pretty dumb i lost a sabre to a neurus which was really  embarrassing thanks for your time and thanks for your votetubrugtubrug1makeevegreatagain

gl tubrug some really good ideas there i would like the see them in action 
tubrug1 wrotemake deklein an npc region with no playerowned sov naw then it will be entirely lifeless whatcha want to do is follow the models of pure blind delve and fountain and just put a few npc stations there so you get as much interaction as possible rather than just empty space no sov space should be that far away from an npc station for many reasons pure npc space is mostly lifeless pure sov space is too safe goldilocks zone is when the two collide in just the right way
eve has lost over 20 thousand players in the years i have played this game and it is sad to seethe player base continues to tell ccp that the one thing that drives players away the most is ccp continuing to allow players to suicide kill other players in empire space with little to no ramifications for their actions while the players they kill take huge lossesno one will continue to play under such circumstances and the drop in population shows ittake ccps position allowing suicide ganking in empire to continue to its natural conclusion no one will bother to contribute to the economy because it would just be destroyed and everyone would sit around and suicide gank each other until there is nothing leftall ccp has to do is disable people from being able to fire on each other in empire space without a war dec very simple they already have the mechanic in the game  bombs dont work in empire capitals cant jump to empire etc ccp if you want to attract people to play this game create a safe space for people to learn and play in safety and then move out to null sec or take part in war decs when they are readydust514 is shutting down your valkyrie product is not going to have a good reputation either when your preceeding product is hated by most of the gaming communitywill the council try to get across to ccp that the on going state of eveonline is glorified gang warfare disgusting to all civilized people and must change as outlined above to continue to survivetimes have changed eveonline has to change to or die
ccp statistics disagree with you
while i dont agree with the op people need to stop spitting out those statistics since all it shows is that ccp isnt very good at data analysis the biggest problem is that they didnt look at the circumstance of those players joining for example they say people who die play longer but if an existing player who pvps were to recruit a friend they would be more likely to die because they would be brought rapidly into the game while someone who joined of their own volition would be less likely to die since we know too that people who join corps and get involved are more likely to stay that tells me that they actually have their stats backwards its not that people who die are more likely to stay but in fact people who are more likely to stay are also more likely to be the ones who are put in a position where they lose ships see how its pretty easy to just wrap an interpretation around statsthats why ccp were so surprised by their own findings because they were pretty much guessing
while concurrent logged in player counts have indeed gone down we have no evidence how many players and accounts that really translates into and ccp isnt saying player activity kills trading etc seems to have been affected much less and there is no evidence that highsec violence has impacted this at all as shah said certainly you are wrong when you say that no one will play under those circumstances as i play because of that i am not alone there are many people who play because of the playerdriven economy and sense of real loss that this game features as one of its main pillars that is enable by a lack of a 100 safe space do not make the mistake of thinking everyone is like you or that you speak for everyone else highsec has been unsafe for almost 13 years and the game has not ground to a halt if anything the game grew faster at times when highsec was less safe earlier in eves history suicide ganking and other conflict facilitates the competition that gives things value in this game it makes the game much more interesting by meaning the players that minmax production most efficiently dont always win  defending your stuff is a concern which you as a producerindustrialist have to balance against pure yield this conflict literally prevents the economy from being driven into the ground by overproduction and gives our virtual assets meaningthis cannot work in an openworld single shard competitive sandbox game if you make highsec 100 safe which you would be doing by only leaving wars as npc corp members are immune from them then all the veterans in this game would move their production back to this safe zone they would use their resources to outcompete the new players and also deprive the game of all nonconsensual targets the game would then grind to a halt with players awash in ships and no meaningful targets to use them on the economy would collapse and everyone would move on besides eves is intended to not be 100 safe that is what has brought and keeps many people here why should that be changed now especially given eve online has outlasted almost all if its contemporariesif you hate eve like you claim without evidence so much of the gaming community does why are you paying ccp to keep playing just go play one of the multitude of other spacethemed games out there that does not feature nonconsensual pvp sandbox play in its core design eve is not going to change for you carebears have been saying the same thing as you since eve was released and here we are eve online is still trucking along featuring moreorless the same gameplay since the server went online there is nothing wrong with eve it clearly just not a fit for you spend your energies finding a game that suits you better rather then whining plaintively for ccp to change their successful product to suit your tastes you will be much happier
again not agreeing with the op but you say this like this doesnt already happen the veterans already do use highsec for industry and dont lose a thing ganking isnt an endgame activity its an activity with a low barrier of entry used to kill newer and less informed players this is why the only changes id care to see for ganking is to make it require more of an investment make it less formulaic and predictable and give antigankers a hope in hell of fighting back antiganking is significantly harder and significantly less rewarding than ganking which doesnt really make for good balance giving them a better way to fight back would produce more contentjust fyi if highsec were totally safe from pvp eve would still not be 100 safe that would require all parts of space to be safe even if there were no chance of pvp it wouldnt be 100 safe until even npc stopped shooting players so suggesting that the op is pushing for 100 safety is far from correctthis is the how dare you have an opinion that differs from mine you should just quit instead argument so is more a sign that you believe your own arguments are weak enough that you need to op to leave to save you wait what so carebears have been saying this all along theres a lot of carebears in this game and if theyve all been saying the same thing for so long perhaps that in itself is a testament to the strength of their opinions slowly but surely pedro you are convincing me that the carebears have the right frame of mind here also a game still having the same gameplay as it had when it was launched over a decade ago isnt necessarily a good thing and in this case is demonstrably false
interview posted from eve nt thank you for giving me the opportunity
noobman some questionsq1 what will you be doing to encourage more pvp corporations in wormspace  especially in higher class wormholesq2 do you see any mechanic changes that could encourage more frequent and sustainable pvp in wspace  if so would you promote them as csm  when i say sustainable i mean more fights but less evictions so the opposition gets to recover and come back to fight another day instead of a large percentage quitting eve which often happens after a evictionq3 do you think the increase in farmholes is a healthy thing for wspace  edit liked your responce here to this issue

on any other post then this you would be right as thats what tora does but like i said before this is a serious csm post where we should be able to seriously discuss subjects as a csm you should be able to handle disagreements if you cant you shouldnt run for csm
i would like to know your thoughts on the bounty system i think the fix presented a few years ago was rushed and temporary and the whole system is overdue a rework in my opinion kill rights work but i think they are backwards a player should be able to issue a kill right on a player for a reward to the person completing the kill what are your thoughts on thisi agree with your sentiments on bumping though bump fatigue is a little extreme  i think mjds for haulers would be interesting
ive had so many thoughts about the bounty system since they first started it and yes it never really worked outside highsec people often fly small ships or pods so getting 20 of the killmail is not worth it and in highsec there are so many people abusing it to scam players that even if you see a killright you often need to long to check it all before you activate it why would you need to buy a kill right at all youre hunting down someone for someone else aka working offering a reward on a certain player via a killright makes more sense that also solves the problem of war deccing an entire alliancecorp just because you have issues with 1 guyyeh bumping fatigue is a bit to much was just kidding mjds for haulers that would make ganking way harder im ok with harder unless it makes it almost impossible to gank then it would be unbalanced again towards the other side but yeh something to look into to
at least bring back the criteria that a pilot has to have bad sec status before you can place a bounty on himher perhaps have another mechanic for placing a hit on someonebounty an amount of money given to someone as a reward for catching a criminalto put a big red wanted on someone implies that theyve committed a criminal acti made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal

i think the sensationalized fiction about me is a wonderful way to learn about my roleplaying villainous ways the lead farmer saga was a personal attack on a level unknown in internet gaming i did nothing to them but yet they made up all this fiction as well real life threats were involved honestly they were lucky they didnt have interpol show up at each of their doors but i realized it was just a bunch of computer geeks from the uk and couldnt be bothered photo shopped texts and images that will immortalize me in a way ive learned to accept at least ive killed over a trillion in isk now and collected some of it it was about 3 billion that was stolen from me when i lost my wh networkim sorry for the previous post some people must bang their head of an imaginary wall i supposehave a great daykilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better
so i thought an interesting topic today would be setting up a reaction of moon minerals in a series of poss from my recollection and experiencei used internet resources and about a couple dozen moon probes to find my system i found 2 viable moons for extraction and reaction it was 2 moons a platinum moon and a chromium moon i checked and there was a reaction for hexite what a fun endeavour i thoughtnow i wanted to do this onthecheap because i knew the poss could be vaporized at any time and fuel costs for the poss were a part of the equation also at the timei think it was maybe 2010 the profit after costs was about 900 mill a month which was great for me as plexs were hovering around 300400 mill everything was substantially cheaperi had my fancy new crane and a sense of adventure i knew this would take a few trips so i bought all the stuff including the old pos fuel elements for about a month thats a medium pos of your choice and a small pos for starters i needed two moon extractors 1 for each moon 4 silos a simple reactor and the hexite reaction blueprint or whatever it isok so i anchored my poss got them running and anchored the moon extractors and linked them to the silos at each moon the medium pos had just enough powergrid and cpu for my needs as far as the reaction so my moon goo starts filling up in the siloswhat a glorious thing practically completely passive isk generationnow i set the reactor up at the medium pos linked with the last 2 silos one for the platinum i was collecting at the small pos and the other for the finished product the hexiteonce i had amassed enough of each material i started her up it was a beautiful thing i transported the platinum to the medium pos put in the hexite reaction bp and it starts printing isk i had it up for a few months before a large entity at the time asked me nicely to go away i knew my moon harvesting time was over so i bought all hardeners and gunsutility defences and anchored them to both poss and left with a message that ill go down fighting thanks very much if not that at least waste their time a little longer shooting down the poss i left the solo moon mining venture ahead of the gameminus 2 poss in the end it was a great experience trying to find any viable moons is a tough job however in todays evethats why i think rarity 8 and 16 moon materials should be offered in high sec its a fun process to set up and its isk made easywe need prices to go down eve is getting too expensive as far as ingame shipsitems this would contribute to helping lower prices which is good for everyone except the fat cats who profit from gouging the playershave a great day everyone i hope this was enlightening to some it was similar to the lead farmers saga which follows me like a fictionalvirtual ball and chain but these guys just took their moons and didnt go on a crazy rampage making up slanderous stories and threatening me in reallife negatives aside moon mining is great fun and as your csm representative i will look into moon materials being offered in high sec for the benefit of newer or older players i think it would set off a lot of competition and interest too edit  this would also make high sec posscitadels an interest to more people at the moment a high sec pos has limited use and apeal plus as many of us know getting your state standing to 5 can takes quite a bit of grindingkilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better

im yolo swagtron and this man would be a great csm candidategreat in the sense that there would be a drunk 220 pound man passed out in a reykjavik conference room mumbling incoherently about phoenixes and widows while everyone else talks about boring nonsensegiven the results weve gotten from other less professional candidates its clear to me that the jones plan for drunken game design is the only legitimate plan
1 vote for the official sapporo jones pl entry planevery other time weve elected someone to csm theyve left for pl so i can only assume
you care but all of them but do you really care about the little guy that only pops in once in a while but still wants to drop blap dreads on the occasional passerby
can confirm sapporo do carehe wants to make eve a better place and i do belive he would be a great csmrip test without sapporo jones
so does sappo care
sappo the alliance exec of my heart 3
so sapo cares i guess thats goodman i dont know how to shitpost propperly please notice me and teach me your ways senpaioh my gawd im posting under melzy faints
i would like to take this opportunity to remind you all that a vote for me is a vote for this game a vote for this community and tacit recognition that subaru is greater than honda
its probably also a vote for freedom but subaru is more important
but why
heil
i aint going anywhere friend and why because we deserve that representation us in our dank meme dominion others in nullsec krabs in empire all of us we deserve betterand i care so i will run
sieg heil meine fuh i mean my frienti wholeheartedly support this fundraising fleet to run this campaign will begin shortly from jita 44 undock lets make eve great again
im naliao vee and i approve this message
im fencer and me and my pancakes approve this message
this should be fun
the amount of jealousy i have for you right now cannot be measured that said id definately vote for sappo if i knew how
ccp will helpfully produce a guide like they do every year on how to vote i will not in test or in the dominion push myself on our dudes if you want to vote for me you can if you dont want to no hard feelings i believe in the process and i believe in what csm once was and i believe we can make eve great again if we work together
so does this statement mean that if you get elected youll hopefully throw out the space mexicans from eve
first off there are eve related rare pepes but they are rare enough that you havent seen any i might share one if you answer these questionslets say ccp asked for your opinion regarding the skill sucker aur pricing model what would you have you said dont retconare you going to try to participate in balancing discussions what is the csm what does it do do we need you in it what changes would you champion to bring back people who havent played in a whilewhat changes would you champion to bring in new playershow do i know youre not going to get in based on the votes of your dudes and then do nothing like a huge percentage of null leader csm dudesdoes this look like a butt to you people are talking about making eve f2p would you support that how would you recommend implementing a f2p eve to ccp if that was the direction they were looking to go
good questions here is my answers in response to your questionslets say ccp asked for your opinion regarding the skill sucker aur pricing model what would you have you said dont retcon i have been open in test about how i think people should be able to buy small sp packs theres so much you can already buy i dont really see a real problem with it on a personal level ive played eve long enough to see what people can do with literally day one alts when battleships were the largest ship one could aspire to i remember as goons took down a battleship in a fleet of rifters theres more to this game than skillpoints but we cant consistently get that in to peoples brain and at the same time have eve remain approachable in the modern age i think a solid middle ground is purchasable sp im still not clear on how solid the process currently is or whether it is good long term for the game but i think the idea functionally is soundare you going to try to participate in balancing discussions yes if allowed to i would like to what is the csm what does it do do we need you in it the csm is an organized group of active players in the community who act as ombudsman for the players to ccp regardless of principle or image thats the fundamental principle we need diverse people representing diverse interests and those interests should align with player interests i believe i bring value to the organization by being a solid delegate from a player base that is an institution in this game sov null players also i love you and care about you no homo unless some homowhat changes would you champion to bring back people who havent played in a whilei want for jump fatigue accrua changesl changes to sov null mechanics with regards to ui elements and capturedefense process and tools for community organization and involvement there are i feel many ways that through the user interface with some changes and tweaks enable larger communities to function as synergistically as smaller communities what changes would you champion to bring in new playersmore diverse camera options that enable more complicated videos to be taken with in game ui functions the idea of the camera drone is archaic what we have now is orders of magnitude better than what we had but enabling people to create content and then enabling that content to be presented to new players in a way that preserves the spectacle of combat in eve is fundamental to attracting new players how do i know youre not going to get in based on the votes of your dudes and then do nothing like a huge percentage of null leader csm dudesi told test as well as our allies in the dominion that we are not going to do a proper bloc ballot i support that for our bros when they want that support i personally want my friends in test and the dmd to vote their conscience and not vote because i tell them to vote for me given that in the unlikely event i am actually nominated it wont be because i abused the stv with a bloc vote as far as other null leader dudes doing that thats their call the bloc vote has been successful in the past it will be again i will consider myself honored if i am on their ballot but i wont ask for it does this look like a butt to you yes it does it absolutely does
thanks dude heres a rare eve pepe from my collection
that is rare ive never seen that one before here is one of my rarest pepes from my collection
i should of clarified id vote for drunk you
thats my secret
are there any good f2p gamesthe answer is generally no and therefore would most likely make eve bad
emphasis mine phoenixes and widows the two most sp intensive ships that i can fly that no one ever uses sounds like my candidate
im down with brown town
sapporo promises pepe dank memes sapporo will deliver said memes support
lets make eve as a while better
for those who have contempt for the discussion of high sec aggro mechanics70 of the game population lives exclusively in high sec therefore highsec must be engagingthe state of highsec is the state of the game we need reps who understand the risk structure of highsecif we are being honest high sec is nearly perfectly safe if you avoid the pipeline and hubs perfect safety feels good but is not truly engagingcheap war decs reduce the size and quality of corps that declare war so that normal corps can win the super mercs only exist because war is so expensive before retribution a war dec corp with 35 members was normal that means target corps can win and still get playtime when the aggressors are logged offcan flipping was the gateway to pvp it was casual pvp you could dabble in without commitment or expense it was the best pvp mechanic in the game we need it back without it highsec is turning into a boring placewhen i joined i undocked into a carnival of baiters flippers and smacktalkers i feared them but i watched their fights and local chat with fascinationnow noobs undock into pristine silent lonely spacealone there is nothing happening outside station there is nothing in local chat the whole of highsec is full of nothing
explain the mechanics of can flipping to the newer players of eve if set correctly it can counter freighter ganking for profitthx moe didnt think you had a ganker nerf in youthieving pirates discuss integrity anarchist gankers give us laws and whoring mercs cry then blow off clients with insults

do to some job changes i have had to with drawl from running for candidate real life first hope to see you in game and we shall see as things calm down thank you for your support and the conversations that came of this i appreciate your time xiapathos
hi im commander castigatus and this is my favourite csm candidate seriously though nashh is a great guy and a highly skilled and dedicated event organiser i think we would all benefit from him being part of the csmso vote for him or ill shoot you in the face
im one of those people who is considering leaving the gameit seems that the gankers have the advantage even in hisec against solo players and small corporationsit seems to me that ccp favors the gankersim a solo player who wants to play at mining in hisec i dont have time enthusiasm to join a large corporation  from what ive experienced they couldnt help me with the ganking  harassment in any casereading in these forums the major response is to just tell me to leave this gameits as if there is only one way to play this game to my thinking that is not a real sandbox thenis this how ccp feels im wondering
bella jennie wroteis this how ccp feels im wonderingccp falcon wrotei love eve and the core of what the game stands for thats why ive been dedicated to it and its community for over 11 years nowrisk vs reward is a huge part of thathonestly if that changed and the game started to soften out and cater to those who want to have their hand held all the way through their gameplay experience id rather not be working on the project regardless of how many subscribers we had than sell out the core principles that new eden was built onthats a sentiment that i hear a lot around the office because we are all invested in what makes new eden so compelling  the dark gritty hard reality beneath the pretty ships and nebulaseve is built on the core principle that you are never 100 safe no matter where you go or what you do when you interact with another player you roll the dice on whether theyre going to screw you over or not thats a massive part of the social engineering behind the very basic underpinnings of the eve universe
totally agreethanks for laying it out so clearly

hes the head community manager at ccp and has been for years his primary job is to communicate the player base about the game including what type of game ccp is developingyou must not think very highly of ccp if you think they hired some renegade who does not represent the corporate views of ccp and the views of the lead developers of this game you can think anything you want that doesnt change the reality of the situation if you dont like what ccp is selling then go somewhere else thankfully there is no shortage of gaming companies these days developing all sorts of types of games you are not starved for alternatives
have been going around the forums and came across the post above this is something i have always feltthat post and reading ccp falcons extremist views on gameplay have convinced me to quitill check back every now and then to see if they fix hisec the right wayhave fun
best of luck finding a game that suits you better if you like the eve universe and have the means to get your hands on an oculus rift perhaps valkyrie would be more up your alley but i am sure you will have no problem finding something else that is a better fitfly safe wherever you end up
just cancelled all my accounts feels so goodthanks for linking the ccp falcon statement i kind of alluded to it in my reason for leaving ccp refuses to balance hisecccp clearly favors the gankers  griefersscrew ccp falcon and his dark gritty and unsafe anywhere universe he should realize hes a developer not a player 
i warned you about ccp falcons viewsand those are the views of ccp have been ever since the founding of the game people have told you this it is in ccp documents available on their websiteand yet here you are complaining that eve wont change to suit your view of what the game should begood bye and good riddance
you start to sound a lot like admiral foxbolthe represents the interests of ccpalso let me remind you that this is a sandbox which means people can do whatever they want to whoever they wantthere is no such thing as solo gameplay if you sell something on the market another player bought it or some other dude will 01isk pvp youeveryone should have this wallotext popping up before they start the game or make a petition otherwise well keep seeing meaningless threadnoughts that go nowhere
good lordwhat a load of stupid nonsense
the anticipation is killing me
your platform is weak and pretty much pointless i know you have support as ive heard from 1 or 2 peoplethat aside i wish you luck in the campaign have a great dayps i wonder who the goons and such will be told to vote for poor sheep ehkilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better
the perspective is really different from this side of the culture wall as i have said in previous posts addressing this sort of question goons havent made or forced me to do anything a ballot for the entire imperium is made at some point but nobody is going to be kicked from the alliance if they dont vote accordingly
event posted my csm xi profile
the judge is one of those rare people you dont come across too often in life and even less often in a place like eve through all of the dark and shady bits of eve the judge stands apart being incredibly intelligent and very fair he is a man of both tact and composure if i had to use one word to describe him it would be professional he has the ability to always be positive in the face of extreme odds while still maintaining a realistic frame of mind merging seamlessly into any social situation he is able to converse with all types of players on all levels with relative ease because of these things he has been an outstanding diplomat and i am proud to call him friend most importantly though he is passionate passionate about eve and passionate about her players he believes in our community and wants the best for it that passion has led him to run for csm so that he might better the game better the community and better our experienceour alliance is fortunate to have him and if he is elected to csm all of eve will be able to share in that same fortune it is for these reasons that i will be voting for him and urging everyone i know to do the samefor a better experience for a better eve  vote the judge for csm xi
he is one of my top 3 judges along with dredd and judy
had my interview last night with stu from capstable i feel more comfortable with a job interview but my regards to the guys of capstable the bring in the difficult questions peopel are wondering about and give your the opportunity to talk bout them great work thanks for the opportunityfor those that allready want to hear my nice voice pro space truckers in a presentation for red frog on last fanfest
so diana kindly answered some questions for me interview here
greeting capsuleers i hope your having fun today because im not at work leave a post or reply and i will answer promptlyhave a great daythought for the day does anyone do burner missions did anyone ever do burner missions i think it was a poor choice more challenging and profitable lvl 4s wouldve been nice ive got 90 and 60 in caldari and amarr state for standings i for one know the doldrum of grinding missions for weeks we need some more varietykilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better
it is very easy to post ones dislike of someone without resorting to petty personal attacks it is not okay to attack a person in irl for there actions in game this thread has been cleaned keep it that way thx
it seems nonsensical but i would highly recommend you join a nullsec corporation if you want to mine safely and profitably the mechanics of how people play eve in sovereign space with intel channels standing defense and response fleets poss and help close by on 247 communications makes the risk reward options for mining much better in nullsec at least imho why not check out the moosearmy we enjoy all aspects of the game and have great mining anomalies and even 2 ice belts chaching i know its not solo but we have big industry needs and you can play in a solo style if you like with the backing of a nullsec corp and alliance without a lot of requirements the corp is about having fun playing all aspects of eve
never forget fight for the cause
now before anyone gets out the torches on this one please hear me outi know that they already did a rebalance of the mining barges and exhumers but i feel that there was a minor error that i would like to ask to be considered for correctionbefore they changed them covetors and hulks ruled the mining especially in highsec and required med sized ganker fleets to take them down which spawned events such as hulkaggedon as groups sought to shake afk miners out of their apathybut in those days miners either flew covetorhulk or retreivermachinaw while waiting to affordskill up to the larger ships but few ever flew the poor little procurerskiff as they were deemed not worth the money except under specialuncommon conditionsso i was happy when i heard that they would rebalance them and largely was happy with the results the procurerskiff became small tuff little ships capable of mining in slightly hostile environmentsthe retreivermackinaw became like the solo miners bread and butterthe covetorhulk were supposed to become specialized fleet miners but few if any fleets actually use them why because they are terrible too frail to survive if the fleet they are in gets attacked too small of an ore hold to use without orca support too expensive to make worth while so fleets instead use skiffs andor machinaws or their t1 kini think that some discussion should be opened on how best to make the covetorhulk an attractive option without overshadowing the benefits of using the other two shipsmy personal opinion is that it with minor tweaks to armorshieldorehold values say 40 increase to each they would become more attractive to playersbut i would like to hear other peoples opinion regarding this
well thats as obvious as the colour of the sky as votes are confidential i just wanted your thoughts on the sheep who will follow their overseers i dont know what youre talking about a cultural wall there should be no difference in perspective we all play the same gameand im looking to improve the eve experience for everyone not just special interest groups  nullbearlow secwh high sec and ship spinners i have ideas to improve their experience we need more people also as eve is on the wane with in my opinion bad ideas and game changing patches i used to log on weekends and see 5060k now its 20k average this must be addressed or eve online will die read my platform i speak for everyonehave a wonderful dayholeysheet1average eve player who wants our game to prosper also csm candidate who would like your vote check my thread today ps at least if my ideas arent given voice eve population will decrease further and it will give me the opportunity to procure all the dysprosium moons so either waykilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better
one not need have a focus narrowed only to special interest in order to have support from special interest groups
now youre talking rubbish good luck anyways many a politician has gotten voted in with innuendo and lack of integrityhonesty i hope as a csm candidate you listen to possible constituents and dont have a hidden agenda although i fear you dokilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better

hello guysyeah thatUFFFDs another csm application so take a cup of tea and relax during last year i was thinking about how csm is working with players and ccp in general and the more i was thinking about situation the more i was becoming sure that csm is not friendly and open for common player what are we voting for for promises and pink unicorns or are we voting for ballots and alliance members yes itUFFFDs not a secret thatUFFFDs what csm looks like at the moment candidates promise things they canUFFFDt deliver people believe in their promises and in the end we are saying UFFFDcsm isnUFFFDt workingUFFFD iUFFFDll leave promises to other candidates not going to ruin their business letUFFFDs return to the common pilot who doesnUFFFDt know how csm is working what they are doing how they vote about new ccp features sure you can always find articles and blogs but if you canUFFFDt find all csm reports or thoughts in 1 minute youUFFFDll get my point thatUFFFDs a wrong way for csmmy main goal in csm is to make it player friendly and open to public blah blah what are you going to do 1 develop the options for better communication between csm members and players players should see what they voted for how their candidate is voting thinking etc for example it can be periodical reporting or thread on forum with offer and result result players will see how csm is working who they are voted for and make right decision on next csm about their candidate 2 create csm reporting gathered in one place players shouldnUFFFDt spend bunch of time looking for a common and public information opinions voting results accepted and declined ideas proposals from each candidate can be included in such report result players will see activity and productivity of each csm member and they can make their own opinion about each candidate 3 develop rules and criteria to assess csm memebers activity with members being excluded from csm for noncompliance combined with reporting it will make the process more transparent for players and will show true activity of csm membersresult csm will consist only of active members who will represent players in best possible way4 improve communication between csm and players yeah letUFFFDs bring back the practice of threads and proposals on the forums where everyone could write his proposal about features in game and then csm moved it to ccp result csm will become closer to players and stop being mythical group of people who are doing something behind closed doors i canUFFFDt promise you pink unicorns and everything will happen as i wrote but iUFFFDll try to make csm being more public more friendly for players shortly about me playing since 2011 most of my game life i lived in nulls but had periods living in highsecs and lowsecs sorry wh bros i know about your life only on my friendUFFFDs opinions thoughts and reports but i have wish to try wh living to and understand your troubles i love pew pew but itUFFFDs rare when i can get in killmail prefer logi or unusual or support roles in fleets had a period of active taking part in faction warfare had experience with old claim and new claim had experience with production t1 t2 capital ships and modules used pi and moon mining reactions on moons and terrible schemes for p4 on planets are still coming to me in nightmares 0 thanks for reading and have fun

yeahno youre going to have a very hard time finding a game mmo or not where developers arent also players of the game
and to add to thisi vastly prefer a dev who plays the game they create versus a game they create but dont partake inhell most of the features that have made eve what it is were created by devs playing and thinking this could be designed better or people are doing this and it should be enhanced
or it would benefit me if this happened lets not pretend ccp devs have all been altruisticwhat ccp falcon says though is good its just a shame thats not what eve is i mean really everything comes down to isk and isk is easy to make so theres basically no repercussions for doing anything in game the dark gritty hard reality is that once you realise ships are ammo rather than assets its really not as hardcore as claimed bring on permadeath
ccp wrangler once said  eve is a dark and harsh world youre supposed to feel a bit worried and slightly angry when you log in youre not supposed to feel like youre logging in to a happy happy fluffy fluffy lala land filled with fun and adventures thats what hello kitty online is for end of quoteeve is not a single player game albeit it has some single player content eve is pvp even mining is pvpeve is an mmo and its all about pvp and nobody cares if that pvp is consensual or noteverytime i log in im prepared to lose my ship thats the circle of life in eve simple as thatthe sooner you get it the better for you otherwise you will for sure leave the gameif you want to play completely risk averse in 100 security then maybe you should choose a single player game like x3 albion prelude because eve is not that kind of gameand albeit im a hs industrialist myselfi would for sure quit the game if one day i log in and i would know there is not even the slightest danger anymore in hs because thats not what im paying monthly fees forif eve goes the risk averse carebear way im outta here thats for sure
umm no the flimsiness of the hulkcovetor is very much intended they are suppose to be vulnerable and require attention to use safely as well as a support fleet so buffing that so they can be used solo is counterproductive and devalues the other ships that said if they are not being used enough then they should have their strengths buffed a 40 or whatever buff to yield or a corresponding reduction in yield of the other two classes or a combination of both would not be out of place it would make the hulkcovetor more attractive but still force a tradeoff on the miner to choose yield over defense and the ability to operate alone but only ccp has numbers on the relative use of these ships its true i see more skiffs than anything else these days but perhaps that is not representative of the total use of the various mining ships and i do see all of the subcap mining ships being used to some extent although i have yet to see an endurance i am not sure there is even a problem to be honest
i can assure you that plenty of players are using hulks
that is actually good to hear while i have been playing for a while i am not so bold as to think my sampling of people to interact with in any way is an accurate gauge of the total eve populationso i would instead like to shift then to a question of how best to employ covetorhulksthey do not seem capable of reasonable solo mining and seem too fragile for comfort in many potential uses that i can think of aside from mining deep in hisec where concord responds the fastesteven with an orca supported fleet mining activity based on bonuses and such i have trouble seeing where 2 hulks would serve better than 3 machinaw or their respective t1 versions by comparisonperhaps you can shed some light on this for me because right now i am hard pressed to find any reason to use my hulk where the benefit even remotely offsets risking the ship
as a long time null sec resident diplo and role player i fully support fafers bid for csm
you have my full support and vote fafer  3
trust is hard to maintain in eve fafer youve had my trust all these years full hearted support here

greetings comradesmy name is niko lorenzio also known as nikolai vodkov founder of pro synergy and valkyrie dUFFFDark i am not a widely known name in eve i do not have a backing of a large nullsec bloc and i donUFFFDt really have a presence in the eve media i do however have the experience passion and understanding of eve which i believe you may find useful in representing you in csm xiin the interest of your time iUFFFDm going to post a summary of my beliefs and opinions below if you would like me to elaborate my thoughts on a specific subject please do not hesitate to ask either here or by contacting me in person what is the csm and why it matters more than anything else i see csm as playersUFFFD ambassadors to ccp csmUFFFDs small size allows us to have ongoing intimate back and forth discussion with members of ccp i believe this is the main strength of the csm and cannot be substituted by less personal feedback channels like forums reddit etc why will you be an effective csm member i have the experience and knowledge to contribute to the discussionsi have the passion to dedicate myself to the csm for the entire termi am patient honest and a teamplayer which would help with holding dialogue with csm and ccpi can see and analyze an issue from many different anglesi can detach my personal interests from discussions as i have a broad perspective and tend to view things on a macrolevel whowhat do i represent iUFFFDm not running to represent any particular group space or playstyle i want to represent the values which i find fundamental to eve and its success while there are many id like to highlight a few that i feel have been compromised or forgotten in recent yearssocial interaction tools  corp alliance fleet and other communication and organizational tools need much improvement death is a serious matter  risk and losses are important because they gives assets and relationships value meaningful choices  eve should be about long term strategic planning and choices should carry meaningful consequences emergent gameplay  game mechanics and features should give rise to creative unscripted and unpredictable behavior specialists  interdependence between players enriches the universe and fosters cooperation which leads to stronger communities player freedomcontrol  players should be given the freedom over how they experience both the eve client and new eden player agency  over the universe but also over the games development and direction persistent universe  playersUFFFD investments should not be undermined without careful consideration and debate communication  as curators of new eden ccp needs to be open and communicative with content creators players conflict drivers  limited resources limited space strategic locations give value to holdings and provoke conflict these are rather vague so iUFFFDm posting commentary on how some of these would apply to past and current topics citadels i have several concerns regarding the upcoming citadelswe know from past that balancing things with price alone is a terrible idea i would like there to be some kind of limiting factor to promote competition over UFFFDcitadel spaceUFFFD we also need to be careful not to end up with a situation where one entity ends up with a 100 of them in one system making them practically unbeatable possible solutions limit 1 xl per system 1 large per planet 1 medium per moon andor rising fuelmaintenance costs with each additional citadel in systemi dislike the idea of automated transfer current proposal makes it too advantageous to simply abandon the assets rather than attempt to defendevacretrieve them evacs and the emergent gameplay surrounding them should be encouraged possible solutions have the option to retrieve assets from wreck or jettison to safe spots uncollected assets will be available for automated transfer after 30 days possibly add an option for the conquering party to release assets for automated transfer earlieriUFFFDd like to see more interesting options than simply owning or blowing them up ie transferring ownership incapacitating and conquering them carrier rebalance i like the fact that they are breaking up carriers into two distinctive roles encouraging specialists and atk gameplay and reducing dependence on alts ideally all major roles within fleets should be filled by individual pilots with interesting and unique gameplay skill point trading i could write an entire article on this subject but in short i hate this proposal it introduces nonvanity microtransactions to eve it allows for instant specialization into any area reducing dependence on others it tempts people to grind for isk to UFFFDlevel upUFFFD undermining one of the unique appeals of eve  grind free progression it is a massive isk faucet yes faucet not a sink as turning unused idle sp into active sp makes it a faucet regardless of penalties which will further raise the bar of entry and make higher end up shipsskills more ubiquitous and harder to compete with worst of all ccp did not even attempt to communicate their real motivation and reasoning for this proposal to the players refusing to even acknowledge the massive resistance to this changeremoval of language channelschat channels are the first tool that new players use to find and meet other players the language channels were being used by thousands of players on daily basis but more importantly they were used by newbros to find their native communities their removal is a big loss for eve and makes no sense whatsoeverthe csm xi election are now open until march 25th 2016 consider niko lorenzio for csm xi

something i was asked last campaign  can you highlight weakness in the game design and link to possible ways they can be fixed i believe my following answer still holds true in fact now more than everessentially it boils down to me that the focus needs to be on customization and player drivenunique solutions to overall balance for instance when ccp generally thinks of balance they consider how they can better move us to the right decisions based on some predetermined ship archetypes and given specificationsi see it much differently this game like no other has embraced the very foundation of economics and material acquisition that should be used to drive balance from within the player base through real invention and tweaking of products in the manufacturing process more like being given a bag of ingredients that we discover how to put together better based on a more fundamental approach to attributes specifications and parameters so instead of changing an attribute tag on a ship and making the mass artificially some number that should be a function of all the crap you put on it plus materials used in construction etc along with efficiencies in design and whateverso while the ship othe day meme never gets old it does always say the same thingcookie cutter top down design doesnt work innovation needs to come from those that actually make use and need it etc and not by committee but by individuals experimenting and literally inventing drafting and building custom ships from the raw materials available throughout the eve universeto me that is the ultimate waaay on down the line endgame and not something i would imagine would just be implemented but rather a philosophy of thought driven towards so that progress can be made in that direction over time nothing in eve feels like it is mine even though i may have minedharvested the components or done the reactions etc etc etc at the end of all that work i get some thing that is the same as all the other things with no more or less value and all i did was jump through the right hoops for the sake of it that can extend to all sorts of aspects of the gamethis means moving towards a model where the invention and manufacturing processes actually have an outcome on the ship and that is where numbers tweaking and modifications happen by the players eve has done a remarkable job at creating a market and economic system based on player based manufacturingessentially it requires a different mentality building and invention are actually just that the baseline physics mechanics and engine are all that are really needed ship modules and composition along with various choices in building would provide the customization and performance balance on a daily basis by the players really inventing blueprints and making manufacturing choices when executing a buildthat is essentially the tldr though i have said it better elsewhere
im going to support this candidate she is really nice
wasnt it ccp leloos jobnot a single thing about the game or have i missed something

my vision is1 csm works not as planned is there leloos fault or not this is fact2 we need to start move csm forward to what players want from this council3 what players really want imho  transparent feedback they want to know that ccp hear players admit mistakes and moves forward4 with better feedback we can understand why this or that new features or fixes can or cant be implemented

my father was a hungarian immigrant i was born in canada i appreciate my roots and wished my father was still around so i could learn more about the culture one thing that i did learn is that hungarians are the best at everythingwhile i am humble these days i tend to agree with himconsiderr a vote for me for csm i will represent you the player and create a better starting experience as well as try to entice more to come to our game ps the skoda was yugoslavian now i rememberkilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better
good morning capsuleers on this february 9th 2016my topic today is ganking i was convod by someone asking me whether i support ganking i have always had a pod popping toon based in perimeter who ganks autopilot pods it can be good fun and can really tick someone off i did this even before implants were displayed on killmails so you would have to judge its worth by hate mail you receivedon the flip side ive tried the tornado and hauler gank and scoop technique in amarr it can be very profitable and fun i havent had that much success but one time a hauler i popped gave me 13 billion in lootive never taken part in a freighter gank but have watched many people just need to haul less so youre not such a juicy target i wouldnt want to say i am a pioneer of ganking but code definitely perfected the arti know also the sting of being ganked why just this weekend i was writing on the forums and had one of my toons on the uedama gate in sivala while writing i looked over to see my guardian in structure then pop at least i got the pod out mid grade slaves phew i know there are 2 sides on this but i think ganking has become an integral part of eve and players must take precautions to avoid monetary losskilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better
i fight in lowsecnullsec i oppose jump fatigue im antigooncfc i support changes that make the economy better eg removing fatigue to promote largescale capital warfare i oppose changes that make the economy worse eg ratting buffs that increase inflationi oppose parts of fozziesov but see benefits in what some smaller alliances have been able to do i absolutely oppose jump fatigue on jump freightersrorquals and on any industrial ship being bridged i believe geography for regions and pirate factions should matter more than how many r64s you can control and how profitable escalations are

while i dont support an increase of hulk and covetor tank for the reasons given by earlier posters i do agree that there is an inbalance in the numbers of different types of mining ships in use in highsec its certainly possible that the hulks and covetors are mainstays in null my experience there is low but i have noticed an occasional large covetor fleet in providence while passing though obviously to a player like myself seeing a giant covetor fleet brings on the same reaction as going into a golden corral however in highsec its all skiff and procurers with the occasional retriever the somewhat rarer hulk and the lessseenthanbigfoot covetor usually when the eve community makes an overwhelming choice for one platform that platform is due for a nerf see drakes and hurricanes however it can be done with buffing now carebears have always been extremely risk adverse but not more than three years ago before the ships were redone there were lots of retrievers and mackinaws despite their relative gankability this reflected the state of ganking at the time but also the calculation of mining efficiency versus tank this leads to what my actual point is its not that the covetors and hulks have too little tank its that the procurers and skiffs are too productive relative to their less tanky bretheren so maybe instead of making the covhulk safer they make the procskiff less productive or if you prefer buffs make the other mining ships more productive and leave the mining battleships where they are then there is a real tradeoff a miner could sit safely in his procurer and watch a more daring competitor melt the ice away at a much faster pace a safe carebear is a happy carebear but to some miners the loss of income would matter and they would use some of the other ships i realize the selfserving nature of incentivizing miners to get out of procurers and skiffs but anyone who visits a highsec ice field can see in an instant that there is no variety of choice among the miners no tradeoffs no calculations just an attempt at safety and with it afk mining silent local chat and general noninteradtion thats badtldr the massive over representation of procurers and skiffs in highsec mining is proof that there is an unbalance and it should be addressed by buffing if possible by nerfing if necessary by choosing to mine in new order systems highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct wwwminerbumpingcom
hello alli dont know if this has been suggested before but i believe it would be nice to have your characters standing with npc corporations  falcuties in eve gate similar to how you can see your skills since standings are used for multiple things in the eve universei know for one would use it constantly since i do most of my calculations and dealings while i am at work and cant log into the game during that time what do you believeany feedback would be much appreciated
mr hyde 2016think i just found the only person i am voting for this year
i have had the pleasure of flying with joffy for nearly a year now and he is someone i have always looked up to as a player he is a passionate and knowledgeable young man and i believe he will make an excellent lowsec representative on the csm he gets my vote
awesome guy got good ideas for eve one of the best diplos out therealways welcome for a chat
here have a bounty
bounty hunter could be a legitimate professionmake it a random missiontype endeavor from concorde agents you dont get to choose the target which avoids gaming the system and it pays a flat rate  of the bounty for bringing back the corpse to the concorde agentyou would have to have a nonnegative security status but would not suffer any security loss for killing your target and podding themjust an idea
firstly i am not your friend secondly you do realise that by hiding behind the cloak of anonymity you are indeed comparing yourself to the shakespeareasanonymouscommittee theory as well as meaning what you said in your previous posta rose by any other namegl tora  hollyshit apparently doesnt have a valid passport you are see and pees official great white hope
dont forget to cc i cc i v i c c i v e v i c c i v e t e v i c c i v e t o t e v i cc i v e t o v o t e v i c c i v e t o t e v i cc i v e t e v i c c i v e v i c c i v i c c i ccits the right choice
i support this
bumpcome on empire dwellers lets make some change together
it would seem i let my passport expire a while back as i dont like flying anything but spaceships its a technicality as i can get it renewed post haste however if this puts me out of the running i hope some intelligent people with good ideas will be voted in this year lets make the new player game experience better lets attract more subscribers dont let special interest groups run the game good luck candidates and this thread was fun remember our game needs some cardio pulmonary resuscitation or it might diekilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better
im looking at the bright side as this gives me an early start for next year if this years councils ideas ruin the game further cest la vie my job next year will be tougher although if average numbers drop below 10k i will probably find something else to fill my timei endorse any council member to use my ideas they are written here and dated so i would appreciate some mention that they were my ideasif i do happen to show up on the ballot vote for the guy who loves eve and has great ideas i remember years ago a forum post i wrote on a covert ops mining ship the t2 venture was built and i got no credit youre welcome ccpkilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better
i believe it t doesfarewell and dont forget to keep to your reformed waysps how can one not have a valid passport on hand at all times inconceivable
 your comments deserve no answer as far as your bounty on me i will match it if you ever get one which you wont youre a mildly annoying troll thats all you will ever be in eve although your actions make you look more a fanboy im unsubscribing this thread so continue talking to yourself by all meanskilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better
since we cant choose which npc corporation were dumped into after leaving a pc run corp i still dont understand this lack why not give these factions their own fighting chance as a selection in pilot creation as starting empire to fly under their colors it would really open up a lot more options in new eden not to mention that zing of extra spiceas a matari nationalist i fight this unreasonable oppression not much better than slavery under amarrian overseerslet the loyalists of the serpentis corporation guristas pirates angel cartel and sansha nation have their rights to freedom defense modules and pursuit of factional warfare systemsoppression and slavery bad freedom very tasty indeedjeven
hulks are intended to be used in group operations having a dedicated hauler makes using hulks worthwhile you can also mine into freight containers
as i mentioned during my interview if i am elected i plan to establish communication channels with those players that have voted for me i would ask ccp to create a mailing list in game with all the pilots that would have voted for me but i do not know at that stage if this can be doneso in case it would not work and if you plan to vote for me please post a simple i will vote for you in the thread below and if i am elected i will contact you when establishigg my csm town halls contacts list to hear your voice for the game style we representif you belong to a group whose goal is to ensure independantminded candidates like me cant be on your voting ballot use a neutral alt to post below and make sure to monitor your ingame mailbox if i am electedthanks for your support
joffy is a great guy  always friendly helpful honest and fun to have around he will make a great csm member of that i am sure i think his combination of passion for the game itself rather than the metagame his dedication and drive will help him leave his mark vote joffy
hicould you ask for an downstack option for items in your inventory have a stack of items broken down to smaller stacks of a requested quanity just right click on a stack of items and have a downstack option with a place to request quantities of each downstack say you have a stack of 20000 missiles click on it then enter the stack quantity you want 2000  4000  200 or what ever you need  and perhaps an option for how many stacks or the whole stack that you currently have selectedstrawberry
if we must have a csm make sure it has good people like jintaan  rather than dangeroustothefutureofevecandidates
hi loreleii told jintaan that i do not recommend he run for csm this year i feel ccp is pretty closed minded lately and ignores feedback there is a particular lynch pin team that i believe is steering eve into dangerous water they feed into the immediate self gratification crowd and they outright ignore csm feedbacki will be voting for xenuria because i think that is what ccp deserves this yearhowever i would like you jintaan and a few others there to crowd out people like tora he is quite delighted if his minions attack other candidates and shout them down so keep pushing forward and dont let someone like that wini will direct anyone i come across that wants a to youmy best wishesjen
even though i only had a small number of votes last year i was consoled by the belief that my efforts took away votes from toras ability to achieve a csm seattora is irrational does not believe in a clean fight and is rather happy if his minions attack other candidates and shout them downhe then declared one of those laughable wars on a null sec alliance throwing away isk and believing he was achieving something
thanks you get a like for thatand they are called marminions creator  orions lord
you too have achieved a gold star say 1000 more words and you can unlock two gold stars on your quest to find the the like and get likes thread renewed thread
like it or not your gameplay reflects your characterrli made this so long because i did not have time to make it shorter blaise pascal
i understand that i sometimes feel like one of these actors who always play evil roles and people on the streets keep telling them how mean they are thats the downside of being a good actorrole player
oh there are definitely people who pretend to be villains in eve but you can usually spot them by their out of character commentsyou are consistent in all contexts that we see of you
i am really interested in what these things are that you name as consistent between him roleplaying and him seriously discussing stuff for csm can you please elaborate and tell me which these things are
i do not believe his intentions for this and feel it is a personal axe he grinds about paying and not being able to slaughter this is a hopeless idea with skill injectors even based on account age nowhe quotes a study by ccp that had very narrow windows in it and is being applied far more generally with regards to new players being killed or in fights and their staying or leavingie grasping at straws to push a killer agenda so he makes a farming corp with an alt gives people roles and then station camps themi am not even half way into his mix of propaganda and laid out agenda i would think so much of this is obvious at a glance
torathough i would like to enter discussion with you on wardecs and possible changes i have a different topic to ask you about with regards more so to high security spacehow do you really feel about the bounty hunter profession and how you might change the way mechanics work now for bounties and hunting to work as an actual engaging experiencemy thoughts on it in simplicity would be1 only allow random target assignment from a concord agentpreferably a losec agent2 allow for full individual bounty payment meaning 1 person put a 10mill bounty on target not the 2 billion total by example that could mean 200 separate 10mill missions when corpse is turned into agent3 bounty hunter is given free kr activation for that target only with regards of being unable to activate any other kr options and if he does not get the pod has to return to agent for another free kr token4 bounty hunter is supposed to be law enforcementif they gank do something to achieve gcc they get dumped to a red sec status immediately and are unable to accept bounty missions for 90 days
and here is the csm watch interview many thanks to the guys for having meface the enemy as a solid wall for faith is your armor and through it the enemy will find no breach wrap your arms around the enemy for faith is your fire and with it burn away his evil
there is a god
as of this week ccp guard thats me and ccp logibro have been handed management of the csm any questions or queries regarding the csm project should be directed to either of us in the futuredont forget to vote in the coming electionccp guard  eve community developer  ccpguard
a welcome to the new csm overlordshow does the new administration feel about noted spaceship pilot sion kumitomo
this is great news as ive liked ccp guards enthusiasm and ccp logibro has done very well regarding at organization and support of 3rd party tournaments1 from me
man i love ccp guard but i am sad to see falcon go 
luv you long time
hes an idiot
is ccp willing to comment on this change beyond announcing itdoes this change have any effect on recent white paper modifications
love guard
best of luck to the new team tootmaybe you should inject reading comprehension and train it to 1
cool
id love to if there was any point nullsec voting blocks determine the csm as always
interesting news great people to work with
not entirely you know
we in the nullsec voting blocs love this attitude because it improves the power of our votes
were still around of course ill still be keeping a keen eye on the csm but right now im super mega busy with work across quite a few different projectsthings are in good hands with guard and logibro even if the latter is a ginger ccp falcon  eve universe community manager  ccpfalcon
meanieshush steve we all know youre a gewn pawn
my bro
every new meeting should open up with ccp guard rapping maybe for hot topic issues a streamed rap battle between ccp guard and the csm allowing us to elect csm members based on rap skills
i am fairly sure the blocs encourage that belief it can become a self fulfilling prophecybut as steve said above    the proof is not really there sugar holds the permanent seat right now and i would lay real isk on the bet steve will next term cand the blocs elect some reps yup can they control the council bwa ha ha ha haaaaaaaaum i mean    nopemmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
thats right if youre not part of a nullsec bloc dont bother to votedo bother to tell your friends not to vote though
while i applaud the sentiment youre not going to get anywhere wmizhara im afraid
so the csm is now in a top and bottom sandwich you get it eventually
the csm just got 1000 more woop i would like to announce my csm candidacy which is really just a selfish ploy to skype with ccp guard all the time
the blocs rpobably would if there was any need to bother people tinfoil themselves out of relevence quite well all by themselves
thats a good thing that  at last  ccp tries by many ways till a year and a half now to minimise blocs influence in game and in csmthe game can now goes on his progressive path shutting down conservatism and reluctance for its most glorious futuredid i say politic 
are you still allowed to answer yes to all of our questions
can i vote blank this year would love to not skew the poll with my votes just to get the trinkets or even better have the option to vote against the csm entirely not that i expect you to shut it down should that option win but more to give us the option of receiving your trinkets while still making the conscious choice to not vote for a system we might not like or believe in

here is the csm watch interview with sogor for the csm 11 electionenjoy
here you say that highsec is pretty balanced but that you want to be on the csm to squeeze as much entertainment out of the game as possible regardless of how badly ccp want to kill all the funyet in the damage control thread you are all in the face of people that see how those changes might affect entertainment for many peoplehow can you expect anyone to vote for you when your words there dont appear to match what you claim hereadditionally is the current arguing in the other thread how you plan to collaboratecommunicate with ccp and other members of the csm if you dont agree with them
it was only a matter of time till the crying came herehighsec is pretty balanced but that doesnt magically transform into dont change anything freighters are going to require more effort to gank and with current bump mechanics gankers have all the time in the world to do that your opinion is noted its not going to change mine as for the level of discourse im expecting ccp and the csm to be less qq more this is a problem i propose x im not going to pretend to be polite to people who have no intention of being constructiveplease dont branch that debate into here because isd is going to prune it out and then youll complain that im censoring youisd please leave that post alone
what crying i use webs with my freighter alt so the change will have no effect on methats not what im interested in with 50 candidates for the csm making an informed decision about who to vote for is important for anyone that values voting for good peopleso the other thread is irrelevant now as the response here seems to provide all the information i needed there are 49 other candidates out there not accusing someone of crying for simply asking an important question about approach to consultation and communication and many whos statements in their csm thread are consistent with what they say elsewhere
i use web alts too when i have to hit highsec most freighter pilots do and those that dont i suggest they adopt the practice i wont ignore whining but i wont pretend it isnt whining just to make somebody feel good i want whats best for the game not whats best for a loud minority use your vote to better eve how you see fit not to make a statement on an internet argument
here is the csm watch interview with viceran phaedra for the csm 11 electionenjoy
such as he predominate use of the catalyst for ganking over the other destroyersboth the procurer and retriever previously received a 25 reduction in yield i disagreed with the retention of the procurer and retriever in the first place they should have been retired instead of shoehorning yield bonus to replicate 3 strips give the coveter 4 mids and enough grid for 2 lse and the hulk 5 mids preserving the legitimate fitting choice which the major of ships follow
at least you believe in trinkets
as a fallback option you could also check out the candidates who are running on the off chance that at least one of them doesnt offend your sensibilities
neat i like both of those people
wow extra reason to hope that i make it in both very pleasant people from what ive seen
moving back to a multi month minute release to help stretch out the anticipation
i would like the prospect of killrights being award for ship loss and not juat a pod loss my ships are more important than pod and in most cases can cost more balance out killrights and ammend ganking in one gospace cadet online  a wee blog about my exploits mass of wrecks  public npsi events fleet  launching 28th august
i want the csm to discuss issues with the account management page and payment these issues have become a problem since the release of skill extractorsinjectors i want the csm to ask about what steps are taken to assure backend stability when a new sale or service is announced
are live events from the past dead and from now you will use this new format engagement what does it means more love for normal low secfour way fw whenstill in plans ccp quant still owes us somethingrebalance of factionpirate ammo so that it is used 
whats there to discuss reallydiscussion is when theres a back and forth on things when both parties have more to say than fix this pleasethats more suited to just a quick waving about in one of our chat channels
kill rights are granted on a criminal act not a pod lossin highsec youll get kill rights just for being shot in a ship or podin lowsec youll get kill rights for being shot in your pod doesnt need to kill youin wspace and null you wont get them
you go judge  your the right guy for the job
new player focusspit balling some new ideasf12 help menu tutorial videos linked with in new player agent missionshave these videos play on the captains quarters all dayhere is why i want to represent the new players i recruit only new players not only do i have a finger on the pulse i know the questions they ask every time lets look at how a new player experiences the start of the game and address the learning cliff and get more new accounts to sub and player past the tutorial instead of getting confused and quit
of mayonnaise
no actually the gankers are using the catalyst just like intended they fit it for max dps at the expense of all other considerations which is one of the many ways to fit a destroyer
fitting is the not the issue for the catalyst it is pointing that the catalyst an overwhelming choice for one platform
i have wanted a way to abolish the csm or vote against candidates for yearshow i would have loved to vote against mittens before his melt down
eve roadmap w ccp seagullquestion will the new areas of the universe behind the stargates be free for subscribers  it was not specifically mentioned free expansions UFFFD you will never be charged for an eve expansion  as the eve universe grows so do the benefits of your subscriptionsource
eve expansions always were freeif i remember correctly for example wow has a sub and players still have to pay for new expansions
why i will vote for xenuria
with regard to your yearslong campaign regarding the csm it is at this stage difficult to think of anything youd have done differently if you really were a goon alt the whole time
i guess i stared into the game designs of fozzies team too long
bobmon has my vote good man
i would love to have this so yes i would def ask about thisi know i would love to see in addition to downsizing a stack1 adding a split stack on the right click menu the current way of shift and dragging away is a bit annoying imo plus the popup you get saying there isnt any room left is kind of silly since you are just splitting the stack not moving it to another location this functionality is there since its in the contract system so should be easy to make it a general to stacks of items2 the right click on contracts to split stack should be reworked where the checked off goes to the stack amount you split to rather than the original stackwould def love this thanks for bringing it up
vote wyld he understands me he also has a sexy man voice
overall i want eve to be a better game it is already a great game on many levels what can be improved without breaking itscarcity drives conflict from null sec anomalies to high sec missions there is a lack of scarcity npcs can be overharvested  driven from systems just as mission runners can find that the agent ran out so many people asking cleared out their todo inventory anomalies build up in systems again agents give players a number and the player can get another mission from somewhere else until the agent has something they need handled againsome people talk about more direct assaults on planetary interaction which has many existing lines of assault such as poco and ship shooting the evolved project legion could bring in a bounty system where a player pays to have an entire planet assaulted and pugs from project legion carry out the actual assault and defense of planetary structures the attacker pays a large upfront bill based on the number of command centers while each owning defender pays a fee based on how successful or unsuccessful the assaults where in addition to any repairs needed to bring the facility back online the fees of course would be paid directly to the mercenaries more later
i support this
i support the concept but we should always also look at the tools that are currently available
what are your intentions with how this interacts with insurancea pilot by default has 40 insurance on a t1 hull with a 100 bounty on default insurance you reintroduce profitable altfarming to capture bountiessome other pilots would be happy with this as an outcome
wow tell you what ill laugh if this guy gets in1 for complete inability to demonstrate respect for different game styles and the actual objective of the csm this guy clearly wants everyone to play his way or not at all a great vote for the degradation of the already delicate relationship between ccp  csmwhat about all the other content in eve
voting against candidates is usually achieved by voting for candidates other than the ones you hate
mainly ship balancet3 cruisers when are they going to get their balance pass and what will we end up with the original long term plan was to have them balanced to land between navy cruisers and t2 as it stands they not only invalidate most specialized cruisers but also the battle cruisers above them and even battleships in fleetsstrategic destroyers blatantly overpowered they jave invalidated not just af but most frigates and all of their t1 destroyer counterparts stand no chance what are ccps plans to bring them into linelogistics with the changes being made to capital logistics are there any plans for working on subcap logistics to allow smaller fleetscorpsalliances to do damage to the other side as it stands if you cant break the enemies logi there is nothing you can dofreighter buff with the changes to dcu mods all ships are getting 33 structure resists including freighters why does ccp feel a ship that couldnt even fit a dcu should be getting compensated also does ccp realize that this will mean the anasha jump freighter will be hitting 1 million ehp with this change
minutes when read and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
theyll be a while but not a dolan while
got to spoiled with last two summits i guess with minutes going live almost right after summit day was over read and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
i will vote for you
if ccp wants to turn off the potential isk faucet then ccp could remove insurance payouts from paying out to a character if the character has a bounty on them until the bounty is exhausted currently you lose the insurance payout if you are concorded so it would not be a huge step to add losing the insurance benefit if you have bounty on you and such a step would add an extra punitive level to placing bounty on a character
interview audio
very cool guy always trying to help people in game big thumbs up for this guy annx
i dont even care for your campaign i will vote you if you promise to be as annoying as you are on the forums if you visit them in island
if anyone has any ideas or changes to add to this proposal please feel free to post them along with your supportdmc
im not sure i like the direction of a couple of things so i thought id post them here to see if im missing something1 with skill injection eve has become at least for a time pay to win a new player with access to loads of cash could be flying a t3 cruiser with all the tech 2 fittings a supercarrier or any other ship or all of them in a day or two yes eventually people will run out of skill points they want to get rid of for isk but the idea that eve would be pay to win even temporarily just rubs me the wrong way thats the small issue2 destructible stations and citadels all this looks like to me is painting big red targets all over null sec for pl to run around killing just because it will cost other players isk thats all they do even a decent sized alliance is either going to have to align with one of the two or lose 70b isk every few months when pl comes around and when alliances start losing 70b a pop to pl and players lose billions of isk because of the ships and equipment that were in them youll have mass departure from eve in the present circumstance you live with pl coming around maybe move a few systems away to let them do what they do but you dont have to put up another 70b isk to move back with destructible stations and citadels you do because when pl comes around theyre going to level everything they want the big isk numbers they want the massive kills theyre like locust anything in their path gets destroyedand if stations and citadels are destructible they will be destroyed too null sec will become a barren wasteland of uninhabited systemsand thats a bigger problemif youre going to tell me that i should mount a defense or find allies youre cluelesspersonally if i have to move out of null sec because pl is destroying stations where my stuff is im done im out im not playing in npc stations

i am glad for your vote but dont see me as a weapon if you can help it
xavier azabu is a cool dude and keeps his word 1 while pve is not exactly my primary interest in the game its good someone tries to make the experience better for those who concentrate their gameplay on that
erika is great she cares about so many aspects of eve including industry invention pve pvp you name it 
hey stevestill love your tools and from what i can tell you are doing a great job on the csmhow taxing has this term been for you are you dealing well with the workload and drama and do you have time and motivation left to actually play the game
its been a touchtaxing yes i dont like having to deal with some of the drama thats been kicked up but its part of the job soi still have plenty of time and motivation to play havent been making as much as i used to so my isk is slowly decaying but i still have enough to go out and have fun with
i have played eve with the judge for a while now he has always been an insightful and honest player he has a great prospective of the game throughout many gameplay options he would be a great member for the csmthe judge for csm
tora what are your thoughts about changing it to where you cant drop corp when your corpalliance gets war decd or it costing isk to drop corp during a war i understand its a problem for the high sec merc communitythanks
i would disagree with you you get to put on a mask and be whoever you want in eve you might be a doctor in real life and a pirate in eve it might be that break from reality that you need
im against it because that would mean if youre perma decced you have to stay with a corp you do not like also sometimes we mercs get hired to disband a corpalliance paying to get out of the war as a playermmm neh to much for me
will be on the declarations of war podcast this weekend as part of the round table event

here is the csm watch interview with bilbert lashlily for the csm 11 electionenjoy
ccp removed the ability to publicly view other characters standings a while back and unfortunately i dont know the reasoning behind that presumably your proposal will be a nonstarter on the grounds that it would violate their previous actions however if your standings were viewable just by you that would be fine and youd get a 1 from me 
no it hasnt a new player could technically get the skills required for a command ship or t3 or whatever right from the get go thats truebut they wont have the skill to fit it or fly it theyll still be as clueless as to fittings how to fly it or game mechanics so much so that theyll probably lose it to a player who is flying a cheaper ship but has the knowledge and experience to fly it effectivelyyou obviously have a political axe to grind here which leads me to ponder how the average player would benefit from these changesif at all good if thats how you feel kindly disembark whining nullbears are just as bad as their highsec cousins you may contract your sp and possessions to me i will make sure they get nonwhining use
i wish i could say good luck because both of you are good people and good devs but the csm idea is fundamentally brokenplayers want to win so whatever feedback they give serves only one purpose to facilitate changes that helps them win and make others lose and of course theyll keep leaking because early information means fast adaptation and trillions on the market while engaging with a limited selection of players on the forum to decrease the noisesignal ratio would be good the csm cannot be salvaged especially after the document of shame where they united in their will to remove wars and rat forever in safety  and ccp accepted their feedbacki will keep boycotting the csm elections and call everyone listening to me to do the same
there really arent enough good things to say about joffy he has many great qualities including his insane love for this game but i think the one that will be most useful for him as a csm member would be the fact that hes one of the most level headed people you will ever meethe knows this game inside and out and hes one hell of a solo pvper hes the gold standard in stfr i think his platform is one that is easily overlooked i think he will be able to help bring great insight to ccp for how to make the game more accessible for people with some manner of disabilityplus hes coolall my votes go to joffy
thanks quitrix you know that i almost never rat anyway check out my killboard however pve is important to the game because it can often lead to pvp
vic has a deep working knowledge of the game and a passion for explaining and teachingvote vic
here is the csm watch interview with chiimera for the csm 11 electionenjoy
hi dotoo foopls can i ask if you think it would be a viable request to ccp to allow single player ships who are out and about in null low or high trying to enjoy parts of them game not involving pvp or wanting to engage in pvp at that time to have one evac mod or ability to use once every 24 hours or 48 hours for example so when a gank group turn up to just destroy your ship when you have no chance of figthting back you at least have the option like i said above to use an evac that instantly warp your ship back to a safe spothome station  be like a jump clone but for shipsi know so many ppl who get fed up with the game and stop playing because they were out trying to enjoy other elements of the game and then lose 23 ships in 12 days or even just a few hours because they just keep gettig ganked while trying to enjoy something in the game instead of pvpingi truly belive you should have one chance every now and again to evade a gank group even if the ability can only be used once a week although i believe it should be more like once every 2448 hours if the pilot decides to go out again with their ship after using the evac then its there decision then to risk losing their ship while not being prepared or wanting to pvp in the ship they are inplease let me know your thoughts on thisps i also belive you should be able to use this ability if you are completely solo  so not in a fleet or a group with your friend  you must be playing solo to use this ability it could be rig you can fit or module or just a new ability added to all ships anyway these all just a variety of suggestions regarding this one topic on evacing your ship to safetythanksdravenhawk
20 k people dont log in in the peak because they dont need to they have a lot of plex stashed and a lot of skills in skillqueue maybe they will come back now while you can inject more sp so they will not have to wait until carrier lvl 5 completes

i hate to dig this here out of the woodshed but in case this point wasnt already made gratuitious violence in high security space is actually good for the economy  destruction of ships creates more demand for shipsreplacement modules  destruction of ships causes more mineral consumption which drives up market prices  destruction of ships causes those involved in the market to be more profitablewhat can be deduced from the above is that most industrial type pilots are involved with markets as they have to buyselltradebuildharvestetc with that said they will be more competitive with these activities what can also be deduced is the ones crying about being suicide ganked likely are afk mining the ones crying about being suicide ganked likely are fit for yield as opposed to having any tank on their ships the ones crying about being suicide ganked likely dont consider using siege warfare modslogisecurityfurthermore the ones complaining about suicide ganks the most are the ones that dont realize high security is just that high security not absolute security undocking your ship is consenting to pvp whether wanted or not combat in high security is not going away consensual war or otherwise preying on the weak is an acceptable tactic see asset denialroute denialso with that if it really hurts your delicate sensitivities that badly show us on the doll where the gankers touched you give me your stuff enter biomass queue over i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
sowhen did the first nerfs to hs ganking take placewhen did the trend in players online start going down granted not proof the coincidence of these two things would indeed be suggestiveif there is a coincidence
hell i dont see it as 13 persons working on that features in reasonable timespan please think more about it as if you would be the team leader 
something to consider is wis stands currently as a testament to the eve community being promised something and then the rug being violently snatched away due to the moaningcryingpingbing of a group which while large in numbers does not fully represent the eve demographic the community at large or anyone other than their own interests yes the microtransaction thing when represented as p2w was bad however this is exactly why the older players are leaving are jaded or have not faith in anything said about new features presented features need to be completed as the playerbase will not have any faith in the continuation of eve and more will unsubtheres my two bitsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
didnt realize they had it before and removed it but i did mean that i would be the only one able to view my standings in eve gate so that i could say do refining calculations or check if i can put a pos in high sec and etc just will save some people the hassle of logging in just to check them like i mentioned i do lots of my calculations while im at work and cant log into the game d
hey mike you were a great accountability buddy on the csm ill repeat this again since the company is showing clear sign of hubrisagain by ignoring customer feedback on their own forums there is noreason why we should have a player representative counsil anymore regards a freelancerps tyvm sugar steve and mike for your time and effort with respect o7

you are on my shortlist for votes but i have a few questions for you did you do any interview about your platform if yes where and if not why not what kind of new content would you promote for wh  what is your experience with c5 and c6  what do you think about the csm candidates piloted stealth changes to null sec exits a few months back
you have my votesbest luck
hi jenthanks for stopping bycampaigning this year has been a world of difference from last year in fact pretty much every one of my supporters that i have taken up contact with has come back with sorry not voting the csm sucks  are goon pets  is outdated  does nothing or some variant of this phew but more on that later maybe in a blog post

if elected to the csm i will provide reasoned feedback based on my rl experience as a technology change management professionali will not be a showboating metaclown distraction writing dissertations on how to make enemies and remain ineffectual if you want someone who doesnt give a crap about popularity contests or metagaming bs and just likes solving problems and offering logical solutions based feedback then please vote for me with all the csm drama and crybaby antics its about time the csm grew a saq a big fing harry saqjust sayin
you have my votesbest luck

i am generally the hunted rather than the hunterwe already have modules that allow us to escape unwanted pvpcloaks warp core stabs ecm sensor damps staying alignedcyno ships especially covert cynos when you are in a blackops battleship work wellfor everywhere but wormholes we have local especially useful in null and lowsec even in wormholes there are plenty of explorerssolo players abound in eve
thanks borat i still have my shortlist to do and a little more reading but like what i have read so far
you have my votesbest luck
you are on my shortlist for votes but i have a few questions for you did you do any interview about your platform if yes where and if not why not you say you want to represent all high sec there is a fundamental difference of play styles and objectives between gankers and regular high sec denizens like new bros or those that simply do not wish to risk their assets and remain in high sec others are already running to represent clearly the gankers why are you qualified to represent all of high sec ccp has given gankers a boon in february with increasing hp of wrecks and in march will increase the hull hp of all ships by 33 something gankers are now crying about where do you stand on those changes
good luck brad hope all goes well for you i look forward to being in contact with you again as ive recently returned to eve i miss wh days perhaps part of your csm representation could be some sort of order or unification of jovesleeperdrifter and amarrmercjamyl lore compilation as it seems all very diluted and is related to wh anoikis space i know your focus is pvp but eve lore is so overlooked its sad such a rich canvas covering such an expanse and year after year its white washed or a dog biscuit is given to us when there an 8 course meal to be had anywho youll have my vote and perhaps we can fly together in the future again
the catalyst was chosen as the primary gank ship because it had the ability to sacrifice everything else for dps it combined this with a low training threshold and low expense to make it a suitable choice for early new order gank fleets since then vexors brutixs talos and thrashers have been more and more common based on the situational needs of the particular gank that being said the catalyst remains the preferred platform for the solo and small fleet gankers part of this is due to the ship replacement program in the new order which pays for only a few types of ships most generously the catalyst it is also the case that the ganking guides are mostly catalyst based and of course the prestige the cat has aquired as the preferred steed of the agents of the new order catalyst means new order and new order means exploding miners and exploding miners means the saving of highsec its natural that other gankers would want to be part of such an inspiring movement so they fly catalysts too goons excepted of course as they were early adopters of the cat for their own reasons as i said earlier i would be fine with increasing the efficiency of the covetors and hulks rather than nerfing the tank of the procs and skiffs so to be fair i would also be fine with increasing the lethality of the other destroyers while leaving the catalyst as is its certainly completely in line with new order philosophy to improve the pvp capability of everyone in eve no matter what pvp ship they choose to fly by choosing to mine in new order systems highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct wwwminerbumpingcom
obviously your corp name is highly disingenuous and should be changed reported
well anyway thanks for stopping by
i have updated the second post now to include additional ways to reach me via twitter and my twitch stream
so basically we all like this game because of risk  it makes what you do some gravitas it is one of the few games where bad decisions are often punished and good ones are often rewarded where other mmos are akin to the empty calories of most fast food  instant gratification only if you build it it you destroy it it is because you were able to best other players pulling on the other end of the tugofwar basically this game is fun because of risk which is largely absent in other gamesas time goes on players have found every possible way to mitigate and avoid risk in a turbulent and violent universe if you take the slightest precautions freighters will never fall prey to high sec antagonists and your ratting ship will never even be on the same grid as a potential enemy players have found all the ways to share information and effort to maximize security and you cant blame them at all for it there simply isnt enough risk left in this game for it to be as fun as it could be any mechanics change that increases risk should be lauded any that potentially gives even more ways to avoid risk should be seriously reconsidered as fundamentally threatening what makes the game fun there are no accomplishments to be had in this game so long as there are no risks on the way to that goal
i support
obvious translationi am bowing out because i am lame and nothing but a terrible troll i cant stand the heat so im outta here lolololpathetic
would anyone who actually knows what pay to win means like to reply
i know what it means but the situation in eve now with sp injectors is simply not pay to win you are basically wrong
you dont seem to know yourself pay to win refers to being able to buy with real money advantages that are not available in game no matter how many skill injectors you buy you cant train hac vi or double drone interfacing or gallente battleship specialisation with themwhilst i dont like the whole skill injector thing at all because i think its corrosive to some fundamental aspects of eves philosophy its not pay to win its pay to avoid waiting or pay to avoid gating if you like but not to win skill point trading is problematic for more complex reasons than that and you do the issue a disservice by mislabelling and simplifying themwith respect to destructible citadels i believe you should read the proposal more carefully individual pilot assets are not destroyed or irretrievably lost when a citadel is

hello there space friendsi would like to hereby announce my candidacy for the csm xi note that i send the application in good time but i have not yet had any confirmation that ccp recieved either the application or the scan of my passport and i am still awaiting thier reponse on this matter this means i may or may not end up actually being able to recieve votes but i guess time will tellmy real life name is roland i am 32 years of age and i have been playing the game for well over 9 years the oldest currently active toon i have is this one started late 2007in my eve carreer i have done pretty much everything eve has to offer the only thing i havent done not that much anyway is living in a wormhole other then that i have done loads of missions mining building high low and nullsec pvp even a little solo though that is not generally what i prefer a lot of incursions mainly sansha a few drifter ones exploration pos management jump freigthering trading pretty much everything indeed these days though my main activities include low and nullsec pvp with either nc or spectre on occation and incursions in that context many may know me as either martha hamster or truus demier an fc for the incursion community called the valhalla project or tvp for short i have also flown with quite a few others though dmy eve carreer has taken me through many interesting places and has lead me to meet many interesting people i have seen the way people react to changes made by ccp and this has lead me to believe that no change made by ccp is truely likely to do what they intend it to do that is the most important reason i say that any change should effect as little as possible only the problem they seek to fix the fatigue changes for an example where in my oppinion needed but the implementation resembled ccp trying to kill a fly with a sledgehammer regardless of what happens to the fly you are likely to do far so much collatheral damage that way and i would say sublety and a more creative approach is neededother things i hope to bring to the attention include drone regions they have been neglected for far too long some lorerelated ideas how likely is it for estamel when he goes out hunting players to bring a rattlesnake bpc by the time he needs it he no longer has it and i have a few small ideas about missions mainly hoping to make them be a little less repetitiveanother thing i hope to discuss is ccps ideas concerning inflation i feel like inflation as such is not a good thing and it is only marginally better then deflation if at least npcrelated income is compensated things like lp loot salvage minerals in short anything that draws its profits from the market will inflate along with it but if a newbro is grinding level 1 missions and he was previously able to buy the ship he wanted after an x number of missions inflation should not harm him in this sense or we will see a reduced number of newbros joining the game and we all like shooting newbros dlast but not least i would like to wish everyone running for csm good luck on thier campaign and may the best bever win p
yeanoliterally the worst vote for me announcement for csm xi youre pretty much the donald trump of eve entertainment for the uneducated masses but pretty much the worst possible candidate if actually elected the day someone as emotional as xenuria gets a seat on the csm is the day i unsub my accounts and go play entropia universe again so good luck get rekt and do the community a favor uninstall eve biomass yourself and go play world of warcraft instead
not a weapon as much as a way to punish the rest of the csm members and any ccp employees who have to deal with you it shouldnt come as a surprise to you since we know youre a dishonest to the core willing to join any organisation just to get within grasp of a csm seat and entirely unable to lay out your platform in any coherent fashion the problems you try to claim are in need of reform are the same problems you reject explaining voting you in is tantamount to asking for the csm to be abolished youre not just a joke but also as jenshae intends to use you a tool to inflict pain and suffering the two positive things about you are that youre great fun to observe and you make other people seem like perceptive geniuses by comparison jenshae have you unblocked me id really like to answer your evemail but its kind of hard when you throw a temper tantrum like a 3yearold editluckily the csm doesnt have enough power to make xenuria a problem had it been like other elected assemblies youd be right but ccp controls so many things around csm that what the csm really has is ease of access information and a nametag from there they have to make their arguments count thats why some csm members can be effective while others arent and why xenuria wont be much more than an empty seat with a microphone wired up bleating out insane memes catchphrases or allegations all ego no brain will get you nowhere when that member doesnt have a vote only a voice luckily xenuria will be limited to possibly ruining the csm not the game im still wondering what the cfc plot behind all this is though is it an evenhanded joke on xenuria is it a cruel joke on the rest of us is it a revenge plot on the csmccp employees or a scheme to get the csm abolished time will tell

here is the csm watch interview with aryth for the csm 11 electionenjoy
after listening to his interview on csm watch aryth is by far one of the best if not the best candidate so far that i see running for csmin my professional life i deal with the final say on hiring individuals on a regional basis and you learn to spot certain traits in an interview there are a few things that stand out with aryth that puts him miles ahead of any other candidate1 an understanding of what the job entails2 a realistic view of what the csm is and has evolved into3 knowledge about the game as a whole and the simplecomplex devices that fit in the game4 thought out and realistic goals of how to keep eve alive and growing instead of stagnatingwhatever your opinions of goons are there is one fact that cannot be disputed they have knowledgeable players and know how to get work done when it comes to the game we all loveput aside all of the political bias and vote with your head instead of your emotions vote aryth

what  game are you playing wherein 40 is a minor tweaktell me i find this fascinating you know with innate hull resists becoming a thing maybe catalysts need a minor tweak to their dps say 40
well it isnt strictly pay to win as a lot of games deploy it but you can spend money to boost a character to far greater capability than even someone who has been training for years simply by spending enough moneygranted this is probably a temporary thing as people make money from selling sp they dont use anymore so thats why it was only minorand even if items can be retrieved who is going to spend 70b isk to put up a citidel just to see it destroyed by some overwhelming force passing through in a couple of months this is effectively a return to large blobs controlling space
with your admission that you are wrong and have basically no idea what youre on about i think we can all safely agree that the best thing for you to do to save a little bit of face would be to publicly apologise for your senseless waste of electrons in this thread
a month ago a new player with loads of cash could go to the character bazaar buy a highsp pilot and be flying a supercarrier in a day or two im not overly fond of skill injectors but nothing fundamental has changed in this particular regard
well it kind of has but eh whatever ccp need the money to direly to accept any argument that doesnt involve things being nuked from orbit there are better battles to fight
i am sorry that you feel so negatively about me
you could potentially fix that you know
actually when a delusion is strong enough no amount of effort can uproot it i would direct you to the famous example the 3 christs of ypsilanti this is why i have been prioritizing legitimate questions and concerns
true which is why i dont expect you to ever deserve a vote outside trolls or punishers but still its possible in principle its almost cute that you think so i havent seen you respond to any hard question with anything but vagueness misdirection obfuscation insult or claim of conspiracy and youve barely responded even to easy questions such as appeals to expand on your platform by what looks like potential voters im quite amused by your antics both because your arguments are so insane and poor that the only thing you realistically could accomplish on the csm is having it shut down and if i am to believe your cogoon sion that wont change much and because its actually hilarious ive been following or participating in various political campaigns for close to 10 years now and yours is the greatest combination ever of delusions martyrdom syndromes messiah complexes and total incompetence youre the best kind of political entertainment its all the joys of watching a campaign of conspiracy nuts added with the excitement that they might get in granted a position on which ive changed my mind after seeing how little power the csm has but minus the fear of them mucking it all up its like certain us candidates just virtual and without consequences please do continue you never cease to amuse and amaze me
i will fully be supporting bobmon in his endevorsgood luckpantsufan army exec
hi borat thanks for the questions and support i will look at your thread as well1 yes with csm watch and eve nt they havent published them yet i did them about a week ago2 wormholes need new content for preexisting c1c6 new frostlinestyle beacon sites and a revamp of some sites like old sleeper relic sites the new systems that they recently added like the drifter wormholes should be better connected to the preexisting c1sc5s some of us have been grinding the same sites for yearswhat do i mean by new it ties in to my feelings about eve missions we need more options other than just kill as many sleepers as possible i wouldnt mind having multiple factions to shoot at in wormholes such as soe drifterlite etc 3 one of my favorite experiences in eve was getting pvp by using statics and rolling holes until wed get one with a decent null exit this became slightly more difficult last year took more scanning and rollingto be honest i did not appreciate the stealth changes that benefitted defensive nullsec groups and prevented some groups from third partying i like the idea of limiting the null holes sizes in some way to limit huge sub cap fleets from bypassing regions but the holes should benefit small gangs id love to see say timelimited holes that force groups to bring along a ship with probes fittedi hope that helps
carebears unite and vote for tora you need someone with an evil streak to rid us of a greater evil codies tora has promised to kick these gankers teeth in no more steak dinners for them mr bushido will make hisec the land of unicorns n rainbows nerfing anything that will hurt our carebears maybe im exaggerating a littlebut for the sake of defending the defenceless and creating some content tora is committed to buffing the antigank teampass the word carebeares haulers miners and industrialists in highsecurity space stop whining get off your buts and vote n vote oftenthieving pirates discuss integrity anarchist gankers give us laws and whoring mercs cry then blow off clients with insults
ive known foo for several years now and can honestly say he goes the extra mile to lend a helping hand and shows concern for others while having a wealth of knowledge about the dynamics of eve as they pertain to pve and pvp especially in wormholes honestly cant think of a better candidate for csm who will represent and look out for the interests of wormholes and their inhabitants as it is conducive to balanced gameplay1
here is the csm watch interview with sapporo jones for the csm 11 electionenjoy
i am asking any csm member who reads this to please ask for ccp to the newest dev blog on overlays in greater detail the dev blog that was released did absolutely nothing but raise more questionsplease do not tell me to file a petition as those do not help the player base at all they only help one player and even then are completely dependent on whatever gm is answering it it is to subjectivei am asking for actual examples screenshots videos whatever to clearly define what is bannable and what is notper the dev blog4 however if any third party application or other software is used to gain any unfair advantage or for purposes beyond its intended use or if the application or other software violates other parts of the eula we may fully enforce our rights to prohibit such use including player bansi we do consider overlays using elements of a second or multiple other eve clients to be against the rules it changes the way the game is played and grants the player unfair advantages over other players for example having overviews from other eve clients as overlays on one eve client would allow a player to get real time intel from all those other game instances without having to switch to the other windows similarly overlays using elements from a second or multiple other eve clients to allow the player to activate modules etc on those other game instances without switching to the other client windows are clearly in violation of our rulesso what exactly does this mean if i use isoboxer or some other software to make it so i can just see the overview of another client is that alone bannable per this paragraph it would seem so long as that screen is not on top of another we would be fine therefore i could have as many accounts open as i want and have as many overview overlays as i want so long as they do not overlapin that case how can this even be policed windows itself lets you control window sizes if i put all my accounts in windowed mod and layer them so i can just see the overviews how the hell can i get banned for that i am using a built in feature of the game to move my screens around so i can make some sense of what i am seeingnow okay ccp says all screen must be in full mod then it would be against the rules for a player to have more than 1 account open per screen they have as they would have to overlay one anotherthis then also raises questions about how they can legally do this because if i have all my accounts in windowed mode and layed out across my screen not even using isoboxer how the hell can ccp tell me what i can and cant do on my monitors
there is no conspiracy here i have already addressed assertions that one existed
you have a child army and my sword bobmon for csm
lets have a csm xi free of null sec blocs influenceif you want a csm that is not driven by the null sec blocs dramas leakages conflictual relations with ccp and influence over the game we all share to promote their own interests here is the list of the players to not put on your ballot the null blocs cannot influence independents candidates once they are elected as csm members can communicate directly with ccp with internal tools like confluence but with the stv voting system they can influence the number of independent candidates that will make it to the final 14 via their bloc votes and via their players that run for csm xi under other guises acting as decoys to spread the votes and control the csm composition better i also believe eve media personalities should not be in the csm as there are too much potential for conflict of interests they should keep their focus on their media so here is the list of the candidates to not put on your ballot if you value independence they will be on blocs votes anyway so why give them any of your votes for a fully independent csm check my endorsementsaiwaannexeapothnearyth the new sionbilbertbobmon chiimeracommander azefaferinnominatekane carnifexkyle aparthosmining formanmr hydenashh kadavrnoobmansapporo jonessogorsullen decimusthe judgetora bushidoviceran phaedra wyldxenuria updated after the official list from the goons was made public
1 would recommend
i second you
what i see as the problem with your proposed example changes is that this would disengage the miners from the safety in numbers idea yes a single procurer or skiff is a difficult but definitely a killable target now the prospect of killing 2 procurers or skiffs with orca support is a much more difficult ideahow would you propose balancing this as giving the skiff as in your example an extra highslot would introduce these ships into a more pvp role which they already are able to entertain but not able to fulfill because of the limiting fitting slots
you have my votesbest luck
ive been listening to csm watch and you are currently one of my top choices mostly because i could relate to everything you had to say there are few candidates who would view me as a constituent but without me and others like me there would be no resources my pvp consists mostly of trying to evade or avoid death but when it happens thats just part of eve and i wouldnt have it any other way i was bordering on irrational exuberance while listening to your interview you will have my 2 votes
you have my votesbest luck
you have my votesbest luck
locked as requested o7
hell i would love this option itd be refreshing to be in a dark room my corpmates and i around a projection table with blue light on our faces discussing various tactics instead of sitting here staring at my ship and talking on ts the avatars for the game are really detailed and it seems a shame that theyre going to waste also i wouldnt mind doing some blackjack im all for it most of the mechanics are already there from 2011 when the captains quarters were opened up the only thing holding them back if i had to guess would be fear and if what i heard about the rage is true i honestly cant blame them
another question that came up last night when talking to friends in different corps was whether or not it was a bannable offense to simply have the entire client shrunk down so you could fit 4 to a screen there is no overlap but they are all smaller
1 im not sure you actually read it because nowhere did i claim this is a conspiracy if cfc decides to endorse you there are a limited number of reasons and i dont know which one but its clearly not a conspiracy like when they flew drakes into titans gunfire or when they cabalised moons or the like it was sold during or after as a plan to put pressure on ccp what will happen here we dont know 2 do feel free to link to or cite your rebuttal3 unless that is its just your word against someone elses someone might claim conspiracy based on conjecture but a known liar cant address that with words alone you lie or selfdelude lets be honest its a valid option continually and theres no reason to trust your word
you say that there is no reason to trust my wordcan you provides examples of this within the context of eve online csm
all the other times youve asked me to prove it i have done so and you have ignored it each time is it going to be any different this time no of course not a worthless messiahcomplex or troll candidate like you wont because reading enough of it to comprehend it might ruin your bubble of selfdelusion or not be fun if youre just a troll ill still give a list of links not quotes though since closed threads character limits and quote limits makes such an effort too much work so that anyone who follows along can see what a dishonest megalomaniacal careerpolitician you are in this your current csm11 thread i ask a question about your last csm11 thread that you then do not answer though you quote parts of it and the following discussion but when i call you out on it you ask if i have any specific questions i repeat those questions and seraph also asks for a reply to his questions but you ignore that and instead answer a potential voter with one of the blandest answers ive seen in a long time mind you politics is what i do and study ive seen a lot of politiciantalk and yours takes the cake i call you out on your refusal to answer my questions and you ask for proof that youre lying see a pattern at which point i repeat that i quoted that exact evidence earlier but you never addressed it you admit that you have no clue or as seraph puts it we have to vote the bill in before we know what it says as neuntausend astutely points out we have to believe that a person that cant put together a platform shall once elected be able to produce a reform and lets remind ourselves that your earlier attempt at that feat was to literally define reform  we might as well elect a dictionary that will work and improve the csm and be agreeable to ccp thats a tall order even for a master diplomat and an impossible one for someone with your qualifications you also claim that you dont think your cfc membership can influence you and clarify it at length later and that you will call out any cfc wrongdoing this is contradicted by your earlier campaigns as we shall note later you claim that you have prioritised legitimate questions but as we have seen you dont even answer easy questions by potential voters and classify any hard question as not legitimate in your earlier csm11 thread first i like how you posted your csm11 thread directly after losing the csm10 election and with a one of the least relevant platforms in a long time but still manage to make it probably your best csm opplatform posts as malcanis also notes on first page however there were still a number of questions unanswered from your last csm campaign thread so i quote the relevant parts but like were all used to you refuse to answer even easy questions and those would have been easy unless you were a lying sack of fillintheblanks as is your mo you try to deflect any questions with allegations that others cant stay on topic and then promptly fails at your own platform and basic understanding of microtransactions eve and the meaning of words again a dictionary would be better than you i have made this point before it shouldnt be hard but apparently for you it is since people posting in the thread had to explain the effects of your platform to you just one of several examples this one sums up your misunderstanding well when you include the quotes like what weve come to expect of you you either troll lie or misunderstand even to the point where you misunderstand yourself amazingly enough and if that doesnt work claim conspiracy in your csm10 thread im down to 90 characters so ill just link it and see if you can figure it out yourself there might be an election coming up in my home country tonight and im a candidate for parliament im going to participate in it that means i might be occupied elsewhere so an expansion on this point might have to wait sorry about that
assuming a successful election to the csm what aspects of the committee would you propose reforming to what degree and why
i support bobmon for csm x
here is the csm watch interview with xavier azabu for the csm 11 electionenjoy
hii have a couple of question if you have a few momentshave you asked james 315 for permission to run as the highsec candidateif you had a goon alt what would its name bedo you yield fit or tank fit when you minewhere do you minewhydo you have a permitwhy should i ask the nerds in codedot to vote for youdo you agree that its time for ccp to unban jerry rintia
you have my support toxic
about this why not give interceptors the same change as is being given to caps so instead of immunity they get a very high resist
in theory that is what the idea of nonimmunity to heavy interdiction bubbles is this could be achieved by simply not making interceptors immune to current warp disruption field generators while unscripted or by adding a script that specifically multiplies the warp disruption strength enough to stop nullified ships if you have another idea on how to give a high resist to bubbles that is easy to implement i am all earsanother idea that was brought up to me was leaving immunity alone but making the align times for interceptors longer while i think that is a viable solution i feel it would have quite a bit of a knock on effect in the usability of interceptors in pvp since it involves either a change in mass or inertialike i mentioned in my event interview the csm does not exist to develop the game the csm exists to guide and provide feedback to the developers and present information from ccp  players and players  ccp while i advocate for such things and i am willing to bring them to the table it is completely at ccps discretion what to do with that informationthanks for the question
you would be horrified to know the things i can do with a positive sec status mine is currently just under 0 but thats from ganking the worst things ive done dont affect my sec status sec status only relates to crimes against the empires and concord positive sec status does not mean youre not a criminal
that could be really fun would have to make a way to ensure the proposed target is actually online lol maybe it only chooses a target who is currently online and undocked and also provides their current location
thanks for the support

my candidacy has been accepted so yay d
i sorta mentioned this else where there were several elements that were apart of wis which didnt need to have an avatar interface these things would allow you to do activities while in the station but use a simple 2d neocom interface like a mission giving bot etcwork on the gameplay with in the station once there is several of these sections then change the interface from neocom to avatar
update regarding multiboxing and input automation posted nov 2014
before i continue
yes as you pointed out isoboxer is not banned the only real function it had left was the ability to manage multi windows easilyas far as them detecting it they can detect input broadcasting but in this case where they are going to try to enforce something that every single operating system allows you to do if you read the dev blog by their definition it could be interpreted as even having more than one monitor is a violation do i think that is the case no but when your rules are that vague it does not work
1 from me too and remember get rid of the frigate menace and bring back the good old battleship era  i dont belive in reincarnation ive never believed in it in my previous lives either

1 with all my intentions
i appreciate your support friends and notsofriends alikevoting is on monday remember to make lowsec great again
obviously you and i must be listening to different interviews mental incapacity because weve reached entirely opposite conclusionsaryth is im sure a skilled and knowledgeable player he certainly talked with a lot of selfassurance on the matter of the jewbal and his previous exploitshowever despite his personal relationships with sion the mittani and mynnna he is deeply out of touch with the realities of the csm multiple csm members have come out over the last few weeks to talk about how the biggest trouble with ccp is getting them to even acknowledge you in the interview aryth glossed over this fact by insisting that his communication attitudes of blunt truth and no filter will get his message through to the supposed right peopleheres my question noone at ccp has to listen to you and noone at ccp barring the summit has to be in the same room as youhow are you going to get heard arythwhat strikes me about your attitude is that youre running on all the same points sion and the mittani did what exactly apart from that fact that its you doing it makes you and your campaign any different from theirs
the main topic of this years discussion focused on the role of the csm we covered a lot of ground in each panel with each taking a different tact and tone panel 1 aryth commander aze edeity diana olympos panel 2 apothne kyle aparthos jintaan toxic yaken utari onzo thanks for listening go out and vote
nice initiative stickied
thanks for having me was a good podcast would recommend a listen to anyone even if you dont like any particular candidates platformface the enemy as a solid wall for faith is your armor and through it the enemy will find no breach wrap your arms around the enemy for faith is your fire and with it burn away his evil
i did an interview for event no one else really seems to be interested with speaking to me i do not represent any of the well known alliances so i am having a hard time getting my word out other then right here for your second point yeah i have been gazing at the other hisec candidates and essentially they are either in the gankerwar deccer group or they are carebears that want ganking to be nerfed 1 candidate this year want as far as to say that hisec ganking should not even be a thing essentially i am both of these things i went thrasher ganking in jita a few days ago and as i am typing this i am alt tabbing my freighter with some contracts i am running i have been on both sides of a war dec and i can see where that needs to be worked on from both sides where as most players have only been the defender as far as gankersgank targets same thing i damn near rage quit when i lost an incredibly expensive ship that i spent alot of time grinding the isk to get and a day after i got the ship i lost it i was broke but i got my stuff together and went on with my life instead of being a baby about it and i am much better for it since then i eventually became a ganker myself and now i know so much about ganking that i know alot of tricks to keep my vargur from getting blown to hell as i cart that around to do l4s from time to time bottom line i know the fears and joys of both sides of the coin your third point is interesting as of right now all i can honestly say is that while yes it is going to take more to drop a freighter a white knight will not be able to just shoot the can like currently so in the end while it will cost more to do a gank the rewards will be better because gankers should be able to loot every wreck once the wreck hp buff goes into effect so there is good and bad here honestly for years i have felt that wrecks need more hp so i am happy that is happening as far as the 33 hull boost that is going to hurt gankers but it is going to help most of eve so i am going to have to say i like it besides maybe new ganking strategies will come out of this one thing eve has taught me is you never knowtldr somebody interview my please carebearanti carebear relationship needs workfreighters getting hp buff but you can always loot the wreck a win for everyone including gankers
you got my vote hyde
and as predicted you wont face the reality that youre the very problem you claim to desire removed youre a worthless mindless and yet egomaniacal tool whose only problem is that xenuria is not on csm and the only fix is to join the only group who can get you elected despite your qualifications and your platform and now youve shown that we both know election is at least postponed until wednesday so until then i can enjoy your antics please do continue
yeah but you could at least extrapolate potential avenues of reform even if you dont have all of the information in fact youd be wise to do just that in order to be as prepared as possible if the time ever comes for you to attend the csmhowever seeing as you just rudely ignored my question and instead responded to the poster below me asking about goonswarm you can count my vote out i was on the fence thinking that you might bring an element of randomness to the proceedings but based on your behaviour to me and several other people in this thread i dont think so now i know my vote doesnt mean anything in the grand scheme of things but it is my vote and i choose not to expend it on you
joffy has my endorsement  i cant think of anyone else who 100 deserves to be on the csm than him i have had the pleasure of knowing joffy for a while now we met in b4r and he really cares about the community and its players as well as great knowledge of the game and lowsec his experience is also very unique from most which gives him a very unique perspective on how eve can be bettered for accessibility  an important topic that has been untouched by past csm members5 votes for joffy from me 
so niko kindly agreed to answer some questions for me interview here
its a utility slot no guns missles or the like i see it as just giving it more options i think i like that word too much but its true  mining in numbers is always going to be safer i dont think thats going to change that in my opinion its not a pvp ship and i dont think it should be able to fufill a proper pvp role so there would yes need to be rebalancing  perhaps a drawback on specific modsnote im typing this on over 24hrs since i last slept so i hope what i typed made sense
thank you woooo
thank you joffy 3

hey ronuken when it comes to industry do you have any thoughts about improving the quality of life for the average industrialistalso how do you feel about pirates
youll have my vote again this year anyway but id like your opinions on the click fest that is pi at the moment and do you have an opinion on how it should be changed if indeed you think it should be changed
the core mechanics behind pi are pretty decent if changes were to happen itd mostly be ui id be asking for things like automatically starting a link when you place a factory or allowing you to have a list of facilities to link to rather that having to find the right one or being able to say draw all your materials from this site as a shortcut to the multiple clicks to fill ad advanced facility and having some kind of visible notification when you dont have the product being routed anywhere
reverse orderpirates multiple definitions of this exists if youre talking about ganking i have no problem with ganking bumping i have more trouble with but i dont have a solution for itas for improving the quality of life mechanically were in a better position that we have been for a fair time crius was great for thatthere are a few things which need to be evened out numbers on blueprints mostly and the structures need to come through correctly for everything to remain good
initial post updated as well as
a pity bump is better than no bump 
chiimera is a 100 aok bloke i wouldnt just say this about anyone he has a deep passion for this game and its citizens i will be voting 1 for chimera as i do recommend for anyone who wants to see this game continue from strength to strengthotto
that is the thing i am not going in with the expectation to get heard i can just use the media to be heard if i want you know like sion had to and then things changed
dear mr arythif youre elected to the prestigious position of csm person will you use the position to advocate for a wall being built around deklein to keep the pubbies out
eve vote match is now open to the publicmost candidates have filled in their profile and with the elections tomorrow i have opened up vote match to you the voters vote match offers a matching services that takes your opinions and views on eve online compares them to the views of the csm candidates and gives you a besttoworst matches list of all candidates
lol eve grew quicker then earlier years in earlier years there was hardly an advertising market until about 2008 when they opened full blast in the us in a short time the game got very violent when the average iq of the player base fell horribly
i hate the people that take in a scope of oh you got ganked you must have been afk and i also hate the groups thatsoh you should be using an alt you should get more accounts to do what you want to doi have watched people at their computers doing point to point jumps in haulers get ganked i myself have been ganked landing at a 0 bm on a station just because you get ganked does not mean you were afk or didnt take measures the ganking as just gotten that bad with ccp backing is and lending to the creation of elements here the things you can do and not get in trouble for iti used to be able to autopilot in a pod and not get shot before 2008 now i cant even land on a gate in a t1 fit battleship with out getting locked and fired on every thing i have is tanked and nothing profitablealso i wouldnt be surprised if ccp isnt stretching something like blizzard saying wow had 8m players when players were leaving in droves and now they completely disavow it by saying they no longer need wow subs now because of other games with micro transactions
i am sorry but what is your point that eve didnt grow quicker in the early years or that you look down on americansbecause player counts most certainly grew the fastest in both relative and absolute terms in from 20032008 when ganking was much easier cheaper and probably more common place concord was originally tankable insurance used to cover gank ships not to mention all the creative ways one could use the crimewatch mechanics to flag someone to avoid concords wrath it was only after ccp started ratcheting up highsec safety in the 20092011 era that the the player counts plateaued and started to decline with the incursion expansion and its failed attempt to attract additional playersnow this is just a correlation and many other things have changed with the game over time but it is a fact that highsec has never been mechanically more safe than today claiming somehow that now when ccp has spent over 5 years buffing highsec safety to the highest level it has ever been with yet another significant buff coming next patch player counts are dropping because highsec isnt safe enough is dubious at best the more plausible hypothesis to explain this data is the opposite  that all this increased safety is boring players out of the game but i doubt even ccp with access to all their data can determine exactly what factor or combination of factors is responsible for the stalled growth of the game
what a nice whineflying gatetogate is insufficient in that a freighter is a big slow ship and vulnerable after jumping through a gate you should use an escort or another ship that is more agile for valuable cargo you dont need to have an alt or a second account a friend would suffice although in your case i can see how an alt account would be more of a help there are a number of tools in game already to allow you to travel safely and many of the people ganked are afk or semiafk and most fit for yield vs tank when they do have boosts they go for mining boosts vs boosts for tank so poor choices are what result in many ganksand i seriously doubt that even in a t1 fit bs you are getting shot at in hsso go cry in your cheerios somewhere else
thats a horrible idea unless there is some massive drawbacks players have been trying to get control of stargates so they can shut the gate down and pve in piece out in null seci dont live out in null as is due to politics it bad enough constantly having to look over your shoulder for every neut that comes in a system or the stupid rules placed by corps and alliance that dont want any losses unless its a roaming group that keeps you from doing nothing which keeps me from wormholesthere are groups as is that want to shut down areas of empire with all low connections
today my corp mates and i were talking in corp and we stumbled on an epic idea we were sat talking how we loved to sit staring into space i myself have probably lost hours to this over the course of my eve odyssey just sitting in my pos staring out to space who wants to be dockedthen it struck me like a train hitting a junkie i would love to know how many spins i make when im floating in space i am sure its the same mechanics engine wise you could have some basic rules such as must be staionary etcit was a hit in corp i imagine alot of you would love to know this only a little work to add it inozran

disabled player and wormhole industrialist here erika mizune for csm feeltheerika
vaari stands for vanitywe need to improve our lives with luxury items we have small and dirty captain cabins in gigantic stations from where we are confined like prisoners we need to get roam into station we need ability to decorate our captain quarters or even buy bigger one we need corporation and alliance areas in stations where we can hold meeting and celebrate we need much more clothes we need hundreds of new clothes to nes and many accessories for our clothing we need hats jabots boots feathers capes cloaks epaulettes aiguillettes and so one are you tired of your old medals are you desperate of knowing that your corporation simply cannot award you with anything unique with current medals except perhaps in medal names we need hundreds of new awards new medals ribbons cloth patches banners we need luxury
so you say nothing have no platform and do nothingwell its better than xenuria
hmm i smell a code alt i just went through your eve vote match answers it seems you think high sec missions have too much reward odd stance for a high sec carebearyour regular pvp area is solo and in high sechigh sec suicide ganking is fine as it is but yet you also say it needs workfor the question how should ccp balance the development of pvp content vs pve content your comment was mining is boring ganking needs workbut most importantly was your comment on the should high sec feel safe high sec is worth fighting fornow that is a familiar moto
i am a high sec carebear  but i also remember saying that i am trying to keep all the picture in mind and not pushing for anything totalitarian that also has something to do with what the csm actually is and does i dont think finding missions too rewarding an odd stance i think the whole game needs balanceactually that is probably one of the more central themes of my platform not being narrow and trying to just push one position to the expense of all others and that central theme is pretty much more than anything else what is according to the feedback i have getting me support from people that might vote for meyes indeed pretty much all the pvp i have been involved in has been solo and in high sec i tend to mine solo as well and these things happeni already wrote to the creator of eve match especially about the suicide ganking question did you read the available answers none of them fit my personal opinion that is why i used the clarification option to say that the answers that eve vote match offered me did not give the chance to balance but more or less just represented extremesganking pvp needs work i seem to recall having said that a few timesmining pve is boring have you tried itthat motto i also used last year it was even talked about in my thread  see the thread from last year linked in my first post this year yes i have read bings threads and yes i used the catchphrase before i knew about bings threads but then this information has been out there since before the last election i dont get what you are getting at but kudos to you for getting interested you dont have to vote for me but please do vote participation is keyps for some reason i keep having problems getting to the forums have to keep editing incomplete posts sorry to anyone that read a previous version
2 first choice votes for steveget him back in there people
i dont always comment in eve but when i do its to vote for sullen decimus
you also likely wont hear me say risk vs reward as that phrase has been perverted in this community to basically mean force other players into sitting duck mode so i can shoot them whilst plexing for isk so i never have to become that same victim
hey sorry for long waiting reply crazy weeks yeah you named 4 csm members and how about others do you know them do you know what they were doing can you find all their blogs during 2 minutes 5 10 i tried spent like 2 hours assembly hall  good place for posting but how do you know what ideas were taken and rejected and yes i understand what nda is but at least you can post reports after something thats under nda is posted in game this can help to make csm a bit more open for example i have no idea who i should vote for from last csm council mostly because noone knows what they were doing there are 2 ways to make stuff working  forum and csmeveonline for the beginning its ok may be if ccp has resourced there can be added more interesting tools like site with form and voting for best ideas who knows
i have only good luck
if i could characterise your opinion of the csm id say you believe its a regulatory body how can you act as such if noone will speak with you how will you provide value to ccp if youre only a public voice of disagreementare you going to be a bullhorn csm then should i write about your planned boycott of the csm xi summits now or do you wish to keep us on ice until ccp does something you consider outrageous swhats the point in voting for you if you can only communicate via tweet or article and not provide the value the csm is meant to in fact lets make this easier if ccp continues to suffer problems with the csm what exactly can you do to alleviate those problems personally
here is the csm watch interview with for the csm 11 electionenjoy
unfortunately my rl is going to prevent doing more election stuff prior to the bulk of voting being over thanks for the sticky fractal
understandable just a shame that it was limited to just a very small handful of candidates
