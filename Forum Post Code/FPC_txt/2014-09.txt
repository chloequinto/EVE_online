they are welcome to come and try the best people using isboxer have been able to do is run a fleet of bombers anything more complex and they fail miserably boo hoo lets see those 100200 isbboxer fleets come to null and try to do stuff in pvp that is im quite certain someone who can effectively run 100 miners is far better off to rent out a system in null and earn 50x more than they do in highsecbut thats just me id go for higher proffits if i could run 50 accounts id strip a large cluster in 2 hours
is there actually any kind of an idea in here or is the op just crying
its the latter the op also has a bug up their proverbial over isboxerbut as yet has failed to come up with any coherent argument on anything just a lot of really bad shiptoastingdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
um my comparison was to a frigate where do you see me state a mining vessel notice i did not say barge or exhumer should have the tank and dps of a battlshipoh wait i didnt
so what if its a mining shipcombat ships can mine cruisers with 2 mining lasers and the rest guns fill this role just peachy and i see people doing this a lot what is so difficult about imagining an industrial ship designed like thisso your essentially saying it is ok for a combat ship to mine but it is not ok for a mining ship to be able to fight thats a bit hypocritical there bub
one of my characters corps has a doctrine fit for gank frigates that easily goes over 500 dps and they use them consistentlyi own 6 accounts also if someones next question was how many character do i haveyea the skiff is decent these daysi wasnt meaning that ccp needed to edit the barges and exhuimers i was thinking more along the lines of a new ship type maybe with 4 guns and 2 lasers or something like some retrofit cruiser miners use just seems like since people do it with cruisers anyway why not have an actually industrial ship for it
really so the fact that someone just getting into a battleship can do just over the amount of damage you say a frigate can do and you want more damage then you say a frigate can do isnt asking for battleship damage on a mining barge maybe you should read your own posts againand a combat ship with 2 mining lasers doesnt get good mining yield kind of like how a mining barge doesnt get good dps funny how that works isnt it sure you can put mining lasers on a combat ship no one who knows better does as thats like putting rlmls on a morossince youre claiming to be a beta player and all can you name one ship that used to have mining bonuses that wasnt a mining barge or exhumer no the venture and prospect dont countnope nothing hypocritical in pointing out the way ccp set up the way it works keep trying though maybe one day youll actually make a point that isnt completely wrongand i guarantee that fit if it really exists is dependent on having logi along to rep it this means that if you have no logi then youre still not going to get through a procurers 64k ehp tank before its drones melt you if you do have logi then youre going to win anyway so why bring that much firepowersure 6 accounts in your same little highsec mining corp your blatant lack of knowledge about various aspects of eve hints that youve never left highsec regardless of your bloated claimsyou say this now after every single attempt at getting miners buffed again has been shot down this is the point where you concede that you have bad ideas and go back to whining about one guy taking all your precious highsec ice
show fit
hint every t1 logistics cruiser and frigate used to be a mining shipthey got changed because they were awful at itthat said op why should a mining ship be able to do the same sort of damage as a battlecruiser at least you can already get a pretty decent combat barge going with the skiffprocurer especially in numberswhere is the tradeoff in your proposed ship what does it sacrifice to gain its massivley increased tank and gank is its mining yield somewhat worse than that of an ibis
i felt like this warranted a response never said cloaked ships should be used for a tackle now did i infact if you are using it for a tackle then you are doing something wrong the amount of assumptions you just drew from that is well to be frank i have no  clue how you drew that assumptions your constant attacks on me due to your failed argument is a tad silly really shoo be gone with thee for your nonsense is not welcomed herenext for different response never said that now did i i welcome a prey that can fight back it can put up more of a challenge however if you look at the majority of targets which let me remind you that covert cloaking vessels at the moment are so nitched due to heavy handed nerfs that they are limited on what targets they can attacked ie targets that are basically defenseless or attacking targets that can not move out of the line of fire of their lets say bombs and then escaping for a hit and run tactic the problem is many of these targets have advance warning long before the clocked vessel even gets on grid with them allowing them to warp away and safe up in zones that would be suicide for a cloaker to get close example death star posses this forced players to come up with a clever but boring solution you know what that solution was to make local lie to you that right their solution was set it up so that they restart the game every time during downtime inside of the system it not always to lock it down but to get that kill local is always reporting that they are there even when they are technically not that way someone is never sure if they are still there or not so they must take a risk do i go out there and risk my ship or do i stay in here and constantly lose money however that being said because of covert cloaks able ships are heavily nerfed ie they cant do much to targets outside of their special little box of targets that they can picked from people have figured out how to get around that as well the invention of cloaked hot dropping
yes you didhere is the quote againso your problem is that the cloaker lands on gate and the pve players runs away thus you are trying to catch a pve player with a cloaking ship explain to me how the problem can be that pve players run from cloakers if the cloaker isnt the pilot there to catch the pve playeryou also imply thatwhich is wrong they dont have to they could use interceptors to catch their targets like a normal playeragain you certainly implied that should be the case notice that the quote you pulled up there says nothing about whether or not they can fight back it states that in your mind they shouldnt be able to run away which from what ive read id agree with that analysis of your complaints you dont like it that a pve player can run away when a cloaker shows up to shoot them afk cloaking isnt a clever solution interceptors are a clever solution and they work very well afk cloaking is a method for people to put in next to no effort and cause 247 threat and its quite amusing when people try to claim that its a reaction to local and their inability to us the right ships for the jobas for covert ops ships they are in no way heavily nerfed again you simply dont seem to understand what they are designed to be used for they get used almost every single day in and out of null because they are so useful and effective at what they do they can provide on grid intel covert scanning and warping so your target doesnt know when youve found and landed on grid with them surprise bombing runs meaning a fleet has to remain aligned or risk heavy losses cheap and effective force projection without having to use a titan high damage against larger targets the ability to become completely unprobable in a system and thats without even considering that t3s are also covops capable which are incredibly versatile shipswhat they arent good at is flying in to catch active pve players thats what interceptors are for
and what am i supposed to make of this statementif that is sarcasm i apologize for not recognizing it so what do you suggest the purpose of this thread is to find and discuss ways to make gameplay more interestingnikk and i have discussed tradeoffs to ship balances to where pvp between pve and cloaked vessels would happen more often we are seeking to give both an equal chance of success the chance needs to be such as to encourage engagement instead of running away we also want to encourage active gameplay while discouraging afk gameplayi welcome meaningful response ideas and conflicting views provided they have substance
1 would be awesome we had the same problem you described just the other way around where we staged from a pos and we had so many ships ready to use in it that we had a hard time to distinguish between our own unmanned ships inside the pos and neutrals
no part of the mystery of operating in wormholes is the lack of knowledge of other entities in the hole piloted ship or not if youre unwilling to do the due diligence of scanning down ships in a hole to check if theyre piloted or not you shouldnt be in a wormhole in the first placebesides this youre asking for a sweeping change to the dscannerprobing in every other region of the game with no regard to the consequences of it
im kinda willing to hedge my bets its nikk narrel on an alt charplease take an interceptor or warpy cloaky and go through each nullsec system and check how many systems have industry at a certain level lets only pick systems with at least l3 industryor you could persue dotlan for the same effectthen write those systems down and monitor them throughout the entire month 31 days also note the changes in rises and drops of industry levels and those of neighbouring systemsthat research will however only give you a rough turnover for normal ore not ice for ice check each nullsec system for poses and calculate aproximately how much ice needs to be minedpurchased to keep those towers up and functional also account for jump bridge fuel capital jump drive fuel and ofcourse search all killboards everyday for blopscovops vessels killing someone and add those to the tally of needed fuel every single dayUFFFDafter youve done your little research youll get a realistic idea on how much mining is actually done in nullsec that you claim is so very little or nonexistant now just because ccp said 80 of industry is done in highsecthank you for your attention so far can you please stop posting stuff that doesnt hold wateredit almost forgot why would mining barges need more defenses they are specialized vessels you want more defensive and offensive power mine in a battleshipcruisercarriermercnaugttitan nobody is stopping you from doing that hell put mining lasers on a rorqual and mine with thatships that are specialized for a certain role are greatly efficent in that particular role but lacking in others for a simple reason thats the point of specializationbesides youre missing the point here eve onlline is an mmo note the second m describing multiplayer this isnt tetris or super mario karts make some friends have them defend you from the baddies itll be a rich and pleasant experience for everyone involved
then by all means name this doctrine ganking frigate that does 500700 dps
this change doesnt do anything to the pvp metagame pvpers want kills theyll kill a helpless barge w 2 ships or 10 notsohelpless barges with 20 ships increasing a barges offensive capabilities will only make a pvper more likely to engage with more people which will just make no differenceyou will not ever be able to change what the person at the keyboard is doing and no amount of messing with noncombat ships will change that right now the keyboardist is bored with sov mechanics doesnt want to dedicate time to fw and has made 20b isk doing incursions for a month the keyboardist is creating hisher own content to the perceived detriment of the miner the meta has become 10 yearold bullies with nothing better to do than beat up the 1st graders playing in the sand until that changes we miners and im proud to be a carebear will just have to deal with it so should you
lmao renters specifically northern associates is literally the only alliance left in the game that has this policy
what do i suggest well ive been suggesting it all this time find away to nerf both as in together at the sametimeectra cloaking and local together this is why i keep suggesting intel tools pull the omnipotent intel off of local create real intel tools and you know what that can create the possability of intel tools that can hunt cloaks without being over powered due to local giving them a heads up that there is already someone in the system they actually have to scan the system down buy using infomation that could be out of date ie the map or by going on word of mouth and scanning each and every system that you think there is a hostile in that the problem people continue to fail to understand if you give someone the ability to hunt down cloaks without nerfing local then that ability will be over powered cause you will know that he is there as soon as he enters the system thus he would be unable to hide ever omnipotent intel can only be defeated by omnipotent masking if you want to take away the omnipotent masking then you must take away the omnipotent intel im sorry but despite what people say that is the only way to do it the only problem is that you must figure out away to do both at the same time so that neither side becomes to powerful
wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong its like you don even remotely know what you are talking about if you nerfed both cloakers would be far far far superior to as they currently are as most people hunting for pve players do not use local to do so local is irrelevant to them as it does not tell you who is and isnt available as target on the other hand removing local from pve players and forcing them to use another system is forcing them to spend less time playing the game they like and more time playing with some arbitrary system just so they can avoid becoming fodder and thats before you even consider how it would work once you have thousands of people includign cloakers in a systemand no its not the only way to do it its the only way someone as one track closed minded and uninformed about null sec mechanics can think to do it but it is certainly not the only way i mean if the end result is scrapping afk cloakers then the afk part could be attacked for example preventing people being able to remain afk and cloaked for more than a set amount of time allowing the exploration covops ships the ability to probe out cloakers would be another and would barely affect people cloaking actively as you cant generally catch a ship that keeps moving
if this is your version of a respectful reply i think you missed the markwow that is simply amazing your claim about hunters not using localso if these hostile pvp players enter a system with noone but themselves listed in local they still begin scanning and checking probable activity areas for targetsbecause we know that sov null always has full activity so not using local to locate targets is normal behavior for themskipping obvious and accepted details such as noone else in local but yourself and possibly allies in order to make an absolute statement that denies this not rationalits not that they use local to hunt with but how much they truly depend on itforcing them to spend less time playing the game they lovewait you mean grinding asteroids or npc rats is what we have been working towardswe have not been playing eve for an opportunity to interact with other players competitivelyyou seem to be confusing a timesink  obstacle to play for the intended goal these activities enable us to do which is play with each otherwe grind isk so we can get the cool ships to fly around and play with each other while i am sure a few love the zen tranquility of mining lasers endlessly drilling into floating rocks a screen saver can duplicate thata likely majority do so in order to have the toys we use to play mmos withranting before the end of a post adds nothing of meaningful contentupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
people use stats or common knowledge to pick areas to hunt then on arrival they scan out the system many systems have people in them 247 just docked or in a pos so local does nothing for them when they arrive they have to scan out the system which they can do while on the moveand they dont depend on it at all thats why cloakers have no issue with the removal of local intelsome people enjoy pve thats the part of the game they love you want to take that away from them because you dont have enough easy targets to gankits not a rant its a statement of fact you and maria look at this from a single point of view you dont consider how it affect other mechanics and how it would affect other people
im sorry is me looking at it from a different view point then yours bothering you all ive seen you all thread is reinforce your own view point and not only that but also not even backing up anything you say ive backed up what i said with quotes and links all i see is someone who wants as little risk to themselves as possible in their own little bubble of safety im sorry for not agreeing with your view point
no you are looking at it from one point of view you dont even understand the mechanics enough to try to look at it from other points of views you havent considered if from perspective of people who live in null at all let alone how it would affect large scale warfare youve barely even looked at it from the hunterhunted point of viewand no youve backed up nothing youve linked to one dev saying that he personally thinks it should be different and a handful blog posts written by idiots for en24 you have yet to show why any of your ideas would be good or how they would work if integrated into the current null environment without screwing everything upi on the other hand have nothing to prove since i want no changes the fact that the existing system works has worked for years and is used every day is proof enough the onus is on you to show that your changes wont break the game but you are far too think to understand that so you find it easier to ignore what people write then scream and whine like a child
best thread ever this space for rent
that is a fallacyyou are basically saying you can veto any idea with absolutely no other foundation for your objection except to say you dislike itchange is inevitableit is going to happenhow it happens is determined by a variety of sourcesthe status quo is not a self defending dynamic particularly the way you present it as proof of concept for itselfan argument which seems to actually claim it exists so must be perfectthe current systems existence proves absolutely nothing beyond the fact that it exists at this timei would like you to present more than just your opinion but i am growing concerned you can offer us nothing moreupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
incorrect i can veto the idea because its badly thought out has absolutely no proof that it will not cause enormous issues and has been stated by someone who has given clear evidence that they have no experience with the mechanic on top of the fact that the existing mechanics work perfectly well and get used every single day its like a medical student half way though university suggesting a new and ill through out method for performing a triple bypass while pointing at the patients stomach saying the hearts around there someowherechange in the way you think its going to happen is not inevitable theres every possibility that local will remain as is foreverthe fact that it not only exists but that cloaks and local are used in daily activities show they work well enough the only evidence towards the removal of local is wormhole space which is desolate youve shown no reason to believe that changes to null in the same way wouldnt make null even worse due to fixed gates and power projection and you havent even fired a guess at how it would work with 4000 people in a systemim all for a well thought out change to be put forward but to this date all of the ideas put forward have been thought out from one maybe 2 angles at best there are a lot of mechanics in nullsec which will need to be considered if any change is to happen and honestly i think it would not be worth the development time the value it would add simply isnt there 99 of the playerbase would gain nothing but extra clickslol of course its my opinion as what you and maria have stated is yours at no point have i stated otherwise my opinion is just educated with first hand experience of most null mechanics rather than being from one or two points of view with little to no consideration for how it might affect others your opinion is not gospel purely because you have it
i can veto the idea because it badly thought out is based on your opinion correct also compairing the process new ideas are suggested based on a customer base to how the medical base suggest no ideas does not exactly build a strong foundation on your reasoning specially seeing the process of doing such is much different from each other your lack of general knowledge scares me if devs are complaining about local i some how highly doubt it will remain as is forever how do you know that where does this statistic come from how do you know it will become worse how it would work with 4000 people in the same system well im sure propperly set up tools can quite easily work just like the current system if you have 4000 people in a system i dont know why you would bring up that topic seeing most people in that large of a number tend to be in fleets and you have this amazing tool called fleet chat as for there is a lot of mechanics to take into considered for null sec like what feel free to name a few of the mechanics that would be affected in a negetive manner if local was changed to be only a chat and didnt provide any intel at all aka person only popped up if they spoke in the chat and true intel tools are developed thus allowing people to gain less info if they are lazy or more info if they mastered the system like how basically everything else in eve currently is few exceptions here and there of course as for just being extra clicks how do you know that do you magically know what the future will hold or how new intel tools would be design do you have statics on how that will play out where your proof or are you once again pulling  out of your ass and in my opinion you are just another null bear that wants as much safety as possible without any of the work for said safety as for my opinion not being gospel well not everything i stated is opinion infact it a fact that only omnipotent intel can be defeated by omnipotent masking thus if you remove the omnipotent from one they you have to remove the omnipotent from the other it simple game balancing fact something you seem to refused to accept just because you refuse to accept this fact does not make said fact untrue or an opinion as for how it will affect others well im sure like in any change in the game someone is going to get affected negatively it bound to happen not everyone agrees on things and that is what makes people human cant make everyone happy after all as for the dev part of it only being one dev opinion i do have a question for you if it was just only one devs opinion why has he not been talked to about not posting or hell even removing his post not only on twitter but also the forums if was just one dev then im sure the other devs would of not have stand by idle while letting someone that works with them in you know the same office post things that all other devs disagree with but hey that just my own observation
its simple you havent got a clue about most null mechanics which not only have you evidenced but youve all but admitted so its understandable that your ideas are not well thought out youve yet to explain a single one of the other null mechanics and how they would fit it the only thing youve looked at is how it might affect a cloaker that hunts people which you claim not to be and one of those cloakers has explained himself in this thread why you were wrong which again you ignored come back when you have half a clue what you are talking about or in fact stick around now because no csm member is going to champion your idea while you are displaying repeatedly that you havent thought it through a single dev stated his personal opinion no devs were complaining and there are plenty of examples which i have given of ideas that devs have been for an against which have not gone their way its not a case that anything that pops into a single developers head will get put into the game eventually development simply doesnt work that way where does what statistic come from that null works as is or that wormholes space is emptyand lol most people seem to be in fleet therefore knowing what is in the system the are attackingdefending is irrelevant eh lol are you trying to prove even further that you have no clue at all about null mechanicsagain lol you mean how could sovereignty or supercapital construction work in a wormhole environment not well you havent considered any mechanics you want to strip out local and you want to dump in some arbirtrary system for people to click to be able to gain the same intel and you havent even considered how people that actually live in null every day would react you only look from your point a view a passer by in nulland effort will involve clicks or keypresses how do i know because those are the two methods of input in eve online and you want to add extra input to gain the same output
grow up kid seriouslyyouve posted a crappy idea that youve not thought through and you have next to zero idea of what goes into null daily and all of a sudden my opinion as a null player is irrelevantand how it affects other people is very important when those other people are 99 of the population of an entire system your failure to understand that is just another reason why your idea is badly thought out its a selfish idea that you want for you its not an idea thats good for the gameand why would the dev be told to remove his opinion devs are allowed personal opinions that doesnt mean that the design direction of the game will go that way ever some devs like loot spew and publicly stated as much yet loot spew is gone you hang onto it so much because its the only shred of support youve seen for the idea so since the introduction of immediate local one single dev has voiced his support for it and we are 30 pages into an assembly hall thread and no csm has come in supporting your idea to kill nullsec this isnt even the first thread asking for this idea and still no supportso one comment coming up on 2 years old is supposed to be evidence that local has a limited shelflife youre hoping pretty hard on that one kiddo
lets do a check list here a called him out for his stupid comparision to medical community way of suggesting ideas and a gaming community to suggesting ideasquickly changes tactics saying i dont have a clue about null mechanics check b still going on about a single dev opinion still ignores the fact that if it was only a single devs opinion then he would of most likely been told not to post things like that again which not only has he posted on twitter which right in the same twitter comments the other person stated another dev has talked about it during alliance tournaments so we have two confirmed devs and the possibility of other devs agreeing because they havnt been told to stop talking about it also ignores the fact that dev or developers opinions greatly matter when it comes to the subject of change because they are the ones that you know come up with concepts artwork sounds write the code for such change and ectra c makes claims that wormhole space is empty and thus reason for not providing change however the recent expansion quickly disproves this theory as if it never used why further expand upon it d makes another claim about me not taking into account of other mechanics with this brand spanking new mysterious idea that i never posted continues to place post  and provides no backing facts or stats on this idea that i postednot dont know what seeing i have yet to post an idea that this idea would increase current clicking and button pressing e calls me a kid despite the fact that i have done my utmost best to respect him as an adult he doesnt seem to want to return the favorf again attacks an idea that i have never posted i want to know what this idea he droning on about g makes another 99 of the population of an entire system again i would like to know where he gets these stats from please links a table a chart some datah sure devs are allowed to opinions however when being a developer means you have more power it also means that the gaming community will hold your word at a higher standard then some random person that is posting on their forums
anyone know if it is possible to ban someone from a thread no well ok then
ok a few things to shoot from the hip some of these ideas come from this thread some from others and some from in game discussion proposed changes  these are ideas not complete proposals we make these assumptions stations and gates are connected regardless of space secother than where specified  actively cloaked ships are not reportedpilot aggression status unless specified is not reported 1 local take the form of other system channels where it only shows those who choose to speak2 the auto scan system already in place scan times to be set by pilot shows in tab  keep in mind some things will be described later a hi sec  black box reports to ded and concord record of pilots in system sec status aggression status ship class ship board computer populates standings as set by pilot b low sec  black box reports to ded and concord record of pilots in space sec status shipboard computer populates standings as set by pilot c null sec  npc space black box reports to ded only record of ship class and corporation of pilots in system shipboard computer populates standings as set by pilot if an ess is deployed information as if in low sec is reported to the corpalliancestandings as set by deploying pilot d null sec  sov space  black box ded reports to ded record of ship class in space and corporation of pilots in systemshipboard computer populates standings as set by pilot sentry reports for sov holders if an ess is deployed information as if in low sec is reported to the corpalliancestandings as set by deploying pilot for non sov holders only ship class is reported unless a gate sentry is deployed wormhole space will stay the same new deployable modules and ship modules gate sentry  only deployable in sov space  tied to gate is it anchored on only anchorable within 15k of a gate give reports of all pilots who use the gate or comes in range of gate to corpalliancestandings as set by deploying pilot if multiple gates in system multiple sentries need to be deployed us usable by both sov holders and non sov holders so it can spy on you i have not found a viable interface for thisgate sentry decoy  can be deployed by hostile to jam gate sentries also works as a regular gate sentry for deploying pilot active cloak detection array  this is a deployable that must be part of the pos system it anchors similar to a gun or jump beacon senses ship emissions and emits variable bands of energy to detect cloaked vessels personally i would prefer this be a deployable connected with a combat probe scannermodulessignature decoy  dependant on skills fits a hi slot emits ship emission and alters ded concord signal to broadcast a ship type of the blue print copy loaded  each cycle uses on runsignature scanner  dependant on skills fits in hi slot direct counter to signatur decoy  processes reports and compares to sensor array to determine validity of reported data this is the main idea take several of the good ideas suggested along with other things that are already in the works by ccp incorporate them to change things to make more challenging game play
here a few suggestions of my own a give the ability to disable being watched that way you can set it up so that people cant watch you to know what times you are on at b real intel tools instead of a black box the ability to scan a general direction of what ships are by clicking scan then having a little cone that points in that general direction have the system set up though that signature of the ship the harder it is for that compus to lock on thus the cone gets wider c set up an ability for fully customizeable scan with something like the dscanner better filtration controls those are just three very small suggestions to add as my own
1 my mother got pregnant because of this
i have not considered the watch list  that is an interesting idea however there needs to be a major trade off consider block warfare  hi sec warfare hi sec ganking watchlist is invaluable to entities that do not have the power projection defenses of larger entitieswatchlist gives them idea of impending danger to take appropriate steps currently watchlist does not tell you what system a pilot is in or if they are active or not logging in all super pilots has changed fleet objectives  in both directions logging in as a war target has caused disruption ect what would be the trade to have the ability to remove your activity from watchlist your suggestions to changes to d scan are acceptable and is along the same lines as the detailed idea of scanner improvements not mentioned in the above post thank you for your valuable input
a the comparison was sound you dont know anything about null so while you think your idea is amazing people with actual knowledge of null can see that its dumb in exactly the same way as any other subject including medicine a newbie with great ideas isnt the person you should be listening to about the validity of those ideasb you are truly insane you think that is one dev has an opinion the company is going to come crashing down and tell them they are not allowed to voice their own opinions what reality do you live in where a development company would stifle a developers rights to freedom of speech like that the fact that it was 2 years ago and theres still no changes years and years after the introduction of local intel that speaks volumes louderc wormhole space is relatively empty in comparison with the other space its the least used space and why expand it for exactly the same reason its not very well used so they are trying to improve it to encourage more people to use itd youve voice your idea clearly many times the nuking of local and replacing it with an effort based mechanic where are the specifics who rightly knows your idea has not be thought out well enough to have anye total and utter bull from the getgo youve attacked me rather than the argument and refused to take on board any level of criticism im not even the first person in the thread to point this out another person who disagreed with you was trolled and attacked youve set up a troll alt to troll and you are getting upset when called out on itf so youve not suggested replacing local why are you arguing so hard for it theng im saying that you havent taken on board 99 of the population the number of people who hunt in cloakers and thats all is very very very small since thats the only perspective you are looking at to say youve not looked at it for 99 of the peoples points of view is being generoush and that still does not mean that their opinions will come to pass the suggestion that the change is inevitable because one developer is in support of it is ludicrous
this change is quite one sided most null groups couldnt care less who the individual pilot is all they care about is the colour of their tag so for sov holding groups this would barely have an impact for nonsov holders though it would mean that they cant find the basic information they need to assault a system basically you would be giving defending sov holders an intel advantage as well as all of the other advantages they have im in a large enough group that it wouldnt really matter to me but smaller null groups would take this change hardwhat is the benefit of the idea a lot of the resistance to these ideas has always been that the ideas arent there for a gameplay benefit they are just there because certain people think that local intel should only be obtained through input combining these ideas together in one megathread doesnt suddenly add purpose so to many people these ideas will still come across as more clicking for the sake of clicking rather than being designed to fulfill a gameplay need of a given groupif the idea is to remove afk cloakers then keep it simple stop people being able to go afk without getting logged out and tada problem solvedon a side note why is this in assembly hall this isnt a proposal for a csm to back its just another fi discussion thread thats not in fi probably so it can avoid being noticed by as many members of the community
for my inputfor the watch list the game already has a built in mechanism if we do it rightonly allow tracking by players with a green or blue standingif we learned anything from eve we know that spies are present a spy that only reports intel and takes no action to otherwise reveal themselves is part of the traditional meta gameyou can track your enemies by having spies report that data the effort made to cultivate these agents and the human limitations of their reporting ability with delays and possible errors this is what we want from evethe effort at every step has meaning and is not replaced by a flawless automated reporting systemas for dscan i have created a proposal that may solve thisi believe the cycle time for it should consider range both in distance and whether it is limited to only a narrow directional cone
nikk thank you for putting the link the dscan related ideas came from your post in addition what do you think about the deployables i would really value your input on those the modules have been talked about in several places i have not put details to them either also when i put my finished proposal together for the intel package i plan to reference your threads related to it
i have my own version of deployables for considerationoriginally posted november 5th 2013 as a response in a long thread of other itemshave local operate in degrees of qualitygive it two dimensions for this as welldimension one quantity of inteldimension two quality of inteldimension one would give ship numbers then types finally pilot namesdimension two would give presence of neutrals reduce delay to zero then give presence of cloaked vesselsdimension one structures which would be harder targets would be pos add onsdimension two structures which would be easier targets meant for roams or smaller gangs would be only in open space away from overview beacon items these would need to be scanned downexamplesdimension 1 level 3dimension 2 level 3full list of pilot names with faction tag visibleship type listed next to name highlighted if cloaking activedimension 1 level 3dimension 2 level 0full list of pilot names with ship type next to nameno faction standings listed not defining cloak statusall updates delayed by 30 to 60 seconds balance adjusting by devsdimension 1 level 1dimension 2 level 3no pilot names4 numbers listed 1st number is how many friendly pilots 2nd is how many are cloaked3rd number is how many neutral or hostile 4th is how many are cloakedand for the curious here is the actual for the 03 combothis tactical setup could be anchored on relatively short notice and has no strategic side as the above dodimension 1 level 0dimension 2 level 3a single light indicatornot lit if no other pilots presentgreen light lit if all friendlyyellow light lit if hostiles presentred light lit if hostile cloaked presenti figure this eliminates any need for hunting cloaked ships specifically although that can be sorted into if the devs see balanced opportunityif done carefully it can actually be effective and a good support for everyone having a great game play experiencethe two dimensional system has one side for sov level support only truly threatened by massive blob warfare which only offers mass level intelthe other side is for pilot level whether operating solo or in small groups the intel is more detailed as well as quicker to install or destroy depending on your perspectiveboth benefit strongly when the other side is presentupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
yea that would bring little life to cq even some roleplaying to it i like it
id like to propose1 any titan that bridges a shipfleet must jump with the vessels to the destination as a fleet and the ability to bridge the fleet alone be removed2 when a titan and its fleet lands the ships will land around the titan in the same relative position to the titan as it was at the time of the the fleet jump the sun would be used as a point of reference relative to the titan prior to jumping and the location of the cyno for landing allowing for fleets to form up prior to the jump3 ships could be up to 25km from the titan prior to jumping
surely this completely and totally prevents smaller alliances from ever using any kind of a titan bridgeyoure not going to see for example rooks and kings pipebombing a cfc fleet if they lose a titan every time
what do i trade to give up watchlist well of course i would give up watch list itself losing watchlist means that the aggressive entity also loses the ability to keep track of when the defensive entity so watchlist in this case is it own balancer again im attempting to provide a feed back that i dont care if a change is put through or not im simply stating that if a change has to be made then far many more steps must be added then just adding a tool that gives defensive entity to hunt afk cloakers as with the many above arguments cloaking and in some cases hot droppingwhich is a semistretch seeing local is reporting the hot dropper is the only balancing factor to locals omnipotent always reporting intel
youve always gotta love the my payment is the same the fact that i lose the same mechanic which i never use is payment enough right youre opting to remove something which you dont care about losing and comparing that to the loss of it to someone that uses it a lot so once again we fall back to you making suggestions for gameplay changes to gameplay you are not part of incorrect cloaking is a mechanics designed to be used strategically with other mechanics it has absolutely nothing to do with local intel people like you continue to say afk cloaking was invented in response to local but prove it prove thats the case to suggest that suggests that a people think you can catch ships with a covops ship and that is their intended purpose and b when faced with the inability to catch ships in a covops ship they resort to sitting a character there and leaving which does not allow them to catch anythingafk cloaking was a designed as a low effort resource denial tactic against entities with a set home nothing more other than providing the method by which the target sees the cloaker local had nothing to do with it if you were unable to go afk without getting logged out it would force people to have to actively cloak to have the same effect if people want to do that that should be perfectly viable but they should have to actually do it not just sit their pc doing it while they sleepand the thing is a lot of this comes back to the ability to hunt a cloaked pilot as a cost for them being able to not be on intel but like above thats not a cost since an actively piloted frigate getting scanned down takes some serious terribad playing on the side of the pilot an active cloaker would still be untouchable and rightly so by keeping on the move just like any other frigate is just with the added benefit of still being totally invisible when on grid with targets
i love how lucas glosses over details particularly when devs have repeatedly pointed out they cannot predict emergent gameplaythe whole bit about implying how afk cloaking was intended by devs pricelessi like how it is implied in the past that devs planned local to include faction standings rather than giving it to everyone as a reaction to a third party app that one group had developedbecause you know they can see the future and know how everything will be usedwhich wildly conflicts with any dev commenting otherwise of coursethe last part which acknowledges the stalemate existing but implies that this is intended rather than emergent just wowupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
was this deliberately ironic please point out where i stated that devs designed afk cloaking i merely pointed out that afk cloaking was created to deny resources to enemies over a long time period with minimal effort not by teary eyed cloaked hunters that couldnt catch ratters like you continue to bleatwhen it was originally designed it wasnt when it was later redesigned it quite obviously was designed to show standings or are you saying that the standing icons on local chat are an elaborate bug thats slipped though undetected all these yearsmost devs havent commented on it at all how do you even remotely get the idea that because one dev has stated his personal preference and thats all that the designed and implemented features of the game are not there by design simple question was immediate local programmed into the game or is it a a weird bug that ccp are unable to remove even though they removed it in wormholes i cant catch awake and actively piloted frigates in a battleship either so i guess that needs to changeill say it again a covert ops ship is not an interceptor clear enough stop trying to use it for that purpose then crying when it doesnt workand finally that last part was actually pointing out that active cloakers would be completely unaffected by adding the ability to scan them down since noncovops frigates are also impossible to scan down if they are active and have an iq above 7 so it was pointing out that you saying remove local and the cloakers will pay the price by being scannable is a totally once sided change since the price is irrelevant to anyone except the afkyou need to learn to read my friend
well all i can say everyday i see tones of isboxers and their number strogly increasing and they go pvp they have so many isks so they can do what they want and normal players losing ships to them in pvp even with much more better skills by beeing overnumbered its not fair it will ruin game ruining its balance maybe ccp will get more money but soon they will loose much more when ppl will leave this game cos players will not play game where cheating is allowed officially
i have often wondered why miners are restricted to gallente mining class vesselsi propose that 3 additional ships should be added to provide variety and attract more industrial folk into the gameminmatar mining bargethis is concept art of what a minmatar barge could look like it is essentially an old rusted steel girder with an engine and lazorsamarr mining bargethis is concept art of what a amarr barge could look like the t2 variant could be black perhaps and be khanidcaldari mining bargeand finally here is concept art for a caldari barge i found a use for this otherwise useless hullif there were racial mining barges this could lead on to pirate faction mining barges such as mordus angels mordus angels mining bargeplease discuss my proposal

three things1 mining barges are not gallente they are of gallente origin but they are their own separate faction with separate ship skills no racial prerequisites are needed2 a long time ago each race used to have a racial mining frigate and cruiser when the separate ore line came along the racial cruisers fell out of favor and the mining frigates were never very useful past one week eventually the racial ships were repurposed into t1 logi ships3 why
why not just have one faction of cruisers
because each faction has different traits and tactics that sets it apart from the others mining on the other hand is tactically two dimensional you mine and either you tank whatever threat presents itself or you run awaybesides this would undo the changes that were made to deracialize mining which was a common complaint back in the daynow answer the question why
just more variety i guess each race could be stronger at using specific crystals ice for example is race specific isnt it
i like the idea of the fairly new high sec war mechanics but they just do not work as intendedfirstly corps and alliances such as marmite forsaken everyone vs everyone etc make a joke of ccps intention of making war more meaningful because they mass dec all of high sec how can a war be mean anything if most war decing corps dont even check who they are decing and simply dec 3456 corps a day in some cases the cost of a war is nothing to 95 of a single eve people nevermind a corp or alliance the mechanics support mass decs the mechanics suppress new corps and force many new players out of the game because they get hammerd constantly by mass dec corpsalliances and thats no fun sitting in a station all day or getting killed constantly with no chance to win the mechanics suppress mercenary corps because it encourages mass touting as an ally without ever turning up for the war or even speaking with the corp you offer to support for isk the mechanics encourage griefing because there are few limits on decing the mechanics encourage the 00 draw wars it cost so little to dec you can just dec 20 corps and not turn up for most of them and simply camp all day at a trade hub having played this game since 2005 i have seen how the changes have affected the game over time gone are the days a new corp can form and thrive build up and move to 00 as part of an alliance they join or create now there deced within days of creation and destroyed before they get a chance im not saying this didnt happen before but its alot more common now i get survival of the fittest but the conveyor belt to 00 is getting weaker by the day high sec wars have always been and can be the making of a corp but constant decs without anytime to recover is simply a mechanic to remove people from this game completly if its not fun why should they stayin my opinion new mechanics need change the systemdesign some kind of limit or much higher cost to multiple decsperhaps a corp can become undecable for 1 week after a war if the war is not extended to everyone 2 weeks to everyone if surrenderdnew corps can not dec or be deced for 1 month after creation unless they join an alliance insert other ideas herei understand this is a sandbox you dont want to set alot of rules and restrictions that you want the users to create the content but this is a core foundation of the entire game high sec is the start for everyone and the support for low sec 00 and wh the mechanics in place strangle new players and corps so perhaps some of the above ideas can be implemented in such a way as to not appear limiting some kind of narrative reason why or made up bs reason why there are limits but however its put in the game it needs to be there this is not something to think about for along time i really think this is something that needs to be a prioritythanks
it costs a minimum of 50 million isk per war dec which doubles for each week it is active if someone is willing to spend 5 billion isk on 100 war decs then raising the cost of declaring war isnt going to stop themplus you can always bypass exponential costs by declaring war on different corporations with shell see empty corporations and then the aggressors jumping between the corpsand you cant put meaningful restrictions on the war deccers ability to do that because it will then affect the ability for defenders to jump corp and avoid wars because they use the same mechanicsexploit found have your alt in a shell corporation declare war on your industrial corporation surrender to your alt you are now immune to war decs for 2 weeks rinse and repeatthis is basically dec shield 30after a month drop corp and reform it you are now immune to war decs for a month rinse and repeatoh such corps can only be made by newbie characters roll a new alt character either on the same account or on a trial and train up the basic skills to make another corp it only costs an hour of your life and a small bit of isk er no highsec is like any other area of the game the difference is that aggression comes at a cost either in the form of war decs or ship loss to concord yeah you have some starter areas and there are some special rules in place for those specific systems but eve is eve you can evade pvp sure but you cannot and should not be able to avoid the threat of itand being a newbie is no excuse with the right mentoring and backup a newbie or bunch of them can be quite dangerous goonswarm proved this some of the newbies i see joining fw prove this a guy i am mentoring proves thiswinning at eve has more to do with mentality than anything else
ok great i dont have a problem with anyone finding exploits in those ideas so come up with something yourself anyone can find problems but not everyone can offer solutions no it is not each part of eve has its own rules and is slightly or alot different then other parts but high sec is the only place every eve player will visit and is the place where everyone will spend at least a portion of there timethe problem remains and you offer no solution some corps and alliances are mass decing high sec and killing off new corps before they get a foothold in the game the ally system is harming merc corps because you can just ally with everyone for very small amount of isk and not bother with the war the original concept ccp had for the new war dec system was more meaningful wars wars over something not 3040 decs on at a time mass decing all of high sec then camping the jita gatesdoes anyone have ideas to bring more control to the amount of decs you can have at any one time that is natural leaves the choice in the players hands and fits into the idea of meaningful wars
i offer no solution because i do not see a problemedit also just because you see some wars as meaningless it doesnt mean that the other people will see it the same way for me killing people just because is a perfectly legitimate reason
this thread has run its course in so many circles chasing its own tail i might add it has made me a bit dizzythread lockedisd ezwal community communication liaisons ccls
the number isnt strongly increasing due to the fact that the setup is so difficult that most people couldnt be bothered with it at all  learning how to effectively control your 20 accounts that are trying to do different things is a huge learning curve people multiboxing heaps of account will never be a problem in the big picture
well there was those guys in gents awhile back that boxed 20odd supers between them  can be attributed to causing an alliance to lose their space but they burned out because multiboxing like that is a level of effort that only the most insane could handle longterm
honestly this is why i havent gotten into it i just cant be arsed to figure it out set up all my clients exactly perfectly so that the multiboxing will work and all the other crap that goes into it eve is a game not a job and that seems a lot like work to meeve is a multi player game and you are the content  ralph kinggriffin being meh at two things is not better than being great at one  lugh crowslave
i would buy one on launch day
i still want to see this for the community think of the uses and tearsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
ok we get it your a bad ass uber killer who doesnt give a f the problem you fail to see or understand i dont care personaly why someone decs somebody else i care that they can dec as many corpsalliances as there bloated wallets let them and the effects of this mass decing have on eve and high sec if you dont see an issue with it then there is no need to reply to this at allcontrary to what was said earlier i think a much higher cost to war would reduce the mass dec problem it might even make them take some care as to who they dec if you x4 the current cost i dont care how rich you are you wont want to lose 101520b a week on wars you dont even try and fight the countless 00 draw wars it would force them to consider the decs more carefuly it would also help protect smaller and newer corps because they would be less likly to spend 200m on some 20 man bunch of noobs when its unlikly they will see any action or return on itif anyone has better ideas by all means share them but there is certainly a problem a problem and it certainly does not match what ccp said they wanted from this new war dec systemjust saying
remove concord problem solved
yes please buff us nullseccers its annoying to have to use my alt to grab skillbooks and itd be nice to be able to undock in jita again
had a lovely discussion with an incursion fleet about this the other night i brought it upthey liked the ideathen i said that it would become a prime target for gankers there was silence as they thought about ityup fair enoughthey then went back to dreaming about what the ship would look like who would make it and the varying capacities and loot mechanismsmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
well mike in the first few pages i made suggestions as to builders and bonuses as for my suggestions on looks the art department would be better suited to make that call im glad people are liking the idea and hopefully we can get this thing made for everyone even if tweaks have to be made so long as it helps the community as a whole im not glory seeking but at the same time hopefully id get at least some credit for it hahai am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

hello pilotsiUFFFDm here today to bring some unfortunate news to you our csm9 representative matias otero has decided to resign from his csm duties due to personal reasons he has informed ccp of his decision to do so and while we are of course sad to see him go we respect the fact that real life issues must of course take priorityhowever every end is just a new beginning after internal discussion and talks with the rest of the csm we have decided that we should not have an empty chair for the rest of the csm9 term we have agreed that with the new release cadence it will not be difficult for the new member to catch up on thingsas such we have picked the 15th member from the list the next highest number of votes from the csm9 elections to take matiasUFFFD chair so please welcome our new csm9 representative  asayanami dei he will join the team as soon as all paperwork is sorted but we hope to have him with us for the csm9 summer summitif you have any questions regarding this or any comments please feel free to post in this thread ccp leeloo
very excited to see what asayanami brings to the table and that corbexx has a new tag partner sorry to see matias go but he clearly didnt have the timeenergy for csm
very sad to see matias leaving the csm but also looking forward to working with asayanami ccp falcon  eve universe community manager  ccpfalcon
as we have seen with matias and others in the past sometimes the life of a delegate just excludes them from participating fully in the csm process replacing them with the first runner up is an excellent way to encourage future csm candidates to up their game in the elections and work hard when awarded a seat which can only lead to a better csm for you all i certainly am looking forward to welcoming asayanami to this csm
welcome asayanami  i am looking forward to working with you also sad to see matias go i wish you all the best 
its to bad matias wont write his own rssignation for publication that ccp that publish its more stronger and personal
farewell and welcome in that order respectivelyfor those of you who monitor the csm doings yes this is a new precedent mmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
confirming rl can be a pita with regards to csm duties happy that matias was able to come to the decision on his own and free up the chair for someone able to contribute a bit more
the op thinks that exercising of player freedom is a problemfortunately despite whatever lie he might want to spout about ccps intent the truth is pretty far away from thatthere is no problem here
5b is pocket change for most people a wardec group has no issue keeping that up 100 wars is ridiculous to be honest personally id increase it 10 fold andor put a hard limit on how many wars you can be involved in as an aggressorthe problem with wardecs is that all they are is a means to pay off concord to not intervene they tried to fix that by adding the whole merc system but all that did was open a pathway for scammers while still not making wardecs actually mean anything
which then puts wars firmly out of reach for youngerpoorer players while doing nothing to stop olderricher players from continuing on as usualand a hard limit on war decs is easily circumvented by having a shell corporations declare war and just moving back and forth between themand making it so that players of an aggressing corp cannot leave it until a war has ended will create a situation where no one will be able to leave a corp if the defender makes the war mutual and refuses any surrender requestwars mean exactly what a player wants them to mean it is all about perspectiveyou may not see any point or meaning to a war the other side may feel their reasons for declaring war are perfectly fine there is no right or wrong answer
incoming war decs on op
it does but they wouldnt be able to have so many simultaneous wars if they did want more than the limit at any one time they would need to split up for the actual wars you cant be in 2 corpsa simple short time limit on leaving an aggressing corp would prevent thatwell yes and no the vast majority of wars are used to bypass concord and generate thousands of legal targets to farmof course not but most people have no reason beyond easy targets no concord the few groups that are legitimately fighting with each other for a real reason would have no problems with a limit to the number of outgoing wars even if it were as low as 10 for example because very few people have genuine grudges againt that many people all at once
and if people are willing to put themselves in a position where dozens upon dozens of people can attack them at all hours of the day anywhere in the map let themthe targets can organize themselves and shoot back you know they just choose not toyou obviously dont play the way i do if people dont have a grudge against me in the first place they soon will

well i use a mac so lol and also no is boxer for mesomehow i seem to manage just fine using apples built in tools to send keystrokes to multiple programs as well as having enough monitors to see all my clients simultaneouslyi do use a repeater but if it is part of the core os  is it 3rd party osx and eve client that is 2 partiesmac pro  dual quad xeons 64gb ram 6 monitors  18 clients  no problem  no 3rd party software all done via applescript and tools that come as part of osx
rekt
if ccp bans isboxer then they also need to ban use usage of mac clients get rekt
i think a lot of people myself included would be pretty pissed off if they got to doing something like that before fixing balance issues gameplay issues bugs etc
hello fellow capsuleers i wanted to take the time to apologize personally ive decided to resign from the csm rather than let my seat go to waste it was a difficult decision as i felt that i could at least have spent some of my energy on the allimportant issue of new player attraction and retention but in the end i had to admit to myself that it wasnt going to happen it appears i have made a catastrophic missjudgement of my own ability to juggle the csms extensive responsibilities with finishing a degree and working to pay the bills in hindsight seeking csm election at such a point in my life was not my brightest idea i overreached and to those of you that entrusted me with the responsibility to represent your vote i am truly sorryi wont be seeing many of you in a while as i get my things in order and achieve the things i have reason to value in life but a bit down the line when things calm down a bit maybe during some holiday you might find me behind some forgotten gate attempting amazing things with a brave crew because you can never really quit eve there is nothing quite like it you just go on a breaklovematias
3ccp falcon  eve universe community manager  ccpfalcon
via con diosand eve is always here waiting behind said gate for you to come backmscary actually
i 100 want this this in it self would curb force projection and bring many many titans out of the safety of the pos and we all know what happens when things like that come out of pos shields they would also mean fleets that want to travel far to get in on a fight will have to think about do they go fast and bridge all the way risking the titan or take the gates oh look now we have the chance to blockade a route now we have the chance of having the 300 hot gates i have been asking for this for a very long time make it so
lol yes
actually the bigger groups would just risk the titan when you are jumping 1000 megas into a system to blot out the sun a single titan jumping in then back out is hardly going to be a worry smaller groups though with just a couple of titans they would no longer be able to hit usso agreed lets have this more power to the blobs
small group are a serious threat to nullsec please make this so ccp as we require a mechanic to be changed to protect us from this scourge
to put it short  there needs to be a third option in the corporation hangar section of the roles window currently query and take to allow people to do manufacturinginvention without allowing said person being able to take stuff out of said corp hangar at a station or a rejig of the roles for station based corporation hangarsalternatively allow for the lockdown of all items in corporation hangars this would mean some lockdown ui changes to be made as well as the mechanics of it alright that sounds weird time to put the long post inso currently there are query and take for corporation hangar access permissions i will go over them in the context of indyscience query  allows the user to use the blueprint for copyingtimematerial efficiency research only if it has a material component you cant do ittake  needs query too allows the user to do everything with a blueprint but now they have access to everything in the corp hangar trust is a fickle thing i want the middle ground between these two the ability for people to use the bpos bpcs and the prerequisite materials without being able to actually move them into their own personal hangar or to any other hangar of the corporation i dont know if ccp look over these or not but i feel that considering the crius industry changes this would facilitate the changes on a corporation level and be beneficial for all who do such activities in groups
that would be very useful to be able to outsource production jobs i think it would greatly improve industry at a corp level the blueprint locking mechanic is honestly awful especially now that jobs at a pos cant be run from a station hangar
i havent messed with the new indy ui since crius but if it is anything like the old one having a separate get from and deliver for both the bpoc and mineralsshipmodule would be great just get the bpo from the corp hangar and then deliver it right back when the job is donehonor is a fools prize iglory is of no use to the deadi be a man post with your main vasavi community manager
op i like this do you want the output to remain fixed to hanger you specify essentially you are allowing a corp mate to loan you his indy slots or flexible enough to be redirected as the users wishes they can build themselves a hull from corp resources and have it land in their lapsthat all said  is this bypassing indy risk that ccp wants to maintain
youll want to test this but i believe you are able to prevent corp members from adding or removing items from a pos structure through the management menu at the pos for each individual structure interestingly theyll still be able to view these items so in theory you could set your equipment factory to allow folks to put mats into it but not take out at the structure level while giving them givetake other at the corp level give this a test and let me know if it works o the downside remains that you still cant protect yourself from an internal attack that comes in the form of someone installing and then cancelling a ton of jobs eradicating your mats stock depending on the project that can get pretty expensive
if its built in corp hangars the scope of the output should be corp as it seemingly is right now not at all you would still have to move blue prints around and draw money from a corp wallet to start jobs this is simply fixing up a flaw that gives more power to players running industrial operations if you can lockdown blueprints why not items although i prefer to go with a third form of access
this i havent tested but the roles are there to facilitate it iirc to reiterate op this is for station based researching where such roles do not exist i almost misintepreted your quote as i was typing for the uninitiated only directors or the job maker can cancel jobs you are referring to the job maker cancelling his own jobs something i havent thought of out of scope of the op but good advice 
yeah my bad here assumed you were talking about poss there arent any similar protective mechanisms for stations o
simple solution is to allow corp members to make stuff from materials in the personal hanger array problem solvedbut yeah corp and pos roles need a complete overhaul
o asaycongratulations with the title good luckand i wish the best for you matias UFE0FUFE0FedU00A0U00BDedU00B2U009BedU00A0U00BDedU00B2U009AedU00A0U00BDedU00B2edU00A0U00BDedU00B2U009C
im pleased to hear matias took the initiative to resign instead of letting a seat go to waste welcome asayanami
7o
congrats space buddy to think we where drinking beers to help drown your sorriers at ffestnow they can some how be celebitoryalso
cool thank you for flying asaya air
did he jump or was he pushed he was barely engaged with the election process i can imagine he was at best an absentee member which cant have gone down well with everyone doing all the workim glad that hes realised its a serious position and i hope his replacement performs well
now we can really say that the csm is an adhoc group of peoplecongratulations buddy now get out there and work hard for everyone but especially wormholersinappropriate signature added ccp notarealdev
glad to see another wormholer on the csm even more excited that he will be at the summer summit
well this is overwhelming hiall i can say is ill try my best 
good call matias  the rest of csm9 congratz asayanami can you elaborate on that since we have an stv system all candidates that got in the csm have the same votes and those who did not have zero  left after elimination etcdid you run the stv process again without him to come up with asayanamiplease dont take this as tinfoil or so  as someone whos interested in the csm process im mostly just curious how you determined the successoroh and a bit off topic but a nitpick of minewhile i would even argue that player actions are part of real life because the players are real and try to avoid the term i have come to tolerate it but isnt the csm a customer focus group and shareholder of a gaming company how is that not real lifei do get the meaning and of course everyone has a different priorisation like eg familysome friendsjobother friendschessclub chairmanship but the term real life has this connotation that everything else must be less important because it isnt real i call shenanigans eg eve is clearly more important to me than people dying in congo as i spent x time and y money on the former and pretty much 0 timemoney on the later and its not just a game its a parttime i enjoy a community i am part of and an anchor of friendshipscontactsand for some spending considerable time on the csm very likely takes priority over some other real life things or plain other things those priorities change of course as everything in life can change so no reason to critize matias but also no reason to diminish the relevance eve or the csm in general by stamping it not real rant over i guess sorry
tinfoil is appropriate however asayanami was the last candiate to be excluded my calculations said by 80 votes at the last round of cuttoffmangala solaris has 1550 votesmajor jsilva has 1474 votesasayanami deihas has 1395 votesthere were 2 candidates left to fill and asayanami was cutfor the truly voting tragic i wrote up about this at 201405csm9electionreviewofvotehtml
all the best to matias and welcome aboard asayamami
no we didnt want to complicate the process as we wanted to get asayanami on board as fast as possible it takes some time to get into the team and as we have summer summit coming soon i decided that this will be the best way to get a new member in for now if such thing happens in the future we will make sure that we are ready for it any feedback and ideas regarding this topic will be appreciated of course 3
congrats asayim really happy for you  i hope its all you want it to be
congrats
congratulations and good luck
well i actually figured out how to run the stv with the official ballots but with matias flagged as withdrawn and i get the same  the current csm9 with asayanami so theres that fun fact in that constellation awoxing pizzaspymaster mcblushooter was eliminated last thanks to all those new propagated brave votesi used the stv code from here and the ballot from heremind im not sure if that is the best way to go actually in fact i could see a rerun minus a resigned member causing someone else to drop aswell if the resignees votes give two candidates a big boost youd have to decide between one of those two somehow ideally based on a set rule not as simple as it looks at first glance
matias may be the hero we deserve but the one we dont need right now so well prod asayanami to push fixing hyperion wormhole breakingbecause he can take it because hes not our hero hes a silent guardian a watchful protector a dark uboat
delighted to see asay on the csm hopefully the lack of uboat videos will be balanced by more wh stuffgo asay
this is great news for everyone and excellent news for wormholers matias was taking up a valuable position and im glad that however this went down it was resolvedmatias is a good guy with good intentions but theres no point in having a position on the csm taken up by someone who isnt going to make good use of it to better eve
please keep corporation bookmarks
i personally voted for you i hope you and corbexx can do a world of good for the wh community and others ofc 
well i guess the new guy cant be any worse than an absent member that  from an outside perspective  did not do very much
this means that wormholes are now more proportionately overrepresented than nullsec in the csmheh its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
but still congrats asayanami dei
thats what its forreal reason pftthis is a sandbox any reason is a real reason whether that reason is for kills ransom or because i dont like their corp name
so the wars become meaningless you cant have it both ways if people are able to use wardecs simply as a mechanic to disable concord then the wars become meaninglessand no those people cant shoot back they are specifically targeted because they cant shoot back if they could they wouldnt be targetted and i know i know cue the massive walls of text explaining how everyone can learn and blah blah blah ive heard it all before but its all horseshit you know how these wardec groups work and you know that the average player stands no chance against themno its designed for people to be able to fight for stuff and over stuff to actually generate meaningful content between empire groups instead its used to save the cost of losing ships to concord when ganking if limits were put in place people would have to be selective over who they attack giving the whole system more meaning clearly it doesnt work as it currently is since people simply use npc characters for anything remotely important you know what i meant by that so stop being difficult and limits wouldnt stop you deccing someone because you dont like their name it would just stop the mass wardecs
its designed to be a way to get around the immersion breaking infallible magic space police for a fee nothing more nothing less no if not so long as no strings attached to suggest otherwise is nonsensethere is no such thing as meaningful content by the way and as for npc corps the problem of them being too attractive is not because of wardecs its because there is too much carrot and not enough stick in the implementation of npc corpsthere is nothing wrong with the mass wardecs if they have the money and are willing to spend it let them
there is something very wrong with one style of play being overpowered and supported above all others its good to be a mass war deccer right now that is a game imbalance pure and simple and nothing kills a sandbox faster then someone pissing in the sandi dont have an issue with anyone deccing multiple targets making war for lols  corp names or just because i dont care that some guys think pvp is camping a gate from a trade hub or if corps just want to farm people for isk i dont care at all its all part of the fun what i do care about is the effects of this style of game play in its current overpowerd state has on highsec and all the knock on effects i previsiously mentionedsome sort of cap or restriction needs to be applied to make this not impossible but much harder if 5b is pocket change to most people then lets seriously increase the war dec costs maybe a price based on number of corpsalliances deced  numbers of members within that dec  and flat fee of some type to come up with a combined fee that increases with each week the dec continuedjust ideas maybe you have some
then i guess it works entirely as it should and that npc corps and corp recreation being used to avoid it is also as intended and thus theres no issue ccp please focus more effort on making nullsec more fun for sov holders as clearly highsec is exactly as it should besure there is people used to actually understand that but it seems as time goes on people whine more and more about how everything must remain as is as if all change is bad theres absolutely nothing wrong with giving a system a refresh and giving it more meaning and value the problem is people refuse to accept any changes because they automatically assume the end goal is to scrap the sandboxits pocket change for an absolutely enormous gain the benefit they gain vs the cost and risk they have to put into it is pretty ludicrous so yes i think there is an issue just because they are ganking noobs rather than mining doesnt mean that they shouldnt need to put any effort in or think about what they are doing if they were limited they would have to make choices they would have to consider their options and weigh the pros and cons as it stands they dont they just attack everyone they can using the cash they get from looting those to continue to grow their wardec listssorry for thinking people should have to make choices rather than be handed everything on a plate for pittance

seems like a lot of people dont understand division of labour
what if the fleet size had a limit example 100 ships
then you limit the ability for anyone not in a major bloc to ever use a titan bridge even more
wed still jump multiple fleets titan jumps to empty system with 100 then back alone then back with the next hundred etc or two at a time or whatever really the difference is we still have an enormous backlog of titans so the larger blobs like us and nc would not suddenly stop projecting because it was more tedious to do wed minimise the risk of losing a titan and if we did lose a couple it wouldnt be the end of the world the groups with a couple of titans they use to get about though they would be completely crippledi think you need to consider what impact it is you are trying to achieve with this change and see if that impact is achievable in any other way
there are two goals of this proposal1 to get titans out of pos shields it is sad when a password has to be used to get a kill2 to make them more vulnerable as they project an entities forcesthanks for the feedbackdiscussion
hmmm then the issues may be unavoidable the problem is always going to be that smaller groups would be unable to cope with a loss of a titan as well as a larger group so forcing a titan to take risks is always going to be increasing the stranglehold that the larger groups havethat said if other changes were to come into place to make reliance on titans less of an issue and to make it harder to control larger areas of space then i could see this potentially causing less issues but only though titans just not being used as much all roundits a tough one p
irl stuff can be serious and i sympathize i just wish i was next on that list xenuria csm
for future reference because it is more fair excluding a candidate is as simple as adding a line to blt file you just add a line after the first line that contains  of candidates and number of seats with the numbers of the excluded candidates prefixed with a you then elect the first candidate who appears in the top 14 who was not top 14 in the prior election
why the first from what i can tell the result list has no special order maybe the original order
i was just thinking if ccp expanded on the new burner missions and made them available in various levels they could be offered by these agents every few months for faction standing increase like the epic arcs just food for thoughtdmc
i could see each navy commissioning ore to create a more survivable version maybe one that had a little more teeth to it requiring cross training in combat skills from the navy lpso it would not be a new skill but would require training to some current combat skillsjust my reaction to first reading this

in case no one has noticed lately almost all roaming gangs are inties now why they instawarp they are immune to bubbles and they can cover insane swaths of space in a very short amount of time a keres rsbed over 3k is at the mercy of a server tick to catch one 1 keep the warp acceleration bonus on the short point dps inties  claw crusader taranis crow lose the nullification2 keep the nullification bonus on the long point fleet inties  malediction ares stiletto raptor lose the instawarpoutside of some really over the top gimmick fleets  smartbomb bses mainly  inty gangs are damn near impossible to catch even with a perfectly set up tackler the combination of instantaneous warp and nullification is becoming a balance issuethanks
in both the skills tab and training queue windows can we have two drop down filters added right behind the filter window that is already there the first would be for primary attribute and the second drop down would be for secondary attribute this would allow me to find all of the skills that i can train with a specific combination of primary and secondary attributes before i use a remap
we tried to discuss this idea last year in fi
your proposal limits titan bridges to the cfc n3 and pl is this intentional can you explain how its good game design in any way
i didnt realize these were locations in game nor were they they only alliances with titans
hey this is a good idea itd give corporations a lot more flexibility and it helps newbros get into industry easier because the level of trust can be defines more clearly
no matter how we look at it where ever multiple players can access the same storage area there is an opportunity for theft i am hereby coining this situation the snowden effect in that he was authorized to access everything he revealed and did nothing wrong until he revealed state secretsbeing able to start jobs from a hanger using only query or some sort of 3rd access level that does not include the ability to move objects completely out of the hanger would mitigate some of the risk ignoring directors and full take access this would leave only jobs as the sole method of removing thingsthis leaves two ways to mess with things that i can see one is to start and then cancel a job but last i checked this destroys all consumable materials that were put in a thief gains nothing in this manner for someone just looking to screw others over this will work however it does require a great deal more effort depending on what is in the hangerthe second method would be to start a bunch of jobs and then have them delivered to another hanger to which the thief does have access of course this is limited to how many concurrent jobs the player can run and it takes time to build everything because the time involved to steal a large amount of assets in this manner could be hugely significant i dont consider this to be a viable method of theft unless done quietly over time basically skimmingi support this proposal because it will reduce the risk of corporate theft by the less trustworthy corp members but it is far from a complete fix for corporate roles
because we are trying to ensure that no existing but still representative is removed from the council it is unlikely but theoretically possible
you see there is one skill UFFFDcovert opsUFFFD that when trained allows you access to two different frigate ship classes the cover ops them selfUFFFDs and also the stealth bombers maybe you could be a little more clear in the solution that you seek as elegant as your statement UFFFDchange the fking skillUFFFD is it does leave a lot of room for misunderstanding i can think of three different solutions you might be asking forone are you asking them to change the skill name to something a little more generic that would not share the same name as one of the ships if so maybe they could rename the skill to something like UFFFDsneaky little shipsUFFFDtwo are you asking them to rename the skill to UFFFDstealth bombersUFFFD and keep itUFFFDs same effect giving access to both ships my fear here is that in a week you might be back trying to fly a cover ops frigate demanding UFFFDchange the fking skillUFFFDthree maybe you are asking them to split the access to these ship by creating a new skill specific to stealth bombers that would only give access to the stealth bomber frigates this type of thing has happen in the past but iUFFFDm not sure we want to have one skill to train for each and every ship out there soon you might be asking for a skill name UFFFDnemesis stealth bombersUFFFD if you are looking for this solution i just canUFFFDt support itnow iUFFFDm sure if you were to take a little time to enlighten us as to the nuances of UFFFDchange the fking skillUFFFD and what you have in mind we might all find a way to support your ideas
stop posting plsyour posts are almost as horrible as mine
dear csmccpi know its a bit late to bring this up but i did not have much time and motivation to play eve the past months and only just found out this change has indeed affected one of the things that makes me log into eve and this thing is dear to me so i make this post even though i currently have barely any hope that it will matterin rubicon 11 the following change was introducedthe jettison option has been removed from various deployable structures that have a cargo hold these items are only launched into spacewhen i read this i was not active in eve but i thought i hope this does not affect secure cargo containers but i just found out that it does which made me you see the thing that i loved doing most in eve iswas subwarp racing but now that esport may never be practiced again at least not as we know it subwarp racing required the tedious process of building tracks using secure containers to build square or arrow shaped checkpointscorners accurate placement of these containers was already somewhat of a challenge but after this change it is pretty much impossible by jettisonning you could place them with an accuracy of around 25 meters but launching them only gives an accuracy thats well over 1000 metersthis could be one of the reasons why i have not heard from the subwarp race organizer in monthsso my questions why was this change made is there any chance of reverting this change for small secure containers or even better does this situation improve the chances of my suggestion for a checkpoint mobile structure coming to life is there a deployable that could be used for building tracks instead of secure containers that still provides good placement accuracy close to 25 metersi thank you for any answers you can provide

he means because with those restrictions titans would be far more at risk since the second a titan is out of a shield everyone wants a piece and the only people that could survive losing titans that much are the largest coalitions a group with 1 titan could nto afford to put that titan at risk
i would say that it would encourage individualsgroups away from ships that they cant afford to lose while requiring those that can to put them at risk
exactly this while at the moment small groups can and do use titan bridges to hurt cfc fleets they would not be able to do so after a change like this without losing the ship not something a group with only one or two titans can afford to doand you seem to think this is a good thing why is that

hello this is going to be a lengthy post but ive been mulling with a similar idea jack i understand you would like to see new ships but i believe we have the same goal in mind a highsec ship transport ill make in the form of dev post to be as clear as possible also in this format the csms can bring it to the devs with a viable option in that looks familiar in language im asking everyone here to reconsider repurposing the rorqual to be used as the flagship of these tug class concept vessels its model already used ingame with attributes and stats that can be adjusted rather then having the design team coming up with new ships which frankly all do the exact same thing though the positioning of those ships as orca sized variants is still plausible for empire variants as far as ive seen could be t2 versions of the freighters with but being of lower mass 300000 kg to facilitate wh usage they would loose most of their cargo capacity for its dedicated purpose t2 of hauling ships moving onim going to using the rebalance of the t1 logistics ships transports and industrials the fact carriers wereare in highsec loot mechanics of sma in poss and the general purpose use of the ships class and a bit of game design practicality just to toss it in the mix for proper justificationwhy the rorqual its purpose of crunching rocks has been moved to a pos module now which is where many rorquals usually live long boring lives giving boosts when you look at the ship line its a t2 teir2 orca speaking of whichthe orca its younger sibiling is classified as an ore capital industrial ship that can already haul any fitted ship within is ship maintenance bay smb in hisec having the rorqual be able to do the same thing would only be the conclusion to the ship line not a significant change it does not make sense that the smaller ship is is able to do something the the larger cannot in fact a rorquals smb was limited to indy ships as an after thought even in the descriptionfreighters and jump freighters are also capital class ships in highsec not to mention in days of old capitals were everywhere in hisecwhy not a use carrier carriers dont need to go in hisec the carrier is the small swiss army knife of eve providing various support roles in direct combat situations carriers have the option to joinin in fights while bringing sub caps in its hull to support the fleet even more its a combat ship first and for mostthe rorqual is not a combat vessel could be used to bring ships into a system or wh with out expending time of mutliple jumps this plays into the riskreward factor as a lone roqual is just prey with out the luxury of going into triage in highsec it wouldnt be able to use the industrial core module just as you cannnot use bubbles or bomb launchers or any capital module that im aware of loarget it lore and purposethe rorqual was previously banned from hisec along because the gravitational wakes of its mass ore realizing the needs of deep space commanders went back to the design board extensively using nanofibers and polycarbon structures to reduce the mass of the ship as well as updated ai navigation protocols from the empires keeping these ships from interfering with populated worlds as such concord assembly lobbied by the gallente federation have permitted these ships to travel in high security empire space the empires seeing a use of the rapid deployment have modified some their current freighters to fill this needore ships are primarily focused on industrial activitys on the fringes of space this doesnt mean these are helpless targets as the skiff and prospect can be used for other purposes which adds content for all to enjoythis ship would be similar to a freighter in speed pilots would have to consider carrying a lot of ships or moving with some speed relativeyes it would be a big target and would drop shipsloot similarly to any carrier or sma would there be anything wrong with thatthe numbers well ill start with the most important smb 1250000mUFFFD  1500000mUFFFDUFFFD 250000mUFFFD500000mUFFFD by removing the ore hold 250000mUFFFD adding it to the smb again rorquals dont sit in belts but rather hang out in poss with

versatility and practicality able adapt to fill the various needs of all kinds of deep space industrialists while also being usable as our mystical hswh carrier im open to any ideas and useful comments here comes the rage
agreed 1
oh no my skill train queue is going to take 18 months i need to be able to dump 800 mil to make it finish 12 days faster
any thoughts at all on this
use evemon
while external programs may work i agree that in ingame filter would be nice as wellm
while i agree that isboxer should not be allowed you cant go banning people for just having multiple accounts before the first graphics expansion around 08 i ran 8 clients with out a program after that number dropped to 4 and then to 1 with a desktop that locks up and a laptop that runs slow i have seen ganks with is boxer and those people have had ships replaced due to it so basically ccp calls the other accounts bots but yet it allowed
however if using the rorqual model one would presume an ore manufactured ship and as previously stated ore would not directly involve themselves in building ships that would overtly be used to transport war ships it would ruin their neutrality and likely cause other factions to target them for facilitating thisand who said this would just be high sec because a later incarnation could be jump capable to facilitate transit from high to lownull in a more expedient and efficient manneri am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
that almost sounds plausible execpt it seems youve missed a few thingsore is not redesigning it for the explicit use in war ship hauling is a legitimate business isnt neutral to the empires they have high level ties in the gallente empire remaining diplomatic with the others employs others for security and uses diplomacy fed navy blasters of the black eagles to keep pirates neutral does this already in with orca hull you can place any fitted ship up to bc in a orca with out any repercussions the empires rely on ore hulls for their industrial needs it would be suicide to attack orethe rorqual will keep its jump drive changes can be found in  the numbers  the range will be nerfed a little but its designed is to allow mining commanders to establish a mining outpost in the remote corners of the cluster even deep into anoikis as certain systems may only have a path leading to hisec the roqual would be able to take advantage of these circumstances also when going into the unknown its wise to bring spare ships and modules
i think this is a bad idea ceptors have already been nerfed why does it need to be nerfed again are you not able or capable to think or find strategies to kill themreason they work so well is because they are well made now there doesnt need more nerfing there needs balancing so nerfing  bad soon the only ship good will be rookie ships
i never understood why they were given this capability
hello my name is defiant blessings and ive been a broker and character appraiser on the bazaar for over a year and have been trading characters for  on behalf of clients for over 5 yearsvery recently ccp have changed their stance on 3rd parties posting the sale thread of one or more characters on the bazaar and has negatively impacted my business model in a number of ways however this change in the rules interpretation does not remove the possibility of my service rather it only serves as yet another stumbling block and obstacle in the way of a very large number of players new to the bazaar from safely selling their charactersi would like to request the assistance of the community as well that of my clients to help tell csm and subsequently ccp that this change is not what we wantedit this came about after a number of my vip clients sales threads had been locked and a newly worded ruling on the matter of character bazaar posts had been released on the rules thread i feel this is unfair to the people of eve and of the bazaar mostly because 3rd party sales via unscrupulous methods such as not announcing clearly the ownership of the char as i had have been allowed to continue for quite some time i feel like by being honest open and transparent my service has been punished and i dont believe this is a direction ccp should take the rules of selling characters a link to one of my recently locked threads can be found herethank you all for your time and i hope to see you all on the bazaarcheersdefiant blessings

whats the issue if eve gets money  get real
im gonna channel malcanis and say that this is a pretty darn terrible idea3rd parties can post threads if they can post as the characterassuming they can control the character otherwise alllllll kinds of scamming inbound
thanks for bringing this upthis rule is in place for a reason to reduce the risk of character sales scamming and to serve as a confirmation that the character being sold is indeed owned by the person looking to sellthis rule will not change and the requirement for a sales thread to be posted by the character that is being sold as a confirmation of ownership will standwith that in mind theres nothing more to discuss in this thread so its now being lockedplease do not reopen this topic as this decision is final and please refrain from further spamming of the the fourm report systemccp falcon  eve universe community manager  ccpfalcon
you want to fix nullsechere is funny one every time you cross to nullsec your skill learning stopsno exceptionscheers
uh whatccp are using a wright single transferable vote system the position of people on a ballot has no effect on any other ballot votes cascade down at a percentage of the voting power for a candidate which exceeds the number needed it doesnt matter where someone elses vote puts a candidateif you need 250 votes to be elected and you get 1000 all active ballots with you on them cascade down to the next candidate at 75 efficiency
at the risk of sounding rude i dont think you understand what i am saying unless ccp changed something since last election the problem i describe still exists
then explain it because youre claiming that someone else can affect the value of my vote in a negative fashion either that or youre being disingenuous in your wording of whaaa the cfc can get more people to vote which means the people who voted for me have their votes be a smaller percentage of the total
theres a difference between using third party software and using that same third party software in a waythis also means that the request to ban isboxer by itself is the wrong approach reasons here using software or wooden sticks in such a way should result in a ban if discovered
tin foil may help the issue you seem to have at the momentdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i have been dealing with this problem for sometime buying or selling items is simple enough my own orders are shown in dark blue which is highly visable but the problem comes up when you incorporate the corporation wallet currently if i make a buy or sell order for my corp it shows it exactly the same way as my own transactions transactions i have made on behalf of my corp are shown in light blue text ok so far seems simple but now this is where is all goes pear shaped in the orders section of my wallet it shows the total buy and sell orders in isk it doesnt show how much is made for the corp and how much is personal orders which is a major headache when my own wallet is low because i dont know how much isk i have to play with same applies if corp wallet i use happens to be low at the timeadditionally if other members make orders on behalf of the corp i cant see them in the market windowi suggest that the corp and personal buysell orders are seperated this should be simple enough as the orders are set up using either your personal wallet or a corp walletsecondly corp orders in the market should be highlighted in say green or light blue so they can easily be seen by other traders with corp wallet access acting on behalf of the corp colour should be different to each trader ie if i setup a personal order it should be as it is now dark blue if i set up one for the corp it should be light blue to me and if another trader in my corp sets up an order it should be say green
personal orders show up blue in the market window why cant we have another colour for corp orders this would be very helpful for stationreigon traders ccp fix this please
thats exactly the point i was making only in a more expanded manner
i assumed wrongly that the wikipedia article on the specific voting method would explain it no voting system is perfect but obviously some are more prone to abuse in certain situationsthe vote power can be affected in a negative way mathematically by manipulating ballot positions to counter common ballots of other blocsexamplecfc ballot a b c d l k mbloc 1 ballot m u i w d l peven though m is the first choice on a common ballot or ballot configuration if another alliance or entity wants to make sure that person gets less of a vote they can put that person on the tail end of their ballot if cfc ballot had no m on it then m would have more vote power that is how you do it
yeah you seem to have missed my point also isboxer doesnt actually do those things as proven many times before

lets get some more support for thisi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
with the proper remap i could shave around 10 days off my 70 day skill plannot huge but its still tangible
what get rid of this fantastic running gag no wayit even made it to the at xii commercials
to counter nullbears putting 50 bubbles around their gates
im not a fan of interdiction nullified ships i think the change that needs to be made is to the interdiction nullification mechanics once i think during dominion ccp accidentally nerfed interdiction nullification mechanics it made it so ships could warp out of a bubble but if there was a bubble at their warp destination theyd still get pulled into it this is the change that is needed make it happen again and then the nullified ships still have a vulnerability
mad about the fact that there is a class of ship that is among the most fragile and dpsless in the universe that can escape from a gate camp cmon
you could click on the little flag above the text
that is actually a very good thoughtmaybe with a sov system overhaul ccp could implement some way to reward pilots out of the alliance wallet for doing whatever secures sov optional and scalable by the alliance directorate of courseeg in a usagebased system have isk paid automatically to pilots who use the system in the specified manner
well that large group hellcamping someone out of their sov might very well return to their home and find that they have lost their system when you hellcamp elsewhere you cannot use your own system which in a usebased sov system surprisesurprise makes you lose itso the pipes are sovless gaspno really so what
the idea of the tugofwar is the best i have seen so far i have independently of op drawn up a tugofwar mechanics description features and ideas section and have even independently selected the same term what i would like to discuss is why the sovereignty index should be tied to so many pveactivities it seems overly complex and is prone to balancing issues and the attacker has little influence on it except by trying to prevent the sov holder from doing those and he can only prevent inspace activities not stationbased onesalso sovereignty means dominance control how is dominance achieved by military mighti am thinking that the sov index should be a simple matter of comparing or counting military presence in a system over time index is increased by presence of armed piloted unposed uncloaked ships of sov holder or of ships that have the sov holder blued larger ships  more advanced tech grant more pointssuch ships from alliances that have sov holder set to red decrease the indexwhat do you think
i did not mean your idea would not work it actually sounds good to mehowever i beleive it may be a little more complex then it needs to beif a large alliance can benifit much more from focusing on a smaller group of systems then holding systems they do not need i believe that would be enough the extra mechanics restricting fleets according to the level of those holding the system seem like over kill to me if a power house alliance can spend their pve time in their own system making it even better why would they waste time on a less valuable system out for a pvp roam sure but roams are not about taking space they are about finding fightsthere will be issues with larger alliances keeping the pipes clean possibly even keeping pipes sov free rather than waste time upgrading them just to travel through themi would say pair your idea down into stages start out with a simple basic use it or lose it sov system then add additional mechanics to balance things as players adapt to the new system it is hard to predict exactly what impact the changes will have you could have a group diliberately keep a decent system within jump range free of sov just so they can jump in for a fight with anyone who decides to try and claim it or you could get the power blocks keeping there primary systems and maintaining a large buffer of unclaimed space around them as you say it would be a choice between using time to improve core systems or using that time to hinder others each alliance will have to find their own balance adding another dynamic to sov mechanics with rewards and penalties for all choices
to answer honestly i primarily pve so that is the experience that im drawing upon for ideas i absolutely want sov to be based on activity but it should be equally distributed throughout all of the activities possible that a sovholder wants to do it should also force the sovholder to engage in as many forms of pointgaining activities as possible to maximize their point pool and increase the buffer against harassment if a group only does thinga or thingb to the exlusion of thingc they are losing out on points and making it that much easier for a different group to harassattack their points and drop their indexcertainly ships producedinsuredlost etc by the sovholders should play into their point pool however simply having blues in your space think cyno alts indy alts supertitan alts etc doing nothing should not add to the sov as these characters are essentially leaching off the system you gain sov by doing not by being does that helpthanks
the point of upgrading surrounding systems is to make the supertitan game a difficult one to start and an easy one to disrupt if you lose a level in a buffer system word gets to the home system and all the minions building your titan go on strike because they dont feel safe or some other rp mechanic as far as purposely keeping space neutral if an entity wants to spend the time not upgrading while at the same time using resources to make sure no one else does fine with me sandbox and all thanks
and pray tell why how does it make the sov mechanic better to base it on so many different activitiesand how  i am drawing a real life comparison here  does mining make you secure your claim on territorial dominance other than indirectly by allowing you to produce the tools of warand would it actually help an invasion if the attacker sent in a battalion of mining shipssince the attackers can bring their alts as well i dont think that would be a problemagain i think tugofwar is the alchemists stone i just wonder about what the best methods for gaining and deducting sov index points should be i am inclined towards military presence only because it is a something both sides can do equally well and b it is much simpler and c it is more real lifeesquei think sov should be fought over not minedrattedrelic site hackedinvented over
which the suggestion does if you project your forces elsewhere you are not at home or not in any other system where your sov claim can be nibbled away by smaller groups and it it will be increasingly difficult with more systems to defend them as the crucial attackdefense does not happen at a certain point of time anymore  to which you can force project your entire armada  but to an extended period of time which means you have to distribute your forces over time and space which is more difficult the more space you have to cover
the wiki article didnt explain it because stv doesnt work that way or at the very least wright stv doesnt work that way so heres what happens in your mock election assuming 2000 common ballot and 1000 cfc votes with a quota of 1000 which means two seats  quota  votesseats  1 firstchoice appearances are tallied which gives us m and then a as meeting the quota andthats it they get elected election over2000 cfc ballots and 1000 bloc 1 ballots ends the same way in the above exampleif its a three seat election then quota  30004  750 votes for election as with above first choice votes are tallied m has 2000 votes a has 1000 votes both are provisionally elected excess votes on the bloc 1 ballot are calculated first as they have more votes there are 1250 excess votes 2000 total votes were cast on that line so 12502000  625 votes per ballot in the line passes to the second place candidate on the list or 625  2000  1250 obviously the math is easy with such a simple set of ballots it gets much messier and complicated when you have more variety anyway u has more than 750 votes so u is elected and the election is done  all three seats have been filledflip that around 2000 cfc ballots and 1000 bloc 1 ballots and it works the same way except a  m are elected and cfc excess elects b bloc 1 ballots have excess as well which they never get a change to distribute though it doesnt actually matter as 250 votes wont elect anyone anywayfour seat quota of 600 votes back to the original example a  m are elected u is elected from 1400 spillover votes his spillover is then calculated 800 votes pass to i likewise 2000 cfc ballots and 1000 bloc 1 ballots elects a and m and then b  cetcso lets take the extreme example 2000 cfc votes and 1000 bloc 1 votes but the election is for 8 seats so a quota of 334 votes the earlier mentioned simplistic nature of the ballots makes calculating this really easy  take 2000 and subtract 334 votes pass to the next in line so a is elected with 2000 votes passes 1667 to b who passes 1332 to c who passes 998 to d who passes 664 to l who passes 330 to k well crap still not enough seats to prove my point really we wind up wiith a m b c d and l elected then it distributes excess on the bloc 1 ballot and we pick up u and i as well huh not enough to prove my point what about a 10 seat election i cant hardly go any higher than that youve only got 12 candidates listed so now weve got 273 votes as a quota 2000 votes for the cfc ballot 1000 for the bloc 1 and now were talking candidates a  m are elected the line with a on it has the most votes so their excess is distributed and wouldnt you know it it trickles down to 362 votes passing along their line to candidate m who according to you now loses the election or somethingwell no not really hes already elected so those votes skip him try to go to the next person which doesnt exist and so just fizzle out and do nothing weve only got 8 people elected and need 10 so we move on to count the excess on the bloc 1 ballot and enough votes cascade down to elect u and i as wellworks the same way in reverse if we say bloc 1 has 2000 votes and the cfc ballot has 1000 m and a are elected then u i w d l and p make it in on ms spillover b and c make it on as spilloverat no point in this process does it matter at all that m was listed on the tail end of the cfc ballot and im not sure theres any stv system where just listing someone on the end of your ballot is a route to ing them over just because its such a blindingly obvious hole in these voting systems which believe it or not were crafted by their designers to be fairso yeah theres that
funny how we keep bumping into each other i am not very good with numbers so i am not in a good position to refute your essay on the subject matter maybe i missed something or overlooked something its very likely any time numbers are involvedeven conceding that particular point the fact that the mittani can buy up thousands of accounts just months before the deadline and use them for votes is something i think should at the very least be discussed internally by the csm ccp has maintained that scamming or coercing votes out of people is perfectly legitimate just as is paying people isk for votes however i feel that the meta of having enough money in real life or in plex to farm accounts for the sole purpose of voting is unfair i have said it before and i will say it again eve is a microcosm of a social civilization as such the same ills of any real world system of voting or governance can be seen here in new eden the csm being stacked with cfc members is not in dispute at this point rather what is a subject of discussion is should anything be done about itis this echo chamber working as intended or are external factors being used unfairly if you wanted to spear head that line of discussion you would save me having to run for csm

the only one that would ever be flown is the caldari version but even that would be rare as it currently is more people go for yield over tank so unless the existing barges and exhumers are removed theyll still be the primary ships as they get a bonus you might see the caldari version on a large mining op as a bit of antiganker protection but considering the incredibly small risk of being banked your lost income over a traditional barge would rarely be worth it
interceptors can warp quickly yes but theyre unable to achieve instawarp without sacrificing some low slots or rigs meaning theyre giving up dps or ehp in order to achieve itthey really arent that impressive of a ship until you have a blob of them fast yes but fragile and while a few of them had respectable combat abilities it was primarily because of their weapons bonuses otherwise catching a web and a scram on them makes them melt to a stern lookUFFFD

eve online has been around long enough that its player base is aging i know a number of players that are between the ages of 4565 yes i now really need to use bifocals transitional lens glassesthe user interface is crowded but there are a few key things that are useful while playing the game like broadcastsits a small thing but that portion of the ui is pretty important is there any chance we could make it easier to see and respond tosimon
my thought process on including indypve activities in the sov mechanicjobs creation in my mind and to fill in the rplore side of things the capsuleer is basically trying to become king of the system a good king looks out for his subjects and makes sure they are happy i want each of the people living on the planets that im the king of actually want to be my subjecthence i have sovereignty over them on the other hand i could just flex my muscles and fly ships through the system and blow stuff up both are ways of dominating the system and either alone could do the job so why not include both in this mechanic
steve mentioned the discussion in the thread to me so i swung by to take a look seeing as i wrote an extensively read blog post on the topic back when ccp swapped to wright misunderstandings of the system are at least of casual understanding to me regardless of who is making them in any case use that as a starter read the wiki etc if youre worried i may have distorted it in my blog and take the the time to educate yourself on how the system actually works then perhaps we can have a discussion about the system without resorting to things that neither side can satisfactorily prove or disprove like buying thousands of accounts to vote withas to the csm being stacked with cfc numbers i can pretty much assure you that the number of cfc members on the csm is more or less exactly commensurate with the total proportion of votes cast plus or minus the granularity brought on by thousands of votes as compared to fourteen slots i did however just return from a night of drinking in iceland so  if i can go back and dig into the ballot right now to demonstrate this however if you agree that two step is probably a neutral uninterested party you can use his numbers here we put two definitively cfc candidates on the council by which i mean we had two people  myself and sion  in our top slot of the recommended ballot ancillary candidates included angry moustache jayne fillion and xander phoena who made it in technically you can call ali aras a cfc candidate as well  she was featured prominently on the ballot  but while two steps analysis doesnt show this a cursory examination of the results file will show you that she made it in entirely on the strength of her own support and ours didnt actually do anything for heranywaybased on two steps analysis we cast anywhere from 14 to 26 of the votes depending on whether you count full votes only or full votes and partial votes or somewhere in between see his thread for definitions of that stv is supposed to produce a result proportional to the voting population thats important and well come back to it so 14 times 14 seats  thats 196 candidates on the council more or less exactly equal to sion and i at 26 itd be 364 candidates on the council as xander very likely had a decent chunk of his own support in addition to whatever votes cascaded down to him plus whatever portion of gents at the time listed him in first place i think its pretty safe to say that the cfc is in fact represented exactly as we should be given the turnout for this yearwhich brings me back to that important phrase the voting population whether you believe or not that the votes are real or are just dummy accountsdoesnt matter really no election system in the world can claim to accurately represent a population where a portion of the population does not vote and frankly the eve population is put to shame by approximately every democratic country on the planet when it comes to turnout and again being perfectly frank there are two kinds of people in eve those who to be charitable do not like you and those who have not heard of you the latter probably also fall into the category of do not vote if you want to do something to diminish the cfcs presence on the cfc my recommendation would be to try to reach out to those people and get them voting rather than try to run yourself good luck  many others have triedwith that said im drunk and tired and my bed is calling im out  peace
i understand what you are saying i just dont agree with all of ityou say that if the number of cfc candidates is proportional to the voting bloc than no problem exists i simply disagreeeve is not perfect its just as crooked and messy as anything in the real world that said i think that all players are stakeholders in eve as a product as such rules should exist to limit or at the very least shine light on the presence of an echo chamber even if you arent willing to entertain the idea that your master buys accounts for voting you can at least accept the plausibility of such a tactic moneyisk should not equal votesdelegates at least not at a 1 to 1 relation right now it does i see this as a structural problem with the csmhypothetically a single player can change an entire election simply by being inordinately wealthy and committed to doing so
while i was not on for this it has come to my attention one of our corp members has been perma bannedwith ccp flip flopping over everything i would like an opinion from the elected csm members this is not about cyno bumpingthe simple question is is this titan fair game to bump
bumping stuff which is inside the forcefield is seen as an exploit afair there should be a gm response to this topic in this forum somewhere 1 year ago or so
the rules have been notoriously unclear regarding this with most members believing partially exposed titans being fair game i have seen several players requesting ccp to make an additional post to clear the situation out but i have not seen any official responses to get permabanned in this manner under these circumstances must be an error and i hope the situation can be resolved happily
i believe it is unfortunate that ccp take the approach of permaban and ask questions after the format of you are permabanned unless you would like to respond to us seems silly its as if every engagement must be frapsd in case you have to go back and prove you werent breaking todays rule suddenly we are like the police and have to video record everything silly there needs to be a better process  zion
the part bumped wasnt inside the forcefield and was able to be interacted with multiple titans have been killed by this method due to going too far out of the shield and being bumped further this is completely different to what youre referring to where titans were being bumped while fully insidea perma ban for this and the reimbursement of a titan lost due to the pilots mistake is crazy
this should in no way be seen as an exploit bump it is tragic that an irresponsible titan pilot who had obviously left himself vulnerable should be reimbursed and that a player should be permabanned for what should have been a legal bump using a tornado ccp has at this point completely removed any element of risk to owning a pos titan which is counter to the spirit of the game as we know it if this kill was not a legal kill then everyone must know that they cannot ever try and touch a titan in a pos in any way that would lead to its destruction unless it is an awox apparently even if the titan or any ship for that matter is sticking out of the shields this along with the new change to cynoing on a tower will make having a titan in lowsec absolutely risk free thats really just what we need sarcasm
the playerbase have been roaring over the pos bumping issue as a potential exploit for weeks with no response from ccp for some reason youve now decided to address it badly instead of acknowledging that there was an issue  and that ignoring it was an error  youve chosen to permaban someone who was likely acting in good faith based on current mechanics if you are going to mix this kill in with the other two titanposbumped kills when it is clearly not in the same bracket id like to see the list of other people permabanned you dont have to accept eyewitness accounts or 3rd party vids but you could engage a shred of common sense and a bit of decency when dealing with these issues seriously this is a grossly unfair punishment directed at the wrong individualsplease stop retrospectively permabanning people for flawed gameplay mechanics which are strenuously reported  then ignored
o7hello i hope you are having an excellent spacedayi think medical clone costs should be reduced by 90the mechanic is interesting and adds depth to the game through consequence but the isk cost is too high considering the alreadysevere penalty for experiencing clone loss after failing to maintain an updated clonei think there are three factors that while mild on their own are too punishing when they are all true simultaneously isk cost of medical clones is high consequence of failure is high eve is not a default freetoplay game but gameplay is taxed by default isk cost of medical clones is highfortunately i find myself needing highergrade medical clones due to training rather than pvp loss in the last two months i have incurred almost 350 million isk in medical clone costs for training if i lose pods in pvp i will incur this cost again and there is no limit to the number of times i can face this feeconsequence of failure is highshould i fail to maintain updated medical clones i stand to lose the one thing that can only be gained with time sp my characters are currently using 4 and 5 attribute implant sets so reacquiring those implants after a medical clone loss merely resumes sp accumulation this falls short of regaining lost sp even in exchange for isk it is a permanent loss of subscription timeeve subscriptions are not automatically freetoplaybut the medical clone cost is automatic as if eve was automatically freetoplay in other words medical clone costs are a default tax on gameplay when by default gameplay costs real moneyof these three factors the only one that can be expected to change is the isk cost of medical clones i think the isk fee should exist as a formality in amounts that are onetenth of their current levels
you got podded enough to blow 325 million isk on cloning fees were you pvp training because you cant get podded doing pve unless i missed something
accumulated enough sp to break the clones saved sp limit
you have been playing far longer than i have and in my opinion you need to learn to manage money rather than push for changing cloning costs ive upgraded past the skill point limit a couple times and been podded as well yet i can still manage to afford to update clone all while keeping a ship wrapped around my capsule for more pewpew thats coming from somebody that has only played a month or so
youre essentially engaging a question thats been around for as long as the idea of voting has been namely do those that do not engage deserve a voice you may not be asking it directly but what you are putting forward is just another angle another side of the question the voting system in eve is wide open theres nothing about the system itself that prevents or prohibits someone from voting  so with that in mind let me pose to you the counter question how does any course of action any change to the voting system itself produce a better outcome for those that do not make their voice heard than ensuring they are aware that they have the choice in the first place is something they are aware of how does punishing those who do make their voice known loudly and effectively improve things for those who dont speak up at all or to pose this a third way if a notional silent majority exists how do you claim to know what they want that the beliefs you propose are in their best interests or in their interests at all after all theyre silentas to the notional buying of votes im well aware that its plausible as i studied the plausibility myselfand concluded its a hilarious waste of a lot of isk in light of the fact that weve demonstrated the ability to capture two seats with straight vote power since well before we were ever wealthy enough to consider buying them
i would love to hear from the developers how anyone would have know that bumping a ship sitting outside of a pos would be considered an exploit i fully expect ccp to make this right
in regard to this particular thread nulli seems to have taken this issue and went on a parade with this it is a bit of an insult that they go out in public and wave around their new titan the link to their thread  it is of course in japanese you will need to translate that of course
snip
it all depends how ccp defines inside the forcefield is it you can not lock it  inside ship center inside  inside everything inside  inside i dont knowi only posted what i think was the last official gm response on the topic
the problem is this information flips all the time one gm will say someone else and another gm will say something against what the other gm just said
do the gms even play this game and understand how it works how can one pilot receive a perma ban for what has been regarded as a legitimate tactic for the longest time when the pilots performing the actual exploit elsewhere walk away unpunishedpretty sloppy work from the gm team at the very least
so bumping titans which are completely inside the pos shield by means of a mass super jump to a nearby cyno is ok but bumping one left sticking out of the shield is permabannable offensethis has to be one of the stupidest things ive heard in a while
ok yeah guilty as charged i did get caught without enough liquid to cover clone costs its one of those things in eve that if it was to my liking i wouldnt make a thread about it of course if it was a nominal fee i wouldnt have been short on isk either i dunno i kinda knew it was going to be my personal crusade of the week did some forum  google searches for the latest med clone discussion but they were all oldhaving made my point and looking around obviously there are bigger issues and im ok with this particular one kinda this one i can deal with and move onespecially after reading your reply so thanks for that milin i think thats the most innocent comment ive ever witnessed in evei didnt use the words naive or cute because they would sound condescending but yeah i wanted to ruffle the fur on the cute wittle newbieanyway about my isk one thing that happens after some experience and wondering how to get isk is market trading buy some things sell them meanwhile you hold on to a lot of stock its an easy mistake to end up with too much inventory which is what ive done my immediate sellable inventory is around 11 b other assets of mine require extra steps to sell like the 3 billion isk outfts worn by six seven of my characters im imagining all the players who have ridic amounts of isk who would read this and be like rain stop being poorits a good point that higher upkeep costs are part of the territory for an experienced sp heavy player  character i should and can afford it buuuut im sure you can relate having funds to buy something doesnt mean youll be happy about needing to the inconvenience becomes a danger when its not a onetime expense and theres no limit to how many times youll incur this purchase no matter how much isk you have any sum can break the bank if its applied an infinite number of times this is definitely true at about tree fiddy million a pop pops a sequence of soul crushing popsnormally when something is hopelessly broken the answer is dont do it but in this case the thing is playing at allbeing out in space or accumulating sp passively both are things that can break clone limitsa good thing about high clone costs is it promotes ship class progression in order for the justfordying expense to be proportionately justified im limited to capital ship ops or supporting capital ship ops it would be nice if that was the intention its a valid concept that more sp equals bigger ships i understand how it could be seen as a good thing from ccps perspective but again even for the purpose of pushing higher ship classes the unlimited number of times you would have to purchase new clones after losses makes the feature a broken onethe smart thing to do is maintain several focused lowskilled characters i didnt understand this until it was far too late but should grooming high sp characters be a mistake thats what it is right now
keep the support flowing and fingers crossedi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
does anyone have any new input todayi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
it seems ccp cant give me an answer on their own rules and told me to ask hereis the rules during war and pending war for pocos in lowsec the same as in hisec shouldnt ownertransfering of pocos during war be illegal or impossible
the rules for poco transfers is the same between highsec and lowsechowever in lowsec it doesnt really matter if someone wants a structure dead they will shoot it war dec or not
as i assumed tnxdo you have a link to a page which the rules states that the rules are the same for hi and low sec
rules in low sec are more of polite suggestions if you want it dead take the sec hit and make it deadi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
good lucki am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i understand your argument and concede that it has merit you have information that i simply do not and my perception is such that because the csm has become a cfc echo chamber there must be something wrong the reality it seems is that nothing is wrong that said i disagree with you on some fundamentals just because the cfc has the largest bloc does not mean it needs a proportional amount of delegates as it stands i think only one delegate should be allowed for each bloc this way others who have less of a voice can get a chance to have their interests voicedeach spot should be for a single delegates from a specific demographic
the problem is defining the demographics are incursions a demographic because a lot of incursion runners are alts of people who do other things like wormholes and nullsec how about industrialists because theyre smeared over the whole of new edenits a nice sound bite but it doesnt translate well to reality
yeah the system in place right now has the perks of being transparent representative of the voters but not of the population  which is pretty much as it should be if you want things to change then get the people to vote not complain that those who did failed to vote for yougoing back to the original concept that being at the bottom of a power block ballot would somehow ruin the candidates chances please re examine the last election and the cfc ballotmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i have and i am the last person on the ballot
it doesnt fit within the spirit of the sandbox style of this game for a ship that has several km sticking out of a force field to be not bumpable if the player in question had of used some sort of hack or had even been within the forcefield like they said maybe i would feel differentalso to permanently ban someone that has spent years training a character over a rule that is not well known or known at all is outrageous
if i had being flying around and seen said titan i would have thought it was fair game i think ccp got this one wrong and said player should have never being band for his actions
when and where was the public announcement made that this was an exploit and would result in a banplease reconsider and revoke the ban on aglons account extremely harsh and seems to have come out the blue
i call this bs are the nc guys baned for using the cyno and titans to bump the titan out no so what the actual f
i have now had 4 groups of people we shoot at regularly people with a legit interest in there being one less of us convo me to say aglon got an unfair deal fix this ccp
ccp have really over reacted on this but because this isnt a big 00 aliance shadow cartel  soul takers are unlikely to get any luckim with them on this the titan sticking out like that is fair game to bump if you cant safely park your titan in a large pos then you really shouldnt be flying one in the first placeccp need to reinstate the account of aglon and provide clearer clarification on the rules
two things id like to points out ccp has a policy of not commenting or sharing gm communications there are probably details we are unaware of and wont become aware of if a guy was perma banned for simply bumping a titan ship out of the pos without forewarning andor a chance to toe the line of ccps fairly ambiguous precedent id support getting that permabanned removed it seems pretty severe however i really wonder if there is much more to this story than is being made public
it is completely ridiculous that a game that serves as a vehicle to form friendships and into which people pour years of their lives may see a players existance wiped out without warning and at the whim of a person that is unnaccountable and his interpretation of undisclosed rules despite ample previous accepted practice to the contrary
a really great article written by evenews24 which includes detailed information and interviews from both sides of this
yo ccp take de dam ban down mon
ccp has to revoke the ban or deliver an explanation for this other than has not entered force field passwordto me it looks like in order to bump the titan entering the force field of the pos was not necessaryi suspect the log clearly shows the titan inside the force field not considering the whole hitboxif thats the case apologies are in ordereven if the bump happened inside the force field permaban is still overkillps im not affiliated to any of the partys involved other than them propably being red to me
being personally involved in this i got the final blow on the titan and knowing the involved parties i can tell you that no there is nothing relevant that you have not been made aware of this issue has been completely transparent on the soul takersshadow cartel side the gm who banned aglon is to put it bluntly being lazy not paying attention at best or at worst incompetent
its still a good idea 1 more 
why thank youi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
hi allthough this is not a concrete proposal i believe this forum is the right place for this thread as i do want to propose somethingi want to propose that the csm and ccp think about the following philosophical thoughts for a minute or two whenever they judge future proposals or changes to evei am a rather new player about 18 months active playing now but i have already seen a lot of evemy main is living in 0space having a lot of fun pvp fighting for cfc but i also enjoy cearbearing in high sec with my alts at timesrecently i have been reading in this forums a lot and i got the strong impression that there is a never ending tug of war going on between cearbears and pvpersas i am a bit of both i can understand both sides argumentshowever there is one thing i could not disagree more about in the argumentation of many pvpersto give at least some concrete example i will stick to the discussion on the local chat in eve but please remember that this is not meant to be a discussion on this topic but more a general philosophical discussion on where do you go evein that mentioned and over and over recurring discussion here in the forums the remove local chat faction constantly argues it cuts my freedom to hunt down caerbaers whenever and wherever i whant it is unrealistic it violates the sandbox nature of eveall of you agreeing with these statements i would like to invite to think about the following quote by the philosopher jeanjacques rousseauso to transfer that to the example lets assume the local chat is being removed without substitutionthat would leave the caerbaers with no chance to effectively avoid pvp and force them to do what is against their will thereby confining their personal freedomthat is in my opinion how we should think about freedom and not the other way that simply means anarchyspeaking of realism many people do argue that if eve where real the universe would be harsh and full of pirates and there would be no such thing as a local channelis that really trueof course there would be no such thing as a local channel but in reality the caerbaers are the vast majority in all societies and they would find other ways to protect them efficiently from piratesmaybe a mobile sensor array that constantly scans the system querying transmitter codes from all ships and warning the owner if some ship does not send a code or sends a hostile code and even monitoring gravity to tell if there are cloaked ships present somewhere in the systemin a real new eden there surely would be lawless outer space regions as we have it with 0 and low but in the more civilized regions high the billions of caerbaer dads would definitely find a way to prevent pirates effectively from killing their kids on their way to shool there would be some superconcorde not only finishing off a criminal immediately after he committed a murder but also imprisoning him and taking away all his belongings they can get hold on whenever he enters their territory thereafter in a new clonealmost as unrealistic are the consequences of the wardec systemno civilized region in space would tolerate corps or alliances at war shooting at each other all over the placetoo much risk of collateral damage civilized regions would realistically be regions where most of the time it is highly unlikely though of course not impossible to be shot atcorps residing in civilized regions would use espionage economy and jurisdiction to fight each other and alliances at war in outer space would block each others logistics at the borders of lawless regions but they would not be allowed to fire at each other in civilized space without any consequences by the local authoritiesso arguing proanarchy with the realism argument is a farce in my opinioneve is a great game and not least because it is a sandboxand after all i know sandbox stands for whatever ccp wants it to stand for but my believe is that sandbox is not equatable with anarchy but with freedom and maybe one should think twice about what type of freedom we are talking herethere will always be plenty of opportunities for us pvpers to do what we love as there are plenty of other pvpers in the universeand after all to me it is the real fun to compete with someone who is a worthy opponent and not shooting at almost defenseless miners or ratters i love my freedom to pvp whenever i want but i also concede to everybody who does not want to pvp the freedom not to do so
anyone who actually holds such an position regarding pvp is to put it bluntly playing the wrong game its equivalent to buying a call of duty or battlefield game for the storyline while you can technically do this it is not what the game is for
the majority that think local should go dont advocate a simple removal they know and understand that this change should come as part of a package of changesthis will mean you will have to work a little harder to gain your intel rather than simply seeing that hostilealso the removal of local works both ways an enemy jumping into a system will have little or no information on what awaits him and the home field advantage may in fact increase but then that would require people to actually do something to protect themselves not unlike the current situation which is rather funny as quite frankly self help and protection seems alien to manyccp have wanted to change local for years but as and until they find a route through this particular maze i wouldnt hold your breathdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
yet another argument one can often read on the forums that might be what you wish eve to be but that is not what eve actually isif that was true eve would be like  lets say mwo where pvp battles basically are the whole gameeve is so much morejust have a look at ccps advertising for eve on the homepageeve should attract many different gamers with many different playstyles and roles in the sandboxi believe they all should have their niche in the universe and their fun playing eve the way they wantand does that hurt the hardcore pvper in any way no
anyone can do whatever they wish but this will mean that everyone else can try to interfere with their attempt welcome to the sandboxalso id like to point out that pvp includes but is not limited to ship combat almost every aspect of eve is pvp so much so one could argue ship spinning is included although its been some time since ive seen a high score thread on these forumsdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
all those things you listed op they are forms of pvp and conflict too or they fuel pvp and conflict at the very least
magsi am absolutely with youdo not misunderstand me i am pro local removal  if it comes with an adequate replacement that does not involve hitting the dscan button every few seconds distracting me from focusing on the rats in an anomaly making rattin
you cant have it both ways in eve thats the pointthe very sandbox nature ensures that the freedom given includes the freedom of screwing over everyone else thats not forcing anything on anyone its been the rule since day onei dont play chess then complain some pieces move differently the game is the gamedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
that is part of my concern there are pvpers and pvpersthere are those who fight in pvp battles against each other for money for territory or just for funi count myself to theseand then there are those who shoot sitting ducks just becausewhat if they have driven away all the ducks one day and there is no one left to fuel the alliance wars protection for the ducks  
the thing you are not seeing is that the ducks still very much contribute to the wars and conflict they try to avoid if they do not wish to be hit with wars and conflict then they have to not contribute to any of it which means they cant really perform any activity in the game
that is where i disagreei believe that we can have both the ganker of course should have the freedom to attack the carebear any time and anywhere but the carebear should also have the freedom to escape and avoid battlemany people argue it is against the sandbox to admit that freedom to the carebearthat argumentation in my opinion is ridiculousrather opposite it is against the sandbox not to give that choice to the carebear and it is forcing him doing things and it does confine his freedomwe may of course talk about their chances to achieve their conflicting goalsthey should be at least 5050 if we want to keep the sandbox really neutralbut my personal feeling is chances should be rather 7030 in favor of the carebearwhy because the ganker is the aggressor and being the aggressor should always have a priceand after all it increases the thrill of the hunt for the ganker
you already have the freedom to avoid or escape battle but nothing is guaranteed and rightly so this goes both waysagain this has been the rule of the game since day one its the whole point and nature of the game i find it rather odd that someone would join a game like this and then expect it to change for themat this point i wonder what it is you are actually asking for we can never have complete freedom in a sandbox as it would be anarchy and unplayable so we have a small set of rules and many many tools at out disposal you have options you always have options but its about playing smart not about wishing for the game to be rigged in anyones favouras far as you price argument is concerned there is already a price it just depends on which area of space you play and what other players you interact with make you payhigh sec ganking without rights always comes with a price in actual game mechanics just as in low its just that high secs price is a higher one but ccp want players to protect themselves and charge a price they deem fit they dont wish to involve npcs any more than they already are its not their role or responsibility to protect what you have in eve its yoursnull and whs have their own price but with a far lower npc involvementdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
that is exactly the point the game should not be rigged in anyones favor if it wants to be a real sandboxbut in fact it is currently rigged in favor of one playstyle over otherswhat is currently happening in high sec with all those broadbandneverending wardeccs i do call that anarchy and almost unplayablea neutral sandbox that is not rigged in anyones favorwith as little rules as possible but enough rules to prevent anarchyand  rules is even the wrong word here as i am talking about giving the players choicesmaby a concrete proposal will demonstrate my intentions betterintroduce a complete new type of slot on all ships called acmslots aggression counter measurethese slots should be reserved exclusively for defensive pvp modules like warp core stabilizers target breakers etcso a miner would be able to harden his ship against pvp attacks without weakening its mining capabilities or a ratter would be able to do the same with his pvefitted battleship again without weakening the ships efficiency in shooting ratsthis of course is just a very illconceived idea i had while writing this post so there will be plenty of space for criticismthe main goal of the idea is to illustrate what i actually would like to sayright now we have the situation that the moment i am pointed and webbed and i am sitting in the wrong ship or wrong fitted  not meaning bad but for another purpose than pvp i am basically out of optionsas a pvp pilot in a pvp fitted ship however i do have options in most casesthis situation has to be endedin the described situation all pilots should have the same options cards to play regardless of the hull they are sitting infitting a ship specially for pvp should only affect its offensive pvp capabilities pointscram web ewar defensive pvp capabilities should be fittable equally by all ships not influencing their capabilities in the main role they are fitted forif that could be achieved i would be the first to claim remove local chat without any substituteand it would guarantee a fair game in many other situations as well
no it isnt rigged in anyones favour unless you consider playing smart and working with others to succeed being riggedyou mean war decs that are easy to avoid and even shield from completely its not rigged and you already have choicesyour complaining about the core of the game rather like complaing about paying a fine when landing on someones property in monopolyships are balanced so that you have to make choices one of those is higher yield or better protection but then we have other choices in which we can choose both but in doing so it requires more people working together to succeedits the same with those in combat ships they have fitting choices to make and they may not get it right all the time the one thing we must avoid are fotm or op ships they will be the death of the game its one of the reason we have balances passes on shipsyoull never get what youre asking for just take a look at recent balance changes to ships there is always a price to pay its down to you to choose what it is and how muchdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
ok you made the point mags my failure was i totally  really completely  ignored the working with others to succeed aspectof course i am aware that this is an mmo and actually that is one of the main reasons why i do play itand i am flying around in fleets and gangs for pvp a lotbut somehow when it comes to activities other than pvp in my corp everyone does his own thing alone so in my head it was always pvp  group content pve  solo contentso i would say yes the game is rigged against solopveplayers in contrast to solopvp which is a viable playstylebut i agree thats tolerable considering working with others  if you have the luck to find some 
bump
all of this is a lot less serious when the name changes are restricted to eg once every one  two  three years like the neural remap timer and becomes eligible only after twelve months of subscription
i hope he can escalate the situation to a more senior gm and find a more reasonable resolution then
another article about this on themittani
the exploit notification doesnt say anything about entering the force field or anything of that sortit says bumping ships that are located within password protected starbase forcefields out of the forcefield from outside without having the correct password or corporationalliance permissions as configured in the tower settings is considered an exploit its unclear when exactly is a ship considered within the forcefield and when its considered outside itsome think and thought for years that once a portion of the ship protrudes from the field  its fair game to bump it outsideheck ill bet a toe even ccp thought that for some time and they policed the game accordinglyothers think that a ship is outside the field when its lockable and while its not  its a no nothats what ccp seem to think at the moment and they police the game accordinglyall this mess could be easily avoided with clear phrasing of official statements leaving no room for interpretation unfortunatly that would also commit ccp to have a clear consistent outlook on a number of issues depriving it of tailwagging space and its usual sporadic behavioureither way aglon made a scapegoat is ridiculous given the fact that travis musgrat seemed to walk away from his cynobump  it only shows the double standards at work something that doesnt add to experience of doing business with ccpso to sum it up  clean up the official exploit notifications and unban the guy
of course you are completely right about that i was trying to make a pointi am perfectly aware of the mechanics and also of the notifications but to any player that isnt  the titan is clearly partially exposed when you dont need to enter the force field in order to bump how can this be an exploitthe problem is not the lack of awareness of exploit notifcations or incomplete understanding of game mechanics its the game client that shows a ship thats supposed to be inside the force field to be outsidehow can you ban someone for getting misleading information from the clientnext they release an exploit notification saying there is a speed limit on high sec undocks and start banning people not slowing down immediatly well the client doesnt say anything about it but there has been a notification somewhere on the website ccp needs to get this right
the sandbox of eve is for players to build explore and create without limits from time to time players have been know to find and abuse exploits this was not one of those times aglon was faced with a titan showing a vulnerability and he had the skills required to capitalize on the situation no exploits were used to gain entry into a force field no cynoUFFFDs were used to knock the titan out please do the correct thing ccp unban aglon someone has put years of hard work into the making of that character dont wipe it away like it was nothing
confirming everything targ said above do the right thing here ccp
and now a word from the other side of this debatecamera pans over to the empty seats across the table as a tumbleweed rolls bythere you have it folks not even your own elected representatives have stepped up to say anything about this something to remember come election day i am sure unless there is a scandal involving a rubber duck a bag of strange white powder and your favorite politician we now take you live to jita where another scammer has promised double isk back over to our live commentator in jita
trolol been about 4 days with no csm or a ccp response however i am not surprised from csm as a majority of the members just represent null sec kinda begs the question what is the point from this verdict how it stands now pos titans would not have any risk other than axowing or spies suppose it is a good time to resub a spy alt and get a proxy again
lets hope ccp do the right thing here so lets try to get as much support for this thread as possible freealgon
this really needs a response from a gm with a definitive answer to the exploit situation community manager wwwbattlecliniccom battleclinic loadouts  killboards  forums twitter anabariceve wwwthebastardsnet recruitment open
the exploit notification was clarifiedit is considered an exploit to bump ships that are located within starbase forcefields by any means that bypasses the requirement for a correct password or access permissions as configured in the starbase tower settings to achieve the bump if a password or access permission would not normally be required to achieve the bump the action is not covered by this notificationthe clarification doesnt leave much room for interpretation if you bump a part thats sticking out of the force field you obviously wont need any kind of access permission etc to achieve the bump and your actions are not covered by the exploit notification the gms can still of course ban you for it because the game is a sandbox  their sandbox 
well said kaz while we may all be at the mercy of what mood ccp are in on any given day we do have a valid point here the rules arent clear and players like algon should not be made to take pictures and fraps of their actions preemptively to defend themselves from possible bans ccp pr department pay attention to this post and respond it looks and feels very much like you are trying to sweep this under the rug unless you plan to ban entire alliances you should realize by now we are not going to leave this subject alone until we receive a logical response respectfully jazz
i would just like to point out that it is literally disgusting that this has gone on this long with no official gmdevcsm response to this thread certainly none of our current csm will be getting my vote at this point
this has not been handled correctly at all that rug at your hq must be getting real bumpythis needs a clear ccp response not the usual under the counter backdoor kept quiet for security reasons excusesi dont envy the ccp reps at vegas when aglon gets theresalt
i too find the lack of csm interest bothersome even a hey we see how this sucksaglon did what anyone else would do titan was vulnerable due to pilot error and he took the opportunity presented this heavy handed banning is ridiculous and should be addressed asap
the way i see it we have 2 major problems i would like to address them separately1 the rules regarding this bump are unclear while ccp has announced that bumping ships inside a pos wiothout a password is bannable this titan appears outside the pos if a ship is considered inside a pos when its model appears outside then this needs to be clarified and the game mechanics need to be fixed a perma ban for unenforced unclear rules is absurd imho2 the enforcement of this rule is very biased the way i see it this pilot has been perma banned yet in other recent titan pos bumping activities i have not heard of a single punishment in ncdots recent kill that seems to meet the same exploit criterea i have not heard of a single pilot being banned if the rules are to be forced fairly shouldnt every pilot who exploits be punished the same if our tornado jockey stays banned but the entire ncdot titan fleet that performed a similar exploit go unbanned i will see this as bob mk 1 era favoratism
just curious is there a certain percentage of the ship that has to stick out of the shields to make it fair gain or can i just have it touch the shields for me to get crying right when its get shotalso am i to understand that only npc ships can freely engage any target anywhere or can i get the serpentis belt rats banned for harressmentmaybe something silly but it seems to me that if you wish to change a certain behavior it helps to explain what it is you wish to change not just ban and make a guessing game out of the reason
that is what everyone is trying to convey to ccp their official statement isbumping ships that are located within password protected starbase forcefields out of the forcefield from outside without having the correct password or corporationalliance permissions as configured in the tower settings is considered an exploit1 please define within2 do parts that hang out that players can interact with as allowed by the game engine count as within3 is it within if its not lockable and outside if it is lockablethere is no clear definition that a player can use as a reference to know if he is playing in the sandbox the way ccp wants them to play so in this case a titan hanging out of the pos shield which can be interacted with and doesnt need a password because on the client side its exposed and bumpable somehow falls under this rule and gets a player perma banned what a joke
i agree with most of posters wrote above the permanent ban is quite ridiculous and harsh those reasons behind it is unclear also this whole affair is kinda ruining sandbox nature of this game how can we create content in this game if some developers or gms ban the actions of a capsuleer with unclear reasons
there really needs to be some major clarification on what is an exploit and what is allowed when it comes to bumping at poss the lack of consistency on these type of rulings is troubling
hello space peoplei am happy to announce that we have finished the summer summit for csm9first things first planned date to release the minutes is 31st of october 2014 winter summit is happening in january 2015 we are planning a few changes to the summit for example we are planning to add a few extra topics to the next summit as additional sessions were positively accepted this year this is not confirmed yet but because of this change the duration of the summit will probably increase by 1 day making it 4 days in totalthis time around we had 29 sessions csm members spent over 30 hours in our office over the course of the summit feel free to ask any questions in this thread  ccp leeloo
any idea when this will occur
someone told me itd be a free holiday in iceland i should have known it was a scam come to iceland they said itll be fun they said what do you get 30 hours sitting in a meeting room
wait u mean its not like some 247 htfu permaband show o
i knew betterstill wentm
we had a lot of excellent discussion at the summit and the csm responded very positively to the plans we put in front of themwere going to be writing up a dev blog about our upcoming plans as soon as possible but at the moment were fairly focused on getting all the communication done for oceanus so it likely wont be until after oceanus ships oceanus ships in a week
thats cool with me bro  3
wheres my minutes dolanoops sorry i had a bit of a flashback there carry on end of october sounds greati heard some ccp devs can write code by plugging a rock band guitar into their pcs
you didnt appear on any official cfc ballot anywhere not even last and you just quoted the person who did ive no doubt our ballot is floating around the wild for you to check again
i am not going to argue this with you it would be against your function to admit anything
please let me know when you have things that are factually and demonstrably true and perhaps ill admit them however sulking off because youve been shown to be wrong  intentionally or otherwise  in virtually every facet of this discussion isnt going to make that any more likely to happen
on the other hand your topic is the only unlocked topic in this entire forumthat has got to count for a win somehow rightright
please keep this kind of stuff on twitter or whatever i dont care if you wanna le epic troll there but this is a formal setting for my csm candidacy
i dont even know the pilot in question but i do have to agree with pretty much all the previous posters the way the rules are being used arbitrarily to punish one pilot whereas another group used an obvious exploit yet none of their pilots were banned i say revoke the permaban of aglon and there should be a recognized and set decision on what consists of legitimate and illegitimate bumping of ships within the region of a pos otherwise arbitrary decisions like this may set a precedent that may lead to a mass exodus of all pilots who are not able to fly a titan because they see that they are treated as second class citizen compared to those who are able to those who are able to seem to be viewed as somehow special and granted special powers it seems compared to the rest of us they are able to light a cyno right next to a post and jump dozens of their ships in knowing that the game will cause some of them to spawn inside the shields before being ping ponged out and thus bowling a ship that is fully inside the shields out and suffering absolutely no punitive punishments whereas a player without a titan used a legal tactic to get a ship to move in a way that he wanted and yet he is permabanned fix this ccp and make a clear statement to players and gms as to what is considered or is not considered an exploit
5 days and no word publicly from ccp only the original ban and the denial of the first reply to the banno word from the csmthe only info that we have in writing is that he was banned because the ship was not lockable and not a single piece of published information that supports any exploit revolving around ships being lockablei understand that we are a small insignificant corp but this is completely unreasonable in any sense of the term currently inside includes outside and banable offence only applies to small groups when the logs show nothing
everything ive read so far regarding pos bumping does not seem to apply to this situation were the opportunity to present itself in this way again i think many people including myself even after hearing of this incident would take the same action i agree with most of the other posts here that we need some actual clear information how to play your game ccp without getting the proverbial banhammer smack to the nuts its got to be bad for business to have conflicting rules that can be loosly interpreted by a gm with the authority to drop the banhammer in this situation it seems to have been done without much thought and that is troubling please explain
thisso i suppose its not the clarification we need its the clarification we deserve meh is it only me or ccp added more words to the notification but havent added any more informationsense
did you escalate your ticket to a senior gm do it if you havent
ccp you should be ashamed of yourselves you built this game based on a sandbox and encouraged its players to think outside the box and find unique ways to kill eachother yet everytime we do and someone cries about it it is now an exploit and you give some half assed excuse as to why you are nerfing or banning somethingthis pilot did what any of us would of done if the situation presented itself so you might as well ban all of us because its a stupid half defined rule and goes against the spirit of the game itselfits time you guys remembered its the players that keeps this game going and money in your pockets so maybe you should show them a bit more care
i would be interested to hear what the csm has to say on this absurd and inconsistent permanent ban considering none of them have seen fit to post on the issue so far
same
first off gm support tickets are considered private releasing them is bannable look at blinkpersonally i can agree that banning someone without a warning is hard for the people involved even the titan pilot bumped expressed the hope that the ban woudl be temporarilyccp is fixing in the next release bumping by cyno and removing stuff from a pos withotu having the password through which ever means if u look at other incidents then there is a wide variation in interpretabel rules and actions from banns to reimbursting titans to not doing stuffi posted it internally th brign it under attention but csm wont take a stand nor pick a side or order ccp nor a gm how to operate especially not in single cases we like to look at the mechanism itself and improve eve so dont interpet my post as a unbann him ffspersonally i hope ofc the pilot can enjoy eve againgoodluck all
except this was not a case of bumping by cyno this was a case of smashing a 100mn mwd tornado into a part of the ship fully exposed from the shield and pointing it  cynoing in dreads well after fully out of the shield the tactic has been used many times beforeall tactics used during this operation will continue to work perfectly fine after the changes ccp are implementing in oceanus
sounds like you didnt really read the post algon was banned for bumping a titan outside of the pos shields the titan was not lockable and he used a 100mn tornado to do it the oceanus fixes do nothing for this this form of bumping will still exist the question was the player was notified that if the ship is not lockable then it is in the pos can someone please show me the rule post etc that states thisthat may have not be worded extremely well however it gets the point across
gj csm
not to mention the whole if its not lockable its in the pos thing is bullshit if its sticking out of the shields it should be fair game
and so the laziness and incompetence continues all i can say is keep posting and supporting the issue hopefully if we make enough noise about this ccp will actually take a look at the case and do the right thingfreealgon
i am sure that with the upcoming patch ccp and the csms have been more then busy with oceanus i hope now that corebloodbrothers has brought it to attention with the csm we will see a swift response to this topic
hopefully now after a mittanicom article an eve news 24 post with over 160 comments and 2 reddit posts with over 100 comments each we are gaining some traction please dont write us off with no response ccp that would be very disappointing for a group that has on average invested 4 years into this game
well i would like to thank a csm for making a reply at least i know one of them is aliveas the debaters and politicians of eve debate over all of the debatable things i would like to point out that my only question was is this titan fair to bump the overwhelming response from the community has been yes but no word from ccp to clarifythe reason it was asked in this forum is that most of eve is under the impression the only real purpose of the csm is to voice major player community issues to ccp and help to resolve them this is all i have asked for i in no way expect the csm to be responsible for getting aglon unbannedwhat i expect from the csm is to1 confirm that aglon was banned for bumping this titan out of the pos shields in a manner a large portion of the community considers fair gameplay2 provide the community with clear details of why it was illegal where it is stated and when it was posted the previous postings that only state in a pos are unacceptable since we understand this one to be out of the pos unless detailed information is included that states what constitutes as in other than the obvious assumption of at least the model being 100 insideif i unzip and have 5 of my thing poking through my zipper and grab it is it in my pants or in my hand most people would argue hand or both not just pantsthe arbitrary ban of aglon without questioning proof or even a stated policy to be broken only indicates that ccp has no stable policy on customer relations and i do not feel that any of us are surprised by thati would assume that straightening out the clarification on the banable offence would either justify or reverse it
not to mention assuming that the ban was legit shouldnt ccp tell the person why with a cut and paste excerpt of the supposed rule be brokeperma banning someone is a big deal take the time and explain to him why
keep the dream afloat folks need this to stay toward the top for all to seei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

the biggest problem with this discussion is one of its basic assumptions that eve is a sandboxeve is not never was and never will be a sandboxwhen you played in a sandbox did some of the kids have sov guns keeping you at your side of the sandbox or at least out of theirs did your sandbox have gigantic whs in it did your sandbox have steps of security so that the playground monitor would ignore you pleas for help if you went into certain areas of your sandboxeve is more like a paintball park there is a fair amount of freedom to move around but both you and your enemies have places of cover provided to you that function similarly to wh collapses the division of space into security zones and of course sov that protects your space even while you are at home eating moms spaghettias to local being an issue i distinctly remember being able to see everyone that entired or left the sandbox so if we are going to pretend that eve even remotely resembles a sandbox then leaving local alone is an imperativeyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
i certainly do appreciate that a csm member finally saw fit to comment on this thank you what i do not appreciate however is a comment that is blind and uninformed clearly the csm member who did respond has no real understanding of how the titan was bumped or what the circumstances were at all since he sited a an upcoming change that would in no way have effected this situation were it in effect at the time cmon csm i really do expect more from you and i think everyone else does as well we are not asking you to pick sides we are asking you to advocate for the player base who wants a clear resolution to this issue i think you all should be able to handle that
yet another day passes freealgon
thanks for the reply corebloodbrothers and i am glad you can at least admit you personally find the ban excessive we also much appreciate you raising it internally hopefully you take on the responsibility of representing our interests in this matter and fight our corner as a csm for the greater good of the players who elected you
ccp should revoke the ban this is uncalled for and no why to treat your customers as no warning was given first to this players about this before hand
so let me get this straightbesides overcoming a huge learning curve i am supposed to know about a list of rules that are scattered about various forums and dev blogsthat the rules are sometimes not very specific and can be interpreted differently depending on the person who happens to get the ticketthat the accused is asked no questions before being banned from the gamethat there is a possibility ccp has no logs of the events so the ban was based on what evidence leading me to surmise that a person can be banned for simply being accused of somethingthat when asked for a clarification on a rule that can get you banned ccp chooses to completely ignore everyonewhat is ccp afraid of obviously something other than basic customer relationsi am now also unclear of exactly what the purpose of the csm is the only one to reply in what seems to be days was clearly afraid to support anything but at least had the courage to be seenunless i am completely wrong about what is going on
so does it count as inside the shield when half of it is hanging out does it count as inside if 14 of it is hanging out does that apply if its lockable or not there needs to be a definite rule and line stated by ccp so there is no confusion based on the screenshot there was a section of a titan hanging outside of the shield bubble that players could interact with and the attempt was made and was successful had the rules been explained by ccp in more detail for example if it is lockable or not players could rely on that to make the decisions on their actions  and this mess could have been avoided
i wouldnt rule out that the pilot has other appealable offenses against him to receive the ban hammer clarification would be appreciated though from this new pilot perspective
senior gm said you have our previous response and closed the ticket
ERROR
even if you dont expect the csm to be responsible for getting your pilot unbanned youve still got a pretty wildly unrealistic idea of what the csm can or cant do as far as specific individual support cases gojust sayinin any case while i dont really give a  about your pilot as an individual case i am a wee bit concerned about what appears edit for clarity based on information thats come to me one way or another from other players to be somewhat inconsistent handling of various titan bumping cases and am doing what i can in that regard aglon happens to fall under that particular umbrella so hey maybe hell get lucky well see what happens
i think it is time to step it up a notch or two roll the twitter feeds and the forum posts freeaglonwhat rubbish that the csm cant do anything about it what the hell were you voted in for to be the players voice so do something about it you guys are in constant contact with ccp this ban is a bloody joke and any sane person know this pull your fingers out
on an extremely related noteif a titan poking out of a shield is not a valid bump target then should it not follow that bridging capsuleers situated outside a pos shield with a titan that is unlockable is also on the list of no goes this should be a bannable offense by associationi have been bridged in this manner before members waiting to be bridged have accidentally bumped the titan sadly this did not result in a killmail so obviously a ban wouldnt happen but if a killmail did happenwho would get banned the accidental bumper or the people doing the killing where precisely is the line
the day in and day out contact the csm has is with the development staffthat does not mean that nothing has been said done or brought up it is that our normal daily communication pathways do not involve speaking with the gms about player bannings this processes does not often have the speed those involved would like to seethere is also a question of clarity there is a news article from june of 2013 about starbase force field ship bumping that states it is an exploit this information is accessible but buried and these scattered rules and policies about the website and forums need cohesion a central location of some sort it is also why i am pointing out the policy but not saying oh well because that policy is buried under almost a year and a half of information i do not consider that reasonably accessiblei will also be at eve vegas
not empty quoting
this article still does not answer the question that we are all asking what the community is wanting to know is what the definition of inside a force field is it targetable is it a certain percentage of the ship out is it totally out of the shield that is what the community wanting to know and what this thread is about we all know that the csm doesnt having anything to do with that ban but we need clarification on what we are aloud to do in the game we need to not be scared of what we are seeingdoing when we see a ship is exposed and not think back and ask ourselves are we going to get banned for this this game is about acting before thinking sometimes
what everyone else but the csm folks here seem to not understand is that this is not limited to one case this could happen again today or tomorrow noone knows definitively knows what the rules are in this scenario so i think your particular umbrella could be catching some rain on this one  the purpose of the csm is to represent society interests to ccp this requires active engagement with the player community to master eve issue awareness understanding and evaluation in the context of the greatest good for the greater player baseyou have access to an internal forum which only the csm and ccp staff have access to where discussions regarding various topics can be brought up by either group in a less formal manner than the summits thanks for fighting for the little people at any rate or not giving a  like you say
the council of stellar management csm is a playerelected council to represent the views of the players to ccp ccps definition not oursthe views of the players are being voiced so representccp has a long history of being consistently inconsistent this is just one small example of the type of inconsistency that causes the player base to ask that questionwhy i am paying for this again this isnt bitter vet syndrome but just another example of the core player base of eve going huh  zion
its ok guys we have consistently had low numbers logged in to eve for weeks let ccp keep screwing us and maybe the game will die and we can all win eve togetherseriously though any pvper in this game worth his salt would of bumped that titan if it had its nose sticking out id do it right now if the situation presented itselffor once in your life ccp be clear on something
thats ultimately why i feel so strongly about this  any one in this thread would of probably done it too given the opportunity  until now it has been completely acceptable and we still have no official idea whether it is or not because of gm incompetence and their inability to publish clear guidelines its like changing the speed limit on a road from 40 to 30 and the prosecuting the people who travelled at 40 before the change for speeding  its just mind boggling stupid
an interesting post from oni industries website the corp that lost the titan  which has been reimbursed by ccpits in japanese but can easily be translated its a little broken but even they claim that indeed the nose of the titan was hanging out after they had finished bridging a fleet see link below japanese or the image for translation
i am glad a number of csm members have commented here as you all may not be gms or have direct contact you do have a louder voice to speak to the gms if you see that there is an issue that needs to be dealt with hopefully the outcry from so many pilots and possible the support from a number of csm members will get ccp to re evaluate their actions
nobody is even talking about the possibility of the titan guy getting unreimbursed 
my perspective is it is really less about the reimbursement of the titan and more about player interaction with ccp one minute they take no action the next minute its a senior gm banning a player for something that was ok a few months ago a player never knows from one minute to the next which side of the coin you are going to fall on as ccp never makes anything clearflawed game mechanic and the guy gets his titan back ok whateverban a player because of the flawed mechanic suddenly because today was your day to have a bug up your butt about titan bumping ok for some people to do and others not to do sillywe all know we can go out and pick up another character but who knows what youll do next that was ok yesterday that someone decides isnt ok today and you are back to square one silly  zion
ccp wont do that cause it will make them look like  but they can unban someone fairly easily
makes them look less bad than not doing it
it is honestly just unfair treatment being displayed simple as that no questions about it the csm probably think whatever they are currently doing is more important than this single pilots issue but what they dont understand is what we have all been screaming about in here for a while now this could and probably will happen again very soon and players want to know the details of what will get you banned and what is fair game simple as thatso there are two options for ccp in my opinion 1 clarify the rules well enough for even the newest players to understand itor2 make a statement to the players explaining why favoritism towards large nullsec groups is continually shown and allows players in those groups to play the game on a separate set of rules than otherssimple enough i think respectfully jazz
id personally be more concerned about your ability to differentiate plain fact from trolling that is if i was you
bump
can someone just answer the question being asked here is this titan fair game and what is ccps definition of inside
if i would seen a titan partialy out of pos shields i would bump it to so make the rule clear and unban aglon 
how long does this need to drag on for before we get a straight answer from ccp on this matter

mistakes are always forgivable if one has the courage to admit themccp step up and speak
at this point i think blah blah logical statement unban algon will sufficeccp making 5 year veterans consider unsubbing bc we would rather make decisions based on our mood rather than use common sense or actually put effort into somethingyou see if this were a small issue and we were all crying about it in this thread i would understand ccp ignoring it but come on this guy was perma banned without good reason plus we all want a freaking question answered that could get even more people perma banned that is not alot to ask just give us a clear answerfreealgon
still waiting for a reply that actually answers the question could we at least get an acknowledgement that you are even paying attention something like hey
our player is still unfairly banned at this moment at least half the people in this thread have played eve for 5 years and gone to fan festhundreds or thousands of dollars spent on plex an subscriptions and years of dedicated play and ccp bans someone on a whim i sense a severe lack of empathy on the part of the game management department
well we are already averaging 21000 people online in us prime time as opposed to the usuall 35 to 40000keep ignoring your player base ccp soon you wont have one
absolutely stunning in the lack of communication even when petitioned about the situation againif youre not going to unban aglon then you might as well start banning some titan pilots and dont flap your gums about risk being the mitigating factor thats almost as ridiculous as the permaban handed out hereclarity and even handedness all were asking for
if you were in a null sec power bloc and used supers instead of tornados this wouldnt be an issue what were you thinking

helloi have a proposal related to the recent dev blog
hi csmafter last nights suggestion of changes coming to jump drives i wanted to pitch an idea to you to see if it had already been discussed or to see if it is possible to discuss when we introduced tiericide with ships and now with modules one of the changes i like was separating the battlecruiser and destroyer skills into racial skills and i think the same could be done for jump drive skills the basic premises would be to take the current skill jump drive operation and break it into separate categories this way you can make or not make changes to smaller groups of ships with jump drives as compared to trying to implement one change to rule them all just as a rough suggestionindustrial jump drive operation for rorquals and jump freighterscovert jump drive operation for black opsoffensive jump drive operation for carrierssupersdreadsalternatively if you wanted to separate furtherlogistic jump drive operation for jump freighterscapital jump drive operation for carriers and dreadsadvanced capital jump drive operation for supers and dreadsthese dont necessarily have to be separate skills for pilots to train for but rather as a means to reclassify all capitals based on their roles and how to go about making changes to them it seems easier with the new release system for the devs to make changes to the jump drive of a rorqual for example without having to also make changes to supers and titans and vice versaanyway just and idea itd be nice to get some feedback if possiblethanks

freeaglon id have bumped it too so would any of you  ccp
still waitinglet the view count climb
council of nullsec more like
on an unrelated note how did you get so many likes trouser freealgon
last i heard aglon is still banned and now after 4 or 5 years of playing he is going to unsubscribe his other two accounts do they really hate their players this much
before i begin id like to address the gms and csm i have the highest respect for the work you do and this post is not an attack on you the post represents my honest opinions free of metagaming roleplay or trolling to address what i see as a process issue for the community and for the gms i hope you will take it in the spirit intended and allow the thread to run its courseto the community i am well aware that the eulatos gives ccp the right to ban any individual for any reason i trust by the end of your reading you will see why this is not relevant to my post i am quite happy to debate the post but please refrain from using strawman argumentsbackgroundthe issue of bans has been highly visible lately i do not wish to discuss any specific bans nor am i campaigning on behalf of any individual or group however i have observed a number of things about the process  such as is visible from the outside  which concern me as a fairminded player and this post constitutes a proposal to evaluate and reform the ban process itselfi accept that the ban process is necessarily opaque for any number of reasons i can see why ccp would not wish to expose the inner workings or deliberations of their decision making process as such all we can do as a community is trust that ccps internal ban process is fair objective proportional evidencedriven and insulated from improper influence unfortunately for the first time in over ten years of playing eve i have been given reason to doubt that this yearas a manager irl i understand the importance of setting standards and evaluating people against those standards i understand the need for a system of warnings before disciplinary action is taken not because it is the law but because it is the right thing to do especially in cases where there are no clear standards inconsistent and arbitrary discipline the continual invention and revision of rules ignorance of precedent and nepotismfavouritism are extremely destructive to a working environment and just as destructive to an online community should these traits creep into ccps processes  and there is some worry that some may be  i am certain that ccp would share the communitys concernnow you may argue that rl hrm has no bearing on spaceships and accuse me of trying to spacelawyer this really isnt the case i am not talking about rights and obligations i am talking about basic fairness and the benefit of the doubt in that context the things that destroy a workplace are the same things that destroy a community and for that reason ccps universal righttoban  while acknowledged  is not relevant to the discussiona responsible ban processi believe that a responsible ban process should have the following qualities it should be incremental and proportional ie offenders should be given a chance to correct their behaviour warnings and temp bans should be the norm and permabans should only be used in the case of repeat incorrigible intentional offence it should be consistent objective and evidencedriven ie gm and ccp precedent should be considered evidence and only evidence eg ignoring communitycelebrity pressure should form the basis of the decision and guiltbyassociation including iphardware bans which affect family members should be eliminated it should be subject to internal review and include checks and balances ie no single gm should be permitted to make a permaban decision petitions regarding any ban should be escalated to a senior and different gm from the gm who issued the ban and internal affairs should review the evidence on permabans for improprietyit would be very worthwhile for anyone interested in the issue to review the success achieved by riot games in this area as covered on wired
proposaltldr the proposal to evaluate and reform the ban process isa that the csm work with ccp internal affairs to evaluate and if necessary reform the ban process to ensure that it is fair incremental objective proportional evidencedriven and insulated from improper influence and that the csm and ccp ia jointly release a statement once they believe that state is reachedb that any permabans which receive a petition after the reform be reviewed in line with the reformed ban process andc that ccp help their community understand what is unacceptable behaviour by publishing anonymised and generalised details of offences that lead to bansthank you for your time

i know you are mainly focused on the harassment bans and ignoring the rmt and botting ones but in relation to those too much information will allow subsequent fiends to capitalize on the intel gathered by their predecessors in regards to a jury of two rather than one a second opinion on permabans not bad but what if they differ a third to break the tieare you willing to add a caveat that some infractions are so blatant that incremental banning just extends the time that the infraction takes place or adds to a the number of victims and so there does need to be a reasonable case load that are permabanned right offas a last thing up until now the csm has been at arms length from enforcement of bans policy we might advise on if asked but for the most part that is not part of our raison detre as private citizens we may yell and scream and point fingers like any other player that is our right but we have no say in the enforcement or punishment although high profile cases may be swung past us more from the how will the community react rather than us in powdered wigs yelling off with his headmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i wouldnt say that my focus is mainly on the harassment bans mike though certainly those are the cases that caused me the most recent concern i can understand your point about rmt and botting details and of course there is no expectation that details that aided future botters should be shared but my focus is on helping people avoid fairly implemented bans so there is some value in logging some detail even if it needs to be pretty vague for opsecre tiebreakers i would think that a 5050 opinion on a ban strongly indicates that it needs further thought but ultimately my concern is that permabans could be issued unilaterally anything  1 is an improvementthe problem with blatant infractions is that it is still a subjective judgement as an effective death penalty for a player and all their accounts and as implemented anyone on their ip address or shared hardware i would think that in the case of a person with no previous warnings or temp bans for a related offence and especially if the offence was unprecedented a permaban would almost never be an appropriate first step and certainly not if implemented unilaterally without impartial appeal ive no expectation that csm would get involved in the assessment of bans this is purely a question of process and policy and it seems appropriate that the communitys representatives simply put their heads together with ccps impartial ia to assess and reform a process which potentially has significant impact on playersthanks for taking the time
fair and square  i have never seen any other game that lets their player act as freely as they can act already in eve the borders between accepted behaviour and banable actions might not be very obvious whitout digging into details  but i do not believe that there is a huge need for that actually you mention different cultures and morales as an argument of your defense  its the individuals responsibility to adjust to the others and not the other way around when i enter someones home its up to me to act in a way that fits to my hosts expectation and not the other way aroundtesting borders is a typical behaviour of children and teenagers to learn and develop their character in eve we are dealing with a large group of adults being capable of testing on a completely different level i do understand that ccps policy is not a public one and wouldnt wish it any other way  giving those adults even more tools at hand will not improve anything
well said

tldri am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
op fundamentally misunderstands the problems behind ship painting from an engineeringcoding perspective which to be fair im still sort of fuzzy on toobecause rigs do not affect the actual ship model paintjobs do that is why the current coding architecture requires a unique hull for each paintjobwhat the dev blog was attempting to explain was that they are trying to revise the code so that it will reduce clutter on the backend which will maybe allow them to make more improvements in the future which they are not saying because most probably they are still not sure which ones they want to focus on andor are even feasibleedit and before you say well why would ccp ever do such a thing that is  programming allow me to enlighten you on something i have painfully learned from working as an accountant anything you design now can make perfect sense because it fulfills your needs at the time in the most elegant way but years in the future when needs change some poor sob is going to look at it all and wonder wtf you were thinking when you did it and try to improve it without breaking anything else that still works and is needed and the cycle will forever repeat
please consider rattlesnake example like thisnowmodelshipcaldaribattleshipcb2guristascb2t1guristasredccp planmodelshipcaldaribattleshipcb2t1guristascaldarihow it could bemodelshipcaldaribattleshipcb2t1any painting modelcaldariits that simpleive postet the idea with something like rigs slots becouse they cant be reused and im sure this is essential attribute for paintingsand about affecting a model in space we do have t3 cruisers already with 5 modules affecting the ship model in space
the point behind the sof is to make customization easieruntil very recently every ship variation was a different model with a different skin thats how the system worked you couldnt just have a new ship type by going use this skinthe sof is designed to have one base model per ship type and be able to apply customizations to that
and the point is to allow sof to read ship typeskin base or fitted and get rid of blueprints that makes everything unclearnowadays blueprints makes new hull types just for painting and its a bad thing it leads nowhere
agreed the current system isnt very good but right now the code is the problem which again the dev blog explains why and that they are working on it you may think it is simple to alter the code but personal experience with databases and formulas has taught me otherwise nothing is ever that simplecase and point when the visible waypoint route was added to eve it was intended to be a purely graphical addition ie you could see what stars you are going to without using the map when it was released it borked the autopilot system and automatically set everything to shortest route it took more than a week to find and fix the problem meanwhile many freighters were killed
the current system is nothing but a prototype its not going to stay that way its to see if theres a suitable appetite for ship skins
unless you are part of a multithousand player power bloc probably
i spent the last 20 minutes reading this entire thread and the evenews24 article and im at a loss for words its a shame to see that even after a passionate outcry from a community that seems to care alot about their game that the developer doesnt not even bother to respond to topic which obviously alot of people have vested interest in an unfortunate display from ccps side a true shame that a wonderful game is tainted by a lack of community relations from the developers side
if you cant control your titan you should get relieved of it next up everyones gonna store en in a small pos because you cant lock itunban the man ccp you wont lose face anyways there isnt any lefteditwhat happens if a fleet member bumps a titan before bridging same thing if you ask me so ban them as well
im a little disappointed to come back to this thread and not see a response yet  it has been 8 days i thought there might be a working on this issue or some kind of feedback that maybe this situation is getting a second look or a response shutting this down and saying it is not getting another look i dont think in any way that the ban is going to deter someone from attempting this again if the situation presented itself because still no one knows what the rules are please respond respectfully deuc
this is going to sound like a broken record but i am not going to stop until something is done ccp please it isnt funny it isnt a joke you are literally spitting in the face of every lowsec alliance corp and pilot and showing us that we are all worthless to you we are your customers we pay subscription fees we need you to actually look at and respond to this in a serious and meaningful manner according to the policy that you yourself laid out aglon should not be banned it makes me question whether or not i want to continue giving you my money thus far you have been detestable both in your lack of clarification and your lack of response and attention ccp you must realize the damage that you are causing here please please fix this
yep pretty much this
ccpthis decision you made to permaban aglon is based on flawed logic what you deem as an exploit is in fact a spatial mechanic that your game allows for your codingprogramming allows for ships to be bumped which extend past the safety of a pos shield if a pilot doesnt want to be bumped all heshe has to do is not exit the pos shield pretty straight forwardyour ban hammer is misplaced and is a terrible precedent to set for the game at large i am not a political animal i dont hang around the forums this is by choice so in the two years i have played this game if i do not know something is an exploit would you ban me if i did it if all i did was bump a ship that is bumpable because your coding is flawed effectively thats what you have done you have banned someone for doing something the game allows by its nature if you dont want people bumping ships outside of a pos shield then put code into the game that prevents it instead you made aglon your programmers scapegoat rather than have your own staff held accountable to fix the real issue you blame the players for doing what the game allows in its current stateyou have also changed the face of pos warfare with this decision people will be afraid to bump ships that are lockable which is a legal mechanic per your recent statements because maybe at the instant the bump occurs the ship is now far enough back inside the shield that it is no longer lockable is that ban worthywhat if enterprising corps put a fleet of capitals on the pos edge half lockable half not but able to pop out on a moments notice if you bump the lockable ones the unlockable ones get bumped too is that ban worthyrather than have your players creativity stymied fix your frigging code then no one not you not the players has to worry about it and for goodness sake unban aglon he should not be held accountable because of the games inherent programming flaws if you want to reimburse the titan sure whatevs but the permaban is unreasonable not warranted and masks the real underlying issued
isboxer gives the user an advantage comparable to the advantage given by a bot for example a player could not normally play 20 eve accounts at once the player would have to either be botting or using isboxerthis no doubt gives the player a huge edge in this competitive game to have the combined income of 20 players is a huge advantagewhat other ways is isboxer unfair on normal players some players have isboxed pvp fleets bombers and gankers but these are the least of the problems the worst of it comes from the economic damage and the taking of content that was designed for an average certain number of players im talking of course about mining anomaliesthe problem has gotten so out of hand that youll be lucky to find a mining anomaly system that doesnt have an isboxer fleet show up at every spawn or in the worst cases there is 4 or 5 different isboxed fleets just take a look in osmon or wuos ice anomalies and see for yourself there is sometimes can be up to a hundred mining ships present but most of them are controlled by just a few isboxer playersisboxer users have the same detrimental effect on eve as botters botting is not allowed for a few reasonsbots take content from normal playersbots probably pay for their accounts with plexbots have an unfair advantage of being able to earn more isk than players who dont buy the software with exceptionsisboxers take content from normal playersisboxers probably pay for their accounts with plexisboxers have an unfair advantage of being able to earn more isk than players who dont buy the software with exceptionsyou dont see anomalies full of bots nor do you see constant complaints about them and yet you do see anomalies full of isboxers and there is a steady yet constant stream of complaintsso while technically isboxer is not botting  it is infact at least as bad as bottingsure if you want to get technical the technical they are slightly different but the effects in eve on the players are exactly the same and that should be what matters to ccp not some technicality
no the reason mining anomalies are mined quickly is because ccp changed how they are found you no longer need to scan for them so everyone and his dog can find them ccp even made finding them automaticthe ice anomalies are also too static and predictableandit costs more rl money to plex an account than subscribeamazon offers aside the difference is in who pays the money ccp gets more money when people plex than if they subbedno each account accumulates iskresources at the same rate as any other account can 20 miner accounts controlled by isboxer will mine 20 times the amount of ice as 1 miner can assuming they have the same skills and receiving the same boostsi think this is what you really wanted to say isboxer should be banned simply because i dont like it
id take the time to write a serious reply if literally everything you said was not hilariously wrong
this discussion only shows how ample ccp are at moderating their game ccp gms need more pssssh
while large multibox fleets are not currently a real issue due to the seldom nature of their occurrence in theory a game filled with these sorts of players could in fact be a problemthe solution is not to ban them as it would be virtually impossible to do so one person using 4 computers with 4 clients each would be indistinguishable from a few roommates playing the game each with alts logged in let alone internet cafesthe solution in fact comes from reviewing the problems associated with running multiboxed characters if you watch the youtube videos of these fleets in action you will notice that many times commands do not go through to all the clients you will also notice that moving around in subwarp speeds is extremely difficult lastly it is overwhelming to manage the fleet when people mess with key components of it the anchor for instancethis means multibox fleets are largely reserved to mining incursions suicide ganking smartbombing and quick bombing runs to a lesser extent capital ship warfare even trying to multibox an l4 is very difficult due to the necessity to travel to jump gates and get in range of rats 100km away incursions are warp in blap warp out which is why the multibox fleets are effective theremost importantly large scale industrial fleets of this size are extremely difficult to protect without concord intervention this is why they tend to dock up immediately when outside highsec instead of staying and fighting despite their superior numbersand so the solution is as follows redesign mining to be less static and for changes to occur on a perclient basis forcing the fleets to have to move around more often and micromanage each client too redesign incursions so they can never be completed by just warping in locking targets as they approach and blapping them redesign rewards in lowsec to be significantly more valuable andor nerf rewards in highsec this will allow nonmultibox users to reap the benefits of engaging in industry in low sec where most multiboxers dare not go
glad to see the csm has the good sense not to listen to this silliness  what a waste of their time there is nothing wrong with isboxer and the eula no matter how many accounts you control with it thinking otherwise just makes you look uninformed
there is plenty wrong with it
please inform me youve got to use some new stuff though because everything you mentioned in this thread so far doesnt cut it
considering the stuff i mentioned does cut it but everyone is in denial i shall not
i see so just so im clear on it you think ccp is in denial over their own eula interesting
throughout the notsovast time that players have been discussing multiboxing in various mmos there is a typical trend that always seems to appear youll have a side that provides actual arguments and reasoning behind their position and the other side will just say nuh uh its cheating cause insert refuted argument here this thread is a prime example of just that and a search will yield you more of the sameall in all a good laugh
ill add my support for the op too if you review my posts you will even see i very much so speak out against ts harassment and all forms of tear extraction i think it takes a very sad individual to come onto a video game and attempt to upset another player for the purpose of their own entertainment this means i have a problem with probably hundreds if not thousands of eve players and yet i agree with opwhy because ccp seems to be a very disorganized company having submitted petitions on various things  from reimbursement to being doxxed when i was a new player  has really shown to me the completely arbitrary nature of how each problem is resolved just recently i reported someone for using a homophobic slur in his bio my petition was closed and his bio was left unchanged for more than 2 weeks i submitted the petition again a different gm responded and the players bio was changed within the daythese sorts of occurrences have been reported by many players where they submit the same petition on different characters and get completely different results based on the gm whos respondedarbitrary decision making is simply wrong and yet it is the cornerstone of eve customer service the way to change that is to involve more gms in the decision to ban playerslastly there is the nature of second chances if themittani can decide while sober to make a powerpoint presentation that completely humiliates a player decide to fly that over to iceland decide to use his time on stage to present it decide to tell players to help urge him to commit suicide and get a one month ban there is very very little anyone else can do that deserved a permaban on the first infraction but hey thats arbitrary decision making for ya
i appreciate the support steppa one thing its best if we avoid discussing specific bans as that would be a good excuse to lock the thread and id rather not have that happen
i cant agree with this although i think the csm are a valuable asset to the game they are players and can be seen by people who dislike their corp or alliance or playstyle as being inherently biased although i think that is unfair and they should be judged on their merits if csm were to be involved in internal decisions on bans it would just create even more accusations of favouritism and i doubt any of the csm would want to take that sort of responsibility anyhowalso consider james article on the recent bans on the mittanicom where he lists previous csm delegates that have been banned themselves for one reason or another
voetius could you reread what youre disagreeing with the proposal is for the csm to review the ban process and i explicitly said they should not be involved in specific bans where biases could come into play
ive stated publicly on my show that the recent trend of instant perma bans for just about any offense lately seems to be harsh and a detachment from how things were previously perma bans should be reserved for habitual offenders and extreme cases while temp bans used to help correct player behavior in short i agree with your proposal however the csm is left out of the ban process for the most part and im not sure how effective well be on this i have been advocating for it though
no offence to ccp this reminds me of a joke i heard a while back how many devs does it take to fix a toaster one to say it not broken one to say it is broken and they will fix it soon one to work on developing an action plan to fix the toaster one to yell at the other devs for not getting the action plan together fast enough one to actually fix the toaster one to write a release about the fixed toaster and one to actually release the fixed toaster into the game then all the ccp devs gather round and wonder how the players managed to make the toaster turn on a light bulb only in this case one player turning on the light bulb gets permabanned as the rest tentatively turn the lights on and off ccp needs to respond to this they need to unban the player in question and most of all if this is an exploit they need to make an official statement about it and fix their mistakedeletetheweak
ccp you really need to make an open clarification about this issue there is still no official statement about bumping a ship that is partiality outside of the pos shields we all accept that deliberately exploiting the server mechanics to get a ship in
ccp your lack of action on this post speaks loudly to many players people have invested many years and dollars into this game myself included does each player now need to be worry about set of changing rules shall there be a daily post of what is and is not acceptable that day this kind of attitude to the smaller low sec community is disconcerting to me in the grand picture we are just a small part of the picture of eve not even worth taking some time away from your day to day tasks it angers me that you will not even acknowledge our voice we are the little kid throwing a temper tantrum at the mall in your eyes just ignore him and he will calm down the parents say why should i continue to invest time and money if the scenario comes up i am going to be guilty until proven innocent freeaglon
im quickly running out of the patience required to keep pouring money into a game where i may be arbitrarily banned for undefined reasons this is impacting our alliances playstyle and forcing us to second guess any engagements that occur in or around the edge of a pos shield which is a sizeable part of our content the lowsec community is requesting a response from ccp on this thread and its subject matter this issue needs to be fully clarifiedfreeaglon
ships that come out of stations are unlockable and yet bumpable as are ships that land just outside of docking range and have their warpin immunity before they move titans are big ships if someone stupid leaves a large amount of it outside a shield then its very bumpable lockable or notthis ban and reimbursement is a massive steaming pile and both should be reversedfrom the past decade lack of any word from ccp usually means they know they did something stupid and are trying to think of a way out of it by doing something else stupid
and so another day passes as the alliances and coalitions of nullsec continue to play the game without a care we here in lowsec continue to stand up for each other and wonder if we will be banned for what used to be one of the most enjoyable and fulfilling endeavours a solo lowsec pilot could embark uponfreealgon
its almost always this oh how the big bad isboxer took all your precious highsec ice not that the isboxer did violence to your boat but that he interrupted your afk highsec isk printing machineheres a news flash it is stupidly easy to run 20 accounts to mine pretty much anything due to the mind numbing nature involved with pretty much every kind of mining it would take running 20 accounts to make a challenge out of it i would know i had the misfortune to have spent most of the last 7 years in this game as a miner though most of that was spent in nullsec
could not read a lot fo the stuff here so i skimmed most of it or skipped pages past page 3not sure about pvpbut consider the atitude of ganking and ice fieldssince i believe that is the actual probleminsult being felti dont mine ice so lets make a hypthetical ice field like the anoms12 ice rocksmaybe 400 pieces of ice eachnow lets say each procurer can get 5 pieces per cycle40 isboxer fleet  200 pieces per cycle1 non isboxer  5 pieces per cyclethe 1 non isboxer will get his 5in the time it takes the isboxer fleet to get its 195 per rockso 195x12  2340 pieces of ice for the isboxer fleetandthe non isboxer will get 60 pieces of icethen have to wait another 4 hrs for the ice field to spawn againi see a problem with this as the non isboxers are gaining iceisk much more slowly to the isboxer fleet idea eventually they are forced to give up to find other ways to plex or run their industryas in fuel block productionor collecting fuel for jump drivesthis i believe it the heart of the matter for those that truly wish to ban isboxerbecause it is an unfair advantage
explain how each single pilot is unfairly gaining more product per cycle than other characters
please dont quote me and try to interject something into my mouth that i did not sayit was just a theory upon why some might want to ban isboxerbut anyway heres golets expan on this theory and then after this take your simply mind pull out a calculator and do the work yourselfspawn  every 4 hrs dtdt  roughly 24 hrs expect on major patch daysthen its more like 235 to2375 hrsso 6 spawns per day x 2340  14040 isboxer6 spawns per day x 60  360 the single guyboth assuming this all they do every day all day long14040x30 days  421200 360 x 30  10800now lets say avg price is 275000 isk per piece421200x275000 115830000000 isk or 14755 plex figured at 785 million isk per plex10800 x 275000  2970000000 or 3783 plexnow lets take a 3 monthyearly qtr into account14755 x 3  44265  40x3  322653783x3  11349  3  8349at this rate you can see the difference is astounding in terms of wealthnow expand on the problem even moremaybe like most of them the single pilot doesnt have all day nor every day to mine the iceso on avg its probably more like 515 pieces of ice per day 3 times a week because competing with the isboxer fleet is too difficultso lets take 10x3  30 x 10  300 pieces of ice275000 x 300  82500000oh wow not even enough to plexthe first month is a bust2 weeks into the 2nd month the nonisboxer says screw this i have to do something else because i can no longer make isk or keep my business operating this waybotting and rmt was the measure of having botting fleets mining all day every dayallowing isboxer gives the botters a different and legit way to do the same thing without really having to change how they conduct rmt bussiness they still push the little guy whom is the one that wants to play a gamenot trying to make rl money off it
out of all the things in eve do we really need to make moving battleships in high sec a priority why are you constantly moving battleships in what scenario do you need to move 3 battleships every day
incursions for one its also handy for alliancescorps that move around frequently

100 support in reforming the banning policyprocedures having had one of my buddies banned out of the blue there is definitely a problem
ive read the available articles about the most recent wave of permabans whether or not a permaban was too harsh or the right punishment is irrelevant when you consider the followingin james 315s article published on tmc it was stated that the appeals to the bans were summarily denied by the same person that issued the bans this is what most concerned me for not even in the screwed up buyyourwayoutofprison system the united states has does an appeal to a decision go before the same judge that issued said decision
while not bans specifically the csm does have a history of representing community concerns related to the gm department and its processes petitions internal communication etc directly to the gm staff at the summitwouldnt be out of left field for you guys to play a role here
agree there needs to be some reform in the perma ban process there is a trend developing of just instapermaban hammer and then ask questions later this silliness needs to be addressed  zion
nice postgood luck with iti may be a bit tired and jaded with my arguments for the past week that have resulted in only circular debates from people unable or unwilling to deal with itstep 1 for any reform would require ccp to treat this game as a business instead of a popularity contest but i guess the evil that they have created rules the game now it has been working well for them for 12 years so what do i knowright
the correcting player behavior part is the most important bithow can anyone know if they are breaking the invisible rules unless they get a hey knock of xyz warning from a gm a perma ban out of nowhere should never happen to anyone but a botter or an rmter as those are actually spelled out as warranting a perma ban
ironically this is the same gm who holds a leadership position within the gm team that has made such declarations as telling people that your alt is you will get you banned im honestly shocked that this individual still retains his leadership position when he is clearly unsuitable for the job the fact that he personally reviews the appeals of unwarranted bans that he dished out in the first place should be another nail in the coffin
malcanis on the erotica1 bans i liked hearing this at the timeofc aleks was also csm then so ill guess this is what he was on abouti like the idea of csm being allowed a look into this whole deal theres rumours that some people mightve been banned that shouldntve theres talk that people arent being told why theyve been banned its impossible for me or other players to know whats true but the csm has the nda so id hope ccp is comfortable talking to them about this i trust the csm as a group
its hard to ask the gms about rules too i wanted to know about a rule regarding concord exploits i filed a petition under the correct category had it moved to game questions and was told they couldnt answer i believe the idea is that if they tell people the rules people will try to exploit loopholesi did eventually get a satisfactory answer but it was difficult communicating and i think many peopled be turned off by the initial response of we wont tell youi think itd be ok if the gms said this is the rule but there are guidelines here too and if you try to find loopholes or maliciously go outside the guidelines you will be investigated and suffer punishment anyway
the last time i asked a gm for a clarification on something my market account got a warning for putting up lowball buy orders in osmon and other sisters systems apparently it constitutes taking advantage of new playerssince then i have stopped asking clear rules are vital to keep inconsistency and personal bias from intruding
thank you for taking the time to write this out clarity of policy and process in the past and future is a goal well worth pursing
i think one important thing to come from this discussion is an overall clarity of how the gm process works in terms of banning not necessarily what is considered ok and not ok in every single situation but a clear idea of what steps are taken each time gms are involved in a potential situationalso when a situation does arise and gms or devs feel the need to go public and state hey guys  this is an exploit dont do it  those should be collated in somewhere easily located and searchable for any player anyway good post huey ill track you down on bstn comms to discuss further 
this absolutely should be a thing in the case benny is referring to there is a clear and explicitly defined answer from a gm on concord manipulation and what willwouldnt warrant a ban buried deep in a locked threadnoughtnow without prior knowledge of it and the gm in questions name that is going to be effectively impossible to findso yes 1 for this thing in particular

i wonder whenif we will hear anything and if aglon will get his account back
it seems to be at this point the official line from ccp is to say nothing and hope everyone forgets about this not gonna happen  unban aglon clarify your rules and make your inconsistent gm team accountable for their flawed actions
this
posted to try and get their attention on twitter might do a blog post next time sharing my true feelings not that it would make a difference and so another day passes as the alliances and coalitions of nullsec continue to play the game without a care we here in lowsec continue to stand up for each other and wonder if we will be banned for what used to be one of the most enjoyable and fulfilling endeavours a solo lowsec pilot could embark upon jazzim quickly running out of the patience required to keep pouring money into a game where i may be arbitrarily banned for undefined reasons this is impacting our alliances playstyle and forcing us to second guess any engagements that occur in or around the edge of a pos shield which is a sizeable part of our content the lowsec community is requesting a response from ccp on this thread and its subject matter this issue needs to be fully clarified chandfreeaglon
pretty easy here if you cannot lock the ship its in the sheild if you were obnoxious enough to bump it out and someone got banned well ban earnedblowing up on twitter about something because you cant get an exact case answer for semantics is a useless and annoying behavior because someone was punishedif you cant lock it youre not supposed to bumping is allowed for things like lockable targets tofrom stations gates etc if its inside a pos enjoy the ban
but titan bowling is alright yeahalso there is so much wrong with this comment i cant even bear it
did you know you can bump ships on gates stations that are not lockable and the model of the titan was half way outside pos shields
double post
still waiting for a response
is there actually any way to kill a pos titan now
assuming lockablenot lockable is the transitioning condition which is the clarification we are requesting get the password bump him out or have a spy do it wait for him to screw up and poke out the shields enough to lock him then bump him out kill the pos and hope its not stronted rfkill the pos and the storage array housing the titan rfkill the pos with the titan logged out and setup a hic login trap for itwould be the only options i can envision
so basically no
apparently some people are allowed to bump them out we wont really know because no one seems to want to address the question  zion
unless youre part of a null blob then all bets are off
i think youre pretty safe to bump it out as long as the pilot doesnt petitiondownside i think it is now standard practice to petition all titan losses just in case some random gm got laid the previous nightcommunity manager wwwbattlecliniccom battleclinic loadouts  killboards  forums twitter anabariceve wwwthebastardsnet recruitment open
now lets not go living in a fantasy world anabaric lol but on a serious note ccp is really taking too long to respond to this so many good points and genuine concern from players with not even so much as a hey guys were looking into itsad timesfreealgon
perhaps it is because of the new cloaking effect from oceanus preventing ccp from seeing it seriously though i am hoping it may have something to do with a new release and they are busier than usual
i see why you are confused here is how it breaks downeach individual character isboxed or not still makes the same amount of isk that it could if it were being controlled by a single player if each individual character could make isk faster than they normally would while it is still being controlled by a real person or with nobody at the computer at all then that is what would break the rules since none of that is happening then there is no foul outside of some peoples uninformed brains by your same logic anyone contributing anything at all to a corporation should also be banned i have participated in corp fleets of nonisboxers that clear entire belts in minutes since that cant be done by a single character then you may as well argue that they are using their numbers and cooperation to give themselves an unfair advantageall isboxing does is eliminate the derp somewhat from fleet ops anyone that has ever fcd can tell you that attempting to coordinate a group of eve players is like trying to herd cats into the back of a moving pickup truckalso i isbox quite often and have never participated in rmt nor will i so leave me out of your ridiculous isboxers  rmt bullcrap thanks
sighim sorry pargellenbut again like i said to the last guy at one pointwhat i wroteis a theory based scenario on why the reasoning behind those that wish isboxer to be bannedand thats iti mean ffs people i dont care about your ice i dont care about your pvpother than the fact it makes me isk every time you blow stuff up at one point i saw an underlying question to explain the reasons for banning isboxerso i answered the question by pointing out how the probanners are thinking other than thatit means squat and if your point out the fact of being apart from fleet opsnot being part of a corp or at least a community thing and just wanking off in the corner by yourselfwell you deserve to be blown up you deserve to have no friends in eve you deserve to be gankedmaybe you should go back to wow or whatever other game you came from because this is not the place for youand i have fcd before and your explanation of that is pretty aptup till the point you start kicking your mewling peeps out or shooting them yourself for being a carebear too much
your apology turned into a senseless rant that i quickly failed to follow apparently i play too much wow or something
wasnt an apologyas what i got from this part of your reply was that you do not like playing as fully valued member of the community but would rather simply supercede others that may or may not be able to compete with you it seems you were sayingi dont a corp i dont need an alliance and have no reason to be concerned with overall health of the game in generaland so my response was not an apologybut the parts directed at youwere basically yeah stfu your not worth much more than the km someone gets for taking out your shipsnot because you isboxbut because your attitude with it is indifferent to the long term health of the community
usually when someone starts a post with sighim sorry such and so it has a strange way of looking like an apology your interpretation of my earlier post is interesting completely utterly and totally wrong but interesting you attack aspects of the way i play and then when that fails you attack me personally hows that working out for you feel bettersome peoples kids
also loot pinatai am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
can i have cybersex with that 
this would require some consistency from ccp which is not their wheel house they prefer to bury it in the sand box  zion
a new use for ples would increase plex prices convincing more people to buy more plex to sell due to higher prices as people get more isk for their money while making other people that have eve has one of their few games and rely on plex as their money goes to other necessities while still maintaining on of the few outlets of entrainment
youre correct that the space object factory is an incremental step that doesnt get all the way to enabling what you describe however it will make further steps toward that goal much easierwhen discussing possible ship customization features please keep in mind that the details of lowlevel implementation which is where space object factory sits need not drive the design for such a feature that youd see as a player that playerside experience would be planned out and designed by game designers to make sense to youso when you ask for how youd like that experience to look dont get too hung up on whats been revealed about the innards of the eve graphics engine the engine can evolve to support what the feature needs rather than the other way aroundid be surprised if the designers would want to make you give up a rig slot for any future ingame ship customization but that wont be a decision coming from me or team trilambda ccp darwin UFFFD senior software engineer art  graphics eve online UFFFD markwilkins
this feels like additional complexity with no gainthe racial changes for bc and dds evened out the ship progression
sure there is a gain more skills and sp for me
1 just no
congratulations xenuria best troll thread of 2014 managed to get 4 of the csm to respond evensetting the bar high for next year 
this is not a troll threadi have every intention of running and hopefully winning election only by challenging myself do i become strongerwinning the csm will be very difficult but once i have the rest will be cakethe workload described by csm members past and present seems like a dream to me i did an 800 page independent study on system analysis and design when i was 16 i think i can handle whatever ccp throws at me frankly my plan to build rapport with the other members was to take on far more than my fair share of work and dutiesthis is less about proving myself to my peers and more about my own learning and growth through the helping of others i have only ever truly triumphed in the service of others
