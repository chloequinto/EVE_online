hi demichael and allfirstly a big thank you on the onset for all the gigantic work you have posted so far which has helped stabilise and raise simultaneously factional standings on all frontsi would also support your recommendations on either options about the reinstitutions of former tutorial agents in the form of new political agents as you recommendedthese agents provided a quick headsup to factional standings in the early days just by completing a series of 2 simple missions and they provided in such a glimpse in the policital front of factions and factional standingsin that sense i would support their reinstitution as in option 2 in an improved way as to have 1 endless battle mission series offered once for each level 1 to 5 for each capsuleer edcation center of each races as a backup plan reinstitutions of the agents as suggested in option 1 would also be useful and as you say less time consuming as the scipts must be readythank you once again for all the work and support you have been in smart missioning as well as the rehabilitation of eroded factional standingsbestpam
ever been in a wormhole you should try it then youd realize how weak you sound right now
i have been there and i dont believe that way it works now is good game design
no

nobody from the csm has even bothered to look at thisis frankly pathetici posted it in the assembly hall with a big proposal on the topnobody reads anything
i have to agree something needs to be changed perhaps something simplesigned i to would like to see some action taken
vizvig i think youre missing a few of my points your numbers on null sec are exaggerated and your nulli tengu bot phantom pulling in 300 m isk an hour 23 hours a day is pure fiction as far as the risk to reward ratio you have misunderstood my averages concerning incursionists and you are comparing bots to players your analogy is out of contextfor reference a super carrier might be able to rip through a sanctum in 2025 minutes and generate an income of 120 m isk per hour i know a carrier can do about 60 m isk an hour on sanctums as far as a bot roaming from system to system scanning down a juicy sites and by luck getting and following a full trail of expeditions leading to loot worth a 1 b  isk get your face out of that pipeyou might be waiting around for 12 hours to get into a fleet but that does not mean there are not active fleets rifling through these sites it only means you are not in a fleet rifling through these sites arent you making new friends your estimate of what an average incursionist might earn in one day is out of context with the average i put forth i dont think any individual player is running incursions 237 but at any given time there are a number of players churning out that level of payout off of incursions my estimate was that between 160480 players were engaging incursion sites at any given time over the whole day not the same 160480 players over the whole day i even reduced my payout estimates to accommodate some criticism to suggest that even such a low ball estimate indicates a problemthe elite faction fleets i mentioned might be displacing your access to incursion fleets you mentioned that you only pull in 40 m isk when you get around to doing incursions are you trying to get through the sites as quickly as possible to maximize your return is your fleet in competition with other fleets in system which minimizes your access to sites are you and or whoever you fleet up with experienced or competent with incursions with out explanation i have to admit that at face value your 40m an hour seems quite feeble
lacutostop spouting rubbish please do 00 incursions with a dozen carriers and titans in your own space like all the big alliances and the payouts are spectacular and the risks minimalwe have to compete heavily on high sec incursions 00 are done by the big boys in their big capitalsthe problem with eve is that unless you are in a big alliance in 00 small corps are just salvage and high sec players dont think the reward is worth it
uncertainty of the future is inflaming plex prices micro transactions  plex investors are taking advantage of it to raise the value of their productincursions earning 100m per hour im a hardcore merchant i know everything if any one was making 100m per hour in high sec i would have bin one of the first to find outthe numbers are more along the lines of 300750m for 1618 hours of nonstop hardcore highsec incursion running in a pro group k bro im calling bull on your numbers end of storyperhaps 1 of the 16 hours the few rare and downright hardcore but they are not i repeat not making 100m per hour more like half that on good days sometimes they get really lucky and monumentally hit that number sometimes they get very lucky and hit 100m per hoursome of the ideas about concord where pretty good how about allowing people to join sansha npc fleets and actually allow people to engage other people under the sansha colors the logistics would be a pain to work out but why not actually turn it into a real sansha invasionwhy are you madthey wont take your maelstrom sniper into the fleetsince you think your special every one including ccp needs to jump around you let me introduce you to a little secret get into a logi and do the missions like every one else who is not specialpsyour special
seems like i gotta add my 002 iskas a player who has been playing for less than a year some might call me a noob ive done many different things to make isk in highsec and some solo runs into whswith your average incursion fleet the income is far lower than 100mil iskh more in the terms of 50 to 60 even thought i know of some specialised fleets who can get you to 150milh possible but unlikely and the investment is pretty high as well isk and skill wise no one will let a not 555 logi rep their multibilisk shinies so yes when you manage to get into a fleet considering you didnt make enough friends to get into one fast there is good isk to be made even if you are not in the shiny fleetsbut what about the other means to make iskfirst mining all alone meh 610milh maybe but no why not use several alts to mine its no problem to run 810 toons mining ice on a single comp if you want to good isk to be made and you can nearly do it afk ore is a bit more tricky but you can still do several accs at once without using bots so yes possible to make 50mil per hour herenext running lvl 4s solo in the right ships blitzing the missions you can surely do 50milh running in a small fleet of toons more i use to fly with an arma a domi and a noctis so nothing fancy at all and surely gain 40mil per hour just in bounty and reward much more for the lp loot and salvage a former corpmate of mine used to run level 4s with 45 toons at once and made up to 200milh if he concentrated on running missionsmerchanting well this is all about controlling the market ofc you can make no money at all or billions per day depending on how good you are and what kinda funds you can work withthere are so many other possibilities worth mentioning like pirating scanning for sites etc thought ill keep it at this for nowconserning the inflation you talk of the before mentioned things about plexbuyerssellers sure play a role another thing would be ppl messing with prices last week we had the case that all but one of the hshubs sold plexes for 7mil higher than the last one the day after that the prices were raised by 8mil over all but this time another hub was the one left lower this is merchants actively messing with prices as they see fittldr incursions pay good money but you can get about the same via other means even in highsec
theres the complaints about afk cloakers about removing or not removing local blah blah i think and id like to toss this out there that theres a fairly simple conceptually idea that would alleviate many of these perceived issues1 cloaked ships when cloaked disappear from local you cant see a cloaked ship by any other means it only makes sense that theyre also cut off from these public communication channels as a result2 cloaked ships also cannot see local when cloaked you cant use local as an intel gathering tool you either need to decloak to see whos in local or use other means dscan probes or even your own eyeballs3 to prevent this from being abused regarding hot drops when a ship decloaks theres a delay to being able to fire a cyno say 30 or 60 seconds hypothetically this would give someone a fighting chance to try and escape or call for help before the sqaud of supers drops on their heads
one thing this does is eliminate the whole afk cloaker issue in two way first if the locals cant see the cloaked ship they wont be ing about seeing an afk cloaker in their system second its balanced by the cloaked vessels not being able to simply sit there and passively gather intel it puts the intel gathering into the actively acquired mode however a wellplanned cloakie can easily be at a belt or whatever actively watching traffic come and go with no one having a clue as to his presenceit also reduces to a degree the excessively easy intel local gives you cloaking will cut you off from passive intel both for and againstmost importantly theres nothing here that would break wormholes i think its an idea worth discussion
you know what i am drunk enough to support this
it seems weve both hidden our agenda in the same place 
people who wanted duels and tournaments this is their chance because this mechanic will allow many interesting thingsfor highsec pirates this would be awesome especially if you have friends waiting to come in as backup once somebody decides they can take you on although the really awesome part is that any outsider can just step in and kill you in the middle of a fight but then again really experienced people will be counting on it pirates vs all who dare to step in
i highly dislike this due to one reason what is the flavour of such a shipif it costs more but is not stronger why would you pay for itif it costs the same but it is stronger why would you fly anything else in lowsec or nulsecif it costs more and is stronger isk was never really a balancing factor for most people so look at aboveif it costs the same and is as strong why would you fly it
i can think of many reasons to fly outlawed ships for one they can easily be bait ships as for isk price of it nothing is yet set in stone but if it were to cost more than your average ship then id say that it would be worth paying any price for some quality highsec pvp actionccp wanted a good reason and good roles for the new ships this is it it is time for those dusty blueprints and new ship designs to be made real screw t3 frigates lets do this instead
i also have no idea if this would be too hard but i like the idea far too many times have i sat there pondering what it used to be it would also be better for screen shots and conversation see me there with that myrmidon wreck yeah that was my first hunting trip
i know they have started doing this very thing although smaller kills still look like a pile of rubblethe last couple of orcas i blew up looked like a scorched and fragmented orca wreck afterwards
litter the universe with the scorched wrecks of our foes
nah for everything else we ninja salvagers will clean up the place
there are other things that should have priority but when the more pressing issues have been resolved or set on the path to resolution this would be nice to see indeed
yes security gains already exist doing incursions but concord standings would be a nice addition right now theres only 2 agents that will give a standing boost to concord and theyre a one time only thing come on ccp give us a reason to do incursions that ties it into our other eve activities  thats a much better way of integrating new features
as an older player i have been trying to figure out the direction in eve online in the begining we had neocom which worked well had no problems and was a fantastic interface while in space or in station now we have captains quarters which is full of glitches no one wants and seldom works in the begining we had rated agents witch guided the players from agent to agent by skill and training now we have all agents open and no challange to get new agents cause all agents are the same in the begining we had learning skills in witch you had to have to be able to train higher skills now we have nothing which has led to the id10t error in eve we use to have a challenging game which took though skill and a little luck to play now we have an idiots game which anyone can play without much intelligenceplease bring back the old eve i like a challangeps captains quarters is a worthless waste of time and programming
to ccpthere is an old saying if its not broken dont fix itwhy dont you do something radical bring back the old players while your at itim not trying to be an arse but seriously this is starting to look like the game i came from the one that is failing micro charges walking around stations whats next roleplay ok common now nerfing everything on a daily basis common now dont make me quit this to now
poasting in another whining threadoh and dont count me in when you say no one you dont know what i do or dont want
a fact im sure theyre completely devastated about
i for one am glad theyre moving away from spacerelated features ccp mustve read my mind cause a year ago i remember thinking yeah internet spaceships are alright and all but what i really want is to have my character walking in circles around his room by himself and wouldnt it be fabulous if i could give him some monocles or fashionable boots with a nice sexy space jacket that i can sit in a station and admire omg
well you could sit around and admire it but you cant sit eitherthe wis interface is ridiculously heavyweight for being more primitive functionally than runescape
it is one thing to introduce vanity crap and all thatflashy items and being able to walk around your captains quatersits an another with the infernal thing eats memory like a stock pigthen bsods if you so much as sneeze at your mirror to customize your fancy nex boots sarcasmingame inspace admidtly has vastly improved but the incarna packagehoenstly i shut the damn thing off in an effort to undockredock fasterand get about the job of running my corpthere are thousands of bugsmany many issues that still have not been resolvedi sympathize with the opbut hte features he highlitghtednot so much been palying 2 years while im not happy with the current direction of ccpits not enough for me to quit overbut im not far from iti just wish ccp would spend a little more time listening and less brainstorming microtransaction bulland that is simply how i feelwhat to make more money keep your older players around while getting new ones
your only legitimate point is cq being edlearning skills should never have been made if u think otherwise kill yourselfthe agent change helped spread people out and it standardized mission types if i want to run courier missions i can go to a courier mission station and get one instead of having a chance the only thing i might not agree too is the quality change but even then it benefits because some agents werent used because of crap qualitythe game still takes skill to play ect eve is still harsh its just cq and nex
i support this proposal because its a unique and obviously well thoughtout proposal and not a whine about personal opinions that no one really cares about sarcasmps no learning skills were stupid and thank god theyre gone
well that was funill just pat myself on the back and go get a cookie nownot supportedhave a nice day
agreedi like that idea and if they can do eve voice out of game then why not chat channels too
you mean you want this booster pack
yesbut wired directly into your brain for a more instant and gratifying reaction
suffice it to say that a lot of people disagree with you the proof is in the pudding how many blaster ships do you see used in pvp apart from comedy fleetssmall blasters seem to be ok if you dont mind going ballstothewall but large blasters have a real problem if you cant start the fight within scram range the increase in jump gate sizes increasing the average distance a ship has to travel to get within blaster range and decrease in speed have left blaster bs struggling to find a niche outside stationhumpingand thats before we even start talking about tracking
i think that blaster could benefit from an ewar module affecting agility inertia destabilizer or maybe a script for web replacing the speed reduction with agility reduction at longer range such a module would give blaster platforms a weapon to fight fast and agile ships without the risk of breaking the balance agility and speed problem of gallente hull is partialy due to the nanofibers being popular these days and countering armor tankmaking hybrid ammo modifying tracking instead of range is however a lovely idea  that would give hybrid guns their originality
as above use a gatecamp if you want to control who comes in or form a gang and hunt them down when they get reportedas the defenders you already have several big advantages here are just a few examples1 you can dock to refit repair or switch ship to counter what the enemy brought2 you can have cyno jammers so that you can use caps but your enemy cant3 you live in the area and know it much better then the enemy use chokepoints and other similar areas where you can trap someone
yes this idea may lead to more of a cooperation with others but the core of the idea is that people should be within view range of other missioners this would give more of a community feeling there will also be a natural tention whenever you see other people nearby especially if they can potentially interfear with your objectives that tention is what will make missioning more dynamic and engaging
i dont agree the stakes already have been made higher for lvl 4s the amount of tank and firepower you need for lvl 4 is much bigger then for lvl 3i also see that incursions are the answer to your op in terms of intelligent play stylethough i support ideas and ways that support teamplay i must also say that there are players who dont use teamplay as their major style they come home from work do 12 missions and then get off i for myself dont want to have to wait till i get enough player to actual play the gamein another post i had to point out that even more nerfs covered or open to high sec will hurt ccps wallet 70 of the player are playing high sec not all of them do it alone but i guess alot of them play missions most of them lvl 4 nerf lvl 4s even more then they had been in the last two years and you cross a breaking point where the game itself will get less attractivetherefore any op with encouraging ideas for teamplay are welcome ie like make the bounty double if you are in a fleet in the same pocket  the wrong way would be to half the bounty if you are alone but none who want to force other players to adopt to their play style if lvl 4 are to lame to you then please start doing incursions and let the rest be
i like the idea of a far more engaging and dynamic system but some folks do like to just mission soloso how about a split system where you can choose to do solo missions or more lucrative due to added requirements group missions with the group mission set having the possibility of being sent to either assist or interfere pvp with a fleet already doing something this would have to allow a deadspace area where concord does not go and you dont get gcc basically as you are effectivly hired to pvp this would only be allowed in the mission site so aggresions and so on end once you leave sitethe group missions may actively require a pvp style of fleet with ecm tackle and logi support for high level ones this way it would be consensual as you would have the choice of non group missions the curent missions which you can still do as a group anyway but with no pvp posibility element as you would have to choose to take these missions and the possibilities that come with it
1 wont really help much they should really go back to the belts only respawn on mf method except maybe veldscord in 10  08 or something2 make them drop salvage ie you need to salvage the wrecks balance to mainly drop stuffs for dronerelated things rigs or t23 yes reduce the trash
any further nerf of high sec is not affordable by ccp btw high sec has already had too much nerfs the last 24 monthhigh sec reflects the paying player base over 70 of the user are living here and about our nullsec citizens ccp will not have introduced a project to make null sec more independent to take away 25 of their available oreswith more nerfs ccp will loose customers what i am sure they dont want to haveif you will find buffs that dont nerf other areas in particular high sec like a new form of mining in which the ore contains all minerals on an average price this ore could be around 150 isk m3 or the drops are of better value here rate of faction rats increase like shadow serpentis etc
at this point who give a dam anyway lol
pretty good post hes spot on too
the way i see it its possible a rebalancing as mentioned by ccp greyscale might serve everyone well for the most part when we do get the rare gravs and manage to suck them dry theres usually an excess of megacyte and not nearly enough of most of the other minerals to maintain production for any period of time the megacyte winds up being used to finance purchasing lower end minerals to bring into the hole so even a 25 reduction in megacyte replaced with a really nice buff to other minerals would likely benefit we holedwellers a good bit id of course like to see the buff to lower end minerals exceed the cut to the mega were that starved on the lower end we still need the megacyte for t3 production this is a basic fact and one reason we wont completely lose megacyte in the holes you dont want t3 production dependent on nullbunnies that dont mine what they have already unless of course youre willing to entertain billion isk tengu hulls etc
if you think it is going to be that big a problem just unite all of highsec players into one alliance and start buying supersnull will die to the wave of death a total highsec alliance would be alternatively stop using the market and build your own ships with the materials you can salvage if the whole of highsec did so then null would have very little reason to be null sec as the accumulation of wealth would be pointlessits your sandbox too

any improvements on the hud and getting rid of the lists i support
yes bring back the old icons please
i am particularly unhappy with 425mm railgun icons  they are black on black background i can hardly see what the hell it isthe primary purpose of an icon is to allow player to quickly visually identify an object that means the value of an icon has less to do with fancy art and more to do with having distinctive patternwhen ccp designers make a bunch of new icons put them all in a grid like the station hangar stretch it out to at least 10x10 item grid on 1600 video screen randomize positions of the items and ask people to identify specific items based on the picture measure how quickly they respond if they respond slower and often confuse 2 items then you know the icon isnt good
1 it has been said before some icons are very dark and i can barely see the icons next to my target locks when i have a black background as well
well your beliefs fail to trump my reality its fine as is in wormholes you dont need to know if theres a cloaked person in your hole you simply need to assume there is and act accordingly and no that doesnt mean curl up in your pos shield and whimper it means grow a pair tank your ship a little haulers especially and go about your business in an alert manner
it works fine it forces people to take responsibility for their own safety rather than offloading it to some infallible intel systemfrankly if cloaked ships are detectable in whs then before doing leaving pos every sane person would have scanned for cloak sigs and hence know what was going on in their system it would be just the same as current broken nullsec complete with afk cloakers we dont need another region of space as stupid and easy as nullsec
actually youre the one who is whining yes you should have to find a station or someplace safe if you are going to go afk youre just trying to make an excuse if you go afk for more than 10 or 15 minutes then you should be logged out most people with even limited intelligence know that if you arent in a station system then you dock up or go to a pos when you go afk unless you can cloak you are just trying to defend your ability to cloak up and go afk all day long in an enemy system so you can be a  with no risk or consequence
you are just trying to defend your inability to have balls so you can bot isk with no risk or consequence
yes because putting in an afk timeout will stop all the botters idiot even limiting cloaks wouldnt stop bottersgrow a brain before you accuse people of being botters
you desire to play the game without having to use your brain you are the equivalent of a bot
a lot of bots will dock up and stay docked if theres a neutral in system this is the power an afk cloaker can have at controlling botting to a degree if the botter then sets the cloaker to blue it opens the cloaker to being able to take out the bots shipslimiting cloaks would have the effect of making life easier for the botters they wouldnt have to spend as much time docked and could bot more iskies faster
thanks for proving my pointback on topicyes i am aware that bots dock up or pos up when a neutred is in system but afk cloakers dont target bot systems for the hell of it even then the bots usually just change systems for a while either way i doubt a change to afk mechanics will effect bots at all
ill start by saying my spelling sucks live with itanyway ive been scanning now for a while and the whole system these days is sooo much better than before imo but there is one things that annoys me and thats wormholes and the fact that they dont have a separate tab for wormholes onlyso i propose that ccp create a separate tab for wormholes only i believe this will help people in two ways firstly the people looking for wormholes will be able to find them without the hassle of going through a list on other sigs and likewise people looking for sigs but not wormholes will have a less frustrating time constantly finding whs my record is 9 holes in a single system lots of emorage that dayand now to be trolled out so we will need more gin
actually your spelling is rather good your grammar and punctuation sucks thoughto your issuei am a little confused on where you want this tab to be for wormholes are you referring to a tab in bookmarks or a tab in the scanner itself if you mean in the scanner i doubt it will ever happen simply because that would immediately give away what sig is what when scanning a wormhole as for in the bookmarksjust make a folder
ill support cosmetic only if i can be buck nekked otherwise no
i hear alot of complaining about the super cap blob fest going on and feel more balance is requiredtitan becomes a defensive ship  replace current dd reintroduce the area affect of dooms day devices with a max range of 50km with less damage but enough to kill fighters an bombers with ease makes super pilots think twice about deploying them 5 minute cyclessupers  increase the bay for holding more bombers because of the risk of being blow up by titanshulls immune to area of affect dooms day device but vunrable to dread dds fighter  bombers get extra damage on structurescarriers  increase fighter bays make immune to all ddoms days little more ehpdread  give the titans dd device only useable on supers  titans whilst in siege and structures inmmune  little extra ehp but penatlty on bombers damage and immune to area of affect ddsevery capital or super cap counters another if used correctlynot a perfect solution but a base for something to be worked one 
you have no actual clue or experience with anything youre talking about do you
wait so let me follow your logic heresupers are overpowered so lets make titans more powerful by bringing back the aoe dd and super carriers more powerful by adding more space for fighter bombers ummm what wow just wow
agreed not only are they useless but they require otherwise useless skills to manufacture talocan engineering seriously why even bother make cosmos bpcs relevant or just pull them
most cosmos modules have the best fitting requirements in their group
agreed
i gather the lack of expected responses is due to the many interested peoples slow wellthoughtout deliberations over the benefits of such a model
it actually doesnt sound like such a bad idea i can see this being a bit of an exploitable device for fleet opsboth for and against i would basically just make local an unreliable intel gathering tool i would support this
how about a slight tweak to your method a cloaked ship doesnt appear in local but when they activate a mod not the cloak of course eg a probe launcher on board scanner they pop up gets rid of the argument about afk cloaking because if they pop up you know they are not afk also if they dont activate anything apart from a cloak they disappear from local after a couple of minutes
after having crosstrained in all empire nations ships and weaponry i must say that out of the four gallente guns are the worst drones compensate a little but not enough both in pvp and pve i understand that improving gallente gun dmgtrackingcap use wouldnt make them distinct so dear capsuleers and csm members reading this what say ye of special ammo for gallente guns with effects such as increasing sig radius range damp cap drainothers on the target to help spice things a bitthank you
please visit your user settings to reenable images
your well thought out annotated well documented idea intrigues me
this
what would be the point salvaging is tricky enough u dont need to be picky about your salvage targets p
yeah good immersion some wrecks dont get salvaged in belts or at gates so it would nicely the generic wrecks are so non personal
i agree that there are more important things to work on but i like the idea anyway titans and capitals actually leave behind a husk that resembles the ship all busted up all ships should do exactly this same thing there would be no increased lag from it ccp would simply need to change the generic wreck item to something a little more complex for each ship shouldnt be hard to do at all
yes its true that there are more important things to do but i think they wouldnt give much hard work since most of those models are already in the game there are specific wrecks even for stations so pos could have their own wrecks too
at least do something about the animation the ships go from intact to a little pile of metal scraps in one little flash no piecebypiece explosion nothing just the instant conversion from ship to wreckas for shipspecific wrecks yes that would actually make sense capitals have them so i cant see why smaller ships cant go for it
i agree it would be pretty awesome to see a pod zip out of an exploding wreck as the animation of the explosion is going explosion animations could be a client side thing that could be turned off and on as wellthat would be pretty freaking cool this deserves some attention ccpposting with alt for another approval

so efforts have tried to be made to ease those who run missions who were not happy with mission probers jumping into their missions to salvage wrecks that at least 90 leave behindso then since this has not gone any further you will be seeing alot more of us who do this in your missions salvaging the wrecks that more than likely you wil just leave behind anywayremember we brought a possible solution and it was buried next time drop a tear somewhere else
i want to take up the idea of the beacon butbind it to blue wrecks every blue wreck should be findable why else abbandon them in the first placenow for missions each wreck in the pockets which remain when someone is turning the mission in without salvaging should turn into blue wrecks if not salvaged by turning blue they get a beacon and dedicated salvager could find it easier the strength of the beacon could be bound to the level of the mission like a lvl 1 is found on first scan and lvl 4 need several circles like to 1 au or sligthly easier 4 auimportant thing is to wait till the mission is turned in we dont want to rob all our ninja salvager of their fun having the need to do a bit more tricky scan jobs
i dont see any problems with how things already are you can already find mission runners you can already wiat for them to finish and leave you can already loot and salvage what they leave behind what you want it to be easier for you to steal other peoples loot too effing bad you can salvage the wrecks without aggression if youre going to take the chance on grabbing their loot as well you should accept the risk associated with thatthe salvager profession is already lucrative enough for those with balls those without can come back when they grow a pair your free lunch is the wrecks the loot has riskas far as scanning wrecks no youre either on the ball with finding them or youre not
now this is a good idea do that no this is not a troll
no not looking for a free lunch ye things should stay as they are in the sense of being agressed when looting wrecks however should we be agressed when they clearly dont want the wrecks however it is those wrecks that are left behind after the mission has been turned in and the pilots are long gonenah i dont mind jumping a mission and cargo scanning the wrecks to see what i may want and be agressed for iti beleive where all this stemmed from was a thread about pilots being agressed even for salvaging wrecks in missions or notpvpmissions and what noti am agressed plenty of times no worries this is about those wrecks after missions are turned in and the pilot is long gone this is where salvagers want to find those wrecks without having to scan down shipsdrones and jump into someones missions
instead of going full  and demanding ccp create a mod that does the exact same thing in the exact same way as another mod already does lets try and theorise how one could increase gallente leadership mods utility in generalas pointed out several mods exist that improve tanking why not have a gallente mod that improve damage instead or tracking or rangethese combined with the much needed look at hybrid weaponry in general could bring gallente back to par with the other races again if it was done well it wouldnt even be hilariously imbalanced
i disagree that damage boosting would be good for leadership it would make things like pos bashing station capture etc easier which is not a good thingi was pondering about things like drone durability or drone speed boosting not sure if it would be worth a command slot though
increased optimal and tracking of hybrids blaster supremacyincreased drone navigation and sharpshooting heavies moving as fast as warriors oh yeah 
while i agree it needs a lot more thought than i have put into it i in general terms think it might be possible to pull offi dont necessarily see stations being easy to take being a problem as being hard to take is part of the reason 00 is supercarriers online at the moment which is all manner of dumb that said i prefer the tracking aspectin any case i would think the bonus would have to be something suited to the supposed gallente warfare style which is as i understand it high close range dps from blasters and drones with armour tanking now armour tanking is ofcourse already covered which leaves some close range weapon or drone effect the ideal route to my mindwhat say you
why not make it activity based whatever alliance has the most players active in a system has sovereignty for as longa s they can maintain that activity meaning alliances can only hold as much sov as they can keep active players and if they spread out too far people will just come in and claim there systemsthis would break up big alliances or at elast reduce blobbing because in order to keep your systems you need to keep your players relatively spread out and your teritories more condensedyes this idea could use refining but i think it could be a building block to start with
im just going to park 8 accounts in a system and do things every now and then thatll crush someones space empirenot supported
never thought i would say it but i agree with the goon 1
because it would be too difficult to actually live in a system you wanted to claim sovereignty over thats why its better to spin ship in station than actively enforce sovereignty
it already is activity based try not defending a system when someone tries to take it
yes please change to a font with letters you can actually distinguish between
id like something larger than a transport that i can jump through a blops bridge would be very handy for pos fueling etc
you know it sounds kinda silly let players get 100 standing with concord so we can be pirate in highsec with out getting concordokenyeh i know not realistic but sounded kinda funnystupidbe nice to see a subconcord divisional corp that is specific to the incursionrelated needs tho
you used to be able to run missions for concord but everyone did only that so it got axedsimply concord has the most impact of all npc aspects on the life of pc so you reap the most benefits by working for them
i beg to differ on the point who trollposts and who doesnt since the poster you misquoted did raise a valid point id generelly support the possibility of choice but the possible rewards should be much more balanced an implant worth 400m next to another one worth 1m and next to even less cash as choices isnt my idea of balance
easier  just hand out lps and put all of this stuff into the lp store there you can buy what you want though i dont think the mindlink would come cheap guessing it would cost about 450k500k lp
taking the shear cost of super carriers in account and the inability to balance things in any likeness to realityie a ship that size ould have so many gun batteries on it to deal with smaller vessels the current neuting defence against hics and dics are fairly well balanced imo some people are saying that it is a risk free ganking tool but that is only if you are reckless the whole idea of 00 is to be high risk nothing is stopping you from dropping your own supercapital fleet or a fleet of neuting tempests onto a gankerlook at the amout of carriers that would be required to take down 1 super carrier if they are in a remote repping chain then a single sc will be sure of not killing them and dying permitted you can get it bubbled it is not a buff feature it is a balancing feature8 carriers to a super carrier you have a fight and they all die the carrier pilots get insurance payout of 50 of ship and fit supercaps dont get to have platinum insurance if dont want groups with 50 supercaps floating about and pawning everything in their way dont weaken ships that are only able to counter what they are worth but create a game culture where there would be no benefit in controlling half the map for precious moon goo but rather that you wil have smaller groupsdefending their own small space where they can generate enough income that it is only worth taking if you can populate it heavily and thus get the isk out
balancing on cost alone has been a failed argument since 2006 in an era when a single tech moon provides an income of billions of isk per week then arguing that a ship that costs 50 times as much should be able to take on 50 times as many is simply nonsensical t2 cruisers cost 50 times as much as a t1 cruiser but noone with half a brain thinks that they should be able to take on 50 t1 cruisers and survive
i like the idea of being able to install gate guns
if you learned how to use spell check your ideas might seem just a little bit less rediculous
i too want the old eve of 09 back
hmmm old eve back    where was you in 2006
from the looks of your battleclinic record you must find general computer use a challenge nice navy mega must make even ratting seem like a massive challenge
thats were it might normally be but that would make it too easyi was thinking more for low sec onlymaybe low sec planets only
last i checked even big nice fat grav sites had lower end minerals in very good quantities in whs of course its just nobody can be arsed into minnig it due to sheer greed over abcim suspicous of this change to be quite honest
if some people like hisec why not let them be happy thereif other people like to hole up in c13 whs mining abc ore in order to have their own little home in eve thats not possible any other way why not let them be happy thereif you really want to let players have more fun make it possible for small corps to hold territory in nullsec in a semisecure fashion  rather than the current reality of having to blob up to survive at all and simply become nameless faceless prostitutes to some huge 00 alliance to enjoy nullsec the only people i see wanting to change things are the 00 dwellers wanting easier prey by forcing these happy hisec and c13 wh dwellers into becoming their nullsec cannon fodder  this wont make them any happier it will simply make them quit playing  ccp needs to provide more niches for differentiated play not less by punishing the existing hisec and wh dwellers 
we used a term in the militaryobeovercome by events basically significant andor multiple events occur that render the original event or plan of action mootit seems that ccp tinhatters can speculate on csm collusion is hoping that enough distracting events will occur over time that the publication of the minutes will no longer be relevant or expected
inb4 christmas day
almost three months since the emergency meeting now both ccp and csm are to blame really csm took their sweet time a month if i remember them admitting on the forums before they even thought about starting on the minutes factor in massive amounts of key ccp personal going on extended vacation throw in a dash of fighting over how the feel of the minutes is supposed to be and you get these resultswhy does either party view this method as acceptable is this what the players deserve
first a disclaimerer this is more of a feeling i got when i was at pax my husband loves eve and everything it embodies i never play but i too also love eve more so now that ive got to chat in depth with various players at the totally awesome and striperless eve party im about as straight as a girl gets i dont want to see any of that going onbut the one thing that really bothered me was how apologetic some of the presentations were like eve isnt difficult eve isnt just a game for advanced gamers yes eve is difficult  yes dedication pays off in eve you dont like it play world of warcraft you dont like that the game changes see previous answer personally i have a pile of emotional issues that keeps me from pvping in any sort of persistent world 1st person shooters and board games are the only places i compete i cant take the heat fantastic i have lotro or minesweeper so dont appologize for eve it is an amazing amazing game based on an amazing philosophy that produced an amazing procedure for eventually making the best game in the universe that has already brought together a fantastic if not slightly whiny community so when you are in your eve booth presenting like you do focus on the chance for change the ability for people to affect the world and the vision of what game the game developers want it to be game devs dont agree fantastic have a debate let the audience ask questions and suggest things during the debate also i dont understand why you feel the need to apologize for the complexity of your game do you want dedicated players or not did you make all this complexity and really expect a bunch of casual gamers to say that they have time for it because they wont and thats ok becausethe eve tournaments are my favorite part i love that it takes a serious amount of skill and dedication to compete and win the tournament and i am really excited that so many people are willing to do this so i dont have to for my entertainment which when you think about it its a lot like football football makes a lot of money i want to see eve make a lot of money so they can implement all my more expensive ideas implant the idea of football for nerds in your collective heads and go eve should be capitalizing on its universe more than it is but not so much as to be too annoyinglastly dont get caught up in the fact that you receive a lot of complaints thats all i heard from everyone the entire time i was stalking and not talking to the game devs at paxjust give them better ways to give feedback youve already implemented some things that work but i think a little more creativity might be needed to really solve the issue these are going to be the worst suggestions ive ever had please forgive me but im a usability designerpsychologist at heart so i have to try  have ab testing on your test servers im not expecting you to put a ton of work into an incarna level of programming and then ab test incarnano incarna but for things like balance issues that everyone talks about maybe being able to change a hull value and letting people comment on it might be really valuable also this really will be my worst suggestion  i love ita tabletop rpg game being crazy is a good time you should try it my reasoning is this if big if you are able to mimic the dynamics of eve in a game like dd then people might be able to find their own balancegame play options and share them back with ccp hey even bad ideas can inspire genius ideas in smarter peoplerightotherwise seriously just make another game parallel to evepreferably one with treesand cute fuzzy animals id totally play that but its ok if you dont i have that warcraft thing if i get desperate
that is one of the few posts ive read that hasnt simply ed about something in a whiney fashion so kudos to you love alot of the points you brought up as well especially the part about an eve table top rpg since they own the rights to white wolf why not put on into production will bring some more players into the game for starters and would make for a fantastic universe to play in with the benefit of brining in more money for ccp to use to improve our game
you should be rewardedhello kitty kestrel reward
funny how vvs scary graph doesnt look so outrageous anymore right about now
this this a million times thisif you do nothing else ccp keep this in mind please
funny how this topic becomes more relevant with each patchi really wish ccp employees would take your initial post get over their adhd read it very carefully and then put it into practice
supporting opthat this hasnt been addressed in so long is disgraceful even blizzard which receives so much hate for forcing their methods onto players at least puts out finished products they have stayed successful for 8 years while the rushed market researched clones die 6 months after they release copy the plan not the content do it right

the new icons really need some major work hell the new turrets need some major work the animations the recoiling lasers lol the crooked barrels on artillery cannons seriously wtf and half a dozen other thingsits like they sat down and tried to figure out how to create guns with a maximum number of spinning  moving parts without any regard to realism or actual usefulness in game when it comes to iconsnot being all negative here either i like quite a few of the new turret designs and obviously a lot of work went into them but with all the wrong priorities

i think ive already maybe posted this but here it comes anyway since im bored and sitting in complete safety in hi sec1 cloaking guy has to travel into system somehow first people can shoot him while doing it2 once cloaker has traveled n jumps in 00 space without jump bridges through n number of gatecamp he probably wants to take a small break aka go afk note this is most important part its pretty much way too much trouble to logoff login just to take a smoke break and no you cant just go and make 30 jumps to nearest station just to afk3 once cloaker has done some stuff he will run out of ammo nanite paste etc stuff carebear cannot even think about he needs to go back to npc space to dock up and get more again he has to go through n number of gatecamps whatever without jump bridges4 while doing cloaking stuff cloaker obviously cannot rat trade in jita do level 4s do incursions etcso yeah cloaking takes much more effort and risk than undocking from alliance outpost and warping to nearest asteroid belt also uncloaking and actually shooting some ratter in big 00 blob alliance is more risky than undocking and warping to anomaly while 1 guy cloaked in system since you can just have your 5000 buddies cynoed in
there should be a limit to how much plex you are able to buy with real life cash because if youre able to buy unlimited amounts that is just plain stupidityand once you reach the limit there should be a certain amount of time you have to wait until you can buy plex again
1 i doubt ccp will put a limit on it as its money in there pockets and they really need that right now and 2 if someone wants to spend lets say 200 bucks on 13 plexs let them it either means they have more money then sense a good thing in eve though not for them or well there is no or
no this wouldnt do anything but be annoyinglookmore plex bought with rl cash  cheaper plex in game  less demand for plex  less people buy plex with rl moneyits a cycle
seeing as how ccp just rolled out a new 13 plex for 199 deal it looks like they saw your post laughed and decided to offer a discount for buying larger quantities of plex

wormholes are easy to spot i do not understand how you feel its necessary to give itits own tab inspite of the signatures that show up in a fresh holebut even thena little practice and tracking sigs no problem all i see is a cry to be lazy
if you dont understand how is it all you can see is a cry to be lazy is anything that might benefit people by making it a little less frustrating a cry in your booksor is it that because i think the system could be simplified and imo improved slightly that i must be crying and lazy christ what the community has become in the past few years from just simply disagreeing to anything that someone dosnt agree with means your either a crying about itedit ill save time and say in before u mad brah
how long does it take you to scan your way to kspace from a system to a fresh c6 staticalso consider that often you have to scan for more than one kspace wh to get out safely
there are filters you can use on your scanner already that will only show certain cosmic signatures such as wormholes while scanning
these do not work until you manually identify weather or not it is a wormhole

yes  1000 times this
two worst parts of being a nooba learning how ships skills and fittings go togetherideas1 create a default training plan per raceprofession for noobs show a hypothetical skills list with links to purchase the skills from market etc put it in their training queue have them pay isk to enable each skill in the list or something2 popup lists for choice driven lists for ship fitting slots  ie click on mid slot 1 get a pop up list of modules that can go there with a subsequent pop up list of skills required and links to purchase themb learning how agents npc corps and standings go togetherideas1 maybe just need to do as others have suggested  have more linked out missionagent suggestions available presented at the end of the tutorial mission chains  maybe describe a bit what the different empire npc corps do and have them choose from a list of agent suggestions
if they log before they uncloak you only have a few secs to kill it why is this allowed at all you shouldnt not be allowed to log to off to avoid dying
i agree that it is a completely lame tactic and should have been dealt with years agobut the carebears dont approve and ccp stopped listening to players long ago
suggestion have a lp store by faction instead of having a lp store by corporationexample  caldari state lp store regroup all lp points of all corporations under caldari state
yes because different corporations arent homogenized enough already at this point the only difference between them is a slight difference in their divisions and agent locations  we dont even have agent quality to separate them anymorehey grinding standings for all these different corps is annoying lets just do everything based on alliance standings and make it so you only work for one factionproposal not supported
wont happen  cause ccp dont want people grouping around certain mission hubs again now there is need to go to a different corp if you want for ie a faction mwd
ok i saw this once in a vid and i was thinking it would be great to have it backnow this is not the exact way it was but u get the ideai know its a crappy pic but thats not the pointplease visit your user settings to reenable images
f11 will get you this i would however like a bigger map
ye true f11 will get the side sys maps it will not get the sys map up with along side the dirscanner as shown in the pici think bringing up the dirscanner should also bring up the sys map along its side as the pic shows like i said i saw it this way in a vid and must have been implemented at one time or anotherthis would be great to have again in this way after all they are used in tandem anyway
yes cosmos is another forgotten feature that needs loveps op should train structured writing and communication to lvl 3 at least
completely agree ive had a hanger full of cosmos bpos for about 2 years simply not worth building or selling the prints
gallente cosmos are waiting to get the complete set of missions from 2006 at least and the bpc are valueless the same make it redo all the cosmo stuff but actually ccp replied to that a few years ago cosmos missions require too much work to develop they will not be further developed or something similar still supported even if it will get nothing maybe something will change
preston vane i should have stipulated that my analysis was based on a per character average instead of a per player average one character can earn more isk off of incursions in high sec than other activities else where im going to ignore your solo mining and ratting fleet comparisonstrading as you mention is the only exception hands down it is the most profitable activity but the npc sources of isk are minimal the most i ever pulled off of an npc market trade was 20 million your account of plex market manipulation is believable gtc prices tend to trail plex prices however the rate of gtc inflation increased after the release of incursion and before the nex implementation interesting that kara brooks the market expert did not mention thiskara brooksi complied with previous critics and nerfed my estimates to suggest that there still was an issuehave you been looking at my killboards i have run a few incursions and earned 100 millionhour with an autocannon fit shield tanked maelstrom we even comped with decked out faction fleets and still earned 100 million isk per hour only ccp knows what they earnedi like your suggestion to allow players to fly under sansha colors another caveat would be to make concord unable to respond to sansha sites chunicha suggested something similar

hmmon 1 hand stealth gangs and solo ops to kill botters solo pvp becomes bot hunting works for meon the other stealth gangs to kill legitimate mining ops that if u think about it have no real defense if they cant tell your coming no pvps this isnt a good thingi accept this on the basis that no one mines in 00
i do get so tired of this adapt or die rubbish which is exactly what it is i still pvp a lot and im still successful at it i can adapt however i dont think the adaptions that i and a lot of small scale pvpers have had to make are for the better small scale pvp has gotten worse since this game was brought in through various changes forget the capital proposal ill remove that after this post material sink is good for the economy yes it does create isk but less isk is created than the value of minerals and build parts required to build the ship which are permanently removed from game overall i feel helping the economy but im not economist and thats not even the primary point i was trying to makemy point is that rr is currently overpowered if you are in a 1015 man gang yes you can bring logistics a lot of the time we will but more often than not any larger gang will have even more logistics rendering you useless resulting in the majority of pvp being ganks unless you know what you will be fighting before you come across it then it is very hard to counter every sort of logistics gang you come up against with regards to spider tanking i just realised my choice in words was poor but that does not change the fact that spider tanking carriers and supercarriers are a real issue they get thrown at small roaming gangs all the time and just sit there and smile while you can do nothingthere are whispers at ccp about changing remote reps believe it or not they will be changed in the futurewith regards to the expected goon troll im not trying to ram my pvp style down your throat im trying to make it viable and yes i do want smaller groups to be able to punish 150 man gangs if those gangs are poorly led poorly fitted and poorly flown why shouldnt skill be rewarded and lack of skill punishedclearly people dont like the idea of rr being used only on the class for which their module size would suggest perhaps there is another answer some suggestions on here have been goodbut for those wanting to keep no risk cheap pvp with their drake fleets and dozen scimitars i hope your days are numbered and i hope ccp will do the sensible if unpopular thing
also thankyou gizznitt for your post and link i would just like to highlight some quotes from the blog which will hopefully show why im even making these proposalsccp want the same thing i do they just dont quite know yet how to get there i believe remote repair is one of many problems with combat in the game that needs addressing also i have changed my opening post to reflect points and suggestions from posts in this thread
what you mean make it a target painter that does damageyeah i could see that it would have to do slightly less damage and be maybe as or slightly more effective then a target painter though it would ahve to be you shoot hit increases sig radius but if you stop shooting it is no longer debuffed and if you miss it does not reduce its sig radius only make the effect last just long enough to fire another cycle that way if you start missing liek if your a bc and its a frig itll still have a chance
you do realize blasters are best guns around caldari gunboats are most ed cos they dont get damage even with blastersits other things than guns like tracking enhancers and ridiculous ship speed which makes minmatar so good
how about instead we get rid of all currency and replace it with debtthat way when you need something from somebody you can trade them tyhe debt someonme else owes youpersonally i think this would reflect a true economy more effectively since in the real world theres no such thing as currency just pieces of paper informing you how much of your countrys debt is your fault
he is on to something for all the pvp tards in gameeverything will be free and npc seededpvp children can fight all the time for freemission runners can mission run and get nothing so they will decide to pvpif u can fly the ship u can afford the shipwant to pvp all the time remove isk and npc seed everything
obvious troll is obvious but go play on sisi
pictures of potential ships i call dibs on the minmatar one
more important things to do than thison a side note minmatar ships would remain unchanged at least

oh yes just let those salty crocodile tears flow pleasegod i cant believe they won seats on the csm just because they got more votes than other people who ran the csm should cater to my needs because what i believe is so obviously what everyone else in eve believes just ignore the fact that everyone on csm got there through numbers of votes cast for themgod grow up your concerns arent nearly as important as you think they are otherwise people wouldve voted for the csm in such a way that reflected that what do you suggest ignoring the number of votes each delegate got and instead appointing yourself as decider of who gets on the csm face it you are a few smatterings of highly vocal carebears trying to create an issue where there is none if you want things to change on the csm then run for it during the next elections and lets just see exactly how many people really do agree with your ideas or lack thereof
its just like a settlement they have to keep trying to come up with something that neither party wants but both are willing to agree toi imagine ccp does not want certain information out and the csm is adamant about letting that very same information releasedit will be out when it is out
yes and by that time it will be totally irrelevant nothing to see here move on

i wanted to put my simple idea in a straight forward and simple manner so i fired up mspaint and went to townplease visit your user settings to reenable images please visit your user settings to reenable imagesthe idea is simple when using blasters if a target gets inside your optimal your critical hits start to do more damage than normal and at point blank range let say 100m your critical hits will do up to 4 times more damage than a normal criticalthis change gives blasters a big damage boost but only when certain criteria are met so its not over powered the only chanage to blaster boat set ups might be more tracking mods and more websas for a rail gun fix my idea for this is a bit extreme but meh welcome to everail guns should only really be put on sniper ships harpy moa eagle rokh for example and used in sniper set ups sniper set ups use up quite a few mid and low slots to do well and hurt the ships tanking potential so i think a critical bonus should be a good way to boost rails and sniping as a tacticsmall railsif optimal is  100km andtarget is with in 2 of optimal range thenchance to do up to 12 times normal damage criticalmedium railsif optimal is  150km andtarget is with in 2 of optimal range thenchance to do up to 12 times damage normal criticallarge railsif optimal is  200km andtarget is with in 2 of optimal range thenchance to do up to 12 times normal damage criticalagain as much as this looks over powered its not because of the very strict conditions that must be met for example if a sniper rokh with a 210km optimal warps to a 200km book mark off a gate then only targets with in 2 of its optimal are at risk of get smacked with a super crit and a smart fc is going to know that if he moves his ships with in the 200km requirement then their will be no way the rokh can hit them for a super critanyway those are my ideas on how to both fix hybrids and give them their own unique flavorlasers do not run out of ammo and have insta reloadartillery has many damage types dont require cap and have the highest alphamissiles never miss have all damage types and do the same damage at any rangehybrids have none of these so lets give them a super crit chanceif you have read my whole post then thank you
keep in mind that right now critical hits only happen in 1 of all shots fired unless your chance to hit per shot fired is less than 1 in which case all hits are critical hits also critical hits do 3 times average damage whereas normal hits randomly vary between 05 times and 15 times average damage though if hit chance is low most of those hits will be closer to 05 times average damage than to 15 times average damage
supporting this cause of your pretty diagrams a kind of reduction to the huge bumpdistance tracking issues could be suitablethere are other problems though like fitting tank speed etc

give new players more things to do than mission running and miningi hear all the time from vets that new players can do this or that early on in their career to this i call bull if a new player knew how to do those things then theyre probably not newgive them more clear things to do ingame
nothing can fix the fact that newbie doesnt know what all stuff he can do its about finding it out it doesnt help to give more stuff when they dont know even 10 of stuff they can do at first place i am not sure if its trolling or not trolol but ive seen growing numbers of whines about new player cant do this and that when theres maybe 100x stuff newbie can do nowadays compared to like 2007 and that good old i cannot do anything i have only 1mil sp
ok this was probably brought up years ago i dont knowbut honestly i think you should be able to use all 3 of yer characters same time i never did understand the concept of why we can not also it would be great for those who can not afford or want to pay for 3 subscriptionsi dont know if it will curb dead and inactive trial accounts probably noti dont know if would curb macros in anyway probably noti am not saying they should be able to be trained same time which doesnt make sense to me either but at least be able to use em same timefor instance if i have one parked in a wh and i can use 2 of my others to pick up matts and goods etci can have a ninja salvager doing what he does and have another parked in a safe with an industrialetc and so onye i know log off  log on etc repeat why seriouslymaybe if i understood the concept of why this can not be done it would make sense to me but i do not and it does not
thats neat i disagree
show me an mmo that allows you to train two or more characters on the same account at the same time
i am not saying they should be able to be trained same time which doesnt make sense to me either but at least be able to use em same time
get a alt and pay for it with plex its not hard1
use plex to pay extra accounts practically almost free compared to income atm if you do whsincursions etc
i have two accounts with all six character slots filled and actively used ingame for piand still i think this thread is a bad idea
no idea how ccp has addressed this issue there is no way this should be acceptable
and cross posting should also not be allowedoh wait its not
duplicate thread locked please keep the discussion here
it would be actually nice if all corporations would be unique lp stores and at least portion of store items would be unique to corporation that way it would matter where you do missions and to whombetter modules would be for corporations with level 4 agents in low sec only but not available in militia lp store etc suddenly low sec mission running duh
this is the sort of quality discussion on eve issues we should be having not what those csm jerks bring
bet youll vote next time hippy
during the last csm elections i lived in 00 and voted based on 00 issuesyet i had 2 characters in 00 and 5 characters in empirewould you want to force my haulingtradingmission alts to be represented by some highsec csm rep when i could have hardly cared less about that part of space because i spent most of my playtime in 00 anyways
no absolutely not but if you cant see the results of nerfing other aspect of the game in favour of 00 and its consequent effects on your hisec activities then its not my place to enlighten you on selfinterest
no man i feel its your duty to tell him why eliminating the need for drudging in hisec is against his selfinterest
id prefer it if highsec was left alone materialwise but had wardec loopholes closed and npc corps eliminated and was made much more dangerous then it is now make it so nullsec logistics had an element of risk to them instead of just being handled by highsec alts its asinine to make it so jbs are limited to one per system while the 00 war machine is fueled by freighters filled with compressed mins on afk autopilot or that hisec miners and industrialists could see living in the safety of a 00 alliance as a valid alternative instead of a far inferior option to living under the safety of concord ccp is pushing nullsec because from a marketing perspective null produces the most content the most videos the most headlines the most buzz that a game needs to draw in new players
they already have this its called whspace
its the nature of eve that its almost impossible to do something that doesnt affect others somehow you might think that youre peacefully minding your own business but in reality youre competing with me and changing my game in a dozen ways
i am blessed with a good job with lots of responsibility i live on a nice farm with my wife and 2 kids we have some horses and some sheep and some dogs and 3 cars i have been playing eve on and off since the start i have also been playing other online games on and off since the start including eq eq2 uo wow wwiionline so thats around 20 years of online gaming  a bit this little intro is meant to let you know that i as many other eve players have a full life outside eve and that eve is not an important part of my life but rather a nice additionthis is my life in evei like to play challenging pve if i had the time or the isk i would now and then like to venture out to lowsec and see if i could be succesful in some pvp the problem is that i dont have the time to read a lot of background or take two years of pvpuniversity so when i go to lowsec i usually get podkilled within the first 10 minutesthen i have to find new isk to be able to do lvl 4 missions well since it would take me 23 month to do that and i really dont want to spend my valuable playing time grinding all the time then i end up buying some isk by selling these gametime plexthingsnow i planned to try a lvl 5 mission since lvl 4 missions has become a bit too easy for me and because i would like to make more money and have more challengei had to find an agent in 04 sec space when i docked out from the 04 station i got podkilled by 4 pirates waiting for me they probably had fun but i can look forward to either go out and buy some more isk or grinding the next many times i have time to play until i have enough again for a good shipbtw i dont get the idea of having 04 space and 00 space when the risk is the same shouldnt at least the station protect in and outgoing traffic in 04 what is the consequencewell for me it is that i dont dare to try the lvl 5 missions i would really like to do to get more pve challenge because i am forced to pvp at a time when i am not fit for itdo i find that fun nonow i will go back and do some highsec lvl 4 missions and if it goes like the other times when i go bored then i quit eve again and in a year or two i come back and stay for a few months to see if pve has been improvedam i whining well maybe but i think a lot of players like me would stay playing for a much longer time and even start enjoy pvp now and then if we could get the opportunity to build up something which had a fair chance in 00 without having to quit the job and the family to go on the eveuniversity and have no other lifei am here to be happy and challenged but not to make some hardcore players happy on my own expense that is simply naivei am a seldom guest in the forums since i would much more like to fly a spaceship there is no reason to start shouting at me since i probably wont see it but if you understand what my message is maybe there is a chance that more occassional players will enjoy now and then being cannonfodder for you hardcore peoplebrtrollo
the minutes where are theylinks to csm blogs about this
hey i wanna run a bot to rack up a lot of isk why do you care what i do with my account or my isk
so how do we allow these smallcorp independent industrialist dreamers to emmigrate to 00 and setup their own outpostsit seems there needs to be a way to have a sort of smallcorp sov mechanic  places where only small gangs of ships can fly  out of the way places where its possible for a small gang to defend and be attacked by other small gangs  places where the daily cap ship  drake blob cant simply come in and control everythingproposalsmallgang nullsec regionsobservationwildlife always thrives best around the borders of varied terrain goalincrease the variety of habitat available in eve and in particular create more border areas around nullsec to create a more thriving ecosystem where wildlife can live and evolve currently all nullsec systems are connected by stargates also cap ships are able to jump to all systems jbs or jds due to this large alliances are able to project power without limits  which leads to a single vast nullsec wasteland where all territory is held by a few large alliances and with no diversified playing field allowing for small gang warfare since a drake or cap ship blob is always just a cyno away at any time so everyone gravitates into similar blobslosec may have been intended as a border region but its actually just an even more deadly no mans landfrom what others have said nerfing jfs jbs would work against the idea of attracting and keeping players in nullsec due to difficulty of logistics learning from the success of whs at encouraging small gang behaviors though perhaps we could create small gang nullsec regionsthese would be territories isolated somewhat from normal nullsec space somehow  either by severely restricting stargatejump travel to them or by making gatesjump drives somehow scale with major sov mechanics ieyou can attack a growing neighboring territoryalliance of small gang regions with your cap fleetblob but you might have to build a larger road or upgrade the infrastructure to get theremajor regions of nullsec would be tied together by major transport routes as today  but there would just be smaller out of the way regions where major blobsfleets simply couldnt go without building a bigger road so to speakas such smallgang regions grow in power they could then move tojoin larger alliance space sure resources wouldnt be as abundant as where the cap blobs fly  but some people dont care as much about wealth as they do independence these smallgang regions would encourage small gangs of miner corporations for example to produce minerals and manufacture things so sell at nearby large alliance trade hubs the other nullsec issues mineral balance manufacturing slots etc would still need to be addressed but at least there would be a way for small gangs to participate 
i didnt read every response but the only way i see of making a rival to jita for null sec players would be to have some of the faction space a defacto hi sec where 10 players can go without concord problems and the faction polices any aggro in their system this space would be entirely seperated from any empire with the only way in through true 00 the system should allow for cynos like any other null sec so jf can jump in to provide the necessary goods for sale naturally all gates to such a system would be camped to hell so possibly a small cluster of systems 34 would worki think this would create an extremely attractive hub for null sec flame expected
very interesting  got me thinking  but then it seems so much like  jita  hmmmm  whats wrong with jita againseriously tho  more trade hubs could be cool
agreed here as well they are horrible
the new icons are simply bad you should kick the person who made them
yes again
bring back the old turret icons
this idea is far better than magic obelisks to claim space or magic upgrades to attract signatures which i must admit was some improvement over pos spam sovi like the attempt in this idea to make sov more of a result of player action and activity and less of a goalhypothetically in a system where two alliances are fighting over a system with jump bridges cynosural generators and cynosural jammers there is the possibility of spam tactics basically as an alliance is losing say a cynosural jammer they could offline it and online one somewhere else in the system sort of a wild goose chase defense a time delay could be incorporated into these structures detrimental to whomevers structure is lost becomes incapacitated or offlined perhaps a ten minute timer more consideration is required for situations involving multiple alliances especially two coalitions of multiple alliances fighting over a systemwith one structure as the focus of contest fleets have more impetus to meet with blob and lag the remaining concernas far as timezone considerations it takes a fair amount of time anchor and set up a pos let alone organize an invasion if an alliance doesnt notice a host of hostiles establishing control towers in their system then they arent using it and deserve to lose it
tldr  nice idea but need to avoid farming for sov pitfallsi love the idea buthow do you avoid the flog me to death to get sov syndromelet me explainalliance 1 wants sov over a system owned by alliance 2  so they get buddies in corp 1 to deploy large fleet of disposable ships which they destroy in that systemalliance 1s sov index skyrockets they gain sov without even having to fight alliance 2yeah i know twisted but then so are some players of eve i know
tldr summary1 nex merchandise is pointless since nobody else can see it2 incarna in its current form aka cq is a massive waste of time that hurts everyone3 nex clothing should not cost more than rl clothingwe all get where ccp is going with incarna its a great addition to the game thats long overdue and what many new players have been asking for we get that however what we currently have is captains quarters a massive project that look a long time to develop yay great i can walk around by myself in this lone office and sometimes look at my active ship assuming its not glitched out which most of the time it is and thats about it all that time and effort that went into developing this expansion and yet its content only lasted 5 minutes before weve seen it all lame with cq we also got the noble exchange a way for players to break up plex into a new currency called aur great but the main problem with this is that cq is a single player experience which entirely defeats the purpose of vanity sales why spend real money for ingame money used for character clothing purchases when nobody else can see releasing the nex with cq was a bad idea it should be removed and reintroduced when players can eventually interact with each other currently its just a wastespeaking of nex the prices are just plain bad weve all heard how awful they are but people generally like to see it for themselves so heres a few numbers to give you an idea of just how bad it really isironically a shirt at walmart is cheaper than a shirt from the nex not much needs to be said about the infamous monocle as its so often used as the point of reference in arguments against ccp ccp needs to reevaluate the prices aka bring them down at their current prices theres nothing micro about these transactions at all not by any stretch of the imagination especially since many of the vanity items cost more than the game itself
omg dont take away my space ken dress up doll but seriously yeah they need to drop prices on it or even better would be if they focused instead on fixing the spacerelated parts of the game that need some work or at least if youre gonna have vanity items make them things for your ship like being able to paint your ship certain colorsdesigns or add other vanity items to your ship like searchlights or ability to make design changes by that i mean changes to appearance absolutely nothing that would actually increase performance
whatever the line everything is risky no one should feel safe is something afk cloakers use ad nauseam using their own words even they shouldnt feel safe enough to drop in a ship cloak and be gone for the next 235 hoursthing is a cloaker which doesnt seem to do anything might not be afk at all but busily logging the activity in the system if hes doing it at all himself and havent set up a bot to do such a thing
thanks for proving mine bot
first i am going to apologize i only made it 5 pages before my eyes started bleeding and my brain cried for a little reason to be heard so if my points have been addressed i am sorry second i am not going to cite anyone specific as i am not trying to point fingers so on to my pointsdisrupted productivity this is bull the only person costing your supposed productivity is your own response not the afker you are choosing to be disrupted by his presence you are failing to do your own intel gathering you are afraid he might spot a cyno or appear suddenly in a stealth bomber does he have a record of flying sb does his corpalliance have a record of cyno warfare do you even know you are being reactionary in a proactive game frapsscreen readeretc yes these tools can be used to gain an unfair advantage by that i mean any advantage gained while not actively playing the game and should likely fall under the category of botting however they are purely passive and cant detected or enforced and could just as easily be performed by someone that has a half dozen monitors and adhd the intel they gather and the method sitting cloaked off the gates are perfectly legit and shouldnt be nerfed because some people are going to cheatomgs nerf cloaks1 stfu please nerfing long term and long distance recon andor making them annoying randomly clicking yes i want to stay cloaked as an example is a really dumb and bad idea intel is central to any war read the art of war if you dont believe me and making the job of your intel gathering agents harder is just about the worst thing you could donerf local in 00 in my understanding of the game mechanics the local channel is loosely tied to the stargates hence why whs dont have an accurate one the only reasonable change i could see to local in nulsec would be to removedelay the appearance of people who arrived in system by nonstargate means however that would strengthen cloaks so no one hear whats to hear that idea pi believe i have covered all of the reverent points however i can edit if after another eye bleeding 5 pages of trolling stupidity whining and ignorance i find another or twotwo responses to the next 5 pages i would totally support an anticloak class of ship not only does it resolve the afk cloaker problem but it would make for fantastic games of cat and mouse especially if all it told you was there was a cloaked ship not what cloaked ship i would also support an afk flag not for anything in this thread but because im sick of asking hey sonso you there p
you test guys starting to feel the pressure pay us our system ransom 500m per system and well leave will me more effetive than starting an assembly hall thread over it
hello test and all the other mega alliances that hire just anybody as a former iac member who felt just the same way back in 2007 when they rolled out covert ops ships i too share this hatred for exploiters why cant people afk mine  belt rat in 110 safety this blatant exploit has gone far enough its not like isk generation has any direct relation to tactical advantages purchasing power means nothing and if people cant minerat constantly how will their alliance ever hold space come on people think about this as miang hawaa points out anything that is possible while afkd is an exploitwhen i jump into 6vdt and i see 110 in local and all i have is a cheetah im pretty scared but then i realize that there are only about 5 or 6 people active and everyone else is just afk in the station or in their pos this false sense of numbers in local is very misleading if youre not actively clicking something you should be logged out and then your account banned for 235 hours that will teach you to afk right this blatant exploit has gone on long enough players should not be allowed to have a tactical advantage while afk at any point false local numbers has been a problem for a very long time everyone knows its a problem why hasnt anything been done what is being done about this frustrating problem
ccp please move some workers to the real content of eve this is something we would like to improve badly 
eve already has that just press the left and right mousebuttons and move back and forward with your mouse
i know of someone who spent 6500  to buy plexes he just has enough real life money and doesnt carei dont like that this is possible but i understand that ccp likes to see more people like him
thanks for the support i anticipate that ccp will start working on fw after the new year hopefully they will do this and give solo and small gang pvp a long overdue boost
i believe that was a wtfbbqpwn post sirnicely done o7

the biggest question would be who is them in the last sentence apart from some scattered forum postings i wouldnt be able to name one much less associate current members or candidates to policies they supportyou state that it would only take five minutes of my time but without some knowledge voting is rather pointlessnobody at least nobody i know likes political advertising but it does serve some purpose to make the candidates known to the people or is it that the current and prospective members of the csm do like their proceedings mired in secrecy and keeping the masses uneducated
no at least not in hisec a group of players have got together to try and inform and encourage hisec residents to vote for candiates who will represent their interests in the next csm election this is on simmer at the moment but things are happening contact either me or lakitel if you are interested in getting out the vote next election and we will will be happy to discuss what needs to be done
the opportunity to vote for the csm was presented equally to all players these postings by a few highly vocal hisec carebears utterly ignores the fact that if your concerns were both as important to the player base and as widespread as you purport them to be then the voting would have reflected that and the csm composition would be different than it currently is it played out in this way for a simple reason people are far more likely to vote in these things when angry the majority of hisec dwellers are content with things there as is while the majority of nullsec players are very upset with the way things there currently operate therefore if you have one group of people demanding change with another group content youre gonna work on pacifying the angry group rather than throwing carrots to those who are currently contenti think the fact that these anticsm threads are so relatively few in compared to the large number of hisec dwellers and the fact that these threads seem to be consistently driven by the same few people is actually quite telling
if he gets no benefit from having a presence in hisec then why is he there and if he does have a reason to be there why should he not care about it ah sorry i see where you seem to be going with this you appear to think that if ccp at the instigation of the csm shifts all of the advantages found in other sectors of the game into 00 then that will make the game fairer and more balancedwouldnt be a 00 resident yourself would you
where did i say or infer that he has no benefit from living in hisec clearly he does lets see if i can explain this to youwhy mine ice or lowends in 00 and risk your mackinaw on every undock when you can mine it under the protection of concordwhy research blueprints in 00 where the stations are few and takeable and poss are vulnerable to caps and supercaps when you can research it in 00 when you can research in total safety in hisecwhy manufacture goods why build t2 etc etc most null players have multiple hisec alts because its simply impractical and nonprofitable to do daytoday logistics and industry in 00 in truth its these hisec alts that are the cornerstone of 00 functionality however given the option they would prefer not needing any of their alts in hisec and they vote accordingly yeah dude if youre going to have one zone that has huge risk and the other have zero risk balancing the reward that comes with risk is rather crucial otherwise you end up with lowsec
whs severely lack trit pye mex even if you mine everything you geti like the idea of removing local from 00 to even things out 
true  but then ccp should listen to the 80 of players that live in hisec  instead of catering to the hardcore 00 minority people have voted very strongly with their feet  hisec is where people spend most of their time im betting a fair balance can be found so that both groups can enjoy the game  i just dont appreciate the current attitude of hisec people dont matter and are ruining the game for the poor 00 peoplewhat does nullsec have to attract anyone  your whole life is controlled by some big alliance no freedom really and all for what the opportunity to participate in large laggy fleet battlesheres an idea  make more wormholes higher risk than 00 no local and no blue blobs to protect you logistics more difficult but they allow people to learn pvp and participate in nullsec type activities but maintain the freedom of a small corpis this why the 00 alliances see whs as such a threat to them  its a way for people to maintain their freedom from the alliances
definitely a good idea and please leave the movement indicators visible for all of the ships in the tactical overlay especially in fleet battles it would help to track the movements of the squads in relation to you and each otherperhaps the tactical overlay could be made configurable in regards what elements are shown for all shipsthe selected ship or not at all
i wanted to put my simple idea in a straight forward and simple manner so i fired up mspaint and went to townplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesthe idea is simple when using blasters if a target gets inside your optimal your critical hits start to do more damage than normal and at point blank range let say 100m your critical hits will do up to 4 times more damage than a normal criticalthis change gives blasters a big damage boost but only when certain criteria are met so its not over powered the only chanage to blaster boat set ups might be more tracking mods and more websas for a rail gun fix my idea for this is a bit extreme but meh welcome to everail guns should only really be put on sniper ships harpy moa eagle rokh for example and used in sniper set ups sniper set ups use up quite a few mid and low slots to do well and hurt the ships tanking potential so i think a critical bonus should be a good way to boost rails and sniping as a tacticsmall railsif optimal is  100km andtarget is with in 2 of optimal range thenchance to do up to 12 times normal damage criticalmedium railsif optimal is  150km andtarget is with in 2 of optimal range thenchance to do up to 12 times damage normal criticallarge railsif optimal is  200km andtarget is with in 2 of optimal range thenchance to do up to 12 times normal damage criticalagain as much as this looks over powered its not because of the very strict conditions that must be metfor example if a sniper rokh with a 210km optimal warps to a 200km book mark off a gate then only targets with in 2 of its optimal are at risk of get smacked with a super crit and a smart fc is going to know that if he moves his ships with in the 200km requirement then their will be no way the rokh can hit them for a super critanyway those are my ideas on how to both fix hybrids and give them their own unique flavorlasers do not run out of ammo and have insta reloadartillery has many damage types dont require cap and have the highest alphamissiles never miss have all damage types and do the same damage at any rangehybrids have none of these so lets give them a super crit chanceif you have read my whole post then thank you
this blatant exploit has gone on long enough players should not be allowed to have a tactical advantage while afk at any point this defines exploit everyone knows it is a problem it has been for a very long time why has nothing been donewhat is being done about this frustrating problem how can we possibly be expected to gank carebears when they all just run off to their posi propose that afk carebears or carebears hiding in pos should periodically be kicked from their pos and sent back to the beltsanctum that they were ratting in
there are plenty enough isk opportunities for corps and alliances in nullsec it needs to be more attractive to the rankandfile industrialists who dont own a pos which usually means dont have access to research and production lines dont have their own cyno capital dont have rorqual support and arent part of a corp dedicated to mining
not try after last nerfs of 00 oportunitys of erning it for corps and allinces got less and less and tahy taking lot more effort and time production anfd mining its tight verry close to pvp and rating less ratign sytems less ammo needet less pvp aliance making less ammo ships etc needet makert turns in dust actualy with last anomaly nerf they turned down almost lal ammo production in soem regions where i ssaa it vas good brath up beforwath gos to mining ccp dont care baut minign eny more loks so now days mining each month gos down oprofits sinking each month even arkonor and bistot brings only to miner 25 milj per hour so to get back his hulk with fiting risking it m by mining in 00 hee need mine around 84 haurs that rediculus time that nedet to raplace his lost ship taht one off reasons way mininrs leaving 00 i not calculated out for there ev3 crystals with hee ned to get thos 25 milj per hourcorps  les anomaly runing les taxses paid moons small reaction dont give good profit eny more all carbisdes giving araudn 150 mil per month with that effort to bring all that  down fuel poses get soem one to do the silo cleaning moving etc that ridicilus ammount off money per month i eve not teling that you need ready all the time ppl to defend thos poses so curenty in 00 its risk vs profit tink its little beter than in high sec but not inaf highh to provide new forces and interest in to 00
obvious but bug reported that seems like an oversight
have my suport on it bring the old icons back
i cant identify anything at a glance anymore and thats not just about getting to learn the new icons its about poor design
well something has to be done new turret icons just lack the crisp shine and recognition of the old ones i suppose its because old icons were pixelwork while new ones are straight off renderso if there is no intention to make new icons look better old icons are prefferable solution
agreedthey do look  and its hard to tell what gun they are supposed to be
i dont understand why does every ammo have at least a couple damage types ie explosive kinetic thermic em except hybrid that has drum roll thermic and kinetic only theres no getting away from it if youre fighting against a gallante ship hes using thermic or kinetic otherwise hes not using his ship bonus not to mention if your out in null say against the angel cartel and theyre weak against explosive and strong against thermic and kinetic you have to lose your ship bonuses on a side bar why have 8 different types of hybrid ammo not to mention factions if they all basically do the same damage just slightly less power usagei suggest as a balance make different damage types for hybrid ammo
tldr addressing cyniacs sov farming loop holecyniac interesting loop hole if i understand your scenario correctly corp 1 is not part of alliance 2 i suppose if alliance 2 holds sov alliance 2 has to receive the flogging to destabilize or lose its sov if alliance 2 ships are not being destroyed and structures are not being incapacitated should unaligned kills in system mean anything aside from that the continuous presence of alliance 1 and corp 1 should by itself contribute to destabilizing the sov of alliance 2 by deterring alliance 2s use of the system but should their presence alone be a factor itself could alliance a blob alliance bs system and eventually flip it why not gaining sov and keeping sov are two different tricksyour scenario also begs a few questions what is alliance 2s response to alliance 1 how does alliance 2 have sov establishedlets say the minute alliance 2 responds to the presence of alliance 1 and corp 1 alliance 1 and corp 1 leave or log off what does that mean could that be interpreted as the route of alliance 1 by alliance 2 lets say alliance 1 engages alliance 2 after accruing all those corp 1 kills but loses why not interpret either of those cases as alliance 2  alliance 1  corp 1 basically nullifying corp 1 kills value to alliance 1 if alliance 1 defeats alliance 2 whats the point of all the corp 1 kills if corp 1 never engages alliance 2 how could you compare alliance 1 vs corp 1 against alliance 1 vs alliance 2 also i think alliance 1 vs corp 1 should have signs of being statistically useless and theres always the petitionif alliance 1 and alliance 2 are rarely online at the same time in mass how should that resolve should it just balance outif alliance 1 successfully blob flipped alliance 2s system what happens when alliance 1 leaves what alliance 1 or 2 structures are left standingif a system is razed and deserted it should return to sov zerowhat if alliance 2 gets alliance 3 to fight alliance 1 and alliance 3 is defeated but there is no game mechanic to associate alliance 3s loss to alliance 2s sov
giving an alliance the ability to online a cynosural jammer might make it easier for smaller alliances to claim space it could mitigate the threat from getting hot dropped while establishing a foothold
this seems rather interestingas for the conquering of the system i think it would be best if it was kept per alliancethat means if you have 3 alliances defending a system owned by one of them and 4 alliances are attacking it kills or losses by the other 2 defending alliances do not count also kills by the 4 attacking alliances are counted each for it selfthat would mean that alliances that actually bring ships can earn that space not some filler pets
then need mechenics that you need say somting than you will be left treue the gate in 00not suported
i agree there needs to be a way to be more secretive about your movements in this game right now realistically there is no way to sneak up on anyone and it is far too easy to have perfect intel on other people and fleets
i originally thought of this as a response to the mittanis thread about greater null sec independence where there was a lot of focus about the reliance of null sec on the jita market but i got thinking and thought it might be pretty cool idea in its own right so to give it a wider viewing i thought id put it up in its own thread to be shot at the problem appears to be that null sec players are massively reliant on the jita market and there is a perceived logistical nightmare involved in this a solution would be a trade hub that is smack bang in the middle of 00 space i envision something like mos eisley welcoming to all the worst best elements of eve life a place where the local faction eg guristas police the system similar to concord in hisec but where having 10 standing doesnt matter the system would be entirely isolated from hi and low sec space so that the only route in would be through 00 for subcapitals i would propose that cynos can be lit just like in normal 00 to jump in jfscarriers etc which would be the main avenue of getting the local market going a system like this would always be camped to hell so i would suggest that 3 interconnected systems be selected with plenty of gates to the wider 00the systems would be at least further than a single jump for a capital ship from the nearest low sec and close to the heart of the faction space one such trade hub for each of the main race factionsis this a good or bad idea at present i live in a wh and dont pretend to know much about 00 mechanics or the wider implications of this idea
there is a trade hub smack in the middle of 00 its called jitatrolls aside there is no middle of 00 being that its a ring around highsec i believe there are a couple of stations in 00 that are open to all chribbas station comes to mind but i also think almost no one goes thereif there was a 00 station open to all that actually had a hub going then youd see campers on the undock 247 just like jita except able to bubble the undock and kill everything
quite the opposite the problem is that it is easier and cheaper to get a couple of jump freighters to jita buy a large amounts of equipmentammo and jump it back out to the alliance hq than to mine and build said equipmentammo out in 00 it doesnt work that way ccp didnt make any of the current trade hubs we see today the players did and they chose it because jita is pretty much the center of the eve map and sorta close to every other highsec trade hub
risjk vs reward to high for industrilist tho bring eny goods there if sytem get camped noone wil bring there eny houler or fregts with goods for sell ther can be done somting about tit to fix this idea one ting can help you cant atack eny feregt or houler witouty him atacking you first in eny surcenstances he even cant lok them that that can work but now this idea for industrilists ho shuld bring goods doewn there is useles
what
a couple points about nullsec trade that you need to be aware of first the goal is not to create a new superhub like jita even if it is in nullsec the goal is to move a significant amount of the industry into nullsec and thereby negate some of the nullsecjita dependence the way of life at the moment abc ores and moongoo from nullsec are shipped to jita producers purchase these and build shipsmodules which are then put back on the jita market then nullsec consumers purchase the items in jita and ship them back to nullsec reasons why stuff is not built in nullsec 1 most production requires an enormous amounts of lowtier minerals appropriate quantities of the minerals are typically not available locally 2 t2 production requires several types of moongoo as well as datacores decryptors and bpcbpos all of which are typically not available locally 3 the number of nullsec production slots is very limited compared to hisec 4 there is a lot of extra risk in nullsec logistics can be intercepted poss can be destroyed outposts can be conquered 5 the local demand is often too low to quickly move inventory in other words once you build a ship you want to quickly sell it or your resources quickly become tied up in inventory once items are produced in nullsec local markets will reflect local production this is in stark contrast to local markets now which are primarily created by importing jita goods and selling said goods primarily to bluesas such the most appropriate suggestions focus on providing building materials locally and increasing the production rates and efficiencies so nullsec industry has better returns than hisec industry which is appropriate since nullsec has much more risk
it is called vanity for a reason and it is a proven fact that people will fork over serious cash for the smallest increase in prestige ipod is mediocre mp3 player at best but sells like caffeine pills at exam timewhat ccp needs to do is get more cheap stuff up in the store and get the mingling part of loiteringinstations released  nothing more nothing less
good post georgiksome of the carebear suggestions in this thread are fkn hillarious system wide decloak afk tag hahahahhaa just learn to always be ready for a fight if you cant defend the systems youre in at all times maybe you should not blob supercaps to hold 150 systems that you dont have the numbers to defend all at oncein short grow a pair
yawn i think plopping down a cloaker and just sitting there is not quite a sign of big balls either but enough of that talk about someones miniscule or nonexistent gonads some people really have to heed their own words theyre spouting as stated in my previous posting
afk cloakers have nothing to do with balls they are not there they are neutralit is the carebears who are all about lack of ballshonestly if this topic was renamed to please dear ccp i am a little girl and eveil person in local is making me pee myself halp i would support it

yaya always be ready to fight right unless you are cloaked in a safespot because then you are 100 invulnerable and unprobable and dont need to be ready for a fight you can go afk until your mom turns your pc off because youre running up her electricity bill
hey hi hello you seem to be one of the disillusioned masses i think we can both agree that your alliance is afking in your space just as much as anyone else i dont usually play this game i just log in hit a single button and inevitably wait for my mom to pull out the plug when she vacuums but how is being cloaked in your space different then your 12000 member alliance hiding their ships inside the 12 outposts andor the countless poses that you have in cynojammed systems i do remember seeing the words invulnerable on many of those sov structures if invulnerability is an exploit well then i guess your sov structures need to come down but i think were really getting to the heart of this problem you were given all this space but not really told what that meant so when someone comes in uninvited you yell to condi for help but of course the goons are busy actually being proactive in their space so they wont come save you from the one cloaked probing alt perhaps with time your keepers can come down and teach you how to hold space i mean honestly fountain is just goon renter space anyway but im happy that you got your name up on the map im sure your internet spaceship friends thing thats really something that strong rallying cry of were our own person and dont need mommy condifor most thingsdont expect to have 6vdt in december winter is coming
and allow outsiders to visit the bar casino etc to do trade etc
in long term you pay for fuel even more then out post out post dont need fuel pos need

moved from assembly hall
personally i think the csm is doing an ok job sure theyre null sec alliance bigwigs but they do speak out when  hits the fanif you followed csm blog posts you will see they do they might not be able to say as much as they like due to nda but theyre working on thingscan it be done better imho yes i think it can im even considering to stand for elections and campaign for a seat as industrialist
i beg to differ as far as ive read and heard the csm is widely regarded as an institution catering mostly if not entirely to the whims of the big 00 alliances true or not i cannot and wont discuss it here but that seems to be the general perceptiontake your usual hisec carebear and yes that wording does nothing to counter the aformentioned perception if he shows some interest in politics even that alone is a step ahead he would think that voting for one or another wouldnt change anything for his own lot in eve so why bother
some interesting perceptions what exactly do you think goes on behind the scenes of a csm do you think there is a bloc of voters who squash down empire or wormhole concerns you think we act as a type of eve illuminati trying to crush dissent and push an agenda over the screams of those not part of the 00 bloc sadly this isnt the case but it would sure be funwhat happens in reality is we all hang out on two persistent skype channels one with just us one with a bunch of devs who we get constant communication with we are constantly discussing issues that are close to us or issues brought to us by our constituents my constituents are anybody who emails me with a questionconcern btw and we tend to hit each other up for more information if its a subject were not really well read up on having two step in the group has been a huge boon for example since most of us dont have a whole lot of experience with wormhole issues and we tend to borrow insight from him a lot when we want to bring up something informally we can chat directly with the ccp devs who handle that particular area or if we want something more formally discussed we can post threads to direct a topic over a more structured discussionthats why its so bizarre when people try to paint insane conspiracies that 00 is somehow taking over the csm when all we do is add our voice to the overall discussion which by the way also includes your voices in the speakers corner and other venues we are lobbyists we are advocates we are a face to face voice to help explain the players complaints or help ccp come to terms with parts of their game that need a lot of work of which they have a blind spot if you feel your issue isnt being brought up effectively have you taken the time to contact one of the reps to help give it some traction to date i think ive received maybe 3 evemails along these lines and thats it if you think that a purely highsec advocate would better represent you then i encourage you to get them out there and start campaigning now so they have the name recognition to get elected
that rather begs the question fun for who it certainly wont be those people being ignored by the csm look we have the words of a number of csm delegates assuring us that they are only interested in supporting the aspirations of those people who voted for them thats not a conspiracy theory thats fact as to the question of a bloc trying to nerf the interests of hisec i can only speak for myself but yes that is exactly the perception that i getas it happens what you suggest in the latter part of your post is exactly what some of us in hisec are trying to do not me personally i have a number of issues that prevent me from standing i dont think that i have a high enough profile in any case we are organising a push to make sure that the interests of hisec are adequately adressed so its nice to know that hisec has not vanished off of the radar of the csm but i would much rather have candidiates expressly chosen by hisec residents to represent me in the next csm
greetingsi have an idea to make hybrid weapons versatile and somewhat unique so since blasters and railguns basicaly work the same way the difference is blasters extract the plasma from the canister of the ammo while railguns fling the plasma filled canister at the target they could be merged into one weapon system hybrid weapons would have two operating modes short and long rangeuniversal attributes fitting requirements energy consumption overheat allowed ammunition mode specific attributes damage modifier fire rate optimal range falloff range trackingso what do you think 
ok ill bite why then should people in hisec not care about what happens there surely it is in their own interest to make sure that they get the most out of it if you are saying that because they do not want to be in hisec but feel they have to because of all the perceived disadvantages involved in having a pure 00 existence that they will vote to increase the benefits facilities and opportunities in nullsec even if that means nerfing the chances of other people in hisec whs and so on two things come to mind 1 that these actions will have no unintended effects on the balance of the game debatable in my opinion 2 that it seems a little like cutting off your nose to spite your face are people in 00 so contemptuous of carebears jealous or insecure that they need to have everything that the other sections in the game have along with all the benefits that being supposedly a pioneer frontiersman sort of character brings such as the ability to run capital ships pos sovereignty on systems etc i just do not see why the fact that others choose to play eve as they wish should be a threat sure being in hisec is comparatively safe but as you already have aknowledged it does have its drawbacks and restrictions rightly so in my opinion it would not be fair to other areas of the game if it did not but if players choose to remain in hisec with all its drawback then surely they should take an interest in what happens there and fight hisecs corner if need be
if your going to argue this subjectconsider the following1 have you ever mined in a whs system for abc ores2 ever try to move that  out by yourself3 ever do so without any risk invovled no local means no visual verification your not alone 00 means all bets are offif you think its just too easy and it warrants abc oresthen you truely are naive as you are stupid
edit ive expanded on this quite a bit in a post on page 2 preserving this post just to be sure no ideas are lostive been trying to figure out how to make lowsec a more compelling place to be making it rewarding and productive without removing the risk of getting out of highsecthis idea borrows from the control bunkers of factional warfare to be clear this would only affect nonfw systems the way it works is that a corporation or alliance would capture a concord outpost holding this outpost would act as a sort of semisovereignty and make members of the corporation concord deputies any deputies in system would be able to see gcc events on their overview allowing them to respond to acts of piracy in the same way concord does in highsec if the person who drew the gcc moves their beacon moves with them as always pods would be exempt from being targets under gcc also anyone with a sec status under 5 is fair game to deputies at any timedispatching gcced pirates in system would net you lps with concord based on their security status the lower it is the more lps you get also putting a multiplier on existing bounties might make it more attractive obviously someone could build a 10 character and pop rookie ship after rookie ship to stack up lps there would have to be something to prevent this sort of farming ccp knows far better than i do what sort of mechanics they could use to prevent this if it cant be prevented another reward system could be useddealing with abuse of powerdeputies violating concord rules by podding gcc offenders or attacking nongcc or nonoutlaw players would need to either be directly attacked by a speciallydispatched concord response or labelled as outlaws any corp with outlaw members would have a fixed amount of time to eject those outlaws from membership or face losing their deputy statuscorporations with average security standings below a certain number should not be able to capture outposts if their status were to drop below that threshold their deputy status is immediately revoked they would however be able to neutralize an outpost if they were able take control from the occupying deputieswhy i came up with this lots of people want to play the good guys in eve but there arent many options to do so its hard to make the distinction in null and highsec doesnt really allow you to participate in enforcement  lowsec is boring this might spice things up a bit by creating larger and more organized battles this would make a good mechanic for drawing out people who arent interested in the current mechanics of faction warfare and nullsec sovereignty it might even create a pathway into null for alliances who decide they want real sovereignty it creates a new way to play in the sandboxideas suggestions for improvementsclarifications flames bring it on 
sorry i just couldnt resist making this the first topic here p
afk cloaking ist a wonderful thing
so how win will be afk cloaking once they remove local 
afk cloaking is the best
afk cloaking for ceo111eleven
never stop afk cloaking
what wrong with it
if they are afk they can do nothing to harm you
how can i cloak without touching the keyboard please help i am stuck
use the mouse
someone afk cloaked in a wormhole once noone cared
seems to still worki recommend nerfing it such that one can only cloak when fkaa
to get a serious rebuttal in earlyif you fix afk cloaking theyll just use a macro to stay cloaked if you prevent that theyll make a dozen safe spot bookmarks and run a macro to warp between them 23 hours a day if youre that afraid of a lowskill alt idling in your system they will always be able to get you to keep your head downthose of us who have spent a lot of time in wormholes arent accustomed to the luxury of knowing who is in system and continue to do our work without that sense of security some people seem to need and we can carry on for months without being gankedbecause we learned to be safe without the crutch of localno im not advocating for nullsecs local to be removed im fine with it being there i just want the people who really do seriously whine about afk cloaking to get a reality check and understand how good they have it with their sovereignty and their local channel

supporting graphical change not a mechanical one though
wis and more rp type things so players and corps can mingle together corp only rooms so you can hang with corp without having noobsrandoms ruin the rp experience
hi csmcan you put some pressure on ccp to deliver the station environment with similar functionality to the old one like they promised more than 2 months ago thanks
intro as far as i know the current warp effect is at least 4 years old i believe it is time for a bit of a visual change in that areamy idea is to replace the current get up to speed and slug into warp with a more punch like effect as demonstrated in the following 4 videosmy first two examples are from the 2009 star trek movielinkagelinkage  imagine a titan or other capitalsupercap class ship performing the 2nd warpmy next examples are from the game mass effect 2linkage  skip to 218linkage  skip to 210finally it seems that ccp has almost pulled this off already in the incursion trailerlinkage  skip to 120i appreciate you taking the time to read my proposalalso keep the suggestions coming id really like to see this become something that mostly everyone can agree on and thus get it passed by the csm
improves both game realism and visual style pair this with a new cyno effect and eve sex forever
you mean like the many new effects that ccp said where coming from there new effect guy months ago that we have heard 0 about sincenebulascynoswarp tunnelsengine trailsgunnery effects
you know making effects is hard work have to get it right this  takes years you know especially if you also need to code stupid rooms and fluffy dresses
inb4 ccp hate bandwanvm latesupported 1
ccp was talking about this affects for ages and nothink was done but yes with designing clothes and putting them into game not much space is left
punch it
thoundth fathinating my butt hutth leth already two thumbth up 
very interesting  tweaking needed of course but intriguing  and controlling the bunker might let you for example  gain protection similar to a pos shield so you could do some mining out there
might make antipirate alliances more viable
ee vere is tuhumbs up they not puted n here that i suport this ned soem theeking sutre but how idea its very verry good
this is a remarkably good suggestion i strongly recommend it to ccp for making things in lowsec interesting
this is one hell of an idea 10
excellent idea to populate lowsec more
1exelent idea
umad
you stupid1 i like the idea
the problem is that afk cloakers once there in system are almost impossible to catch unless there idiots no way to scan them down no matter how good your skills no timer that runs there cloak out or cloak cool down its just click and step away and cause annoyance for locals if it is my system shouldnt my sov have some form of intel upgrade or station ping to uncover said afk cloakers or atleast make it possible with enough skilled pilots
the only thing we really need is a module missile or bomb that when cycle releases a tachyon burst that decloaks targets within its area of effect in games im not so big on things that dont have counters and the cloak currently fits that in eve
protip it isnt your systemcloakers have counters theyre called balls be alert go about your business bring a friend use dscan and keep your eys open want to afk while mining too effing bad youre doing it wrong and deserve to get poppeddamned whining kids wouldnt last ten minutes in a hole in my days we didnt even have dscan you had a buddy sit on the front of your ship with a pair of binoculars and we liked it
yes yes and ligts a cyno and there 60 recons and sb apears near you  then wath your 1 bilj ship gos boom and your frend  in ass wil never come again help you  in this case your tip its junk noting els
so the cloaker wasnt afk after all
circular logic works because circular logic works
wouldnt you just use the same control that you use to select things that appear on the overview including coloring so a red flashy battleship is a 3 pixel red flashy line on the overview and a corp member frig is a one pixel green line or whatever
synopsischange jamming mechanics fromz  xy toz  2x2xyx  jamming strengthy  sensor strengthz  jamming chancediscussionlets skip the deeper questions and implications with regards to jamming and keep this one simple jamming is supposed to be chance basedhowever this is not the case with the current mechanics once the jamming strength of a jammer becomes greater then the sensor strength of a ship jamming is no longer chance based jamming becomes a given taking into account the bonuses from modules rigs skills ship bonuses thermodynamics and gang bonuses especially from the recent move towards posed up t3s jamming is no longer chance based for the vast majority of ships flown these dayswhile the existing mechanics worked when jamming strengths of any given module were typically less the half that of the sensor strength of a ship they break down as the jamming strength approaches and eventually surpasses the sensor strength of a ship firstly as the jamming strength approaches the sensor strength of a ship small increases in jamming strength will have a huge reduction in the chance of the target avoiding being jammed for example a vagabond being jammed by a falcon with an ecm  phased inverter ii that has a jamming strength of 12 has about a 14 chance of not being jammed if the falcon takes steps to increase the jamming strength of its ecm module to 13 the vagabond now has a 7 chance of not being jammed so approximately an 8 increase in the jamming strength resulted in a 50 reduction in the chances of a vagabond avoiding being jammedsecondly as we continue the example above and the falcon takes yet another step to increase the jamming strength of its ecm module to 14 approximately a 7 increase we now find the poor vagabond has 0 chance of not being jammed unfortunately jamming strengths of 12 13 or 14 are not that unreasonable and ultimately a falcon or rook can get nearly a jamming strength of 18 out of its t2 racial ecm modules that means such a ship would be guaranteed to jam at 100 almost every battlecruiser and below with the exception of some recon logistics and caldari shipsnow if we revisit the examples above with the proposed change we find the followingvagabond  14 sensor strengthjamming strength of 12 21221214  63 jamming chance 37 not jammed jamming strength of 13 21321314  65 jamming chance 35 not jammedjamming strength of 14 21421314  67 jamming chance 33 not jammedjamming strength of 18 21821814  72 jamming chance 28 not jammedas we can see in this revised situation two things happen the falcon is not longer guaranteed to jam the vagabond every time and as the jamming strength of the falcons jamming module increases we see a more reasonable corresponding increase it the jamming chances
look at it this way life insurance pays out for every type of death except suicide anytime someone gets concorded their insurance should be invalidated also i think insurance premiums should be adjusted based on sec status the lower your sec status the more you pay the higher your sec status the less you pay this means you will have to also take into account how they recover their sec status as they could just get the status up again before insuring a ship the lower your sec status the lower the benefit you get from your ratting make it take much much longer to get it back to good standing
by that logic afk players in stations should be ejected out into space in their most expensive ship right next
i endorse both proposals of this thread

id like to see ccp make the industry index a hidden value its already easy enough to disrupt mining ops broadcasting your mining systems to the universe makes it even easier soon as you hit industry level 1 its like blaring gaudy club music that draws every guido with a cloaky ship to fistpump straight to your mining system and hang out until industry goes back down to 0 or they forget why they came its like being the lone hot chick at a nude beach full of frat boys and lecherous old men and as soon as you doff your top some guy with a bull horn jumps up behind you and screams tittays tittays tittaysidkwtf this farms and fields idea is but i think mittani is slightly wrong in stating that nullsec is entirely dependent on importing virtually everything from jita and exports only moon goo obviously we do import nearly everything from high sec but we do this because its cheaper there arent too many things that highsec can provide that we cant get out of nullsec datacores faction ammo pos componentsthe problem is that it makes no sense for us to mine minerals out in nullsec when we can just farm havens and use the bounty isk to buy a significantly larger amount of cheap minerals from highsec than we could mining it ourselves in nullsec with mountains of reds who want to light us up the same goes for lowsecthe only real answer i can think of is either increasing the yield that a miner can get from lowend ores in nulllow sec or decreasing the mineral yield of highsec ores and t1 reprocessing or maybe we could have a new mining ship for your average peon miner ie not a capcommand ship that is only usable in nulllowsec that will mine something like 50 more than a hulk since we have to spend 50 of our time at a pos because hostiles are goosestepping through our system i think this is a fair tradei dont know i dont really think that dependence on jita is a bad thing  as long as jita is equally as dependent on us
posting gm logs is bad mkay if your issue has not been resolved escalate the petition or at the very worst case internal affairsi can guarantee that those broken plexes will not go viral like the nex store did

last night on eve radio myself trebor and mittens did an interview about whats been going on since the big emergency summit back in juneeve radio show linkageas a result of that just so its clear what i think about the current state of eve and where it should be going ive made a new blog postreality checkhave a read and ill keep an eye on this thread and respond as rl allows for the next few days thank you
ultimately you summed up the state of play today which in reality is no different than it was when this whole incarna fail business started jester seems to have captured what the veteran player base new when this whole thing started its good to see that the csm wants to rattle cages now at least but it is unlikely to achieve anything you may have had a chance had this process been led by developers the fact that senior management is leading the charge does not bode wellthe ccp business  senior management aspect to this whole affair was the most interesting aspect of the discussion on radio i cant see how ccp can reverse course if business plans have been made and loans secured on the basis of them and hence for the dust  wod development to just be dropped in fact ccp may find they have no option but to push harder to get these titles out the door its a bit of a rock and hard place syndrome still the idiots put themselves in that position in the first place its difficult to believe that ccp thought even for an instant that no development on the core aspect of the game that of fis for 2 and half years is  was a good idea just beggars beliefi will say saleene the csm have done what can be done we should thank all csm members for thatfly safeps am i the only one that keeps getting we were ganked every time i attempt to visit the new forums
sorry mate the csm started out as a gimmick to demonstrate transparency in ccp t20 did some shady things and the backlash threadnaught created the csm as a means to show the player base that ccp has cleaned up its act and that we as players could go and check up on them to some degreethe csm has evolved into what it is now but it didnt start out to be what it is
i like it whatever happened to the new shinys anyway
your avatar is supposed to be wearing them you didnt get the memo
i could get behind this that would be pretty awesome
thatd be awesomealso holy  i really need to play mass effect 2 if its anywhere near as good as those videos suggest
ive been an avid fan of this thread the many revivals and i think the new forums needs a copy of itbeen 5 years we just got walking in stations well sort of but can we get a decent pos now plox
confirming that ccp needs to update poss as one of the priority items would be cool to get out and walk around in one as well
along with this i would also include what changes need to be made to make bounty hunting a viable profession
maybe you could call it antipirate deputization in losec or something better editedi mean something better than antipirate duputizatin in losec
as for the subject of this thread i picked something that would get clicks so people might actually read it 
this is a fantastic idea 1 from me
if count heer was afk after siting in system like 2 weeks witout even not login in dt out seems to me that was bot that counts as afk if he is 90 afk then on his pc
non sarcastic solution every ship in a system thats isnt using an active module cloaks dont count towards thisthat isnt movingthat isnt chatting on localdissappears from local after 15mproblem solved maybe this is the upcoming changes to local in the works and im just profetic but what about bots used to stay on local used by afk cloakers you askwell botting is bannable and if miners can bot then why not afk cloakers if either gets caught they get banned oh lets make this only in systems in null sec
people who spend 23 hours cloaked in a system hoping to hotdrop are not making very good use of their timebut like in politics not every problem needs new legislation if this does need a fix the fix is simple make the cloaking module consume charges big assed charges like cap boostershigh ho silver awaaaaaaay
why shouldnt you be able to afk cloak usually this is because people want to be able to harvest isk in peace without bad people putting you on edge you want it safe so you can mine rat or run anomalies you dont want to have to worry about checking your scanner or split your profits by doing these actions in a fleet or mine with protection if you take even the simplest of precautions you can render afk cloakers completely ineffective but people just dont want to do that its a legit playstyle and already has an effective counter
i can in all honesty say that i have no idea what the hell you just saidlook the solution like ones actually needed to afk cloaking is simple well the solution is to be aware etc however a change they could make to eliminate the complaints about afk cloaking are simple in concept1 when you cloak you disappear from local2 when you cloak you also cant use local your cloak cuts you off in both directions intel gathering would need to be done actively with probes dscan or simply looking around3 to prevent cyno abuse when you uncloak put a delay on being able to light a cyno 15 30 60 seconds something balanced this would give cloaks more of a true meaning where youre actually hidden fully it would also put the intel gathering into manual mode instead of simply scanning local to see whos there it would also add to the sport for cloaked hunters they could be more stealthy in finding and engaging targets however it helps the prey by at least removing the threat of an immediate superdrop on their heads
as long as there is stationsposs there should be also afk cloaking station and pos owners have advantage over cloakers actually id say do not allow fitting ships in stations and poss only capital shipsi think enough said
the only place i see potential for this is null sec but it needs balance the balance would be that neither the people holding sov could cloak nor others in the system introduce the system wide anticloaking field like the cyno jammer
with my solution afk cloaker or heck a regular non cloaker going afk disappears off local false peace of mind for carebears achieved check afker moves or uses a module shows up on local and scares miners away effective dos attack which cloakers currently enjoy achieved check everyone gets what they want no adverse side effects to other cloaking ships like other suggestions to use cloak fuel seem to ignore
this must stay on first page forever
ccp give us plex for remap or just more of them 1yr is too longim happy to give you 3 plex for a remapyou will sell alot more remaps than monoclesi want atleast 1 every 6mo
m8 that makes so much sense that i have edited my proposal changing the segment from white to the same overview top category thanks
theres probably good reason most of you havnt suggested this but i cant help it dgive em cloaky warp if i could cloaky warp in a black ops bs id have one right nowespecially if you lowered sensor strength to account for the lawls pwn factor of having a 700 dps redeemer uncloak on youjst two cents and their probably not so shiny as some other suggestionssmall fleet pilot no intentions of ever joining the null blob cccp please realize just cause they can focus their votes doesnt mean they vote for us all
farewell to the old forums this being one of the better examples of what this thread is talking about  releasing new shiny junk in the form of the newpatchedupgraded forums that add a bit of functionality but are still far from a decent replacement for these ones for a wide variety of reasonsmost annoying part being user feedback that kept pouring for half a year was almost entirely ignored or not tackled yetbut were still forced to abandon these forums
the eris is in need of a cpu boostthe enyo is in need of a third midslot without being able to scram and web a target it is uselessthe deimos needs a big power grid boost a cpu boost and a 4th mid slot to bring it in line with other races hacs it should be able to fit neutron blasters as standard as well as a decent tank so that it can survive long enough to get into range and use them a mwd a scram a web and a cap boosterthe phobos should be given a drone bay size of at least 50m3 the hyperion is rarely used in fleets as the megathrons bonus to tracking are more useful than the hyperions bonus to local repping i would replace it with a bonus to damage resistance or optimal rangegallente ships in general need to be made faster and have a much higher rate of acceleration to negate the speed and agility penalties of armor tanking and still get into range of their target and bring their blasters into the fightthey should also be able to field more drones at a time than any other race as that is supposed to be their racial speciality i would suggest a maximum of seven drones for dedicated drone boats such as the dominix vexor and ishtar and six for others such as the deimos thorax megathron and hyperionblasters need a small reduction in powergrid requirements a small optimal and falloff boost a big damage boost and a tracking boost if a blaster boat gets into range of its target the blasters should tear the opponent up not do slightly more dps and then only if they are able to webify the target to keep them stillrailguns need a massive boost to alpha damage currently theyre like firing pea shooters where as they should be like sniper rifles long range deadly hard hitting but with a slow firing rate which they have and poor tracking at short range which they have there are many reasons not to use hybrid weapons they use a lot of powergrid and cpu they only have one damage type thermal the ammo takes ages to reload the weapons use a lot of capacitor power to keep running and they only work at extreme ranges please balance these out with some reason to want to use them
1 and supporteddefense contractors in evebaby my love is bomb come on the bomb the twist
1 tie the amount of lp gained to the value of the ship destroyed make a noobship worth 0lp since a noobship is literally worthless
lost my post due to timeout after 2 minutes god damn you ccp now i have to type againok here is my suggestion for such a system each solar system in lowsec has a police outpost each player that has a positive security status can come to the outpost and by providing some pirate tags or some other token item become a deputy for 1 hour multiple people can be deputies in the same system at the same time becoming a deputy starts a wage counter if during that one hour noone in the system gets a gcc or a outlaw does not enter the system your wage does not change if someone gets gcc or an outlaw enters the system you have to respond to the offending pilot in a certain timeframe based on security status of the system suggestion 40 seconds in a 04 system up to 3 minutes in a 01 system responding to the offender means doing at least some damage to him you do not have to kill him you tried perhaps he was too strong and you had to go away caution is the better part of valour in such forsaken solar systems if you fail to respond your wage is reduced by the ammount of isk it took to pay the insurance to the pilot that had crime commited on him not saving a battlecruiser is much worse than not saving a shuttle or frigate this might completely reduce your wage to 0 tought luck you are obviously not a good cop if you destroy the offending pilot you recive a bonus to wage equal to a fraction of the insurance cost of the agressor ship 50 at the end of the hour you are given your wage ammount can be 0 if you did bad but not negative the pay is based on the number of deputies in system probably best if a system similar to the incursion one is used so too many deputies or too few of them results in no pay suggested numbers for 100 wage could be something like 410 in 04 systems down to 14 in 01 systems anything more or less than that results in less wage what do you think people
just tweak it a bit to discourage blobbing like having all the lp divided evenly among the deputy fleet and ill fully support more carebears turned wanna be pvpers in lowsec please bring as many navy fitted navy ships as your can
this looks like something i can support 1
sounds too complicated i like the method described by the op better take an outpost police the local system lose outpost to either another highstanding corp or for being a griefer that simplei also like janos saals idea of tying the amount of lp given to the class of ship destroyed to mitigate farming
foksieloy wroteeach player that has a positive security status can come to the outpost and by providing some pirate tags or some other token item become a deputy for 1 hourno this does nothing to create longterm lowsec occupation or organization the entire point is to get corps and alliances operating primarily in low not to get small fleets going out there for onenight adventuresfoksieloy wrote becoming a deputy starts a wage counter wage theres never been a wage for any activity in eve dont start nowfoksieloy wrote if during that one hour noone in the system gets a gcc or a outlaw does not enter the system your wage does not changeso you can get paid just by cashing in tags and idling in an empty systemnofoksieloy wroteresponding to the offender means doing at least some damage to himan outlaw in a covert ops ship would be able to evade you and cost you this wage just by cloaking up and being in system outlaws evade highsec navies all the time by being in fastwarping ships bad ideafoksieloy wrotethe pay is based on the number of deputies in system probably best if a system similar to the incursion one is used so too many deputies or too few of them results in no pay suggested numbers for 100 wage could be something like 410 in 04 systems down to 14 in 01 systems anything more or less than that results in less wagethis means that a gang of 20 people could show up cash in tags and just ruin your day by diluting the wage too muchim going to reiterate my first line of this post the idea is to get people to live in lowsec not go out there for a little fun people go on lowsec roams now looking for solo and small gang fights compared to the pvp youll find anywhere else lowsec is a joke right now i want to fix that by bringing structure and purpose to it
and when hee apiers neerebly you than ups sorry game mechanics no way that needet hee nedet to be forced log off if not play
for short amount off tiem its okey buit fior days and months not okey at all and there is no countre mesures agens cloucked ships if didint know you cant see them in scaner if they warping to you they warping cloucked so this argumet of so to say legit mechenics not works then ned remove all cov ops clocucks thet chips can warp only visible but that was not proposal
and there need to be one ading if he tuches eny buton warp or wath eve he apears in local again in local and cant move 1 minet than this can work
actualy that wuld be fareast ting sov holder need to have some advanted agens tacker that he can use active defences not pasive like agest afk cloukers
can you please use spell check or google translateanyway im guessing you mean bots botting is not a cloaking problem its a banning problem handled separately
the old philosophical questionif a cloaker is afk in a system does he still make little children scared
m8 i not scared i manged to kil some off them with my pvp alt and when they trued to return to systme kiled them again i jsut wish mechanics that i can kil them noting els that he cant sit al the time in our sytems and getign intels and sdisturb industrialsit from working that to easy get in sytems and wait u ntil you have tright moment and strike that can be days months or weeks need put on them more presure that they to have some limitations
i i cant use spell checker he not gives aways right answers and i dont know how to writ that word right with i hear i write how i hear that word that the dificulty with english wting and sapeking not the same leters used so to say buggs around 
something to keep in mind theyre not your systems sure you may have the dominant force in there you may have sov upgrades etc however you dont own the system at best you currently control it if someone else comes in and decides to afk cloak tough crap they have as much right to be in that system as you do due to numbers sov etc you can do more thats the benefits of having control however hes as entitled as anyone else to be there even if its cloaked sometimes afk and sometimes gathering inteljust because you have control in the system dont think youre entitled to fluffy pillows and bunnies in space you still need the balls to maintain your influence and control if that one guy cloaked in there somewhere shakes your entire systems operations then perhaps youre not as ready to control it as you think
they do the cyno jammer they cant hot drop their caps and super caps in system of course you cant bring in reinforcements that way either but hopefully if you have a station in system you have the resources there to defend it as well
cloak selfcounters all you can do while cloaked is observe dropping cloak to do anything at all makes you detectableso your problem isnt one person afk cloaking in system but the sudden appearance of a 60man blops fleet when local suddenly spikes up 60 people it doesnt matter whether they came in via cyno or gate you do the same thing get to your pos and keep your head downtheres nothing an afk cloaker can do to you that someone bouncing safe spots or simply logging off in space and coming back later cant do it sounds to me like you just want to be able to rat and mine riskfree thats what highsec is for
glad to see your bad spelling is on this forum tooevil if i were creating the world i wouldnt mess about with butterflies and daffodils i would have started with lasers eight oclock day one zaps one of his minions accidentally minion screams

this thread needs more zest
i agree with floppiethebanjoclown looks like crusty the clown has competition in regards to the post made by foksieloy not only is it complicated but such complexity allows for griefing and exploitingkeep it simplealthough i got a question for the op when you said outpost to what do you refer to an npc station or a dead space structure that you stay close to like a pos frankly i would prefer the dead space format after all if there is ever an aggression undocking will take too long a poslike dead space structure is convenient because then you can quickly warp out in a shorter noticeeditperhaps a little fleet bonus as well with this kind of feature such as improved align time or improved warp speed ausec
im thinking of something resembling a tcu or the control bunkers of faction warfare didnt i say that in the op in fw you capture a bunker by putting it into structure i would treat this the same way only without the prerequisite dungeons this would let ccp recycle an existing mechanic making it familiar to lowsec dwellers and designers alike
ah i see i guess i missed that bit in the first post
i think this is a solid mechanic for players to fill the role of good guys really like the idea to have gcc events appear on overview for the deputies such a thing may be difficult to implement technically but its the best idea to incentivize anti piracy ive ever read
i was hoping to make it relatively simple reusing the control bunker concept and then the overview wouldnt be that different from a cyno field appearing on overview besides this is big enough that it would be an expansion in itself especially if they included their longpromised bounty system fix since it fits with the theme call it enforcementheres an idea just to motivate ccp you could make nex items that would require concord lps as well as aurum i bet some people would cash in a plex if they could get a concord uniform exclusive to deputies
cloaking is fine stop bitching
just remove cloakers from local in nullsec or remove local completely in nullsec  then at least it takes an actual botter to warp around afk and scare people  sorry to meld topics

id agree for if the person owns both characters of the name to be changed and pays a feeso long asprevious name has some kind of fault  clan ticker from previous games unintentionally rude breaks forums a ccp default name like amarr citizen 2109332new name has been owned by you for over 36 monthsapart from that i see no reason why people should be changing names asit would bring up the subject of removing the names of all the inactive charactersi could bring in the starcraft 2 system when everyone can use the same name but instead have 3231 or a random set of digits after it
allow a name changei like many others were in trial mode when i chose to pay for the game i did not know i would be stuck with the name for lifeyou either have a character red or you donta name change no a character makes no differenceif you have a character red you most likely have notes on them as well ie  stole from corpallow it once for all paying accounts  please
please dont neglect to click the like button in the upper right corner of the initial post additionally if you feel strongly about this subject please spread the word to your corp or persons you meet in your travelscheck in from time to time toomany thanks all of these will make a big difference in building up momentum for the cause
ccp has some decent reasons for not allowing name changes but the benefits to the player community outweigh the concernssimply listing the name change in the characterUFFFDs employment history would solve most concerns though it would require players to take extra steps to research historical data in some cases eg they would have to search market data for all names a character has held etc ccp could probably develop more comprehensive solutions similar to those listed by the op but im not sure itUFFFDs worth the dev timein any case ccp takes an alarmist stance toward name changes while character transfers are far more problematic imo a name change should be required when a character is transferred i dont necessarily want name changes limited to transfers but they should occur during a transfer at the very least
i support way of allowing name change providing provided that the new name could be traced back to old character name
but how will i mock corpmates who buy n00bpwnr01 if they can just change the name do not like
supporting the essential features akka searchability standings fee frequency
i support the ability to change a characters name i do have some issues with some of the options you listed in your posthowever ccp should determine the functionality of changing character namesfor all those who would argue that they cant track someone because of corp theft or whatever do you realize how easy it is to create an alt on an existing account yes you can require an api key or create a trial account and just start a new character doesnt take any skillpoints to be a corp thief i can buy another character just as easy so it seems like both of these are much easier ways to get around player identity than changing the characters namethis seems like the perfect opportunity for an infusion of money to ccp just like the now outdated money a picture change i would pay to change my nameas another suggestion you could create a new forum and require people to post there
yep agreeing with this mans comment
consider the debated feature character transfer UFFFD name changes should not transfer in the event of a character transfer reverting to the first name while preserving full name history andor no character having been transferred will ever be allowed a name change this is highly divisive but it keeps the character market level i believe this satisfies your issue
please do im assuing you had issue with the deabated features section  which is great because there is some really reactioanary stuff in there for clarities sake i added a statement following the title hopefully that gets my point accrossas for your suggestion  could you clarify im envisioning a forum topic where kinda like a newspaper it would have postings of recently changed names assuing i got it right it sounds worthy of being added to the debated feature section
as in this 2 year old assembly hall topic on the old forums

i think youre beating a dead horse here but what the hell in terms of investment vs return black ops are terrible they need love though as ive already said this has been asked for before
my support from the old thread
yeah i got that feeling 18 months ago when i was running the old topic for 6 months thing is this ship has aloot of fun possibilities a good quality kill is something thats real awesome and stics with u for the rest of your eve being its something different than noraml roaming something that could be more fun ect ect u get the picture its a shame that there isnt more stuff like that to do
t1 base stats as a minimum  kind of glasscannony at presentzero m3 maintenance array  ability to actually support the troops with more than the inout taxi servicelonger range both bridge and jumpnew ability to use ab while cloakedthat is near op but doesnt cross the line and makes them more than worthwhile to jump with the clients to the cyno

original threadwith the incarna expansion the original basic training tutorial known as crash course was updated and changed into  aura npe new player experience tutorial part 1 tutorial part 2 tutorial part 3 tutorial part 4along with that change 60 different event agents 15 per faction known as tutorial agents were forced into early retirement due to aura npe who has single handedly ended the endless battle missionthe endless battle2part missionthis used to be the new players very first real mission which could only be completed once per agent in the life of the character part 1 was a simple encounter mission against a single npc which when destroyed would drop a small specific item to be returned to agent part 2 was a simple courier mission to transport a small specific item to a nearby solar systema small amount of corporation and faction standing incurred for completing that the agent would then refer players to 1 of 60 15 per faction career agents for more advanced training on the various careers availablebasically the incorrectly named tutorial agents didnt give any instruction or information to new players other than refer them to the career agents the old tutorial agents were actually political liaisons for their specific faction those 60 agents were a good source for gaining a 1 time faction standing increasei propose 2 different options for the 60 tutorial agents 15 per faction and their mission the endless battle 1 simple and 1 complexoption 1 simplebring the old tutorial agents back out of retirement and change their title to political agents have them continue offering the endless battle mission with a slight change to their ending dialog so they dont refer players to the career agents currently done by aura npeoption 2 complexhave the new political agents 15 per faction split up into 5 different agent levels 3 agents per level from level 1 to level 5 have them all offer the endless battle mission series but have the mission difficultly and reward increased to match the higher agent levelsthese new political agents and their mission offers can only be completed once per agent in the life of the players character just like the old tutorial agentsthe code is already written and with some slight programming option 1 could be implemented very easily option 2 would of course take a little more time and work to implement but is still doablethank you all for taking the time to read this proposaldmc

dodging reputation evasion of consequence metagaming all bad things that come from the allowed practice of character transfers is only made worse with the addition of name changing until the priors are solved first lets not introduce more problems do not like
ugh eve should never have a name change facility bad ideadressing it up with what name changing intends to do is provide a regulated alternative to character transfers in essence reducing the amount of unregulated actions making eve more secure while actually improving immersion and blah blah blah does not make it a good ideado not supportjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
no
i dont think there is anything wrong with an alias change feature have an alias tab appear next to employment if you changed to a new alias the only thing is you only get to once and have to wait a period of time before another edit kind of like how you have to wait a period of time after to revamping your attributes the old link to your character name will redirect to your new onethis isnt going to change your standings or employment whats the point of making a stupid name paying iskaur for it i see no problem can be done since ccp edits namesbirth history fields with their tools
with searchability on old name there is no reason why this would happen the very very slight increase in ability to dodge reputation is completely negligible compared to all the gazillion ways already available if people would actually have reasons against allowing it i could maybe be persuaded they are right but the only ones disagreeing either have reasons that dont make any sense like this one or dont even bother with posting a reason
it doesnt seem rational to have a t2 battleship weaker than its t1 variant just because it can jump bridge a few ships or not have targeting delay when decloakingthe nature of such a ship is that it should be fierce in battle as well as an added special ability imo at leastfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet

seems that people still miss the point that afk cloakers may not be completely idle thats why i put afk in brackets but still can log the comings and goings in a system people ship types cartograph a whole system make safespots if local drops empty or everyone present is dockedall of that without any risk of being discovered thus contradicting their oftenused phrase nothing is riskfree on their ownso i have to state that again make cloaking limited somehow be it with countermeasures ship modules pos installations whatever time or resource limits cap fuel  butcloaking as it is has to be changed

ive added your suggestion but i was expecting youd write nothing if you wanted to keep all of the optionsnothing to do with how many sp someone has the question is aimed at finding out if people would be interested in playing if they only had to pay when training sp ie you could play for free but you couldnt train skills without reedeming plex and or paying subscription there are some interesting things that could happen with a system like this but a restriction like trial accounts you are restricted to how many accounts you can run at once would potentially negate some problems caused with a system like this aswell as making these accounts exempt from free aurum or reducing free aurum amounts compared to paid plexed accounts however this idea could help retain players andor get some new players so it could be beneficial to the game it would effectively allow some people to play for freekeep it up

i suppor thisim a fan of any visual improvements to the game they really need to be prioritized more often
i wholeheartedly support this idea this in tandem with removal of the acceleration time in warp like getting up to max warp speed and dropping out slowly would be amazing it would also boost ceptorsfrigs in that they could more realistically beat larger ships out of warp for properly tackle especially in systems with not much distance to travel if a ceptor could punch into warp and be max warp speed as it leaves grid then slams back onto grid on the other side that could make chasing hisec wts through gates much more interesting
yes
why if you cant make a simple rebuttal then you dont have a point to stand on try again
youUFFFDre pretty shameless to post all highand mighty when you couldnUFFFDt provide a rebuttal for that in the last thread then again iUFFFDd hate to suffer another of your soliloquyquits in this threadUFFFD
i would just like to see it as part of the character transfer system you buy the skillset and have to make a new name and portrait this lets toons be transferred without any drama following them
actually drama following the character is what has to be preserved name change is simply convenience for the player and should not have or have least possible influence on character identity trained character dont come out of nowhere but they should not be set in stone either
i see roll out the you cant make a rebuttle train on anyone who does not support your idea well done 310maybe this will do it for yaccp zymurgist said the following in this threadjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
fail name is a word its a handle its just a part a social pointer if you will of what character is changing name does not change who character is changing name does not suddenly point to some other characterbut if suddenly someone else possess character they become someone else and all the reputation will mean nothing because they start acting differently so name stays same but everything else is not same its exactly what already exists in game character transfersbashing down proposal name change on basis that it goes against games principle reputation matters while said proposal does everything to uphold the principle akka searchable history standings permanence and having functional game mechanic character transfers that breaks said principle is poor form
not fail a name is the characterif i am in a system and a name i recognize comes into the system its linked to my memories of that character and what reputation that person has with meif i have a name of someone who keeps trying to kill me on a postit on my moniter i can bugout if i see themallowing namechanges will remove that recognition from the gameand dont suggest list of aliases in character sheet i cant look up every person i want to look out for every day just in case they have namechangedjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
how do you know character wasnt transferred or even how would you know character was transferred as any available record can be faked so instead of depending on name recognition that doesnt work as you cant be sure that character is played by the same player why not depending on game mechanics standings andor improved awareness and tactics on your part to make yourself saferop proposal includes fee cost and frequency cooldown between name changes so you could still depend on name recognition just with a twist now and then which can be reduced in effect through standings
ones name is everything corp thieves can be identified using that as can reputation as a whole i know from entering local who people are known pirates etc i really dont feel like going over history everytime i see a new name corp history or akas do not quite cover itcharacter transfers tough luck if you buy a character youre supposed to do some due diligence on that guys historythe only thing name changes are acceptable to me is typos or capitalization and gms already allow that the former soon after creation the latter pretty much anytime i believeso nops this topic was discussed during csm 3 check the minutes to hear the arguments for and against etc
stupid forum ate my postcharacter transfers are reality if ccp could stop them they would they cantonly stupid thieves would go for name change as proposed instead of blank char transferchecking biohistory was is and will be intel gathering of choice with or without name changestop talking about some ideal eve talk about eve as it is
maybe so for you but i can tell you for a fact smaller corporations do check for background based on names thats how it isalso that still doesnt address the issue i pointed out if i travel in lowsec theres blokes i know are permacamping gates with sbing rokhs why should they get a free pass at a new namealso some people are known cyno scout alts i know from looking at them who they are without having to do some digging through history and former names and transfers and whatnotthe inconvenience to the many does not warrant the convenience to the few in this case you have a name live with itstill nope from me
please elaborate i dont see how doing background checks based on name is baddo you know everyone in eve not likely but if you do name changes wont affect you as you know everyone anyway if you dont you are already checking on people you dont know old players stop playing new players start playing eves not frozen in time also its not like suddenly everyone you know will change their name simultaneously and keep changing just in spitecyno alts are cheap they can be trained much faster than proposed name change frequency period
fw plexing can be the best way to get small scale pvp in the game it can i believe be the absolute best thing this game has to offer1 let players know when occupancy plexes are entered so they know where to find pvp and plexes cant be won by hiding from pvpthis could easilly be done by 2 dedicated channels one for the gallente caldari front the other for the minmatar amarr front this channel would just say cearain minor auga destroyer if i entered a minor plex in auga in a destroyer it would be nice if players could then set destination for auga right from the message no players would be able to post in these channels to screw them up2 remove the npcs from plexes pve and pvp dont mix well i wont go through all the reasons for this now but its true if this is too much for for ccp or players i would be fine if the rats spawned as described in post 14 below the idea is npcs should not be detering pvp like they do now here is the old thread that goes into this more in depth

i second thatfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
black ops are currently in the short priority list of things to rebalance so unless things go sour you can expect them to get better next expansion or the one after no details as to how yet ccp will reach to us when they get around to doing that particular one and ill then read your posts and the numerous other threads to see what interesting ideas were floated about
i am aware off this however after keeping up with forums for 25 yrs i need to see it first to belive it no hard feelings just experiance
tldr give remote assistance modules an aggression timer equal to that of the target theyre assisting rather than a fresh timer this eliminates rrdocking game abuses without removing the ability of a logi gang to withdraw from a fight by nonaggressionpresently logistics ships can assist combat ships without being hit with a combat aggression timer this allows them to repair gang mates without losing the ability to dock or jump lots of pilots have taken issue with this and for good reason the most common solution to this is giving remote assistance modules an aggression timer when they help aggressed pilots unfortunately this medicine is worse than the disease its trying to curea gang must be able to withdraw from a fight presently if a battleship shoots something they can cease fire and still run their local tank modules while they wait out their aggression they can shoot something and receive remote reps while they wait out their aggression and when the timer is done the gang logistics included can safely dock or use the jump gate the important part here is that you can still tank while the timers tick down  you just cant undertake offensive action now suppose that remote assistance incurred an aggression timer in the normal sense the logistics pilot would receive an aggression timer for repping an aggressed pilot this timer would quickly spread to the entire logistics chain via their capacitor transfer modules if these incurred aggression in the normal sense then these timers would be continually refreshed and the gang would not be able to withdraw without stopping their tanks for a full 60 seconds i shouldnt have to explain why that isnt a survivable optionsuppose on the other hand that remote assistance didnt give you a fresh timer but rather gave you a timer equal to that of the pilot youre assisting that is repping a pilot that hasnt shot anyone for 10 seconds would give you a 50 second timer this timer would still spread among the logistics gang  but it wouldnt be refreshed every time a module cycledif the timers worked as i described where you inherited the targets timer the logistics gang would be able to dock or jump out at precisely 60 seconds from their gangs last combat action  which prevents logistics pilots from being able to dock up immediately as described but also allows the gang as a whole to cease offensive action and still withdraw effectivelyplease make remote assistance modules incur a combat aggression timer equal to the the remaining time on the pilot theyre assisting
i support this ideawhere is the check box for support idea
i dunno i think you can just click the like button on the first postposting does bump the thread though
this would solve a few problems which is why it will never be implemented
ok so like and bump as i thought it illogical to not flag logistics at all but this solution really could work
if the csm accomplishes to get ccp to do any one single thing this yearit should be this
perhaps you could add pod killing being allowed for people with bounties this would make bounty hunting a viable option as well
if i were designing this as an expansion a legitimate bounty hunter occupation would be part of the package the idea would be to build it around the theme of law enforcement via pvp actionid like to see bounty contracts where you could issue a permanent contract to pay isk for the frozen corpse of a particular player regardless of their sec status this would mean that a corp or alliance could create internal contracts basically rewards for podding specific enemies public contracts would be possible as well it would be nice if the system could combine multiple contracts so that one corpse completed them all but if you had to choose who you gave the corpse to that would be fine tooi think you should have to register with concord as a bounty hunter and declare particular targets at the bounty office concord should only approve targets with criminal histories to be podded in highsec if their sec status is above 0 and theyve never incurred a gcc then you would have to suicide to get their pod and collect a bounty this would prevent abuse of the system for the purpose of griefing by getting permission to pod anyone you put a bounty on
eve enforcementan overview of an idea for a major expansion to the eve universedeputizing lowsecthis idea began as an effort to reinvigorate those areas of lowsec not presently used for faction warfare at the same time it was intended to give those players who want to be the good guys a way to participate in pvp with a feeling of purposethe core of the idea is this concord has taken an interest in expanding their enforcement into lowsec out of necessity they will steer clear of the established battlegrounds of the faction wars the problem is they dont have the manpower to provide the 247 enforcement that would represent a true increase in the security level of a system instead they have opted to involve capsuleers in the projectto this end concord places a concord relay station in each nonfw lowsec system a crs would behave similar to the control bunkers in faction warfare in that they would be captured by a corporation or alliance by putting them into structure if you need a reason for concord wanting you to shoot their structure to capture it lets just say they want to verify you can field and organize sufficient firepower to actually do the job a corp or alliance that holds a crs would then become concord deputiesany deputies in a system they control would see gcc alerts on screen and on their overview this would be similar to the way a cyno field alert occurs so long as the gcc timer is active on a player and they are in system a warpto beacon would follow them gcc timers in a deputycontrolled system would prevent you from docking at stationsunless you were in a podbut you would be able to jump out of system according to normal gate mechanics it would be possible to outrun depties for 15 minutes by continuously warping between celestialsrules of engagement deputies can only fire on known pirates people with 5 or lower and anyone with gcc timers pods would be exempt from gcc but a 5 security status would invalidate this protection and allow deputies to pod you on sightany deputies violating the rules of engagement will be attacked by a special concord fleet dispatched to deal with corrupt deputies abuse of power will not be tolerated corporate ceos would be informed via notification of any such action and warned that repeated actions by the same member would cause the corp to lose its deputy status three offenses by a single deputy would cause the corp to lose all deputy statusany player who has triggered such a loss of status will be permanently flagged an outlaw deputy by concord making it easy for deputy corps to avoid recruiting known violators corporations employing outlaw deputies would not be able to captures a crs only neutralize it this mechanic would be designed to minimize griefingentities with an average security status below 1 would not be able to capture a crs if they hold one and their average status drops below 1 they lose their deputy status and the crs goes neutral a negativestatus corp will be able to attack the crs and put it back to neutral by putting it into structurebounty huntingin keeping with the theme of law enforcement and being the good guys its time to address the inadequate bounty systemfirst to address the current issues  bounty can only be applied to people with negative security standings this means anyone willing to do a little ratting to bring their standings up gets a free pass on piracy bounties are tied to the character meaning anyone can collect them got a 5 billion isk bounty get a friend to pod you and split the cash better yet make an alt and pod yourselfi propose two major changes to fix thisfirst create bounty contracts remove the silly twoweek limit to contracts so that bounties can be placed indefinitely or at least for 36 months contracts can be to specific individuals internal to corporations or publicthis means that bounties can be restricted to just the people you want remove the security status limitation so that bounties can be placed on anyone allowing a corp at war to designate highpriority targets internally and attach rewards for killing them make the frozen corpse a condition of completing the bountysecond making bounty hunting a legal occupation in highsec as bounty contracts are not something you accept until you can deliver the goods corpse you would go to a concord bounty office pay a fee to declare a target which has an active bounty contract and then be free to pursue and pod them anywhereidea concord locator agents available only to registered bounty hunters who have active targets just a thoughtin order to protect people from being griefed by constant bounties being placed on their heads only known criminals people who have triggered a gcc would be valid bounty targets in highsec it would still be possible to wardec their corp or suicide gank them to get their podincarna stuffwe might as well accept that incarna is here to stay and incorporate it into our ideas for improvements to the game vanity items available exclusive to deputies and bounty hunters might actually generate some mt activity and give players something thats worth showing offthis would be a good way to test professionrelated info screens it would be kind of cool if your cq had a screen that showed recent gcc activity in a deputized system or bounty hunters could see relevant informationblack ops and assault frigatesthis is a bit of a side bonus which i think we could tie in to the theme by saying these ships need updating to support the lowsec operations and bounty hunting profession i wont go into greater detail on this here as there are literally years of discussion and debate on how best to fiximprove these
fun fact it said i had 1 character remaining then wouldnt let me post the above without a bit of editing it was orginally 5999 characters long when i was typing it in notepadin any case thats sort of an updaterevision of the idea wrapping it all together any suggestions on changesedita minor addition to the incarna section in bold nonbold part is to give contextvanity items available exclusive to deputies and bounty hunters might actually generate some mt activity and give players something thats worth showing off especially if you could have like a concord shirt with medals that would update the more pirate kills you got something like thatedit 2i should note that i meant to include that corporations should be able to register bounty targets with concord encouraging the creation of bounty hunting corporationsi forgot to add in the bit about an lp system based on successful enforcement by deputies i would possibly also extend concord lp rewards to bounty hunters given out in a method similar to what deputies get and only issued when they make kills on criminalsthe rewards part needs some polish before i include it as part of the overall plan
add a decloaking module with a fairly large range perhaps like concord have

instead of nerfing all super caps and eliminating capabilities why not make it so that titans and motherships use pos fuels to run strontium for triage or doomsday weapons and race specific fuels for powergrid and cpu im on an iphone so im keeping this short let me know what you think
how bout leaving them alone and making dreads better
it increases the tedium of using them certainly but youd probably find that people who use supers would probably only fuel them up right before battle and leave them empty when not in use more than that getting a steady supply of fuel is easy for a larger entity as you send your peons to mine andor fetch the fuel smaller entities on the other hand would have bigger issues in setting up supply lines
synopsischange jamming mechanics fromz  xy toz  2x2xyx  jamming strengthy  sensor strengthz  jamming chancediscussionlets skip the deeper questions and implications with regards to jamming and keep this one simple jamming is supposed to be chance basedhowever this is not the case with the current mechanics once the jamming strength of a jammer becomes greater then the sensor strength of a ship jamming is no longer chance based jamming becomes a given taking into account the bonuses from modules rigs skills ship bonuses thermodynamics implants and gang bonuses especially from the recent move towards posed up t3s jamming is no longer chance based for the vast majority of ships flown these dayswhile the existing mechanics worked when jamming strengths of any given module were typically less the half that of the sensor strength of a ship they break down as the jamming strength approaches and eventually surpasses the sensor strength of a ship firstly as the jamming strength approaches the sensor strength of a ship small increases in jamming strength will have a huge reduction in the chance of the target avoiding being jammed for example a vagabond being jammed by a falcon with an ecm  phased inverter ii that has a jamming strength of 12 has about a 14 chance of not being jammed if the falcon takes steps to increase the jamming strength of its ecm module to 13 the vagabond now has a 7 chance of not being jammed so approximately an 8 increase in the jamming strength resulted in a 50 reduction in the chances of a vagabond avoiding being jammedsecondly as we continue the example above and the falcon takes yet another step to increase the jamming strength of its ecm module to 14 approximately a 7 increase we now find the poor vagabond has 0 chance of not being jammed unfortunately jamming strengths of 12 13 or 14 are not that unreasonable and ultimately a falcon or rook can get nearly a jamming strength of 18 out of its t2 racial ecm modules that means such a ship would be guaranteed to jam at 100 almost every battlecruiser and below with the exception of some recon logistics and caldari shipsnow if we revisit the examples above with the proposed change we find the followingvagabond  14 sensor strengthjamming strength of 12 21221214  63 jamming chance 37 not jammed jamming strength of 13 21321314  65 jamming chance 35 not jammedjamming strength of 14 21421314  67 jamming chance 33 not jammedjamming strength of 18 21821814  72 jamming chance 28 not jammedas we can see in this revised situation two things happen the falcon is no longer guaranteed to jam the vagabond every time and as the jamming strength of the falcons jamming module increases we see a more reasonable corresponding increase it the jamming chances
gang links should only apply to the grid where they are active offgrid gang links these days are pretty popular with solo players and small groups that operate in a single solar system i believe that if a pilot and ship are affecting your ongrid combat they should be ongrid with you so that there is a chance to eliminate the force multiplier this is already the case with every other ship and module that affects combat unless you count assigned fighters  and in that case you can destroy the fighters to eliminate their effecti have no problem with gang links in general as ive been the beneficiary probably more often than the victim but someone ought to be at the helm and the ship ought to be vulnerable to counterattacklikely the main detractors will say that since a gang linked ship has to be uncloaked to provide bonuses it is vulnerable  but this isnt true if the ship is at a pos
i agree with this another role where you can be completely immune in pvp combat and yet still effect the outcome of a battle not really a good thing
i agree with this in principle however given the current fleet bonus mechanics im pretty sure its not possible to limit fleet booster effects to ongrid without completely revamping the fleet boosting system
1while the current system of offgrid boosting isnt as easy since unscannable ships were eliminated unless youre boosting with a neutral in highsec or hiding it in a pos it would make a lot of sense to require the boosting ships to be ongrid and ac
why the current system is limited to the solar system the booster is in i dont see why it couldnt be reduced further to only be for those ships it can see on grid
your proposal is based on a false premise namely that off grid ganglinks are immune to attack back when it was possible to make a ship unprobable it was broken as they had no risk beyond spies in fleet now however they can be probed just like everything else there is nothing stopping you from probing and killing them other than your own ineptitude some people do put them inside poss and although that blocks attacking the booster ship you can always go kill the pos instead it probably costs more anyways tbh
i appreciate that comment but i think we should leave it to ccp to decide what is difficult because theyre the guys writing the code if they say its impossible or would take months of work for a potentially small benefit then im content to let them work on something else
fair enough and to be fair so do i i fly black ops well i have a couple and would love to fly them plus i dont want that pesky cyno 5 skill i learned to be worthlessactually while not on the subject of the black ops itself but rather its use i think lowering the skill requirement for covert cyno generation to 4 would be beneficial to the use of the the ship once its bettered it would suck for those of us who have already invested in cyno 5 but would be nicer as a whole thoughts
do you really want to flood eve with covert cyno alts as well as regular cyno alts every time a skill requirement has been lowered for something we end up wading through neardisposable characters created to exploit the new requirementsbut i guess it could be done by making a much more sinister change increase fuel use of the covert cyno and the skill based reduction to make people wantneed cyno 5 or be forced to use either bo cargospace or recons fuel bonus if they need more than a few activations
ive already invested in the time for cyno 5 and if ccp made it easier for others to get it in order to bring more life to blops ops i wouldnt mind i already trained it expecting that it would take the time it didi just would like to do more blops ops without seeing it more beneficial to put large cargohold expanders and cargo extender iis in all the lows so i can act as a mobile jump bridgefight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet

1 for addressing neutral rrbaby my love is bomb come on the bomb the twist
technically this isnt so much a way of addressing neutralrr as its addressing rr in general an incorporation logistics pilot can exploit the current instantdock mechanics just as easily as an outofcorp pilot can this is really more about fixing docking games in which logistics pilots can dock up at any time without suffering from the 60second combat aggression timerif youre concerned about wardecs and outofcorporation logistics moving about freely until they get to combat then that will need an entirely different proposal such as lengthening the wardeclaration assistance aggression timer if this is a concern to you you should probably open a separate proposalif they appropriately address the combat aggression timer i dont think it would be particularly necessary people seem to confuse the two issues but they really are two very separate issues regarding how remote assistance interacts with aggression timers id suggest trying this first and seeing if the whining about neutralrr is really more just about docking games in general small changes first you know that said i wouldnt oppose such a proposal so long as it didnt negatively affect lownullsec logisticsedit heres a guideline for differentiating the two problems if it affects pilots in lownullsecurity space its not a neutralrr problem its the combataggression remoteassistance problem ive described in this thread if its an issue relevant only to wardecs and canflipping then youve got a neutralrr problem
this would be pretty good

i like the level of detail you went into very well thought out although i can imagine how complicated it will be for ccp to implement this idea since theyre way too busy with incarnahere is a question though if a capsuleer were to initiate the gcc how long do you propose for the flag to remain in their record before it is no longer on their record thus rendering them as inactive pirates personally i would say an entire month which i think is about the same duration as a kill right
good point the short answer is im not sure the first gcc event shouldnt last longer than a month but if you keep getting more it should definitely have a cumulative effect to the point that you are permanently branded a criminal and are always at risk of being hunted
op has a couple of interesting ideas one significant misconception about current criminaloutlaw mechanics and one mindbogglingly stupid suggestion that would make a lot of piracy essentially untenable by eliminating the ability to use safespotsspecifically the clause about anyone with a sec status under 5 being fair game to deputies at any time is completely redundant  its already the case that if your sec status is below 5 anyone can shoot you at any time without taking gcc or sentry aggro while not in and of itself damning the fact that the op felt the need to include it strongly suggests that he doesnt really know what hes talking about or what lowsec is currently likesecond the idea of a beacon for a gcc event is kind of interesting although also pretty redundant in a lot of cases since nonterrible players can use the dscanner to quickly find out where things are happening in system however the idea of a warpable marker that follows you wherever you go while gccd would instantly kill any form of solo roaming piracy because the ability to warp to a safedisengage after snacking on some hostile gangs bait or otherwise picking off a few of their members is fundamental to roaming pvp in general
the beacon would only be visible to deputies  not the other roaming gangs right
youre wrong about that currently i can go out to lowsec and pop and pod anyone i want if im willing to endure the loss of sec status and maybe tank some sentry guns i set up a scenario in which deputies are held to a higher standard in that they cant do that without provoking serious consequences then i added the exception that a sec status below 5 would allow them to carry out such an act without those consequencesyes its a bit redundant on normal rules of engagement but i felt the need to spell it out as i was rewriting those rules a bit for the good guys who would be taking on this role  this also i have already said in this thread it would be possible to outrun a deputy response by warping between safe points and celestials or even fleeing to a neutral system to wait out your gcc it wouldnt negate the ability to run to a safe spot to avoid retaliation it would just make criminals run from concord not just warp off and idlesome stuff that was brought up by a corpmatethere needs to be a way to abandon a crs or avoid capturing it if you dont want to be a deputy but dont have sufficiently low sec statuspeople with sec status below 5 should get their own nex goodies eyepatches anyonenondeputized systems should have penalties that make things a bit easier for piratesextra incentive for neutralizing the concord station stations have reduced docking radius and become kickout stations sentries have lower sensor strength and do less damage or maybe have lower rate of fire the question was raised whether drop rates could be adjusted to give pirates better drops in neutral systemsassign static bounties on each class of ship and modify it based on the pilots security status this bounty would be specific to deputies it should never be more than the difference between the price of a ship and its platinum insurance valuethis would avoid people making money by popping 10 alts in cruisers
thats an interesting idea and need more talkthe future system for boosters and capsuleers law may be close enough to use part of the code for this idea
i like the general idea but have several comments and suggestions 1 stick to one subject in this post fixing bounty hunting assault frigates and adding incarna bling is not really relevant these ideas will only sidetrack this topic and smother your main idea 2 i think your scope is too small controllingpatrolling one system is a little too limited and boring do you lose sight of a criminal once they switch systems for better results have bunkers provide constellationwide benefits at least perhaps expanding it to regionwide with multiple deputy corps thereby allowing multiple but limited alliances to patrol a single region if a corp feels they control a constellation they are more likely to patrol the borders and hunt enemies within multiple alliances increase opportunities for antipirate activity across multiple timezones 3 i really like the warpable beacon that follows the gccd player for the duration of their gcc ideally it should only be visible to concord deputies otherwise there isnt much of a reason to be a deputy as anyone can shoot a gcc player and they dont have to deal with stringent guidelines note this is best left as a double edged sword warping to their beacon might land you on an unprepared pirate or it might land you next to their deathstar pos this could also make deputized players very useful to lowsec fleet battles as they can always provide a warp in to the gcc flagged 4 it should be possible to identify the concord deputies in local just likes itUFFFDs possible to identify pirates and war targets 5 gccs do not prevent a person from docking or jumping all acts of aggression carry a 1 minute aggro timer that prevents docking and jumping if you use the transferable gcc to prevent docking and jumping not sure you can separate these two you will alter a lot of rr activities in lowsec considering that most lowsec pos bashes generate gccs for the parties involved the implications of preventing a gccd player from docking are too farwielding to support without serious further investigation 6 assuming you do agree with a multisystem patrol having a concord chat window that updates with the name of a gccd player and the system they received that gcc within your patrol area would go a long way to enable pirate hunting remember every time a stationgate gun fires on a gccd player their gcc is reissued and an update would be provided at first i thought this would be too much antipirate info but it could easily be used to divert attention away from some pirate strike or perhaps even lure some deputies into a trap 7 i think increasing the sec status penalties for deputies is the best option to deal with deputies that violate the rules if they have a 5 sec status and they pod a guy so what just have them take a bigger hit than a normal player 8 concord bunkers how can an existing concord deputized alliance prevent another wannabedeputized alliance from shooting their control bunker to negate their deputy status since both have high standings attacking each other would generate a gcc how does an existing concord deputized alliance forfeit their deputation i think you need a better method of deputizing alliances be wary though as you want only a limited number of deputiesarea becoming a deputy should be moderately challenging maintaining deputy status should require sustained actiivty and deputy status needs to be removeable somehow this is nontrivial 9 why are the faction warfare zones excluded
ignore this post
the afblack ops fixes i threw in because i want to see them happen and they would help flesh out an expansion which is the only way this could ever come about the incarna stuff is there mostly to satisfy ccps desire to have more incarna stuffi feel like the bounty fix fits perfectly in this idea its sort of a natural expansion on the whole law enforcement idea that is the core of the proposal the story would center around concords increasing efforts to make space safer not just around this idea for lowsecincarna rolled out in a few stages theres no reason not to do the same with an expansion like what i describe here a sufficiently large organization could easily take control of an entire constellation this system allows a smallish corp to take a single system and a large alliance to take over enforcement in significant portions of lowsec its similar to sovereignty just because you can have just one system doesnt mean youre limited to one i must not have been as clear in my wording as i thought yes the gcc beacon would only be available to deputies agreed a special tag would denote deputies agreed i forget how screwy the rr situation can be sometimes it would definitely need serious considerationi just dont want the criminal to be able to warp a couple of times and then dock up to escape deputies you would really just need to differentiate between those doing damage and those supporting themallow the rr to dock upjump as normal while making it harder on the real criminaljust an idea
this is exactly the sort of gameplay i want to encourage with a system like what i propose fair enough i agree it certainly leaves some questions open to an extent i feel like some of this design would have to be done by ccp they know what their vision for eve is they know exactly what kind of mechanics they can and will produce and frankly its their jobs  i thought somewhere in here i addressed some of that ill check backedit im no expert on faction warfare but its my understanding a corporation involved in fw can withdraw at any time dropping deputy status would work the same way i feel like maybe theres a small hole here somewhere that i need to fill in on how a corpalliance takes up deputy status and how to make it all work welltangential thought there needs to be something to encourage cooperation between deputy corps so they dont bicker over territory and that sort of thingas for taking control from other deputies i think i said somewhere in here that attacking the crs would not incur a gcc and from there it would be like if someone can flipped you if theyre shooting your crs you can shoot them but they cant shoot you until you shoot them sounds like i need to go back through the thread and pull my ideas together a bit more im already over 6000 characters on my writeup on this idea nowi agree that holding status should require a level of activity there would have to be some way of monitoring levels of patrols and enforcement similar to sov levels i supposefor the roleplaying aspect because concord is deliberately staying out of the empire wars they have no interest in attempting to enforce law in a war zone for obvious reasons it would be left to the local militias to patrol systems in which theyve gained controli thought the presence of the concord bunkers and the activities relating to that would detract from the faction wars also the inability to take out a neutral scout without risking the faction militia getting access to a gcc beacon on you for the next 15 minutes would be a bit too much the two systems need to be exclusive so they dont interfere with one another
hunting cloakiesmoved to features  ideas discussion forum
this mechenics i like and that its reale contre masure on thos clouckers
so where do i close my own thread  i think ive had enough of these afkcloak crybabies in here
damn something must be wrong with the universe as im actually agreeing with the goon what he said with bells on theres nothing wrong with cloaking what you fail to realise there is no difference between afk cloaking or active cloaking you dont if they are active or not active so what is the difference the threat is the same it seems like people just want to ratmine in peace in an area that is not designed to be peaceful at all
there is a problem if someone afk cloaks in a complex or whatever so it cannot despawn till downtime that is a pathetic thing to dothere is currently no way of finding them as they could be anywhere
find another plex another systemyes i do agree its pathetic but its easy enough to find something else to do youre basically moaning you cannot farm plexs with a afk cloakerfind a better system with more plexs in it i think the lastest patch you get 34 sanctums and 67 havens in a 08 system now youre getting one afk cloaker in your system he can only screw up one site
which is a general rule note the quotes that is superceded countless times by ccp and csm stating that cloaking is working as designedcloakers can and are allowed to do those things risk freethe only issue here is that it afkers keep system citizens on edge without any effort so the local chat timeout when not active solves everything while maintaining the intended usage of cloak as a espionage and psyop weapon when the user is active
i think youre kind of on the right track however why should a cloaked vessel show up on local at all it seems the device thats cutting off your ship from the entire em spectrum for detection purposes should do so immediately as well as cut off youre access to those communications systems when you cloak you leave local you cannot bee seen in local nor can you see local ie no free intel while cloaked requiring the cloaked vessel to actively gather intel also to prevent the surprise cyno have a delay before you can activate a cyno say 30 secs when you uncloak
sounds fun
leave cloaking as it iswhats the problem with ppl being cloaked and afki live in wh space if ppl are stupid enough to be cloaked afk then they run the risk of missing chars jumping into thier system and cloaking up which is good if you are on the hunt  and if they are stupid enough to be cloaked up in a wh that isnt thiers then they run the risk of getting trapped in a system due to the wh closing naturally or being closed by the residentsseems to me its the nullbears crying over this issue when they have local anyway
confirming that it is completely impossible to decloak cloaked ships
doomsdays consume racial isotopes upon activation supercarriers have not had the ability to triage since dominion jump portals consume stront and ozone carriers require stront to triage and dreads require stront to siege lets not forget that all capitals have to carry racial isotopes to jump aroundso yes capitals and supercapitals have to carry fuel its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
im not talking about one fuel type for jumping and the same fuel for a super weapon im referring to heavy water for cpu liquid ozone for powergrid uranium and coolant for the capacitor mechanical parts and oxygen and so forth this will allow those who have them to keep using them albeit more tactically and those who cry for their nerfing to be appeased because blobs will be much more taxing
thisthere are no stupid questions just stupid people ccp goliath wrote
and when i refer to needing fuel i mean like a daily rate kinda like a pos this way you have to log in at least once a week and fuel them up make a penalty for letting them go empty like an online delay i mean motherships and titans are close enough to poss to be treated like them and different enough to warrant slightly different rules onlining mods should take a long time that way you want to keep them fueled up and ready but keeping 100 of them fueled up and ready at all times becomes incredibly difficultlets be honest these things were not designed to be an end all be all to warfare blobbing these things ruins the game for everyone the ones crying foul are the ones who cant field these things and the ones who rage against a nerf are the ones who are guilty of blobbing them to the ones being blobbed on this crap sucks you work hard to get that t2 battleship or maybe you just joined the game and your little drake is your pride and joy now you dont get to participate in fleet warfare because if you dont have a nyx or an avatar you are useless to the ones doing the blobbing this crap is absurd you convince yourselves that you are the penultimate badasses of the game and only a short way away from being the epitome of might but you have never really fought a fight you drop 100 super capital ships and by comparison an almost nonexistent logi force that holds no skill if i got 100 brand new guys and put them on a bee line to nyxs and titans and they only ever logged in to update the skill queue and never had any experience i would have a 5050 shot at beating most major alliances in the game thats not skill thats luck on who times out first because the node crashed say what you want but the battle field needs leveling and this does it without taking power from the super caps
keep telling me what you think a good idea is usually born out of lengthy discussion thats usually how bad ideas are formed as well but yeah
any chance of making cosmos missions expired to be reavailable after a cooldown period only cosmos missions i cant beliebe i going to be stuck in king of the hill 7 forever whole mission arc nerfed forever
never really flown a jamming ship before but you seem to have thought this out fairly welli agree that the proportion to jamming strength increase vs chance of not being jammed is flawed i also agree that there should always be some chance to it but the proposed change seems like it cuts it back a little too far maybe get it to where a fully decked out falcon can jam 90 of the time and itll be golden either way until someone shows evidence to the contrary i think its a good idea like
currently the only chanced based ewar is ecm and personally i like that in some cases jamming somone is a given one of the major drawbacks of the skirmish based ships is that they are extremely vunerable to ecm while the more ewar specialized ships are capable of handling ecm also considering that most ecm boats have no tank compared to ships in the same class as them missing one jamming cycle very bad for your ships bulkheadsthe ecm fix is fleet diversity not a complete reworking of game mechanics not supportednot supported
ecms counter is stupid because i doesnt help you in any other way tbhto counter td webs can help slow target down so u can track plus they are awsome in generalto counter neuts you get out of range  plus these are highslot items  but cap boosters fixes thiseccm prevents jamming sometimes and yea 
jamming ships are not used in 1 vs 1 scenarios even if the falcon pilot in your imaginary scenario did engage that vagabond in a 1 vs 1 its massive 40 dps from his railguns wont break the tank on the vaga i just added the above to illustrate how stupid 1 vs 1 math writeups of ecm mechanics really are ye he can jam you woohoo then what you need to look at ecm in fleets where you have multiple ships engaging the falcon pilot there will not be able to jam all targets and will always be called primary target if hes dumb enough to be closebywhat im trying to say is that ecm is countered by tactics not modules
i have done 2v1 in a scorpion before and won only tank it had a an xlarge shield boosterit is possible and i have done ityou can easily 1v1 in a rook and to some extent a falcon its just people dontecm is counted by modules they are called eccm modules and they work perfectly finei dont think there is anything here that needs changing tbh
you could drop the doubling from your formula if you just doubled the base jam strength of all the jammer modules in the gamebut yeah i agree the current ecm formula is all special kinds of fubar i had previously suggested something with an exponential formula similar to the current turret tracking formula but this would work fine too
stop postingminmatar ships have quite logically  sensor strenght about only weakish point there if you dont like it fly something with better sensor strenghtbut then wait you would need to go and fly caldari or gallente in pvp hmmusual ecm whine i hear is from pilots who try to engage larger force solo how stupid is that
id like to see that double webscramecm tank  dps scorpion fit you used to kill those two idiots with
supportedoption 2 please
this ccp keeps removing good stuff they need to start putting some back in and this is they type of place to start why make so much of there previous work obsolete needlessly
actually i havent based my proposal on that premise at all ive based the proposal on the premise that offgrid assets shouldnt influence ongrid fights anything that influences a fight on a grid should be on that gridand honestly you can go kill the pos is a kind of silly response as you cant just go shoot the pos and stop the ship with links  you would have to go through the whole process of reinforcing it then coming back later to finish it off youve not stopped what i consider to be the problem youve merely prevented it from happening in the futurei expect the likely outcome would be that people would still use gang links this way but that theyd be out at 300 km from whatever fight they are influencing but at least youd know that your fight was being directly impacted by links
i agree as well with the idea of limiting the range of gang links especially in respect to mining ive been in 00 before and i have seen plenty of players park their rorqualorca alts in the safety of a pos while other mine reaping the bonuses not much risk there compared to the rewards of mining
what rewards
fleet fights would always start with primary the claymorevulturedamnation and the whole point of fleet bonuses would vanish into thin airfleet fights usually have command ships on grid though v0v its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
but i do believe that fleet boosters should not be in npc corps its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
also do people actually fly the eos because lol its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
mining in nullsec the reward of mining 6 jetcans of ore per hour minimum with a dedicated hauler alt going between hulks and rorqual
im not sure if the reason it is this way is because ccp dont want to have deal with fixing broken grids
maybe introducing module that prevents nongrid bonuses to apply kind of communication countermeasures
with reward you talking about reward its none almost spend time and noting els  dis days mining is worst profesion in eve max wath you can ern per hour is 25 milj mining arkonor bistot so tell me how the poor miner with such income will genareta back his lost rork how much hours its takes to mine so much minerals back to replace it with all fitingi not talking that evrage income per hour its verry poor that is 11 milj per hour with one hulk by perfect boosting by mining randome ores so for rorqual need to mine around 181 hours with one hulk so look numbers and befor posting somting calcualte how that guy will ern back that money and if there is eny good reward at allthis days ppl mining not for money eny more1 they minign for fun  to rest from hard work day2 they minign thatthey like to mine and chill in chats and voiceif wie wish keep 00 mining att al in eve wie ned to create buble around hiden belts that one shjip with guns cant warp in it that comes out form current mining incomes
the above post melted my brainhowever if you do that then people will just get better at gridfu and put the booster at a pos anyway you will see them in their wtf grid sitting at 100000km from your fight and the grid will earn its name again
this means that the whole fleet has to stay together in the system eg you cant have the heavy ships shooting a pos and the lights camping the in gatealso the fleet command ships will need to be reworked to be able to have buffer tanks comporable to the damnation the eos and the claymore will need to lose their lolrep bonuses in favour of some kind of ehp boost shield tanking fleet commands may also need their slot layout revising as the command processors replace tanking midsbeing required to be on grid would make t3 gangboosters effectively useless
supported currently with t3 ships gang links mean very low maintnence almost risk free alts and dont bring anything to the game beside spreadsheet statistics its not just about the pos its also about being almost unprobable
maybe what it means is that you need two fleets or that you need boosters in every wing or that you need to properly separate your squads or wings and have a supplemental booster with an appropriate ship this seems very natural to me and i dont know why it seems to be a concern for you you simply need enough qualified commanders and people who will fly ships with linksgang link ships can be made completely combat worthy command ships and strategic cruisers are renowned for their ability to tank sure they cant fit the most epic tank once you fit them properly with gang links but doesnt that make sensethat is a completely separate problemit certainly would not it would make useless ships useless six ganglink tengu anybody there are plenty of combat effective t3 gang booster fits and i see them used regularly you might even come to think of them as more useful because if the gang links have to be on grid what better way to make it less obvious which ship has them than to put them on a t3 and blend in with the other strategic cruisers it might mean you have to choose which bonuses you want which again i would argue is a good thing
by the way just letting you know that your suggestion encourages blobs its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
please expand on this maybe with three more oneline posts in a rowdo you mean that it would encourage fleets to be larger to fit in a gang link ship because i believe i am suggesting that the alt who under current mechanics sits offgrid gets replaced with a real player who is ongrid assuming a fixed number of pilots thats actually one less in the gang because there isnt a purpose for the alt anymoremaybe you mean that solo players who use link alts will become a gang of two thereby doubling in size clearly this cannot be allowed as twice as many pilots on grid regardless of whether they were in system before is most certainly a blobdo you instead mean that any suggestion about improving eve encourages blobbing because its a simple oneliner to get people to poo poo it because i have no argument for that
i see roll out the fraction train on anyone who doesnt support your idea well done 310 maybe this will do it for yaccp hellmar said the following in this dev blog
ones name is just a name  proof being how characters are transferedcorp theives can still be identified as can reputation as a wholeso youre saying you know every single pirate in eve by name if you have them set to red theyll still be set to red  and thats enough to know that they dont want to cuddle that covers itso yesps post a link because if this is the quality of arguement against it then theres no problem
they can still check for background based on names thats how it will be akain that scenario it doesnt matter what their names are  you fell into a camp and youre screwed anyway reds wil still be reds  obviously they arent camping for a suprise partycyno altsyour inconvenineces arent thought through in this case i have a name ill do something about itstill yup from me
there was a thread recently about someone cyberstalking a woman and her teenage son it was suggested that they sell their characters and get new ones that harassment would follow those characters giving someone the option to simply rename the character at the time of purchase would allow them to break that sort of behaviorif reputation is such a big deal in eve should you really be able to transfer a characters reputation when the rules clearly state you cant pretend to be the same person
a name is a character characters are transferableif youre in a system and a red comes into the system it is linked to your memories of what it means to be red and what reputation that has with you and once youre safe you can read up via akaand you wouldnt otherwiseallowing name changes will preserve standings in the gameyou wont need to also under the debated issues there is a mass mailing feature tell me what you think about thatnow what happens if that person sold that character and bought a different one now youre out of luck  better to have a name change than a transfer
cyno scouts and rokh bombers are relatively easy to train and can be bought on the bazaar for reasonable prices it would be nothing for those guys to jump characters now and have new names new sec status new everything and youd have to learn a whole new set of namesi dont know if others are proposing the ability to change names just whenever you want but i think it should only be during character transfer
my philosophy is this we can argue about the fine details later lets just work past this ignorance that name changing is going to cause the apocalypseill add that to the debated feature section
i think that the pros of allowing name changing far outweigh the cons and i am yet to see an argument in this thread that suggests otherwise the minor inconvenience that would be caused by checking a characters aka tab as you would with employment history for instance should not act as a barrier to add this highly soughtafter featurei feel that the op has accounted for all avenues where this feature could be exploited by indicating that name changing would bear a real cost  whether isk or real money not  aurum plz timelimiting the number of name changes much like remapping and incorporating an easily accessed tab in characters profile that will provide anyone in the eve community with an easy overview of the players previous namesunless i am missing a key mechanic of the game that would be broken by this action i simply cannot see the logic that would prevent the implementation of this feature
according to terms of service harassment is against the rules of eve any player that is harassed has all rights to demand that ccp protects them i wouldnt be against special actions for special circumstances think witness protection program but this is not scope of op
so we should change the whole system for a pathelogical case that happens once in a blue moon
this is exactly why you should not have been voted into the csm downvoting a good idea for a simply stupid and ignorant reason just reinforces my impression of you being an idioti am sure i am not the only one who feels this wayagreed with the op and liked if properly implemented this can be a good thing for both the community and ccp i personally have no problem with my name or any of the names of any of my alts but i know quite a few people who wouldnt mind changing thier names ccpthere is profit to be had here
if any such feature existed outside of the character transfer mechanic it should be cosmetic only in that a name change would not remove you from anyones contact list in fact id go so far as to automatically append a contact list entry with aka  so they easily know who theyre seeingi agree that in eve reputation is an asset and a major part of the game your actions should be forever tied to you however when a character is bought off the bazaar you are not the one responsible for that characters previous actions if you buy a toon who has scammed people for billions you shouldnt inherit all the hate that goes with it just because there wasnt anything google could find about themof course then theres the problem of transferring toons between accounts to renamenot sure how id handle that wiping out their contact list would be a startif you get a free pass off everyones contact list you shouldnt be able to keep yours
but then transfer becomes way to clear bad rep simply transfer your character to another account you own and get free card out of jail there is simply no way to know who is behind character thats why rep has to stay with character at all times
i would not support this unless it was extremely costly or could happen on a very infrequent basis maybe there needs to be a better warning when you originally name the character that this is foreverthe name in eve is how you are known and should be constant unless they come up with a heck of a lot more icons or some way to make notes on a character appear when hovered over in local i would have a hard time accepting the ability to change namesalso when recruiting this is going to add a lot more time and effort to check backgrounds forum searches on every name they ever used google search on every name they have used would make it harder to do a proper background checki assume each name could still not be reused so more and more names are going to be tied up which will lead to more and more use of stupid characters in the name making it even harder to search and remember a personoverall this is such a minor feature would require some serious additions to the game and add very little in return to gameplay let ccp concentrate on more important matters than intorducing a name change mechanism
as to my suggestion ao name change forum similar to the character bazaaran easily searchable forum where when a name is changed you have to postsample postname changed from anewb to noob end sample posti think it is unnecessary but everyone seems to believe they can stalk the person whom first podded them based on their character nameif you are so scared about people scamming you then dont accept characters that have had name changed seems like a simple policy to mesample policyrecruitment note  we will not be accepting characters whom have used the name change feature within the last 6 monthsend sample policyi propose that everyone for this ability demonstrate how easy it is to scam those whom are against the ability using one of the other ways like creating a trial alt creating a regular alt buying a new charater using the character transfer hire someone to do it or become a corp thief with your main i think that covers it but im sure there are other creative people out thereon the issue of lowsec pirates maybe check their sec status check local and see if anyone has gcc seems like a whole lot less work than remembering a dozen namesive had several characters over the years and most who knew me then still call me by my origional characters nameif reputation based on character name is so important to you then dont chage your name
this crappy forum ate my original post anywho here is a quick summary1 if it was isk yes i agree it should be very costly if it was real money it should be no more than a character transfer fee is currently for example and again no  aurum thnx i would also go as far as supporting a 24month timer on name changes2 instead of icons alerts and airhorns going off whenever somebody that had namechanged jumped into system  how about an aka tab in the character sheet if you have the person set as red you are likely to double click them anyway if they were unfamiliar to you likewise i would support a contactlist update when namechange is made3 background checking should not take you more than a couple minutes more with name changing allowed on 12 or 24month basis also please do not work on the assumption that everyone in eve will instantly change their name if this feature was implemented4 i agree that not having the ability to reuse a changed name would decrease the pool of available names to new players but bear in mind that having the ability to have 2 alts on your character is probably a far greater namepoolsink than namechanging could ever be again not everyone will instantly use this feature and pay  to change their name knowing that it is a purely cosmetic feature however having the option to do so may allow some players that bought characters or would like a change of their name for superficial reasons to do so5 i am no dev but adding an aka tab in the character sheet and updating contact lists when a namechange is implemented does not seem like an awful lot of work as everything else remains the same even if it took some more significant implementation the earning potential of this feature should certainly be an inticing factor for ccp
which is pretty much what i said in the last line that you cut out of the quote and the one misgiving id have for implementing this at allof course its also quite possible to purchase yourself a clean rep now by simply selling your toon and buying a new one if reputation is so critical that no one should ever be allowed to work under a different name alts shouldnt exist and we should all have only one identitythis getscomplicatededit im going to take the slippery slope down the reputation must be maintained line just to show how far it can go dont think im trying to invalidate the argument i just want to show how many ways reputation is diluted nowwe shouldnt allow name changes because reputation is very important but toons can be transferred and sold meaning a person with a bad reputation can buy a clean toonwe shouldnt allow character transfers at all because people shouldnt be able to get that clean slate but a you can have multiple accounts one with a good reputation and the other doing all the bad stuff sometimes to friends of the good guywe shouldnt allow multiple accounts because it allows you to do things without them impacting your reputation but you can create three toons on one account so they can still do that just not at the same timewe should restrict accounts to one toon per account but if someone ruins their own reputation they can biomass and start overwe should stop the ability to biomass toonsthe only way for reputation to really really matter is for you to only ever be allowed one eve character if you can biomass you can reset your reputation if you can make alts you can engage in nefarious activities without spoiling your good reputation if you can trade characters you can buy toons with good reputations regardless of how youve acted for yearsim not advocating for a world where we can change our names for free whenever we want im just saying that this idea that your name is somehow forever tied to your actions in eve is a myth
would be too easy and it makes cyno 5 useless it would be interesting to up the cyno req for super capitals so it does matter if the cyno 5 char dies this would make sov warefar more itneresting it is an annoying skill but it does kinda gives u a feeling of satisfaction i have 5 toons with cyno 5 soo if it get removed i would appriciate a skill point compensation if i want to keel l5 i just assighn sp to it tbh i rather see the ship buffed than skills lowerd
whilst studying them and getting ready to use them i have these tidbits1 covert ops cloaki dnot care what anyone says this is the black opswhats the point of having a covert ops fleet if your main jump bridge cant warp while cloaked itself its got pisspoor offense cabilitiesno one uses it for attack little gank to be had itself its not going to be overpowered unless your a insanely overbearing carebear who goes not far when it comes ot afk cloaking2 longer range on the jump drive its very shortfuel is little to nothing in storagecapaciity would be nice if it was kicked up a little bit higher than it is nowbut not really caring to much on this3 lack of gank these ships are just good for one thing bridgingand breaking cyno blockades thats it wahts the point of a black ops battleship if you cant shoot worth a damn to begin withso yeahwould like to see some fine tuning to be sureif it gets covert opsremove the speed bonusbattelships are slow as hellnot that big of a deal stop the evemail spam
what the crap are you talking aboutthose pictures are all from eve if you want eve to look like that stop being afraid of losing your ships and actually pvp no one cares about pve in eve and if you do you are playing the wrong game
ok i respect you opinion now can you please let the people who cares about pve talkand sorry if i was misleading but i mostly meant that this kind of background should be more often in missions  incursions but other than that i dont understand your argument it sounds lame
this is different i think and if true i havent experimented with the mechanics should probably be revisited if you can actively counter me and i have no game mechanic with which to fight back then this is probably deserves some game mechanics tweaking if its just a matter of some guy in local hiding so it keeps you on edge learn to deal with it
its true i tested my self out if you run lets say sanctum and there enerbly you cloucked shiop sanctum not respawning hee stays there untill that cloucked ship warps away ader ting here is meny posts that smal entatys wiling to live in 00 etc how you see smal entaty pl live ern isk in 00 if they have like 23 systems with no sanctums at all and best hevens ant there is clouckers afkers hoo sit in al 3 systems they have no where to go some one sad leave system he cant there in second allaince system is again the same so all allaince gos down or wath i tink that to easy to break wiling to fight or actyualy no isk to fight with enemy and you stil wish mechanics for samm alliance to take foot in 00 if they will have no posibility to ern eny isk at all if some one say that no hapens so not true i saa my self that hapening
if you really want to mess with hotdroppers fit a cyno on you ratting ship dwhether or not you really have a capfleet waiting to back you upand i would suggest having a way to organize bored cap pilots into doing this when they want them seeing you stop and open a cyno when they tackle you is bound to make them think twiceof course it might just end with you and a sb sitting at 30km from each other trapped by your cynos staring at each other waiting for the other guys hotdrop to arriveedit i want to request a feature for the forums that rejects any post that has fewer that 50 recognizable words

i prefer common sense solutions to todays problems give the dd a one in four chance of self destructing your ship also let hostile fighters dock with your supercarrier and upload a virus much like the great space ship documentary independence day which causes your shields to dropi hate supercaps so much
surely our ships arent macos compatiblealso replace fighterbombers with frigs and let hostile frigs be able to dock with you and wreak havoci already like to carry a force of marines a janitor and some exotic dancers in my ships unless i think its a suicide mission
adding statistical information to the listings of planets colonized under the planetary interface tab would greatly assist pilots by allowing a quick overview of important detailed information regarding the installations on the particular planet listedthe csm could request feedback regarding which particular overview information would be most relevant such as remaining extractor program times current storage capacities and installations idle etcwith ccps as i understand philosophy of helping players cut through processes in order to get on with what they want to do the current iteration requires a pilot to double click the planetary interface entry in the science and industry window enter the planetary interface in order to assess the status of their colony even when no maintenance is required as such this is a very inefficient method for this user interface and it really should be improved uponthis sums up my suggestion and i hope it is minor enough that it can move to the top of the to do list for ccpregardskass
this is a good idea it would be nice to check the pi just like you do your manufacturing jobs
ewar needs a look over in general all types including ecm ecm is way more powerful and preferred compared to the other types of ewar ewar could use a rework to make it more interesting mechanic than it is now
ecm is only preferred in fleet engagements when i do small gang work we much prefer tds to any other racial ewar types  as they effect the most ships and dont require a special hull to be used for high effectalso neutering a races recon line is just plain wrong why would anyone risk a falconrook for a chance to be effective fcs want to know that things are going to work if it isnt they might as well bring dps
ewar is really only overpowered against people that dont take the time to understand the mechanics of it and cant think outside the box when encountering itoh gawd a falcon i cant do anything to a falconthe only real change to any ewar module that needs to be looked at is making sensor damps stacking penalties less destructive to the effectiveness of the module when compared to others tds ecm
the reason it encourages more blobbing is because practically no one is willing to sit in an unarmed ganglink ship in the middle of a fight especially if they are heavily outnumbered if you did put the link ship on grid in well say a 2 v 10 fight including the link ship the very first thing that would happen is the other fleet would nuke the ganglink ship or drive it off grid and then subsequently crush the lone combat shipcurrently it works a bit different in the right hands the boosting ship is reasonably safe because that 10 man blob didnt bother to bring a prober all 10 of them are also obsessed with km whoring so no one brought a link ship of their own either as a result the lone combat ship on grid facing off against the 10 man gang is able to kite them or in some cases tank them at least for a while and put up a decent fightlike it or not off grid boosting is currently about the only thing keeping solo and small gang pvp alive remove it and anyone thats alone is just cannon fodder for the 30 man bcbs gangs with full logi support and a cyno to titan bridge in 500 more if needed and they wont hesitate to use it all against a single nanocane if they can catch it the only counter to that blob mentality is to stay out of hard tackle range so they cant all pile on you so easily and it by no means makes you invincible either all it takes is a single rapier on their side and theyll blob you to death regardlessi believe boosting is working as intended and to change it as proposed would be a serious blow to the game as a whole the absolute last thing this game needs is changing mechanics to favor blobbing even more heavily
id actually love to see the stats on pilots sitting in logi and command link ships inside npc corps actuallyive always been a big proponent for ending neutral rrcmd boosts in hisec and the like but then incursions pretty much solidified that that mechanic is here foreveri can definitely get on board with this idea though and i come from the position of someone that actively takes advantage of this mechanic im all for a nerf since it would make for better balanced pvp
UFFFD because a 1 v 10 fight wouldnt have simply squashed the lone combat ship offgrid booster or notim not sure what point you were trying to make there at present flying a logistics or ecm ship in a fleet means you get primaried those ships are still used in combat as to your assertion about unarmed ganglink ship wouldnt forcing link ships ongrid encourage people to explore fits that dont try cramming 6 warfare links onto one paper thin hullwouldnt it be interesting to have squad wing and fleet commanders all providing boosts of some kind
pretty much this although your example is a bit flawed a more reasonable example is a 15man gang you have a wc 5 claymore in the wing command slot and everyone else is in cynabals vagabonds huginns and lachesis an erebus is dropped on the gang and the claymore is doomsdayed the lachesis and huginn pilots are revealed to be spies and proceed to point and web their buddies so they can get taken out one by one by the maniacal titan pilots gunsa 20man gang in sniper hacs take out the claymore before the other ships can burn to them the longrange tackle bonuses are gone and they just go home because being kited is boringthis example is probably unrealistic but i really cant think of anything better right now its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
no as previously mentioned this would break gang bonuses stop trying to remove legitimate features of the game and think of ways to add more features
just a thought but maybe a compromise would be that only command ships can pass gang links in fr om off grid means you could have offsite boosters but only if there was a command ship in the squad ongrid to pass down the bonus from higher up the chainit would maintain the flexibility of fleets that are spread out over a solar system but increase the vulnerabilty of a squad using offgrid boosters you could destroy the command ship and effective cut the chain of boostsedit by command ships i mean both command ships and t3 ships with the command subsystem
you are assuming that the fix made it easy to probe down fits specifically designed to avoid it  max skills rigged and implanted coverts if you want any hope in hell of doing it any sort of respectable timeand what is your combat ships supposed to do while your prober tried to nail the t3 somewhere in deep space i still have 60au bms in small systems because offplane does not include updown according to gm  that is the reason for blobbing you need the extra 4050 to make up the difference that a booster provides unless you have one of your own  because one does not jump into a system and waits for a ready opponent to sacrifice their links nor will the opponent give you time to find the blasted thingswhich is a huge part of the problem and why such a change is going to be damn hard to push through people have simply become accustomed to having one ship augmenting 250 heres an idea instead of having one supergimped flimsy and toothless linkship with 46 links you combat fit them complete with tanksdps and either chose which advantage you want or bring more than onelets look at another very common force multiplier can you imagine how broken a guardian having a systemwide aoe rr field to tending an entire fleet would be  doesnt matter if it was made of tissue paper and the size of a moon on probes it would still be broken beyond comprehension  that is where offgrid links are nowsolution commandships have been needing a onceover for a while increase the tank of the link platforms slightly and change what needs to be changed in regards to the links info link lolz t3 command subsystem changed to decrease signature slightly and allows for two links right off the batit will have a severe impact on some solo pvpers but then they are not really soloing any more than they are with failcon alts neut rr alts orca alts etc  so screw them
honestly this whole proposal sounds a lot like i cant fly a certain type of ship and i feel that because of that no one else should be able to have something better than what i can use because thats totally unfair type of proposalbesides whats already been stated id only support this if grids worked 100 correctly 100 of the time ive been in fleet fights before where i run off grid at somewhat random locations separating fleets in abnormal ways in those cases id rather not be penalized gangbonus wise for something i nor any of the other pilots in fleet can change
i agree that there needs to be a warningyour name is not constant see character transfers and alts  theyve been around forever and the world has not endedif youre even considering doing a background check on someone with more than one or two aliases youre doing it wrongmost of these names will be changed for a reason  theyre undesirable to some it may be minor to others it may be essential roleplayers or even encouraging to continue paying and playing people with unfortunate names  no matter what the case it is profitable
does an ingame name identify a corp thief or the avatar that a corp thief was playingif the avatar is no longer owned by the real person who committed a theftis that avatar under its new owner still a corp thiefthe name of the avatar tells you absolutely nothing about who is playing the avatar and with how easy it is to transfer a toon the history you think you know about an avatar is ultimately meaningless
this is my third attempt to post in this thread keeps going wrong everytime i click post just deletes what writtenon black ops i would like the jump drive range to exceed the jump bridge range on thembridge range would be capped at say 65ly but the jump drive range would be not double but close leave at thatnow if bring recons or something with black ops can jump bit further with themif only black ops can jump to a covert cyno to hot drop someone further awaywhen i first found out that black ops couldnt warp cloaked i wasnt impressedbut when i was in my first black ops fleet i realised that they dont need it

1great idea that needs some work to make sure its balanced and not exploitablebut thats the job of the developers no
we have people always try to push people to go pvp but they generally failwe have people helps noobs and carebears about isk grinding and enjoying the pve but a lot of these noobs finally goes pvpthink about it if you were them will you follow your order such as stop being afraid of losing your ships and actually pvpwho cares if the game is boring they just quitif the game is fun they will try to find some more
eve pve is dull making it look shiny is not going to change things
making the game visually stunning is always something of a priority for ccp theyve been consistently updating and improving the graphics in the three expansions ive seen released if you read the dev blogs they routinely talk about graphic improvements alongside gameplaynow if youre suggesting make it prettier be the top priority for ccp i suggest you kindly keep your ideas to yourself there are a lot of things that will make this game more fun to play instead of just looking at itpve wont ever look like that because you dont see pve fleets larger than about 10 ships pve is usually fought at range and the play style for pve generally has you spend a lot of time zoomed out and looking at tiny icons instead of seeing the scale of the shipswhile im not one to tell you to go pvp if thats not what you want to do in this case i think its true the epic fleet battles and inyourface visuals are in pvp because pvp naturally produces more of those images

i agree kassasis we need a lot of improvements in pi it seems to be the bastard step child of eve right now imoi have read csms saying that it is irrelevant and tedious well i would also suggest that if ccp wanted to make it more than just a sideline waiting for some kind of dust interaction why not make pi a real profession give us some more complex interactions many more long term skills that if trained would give the pi player a lot more to do and a lot more to profit from the point i supposes is that right now everyone can do a little pi and make something actually just enough to screw the real pi player out of a good profit make it a real profession is my point i think also make the primae actually useful just a thought loki
jams are the most powerful ewar in eve this is because they prevent all external actions a ship can perform eliminating the ewar they provide the majority of their dps and their tackle to balance this jams are supposed to be chance based the truth is though they are not chanced based on a significant number of ships i think that your formula is off as it gives too much improvement to unbonused jammers and deminishes the jamming bonus gained from bonused jammers i think a much better formula would be chance to jam  min 096 xy this way there is always a 125 chance of missing a jam but you maintain the current jam strengthsignal strength balance
you can read this however you like but know that most fleets i participate in have gang links present i certainly do not want for more links anybody is capable of putting links on a ship and parking it in space or next to a station or in a pos its much harder to make decisions about what links work best with your fleet while still allowing you to survive on the battlefield so its not about what i cant do its about what is a silly mechanic as has been pointed out already by people opposing the idea nobody wants to fly a combat ineffective link ship  so nobody does instead the job is shluffed off onto alt instead of making it a role so easy an alt can do it why not make it a role so interesting a player will do it
wut you forgot to add logic to your post i point out that the only fleet command ship able to stay on the field in fleet fights is the damnation you say that fleet command ships are supposed to be tanky then admit that the rest of them arent tanky enough but thats not a problem when were proposing forcing them to all be on gridactive tanking has been an irrelevance for fleet fights for years it seems to me that when youre proposing a change to fleet command ships work in fleet fights then a look at the ship bonuses might perhaps be a very unseperate problem indeed
you can twist and rewrite my words all you want but that doesnt mean i said what you want me to have said also just because you have a fleet fight doesnt mean you instantly have to have a fleet command ship just because the word fleet has been used in both instances capacitor boosters are not the same as shield boosters just because they are both postfixed with boostersi say that active tanking is a separate issue because it is an issue that needs to be tackled with more classes of ships in mind than simply command or as commonly happens needs to be tackled by simply choosing the ship that works better at the moment in the same way that you might choose armor over shield i have seen claymores sleipners damnations vultures legions lokis all used as gang link ships to good effect  on grid and in combat i have never seen an eos or astarte because information warfare links are silly which again is a separate issue that affects this issue but is not the same as requiring links to be ongridit also seems to be a littleknown fact that you can use battlecruisers to provide gang links
10v1 isnt nearly as one sided as you might think when solo i typically fly one of the following ships1 arty cane2 curse3 rapierall of these can orbit at 30km and fight effectively with a loki booster alt the arty cane does 550 dps 4k volley and is pretty cheap the t2 disruptor on it has a 34km base range and 40km with heat it also goes over 1700ms without heat ensuring its among the faster ships out there excluding frigatesthe last one i lost was attacking an obvious bait and this scenario is pretty typical these days it was a myrmidon sitting in a belt just waiting for me to attack i was the only other guy in system but i knew he had at least an absolution with him sitting one jump away knowing he couldnt point me back easily i warped in at range and attacked i held about 30km off and slowly worked him down he was active tanked but sooner or later hed run out of boosters i was hoping hed call in the abso to save him that would have been a nicer kill instead they threw a proteus with a faction scram at mei was able to hold range for a pretty long time and had him worked down to low armor despite his 200k ehp tank unfortunately i drifted a little too close and he got the scram on me at which point all his buddies piled in and took me down in seconds however that proteus was likely very worried as i had him down to around 10 armor when i popped a few more volleys and i would have taken him down with me or possibly even gotten away if id had a wingman i dont think there is any question that i would have won and this is a case of me losing such a fight typically i score a kill or two and then escapethis thread really does look like a case of you just moaning about being unable to use the ship yourself off grid boosters are very much a field leveling tool they allow you to take a small weakness in an enemy fleet composition and convert it into a huge gaping whole that a heavily outnumbered force can pull a victory from the loki  nano ship is the simplest and most obvious example but a well flown active tanked ship  appropriate tanking bonus booster can be just as effective if dpstracking is the opposing fleets weakness
so it all boils down to link ships cant survive ongrid as numbers increase wonder if there is some other ships that are viable in large fleet read blob scenarios that can field ganglinksall capitals except loldreads are designed to field links how is that for buffered ongrid link platform for yousure they dont have the command efficiency bonuses to give that extra 10 but with proper skills theyll still be more than enough to turn a battle around hell up until the afk t3booster scourge you still saw regular t1 bcs running around with links
yawn do all the csm just post and run
which timer is usedin a big brawl with say ten guardians all interconnected via captrans but repairing 34 different targets  which timer is transmitted though a logistics chainif it is the highest then one person who missed the disengage order can strand the lot of them when the dps vacatesif it is the lowest then you can decloak a covert for a single cycle and the whole chain is aggression free within a few seconds
itd be the highest if an idiot who ignores the disengage order keeps firing then everyone either has to stop assisting him at which point their timers begin to tick down or he has to stop shootingif you cant coordinate your gang well enough to extract yourself then thats on you
heres an idea to prevent docking to escape the deputies you said yourself that we may as well accept incarna and start incorporating it in our ideas i recall a dev saying something to the effect of there will be no combat in stations for now that leaves me to believe that at some point there will be that possibility how about if youre currently under a gcc deputies can dock and incapacitatearrest you and if you resist kill you would be a tough decision there keep warping and risk your ship or dock and try to hide from deputies with stun guns and rifles there would have to be something done to make the risk of docking at least somewhat appealing say having no beacon on you in station and your gcc expires faster deputies would only get a photo of your face like a mug shot so you could hide in some dark corner or something to that effect just throwing it out therethe entire concept is of lowsec enforcement is probably one of the most compelling ideas posted here in well ever and i fully and completely endorse it my hat is off to the op for coming up with the first real idea for rejuvenating lowsec 1
i would support thisthe thing is you will never see those kind of stunning displays in actual pvp fleet action its always lagged to oblivion with swarms of drones around and blobs of tceccmamp effects butchering whatever remains when you turn off brackets if ccp alleviates lag fleet size will just increase until lag is again achievedsome pve eye candy of what we dont get to see in pvp isnt exactly a bad idea obviously those will have to be just lcos for window dressing since actual people would produce lag and warrant extensive gameplay change for pve
it will change things for the beginners in the game they are the ones who suffer though the visual dulness fest i say stop making station environments shiny only for a few weeks period and start making the outside environments shinier just give it a little love baby
the more efficient and refined the pi interface the more likely wider participationulimately those who actually know and use pi  particularly those like myself that produce tier 4 products know that pi is not just a dust 514 sideshow ccp made a great decission moving the old trade goods to being player made commodities and unless or until these commodities become obsolete then pi is an important fledgling industry in new eden that devs nor the csm should ignore
supportedon the pi tab i would like to see whats being extracted whats being produced  weather extractors are running or not
the fluffers solution to dealing with a falconstep 1 get a droneboat with a drone link augmentor and decent tankstep 2 set drones to aggressivestep 3 land on fieldstep 4 deploy a full flight of warrior iis hobgoblin iis or valkyrie iisstep 5a lock up the falcon when it appears on field and send the drones to attack itstep 5b if the falcon locks and ecms you first no worries your drones will automatically engage it anywaysstep 6 waiteither the falcon will warp off because its taking too much damage falcons have lol tanks unless they give up some ecm ability for better shields or it will diethe same solution can be used against rooks as they are pretty squishy too but you need a better tank as it can actually deal damage
this is a great idea and it covers both sides of teh problem supported
bump because its needed
agree  bump lets go  do it  hello
this is one hell of a idea i came in here expecting to make fun of you op but you are right this is not expected a change like this is what low sec needs right now and i really doubt pirates would mind this because it gets them fights i mean comon just picturing now a solo raven attempting to play sheriff would be amazing kills but the idea goes beyond that another method of earning iskis pvping is never a bad idea and this adds a new life to a otherwise boring dead part for the most part area of eve
i sincerely hope that ccp notices this post and seriously considers implementing this or similar systems lowsec really is just a jokeon another note lp concord store anyone concord battleship blueprints yummy
cloaking in system disrupting an enemies isk making capacity and killing occasional stupid people is a totally valid tactic and should be welcome within the gamecloaking your ship in space then going to workbedout drinking to disrupt enemy isk making isnt and should not be allowed some mechanic to stop it is needed there should be no way to affect other players from getting on with their game unless you are sat at your pc actually playing eve you can even log back in after dt using a remote desktop which can be done very easily this is a massively abused tacticbasically if you arnt actually playing eve at your computer you should not be able to affect what other players are doing even if it is only psychologically
sorry but i thought this game was about tactics and counters hasnt it been said time and time again by ccp that there should be no i win  button in the game for every tactic there is a counter for every mod there is a counter for every gameplay style there is a counter this is true for everything in the game but 1 and thats the cloak the secound you turn it on you win because noone can stop you from that point on i dont care what the counter is to cloaking but there needs to be one if its a fuel bay then fine if its a 4 hour mod cycle timer then fine even if its a pos mod that takes an hour or 2 to scan the system and finds everything in the system weather cloaked or not then thats fine to but there must be a counter to the cloak or it is the i win button of this game to the people who say that people will find ways around it well thats true and you know thats fine 2 as long as there are counters to it
what i have been saying for ages now is to remove the ability of a cov ops cloaked ships to field regular cynos and increase the jump range and fuel bay of black ops by 50 and increase a black ops effective hitpoints by 25 ditch conventional cynos ability on cov ops cloak ships in exchange for a much better black opsbridge cov ops gangs
that is the beginning of a new problem altogether first ccp buffs dreads then battleship pilots will want a buff to fight the dreads then so on and so forth down to the frigs then after everyone gets a buff the super pilots start complaining that they have been left out now we are back at square onenot to mention all the work that this creates for ccp meaning they most likely wont do it the months of bitching griping and complaining this creates same crap going on now and all those changes leave more room for error way oped battleships or something
making something tedious and irritating to do will not stop someone doing it if it gets them enough advantage all that will happen if people have to keep their super caps fuled is that they will do it and hate having to do it it wont stop the supercap bloband pos fuel prices would rise which would suck
glad i didnt vote for you
combat probes use them you must
i can go with this one it always seemed weird that with no intel sight or any connection to a battlefield a command ship is commanding the fight this would certainly help aliviate other issues as well such as t3s being better command ships than a purpose built command ship offgridpos boosters and command alts personally i think if you can play the game afk and still produce a noticable effect you should suffer a nerf even froma pve perspecive this would kill the 6 link tengus for incursion fleets
jag kara gets itflank steak does not
with ccp needing additional revenue sources this seems like a home run it would seem it should be easy to implement i would think it could even be implemented using the petition system and require that much less programming to make it automatedwith all of the naysayers whom complain of reputation and corp thieft i still dont see any potential argument that would justify not allowing this feature there are simply to many other ways to become someone else this would simply become yet another waythe only problem i see with it is people changing their name from anewb to znewb so theyre not primary it still makes ccp money and it will allow you to make fun of people with names like zzzzzzzzzznewb
i was at first giving the current csm the benifit of the doubt despite the chairman and his less than stellar reputation regarding all things evehoweveri am completely convinced now that it is all about the goonswarm agenda pretty much every post i see from a csm rep is drivel and nonsense i would much rather see a post from a dev who has some common sense then some wannabe attorney csm repsoany dev want to make a meaningful comment in this thread
personally i think this could be slimmed down by simply giving all players a number which already exists as far as i know this number would be used in linking profiles setting standings etc as an example bob aka registered capsuleer 208456 changes his name to steve like wise known as registered capsuleer 208456 will auto be associated with bob based on their id numberthis would make it much easier to distinguish between people too as to search someone it could go from looking up bob and recieving results on every one with the combination of letters bob and having to search for them to just looking up 208456 and having no confusionthis method could similarily be applied to alliances and corps as they would be easily trackable with it as well as it would open the possibility of allowing possible repeats of names as confusion can be prevented by the numerical difference between characters not that im looking to see 500 john smiths in the john smith corp show up in a battle and having to call primaries
that isnt a bad idea at all would said id number be something the pilot knows this might allow for duplicate names which i think would be freaking cool ruining somebody elss replol fun times if you know what your number is you can have someone add you to contacts or email or whatever using said number instead of the name to clear up any confusion with duplicate names
that was more or less the idea if you can track them based on a unique number that will never change why would you need to worry abut naming confusionand yes you would know it it could be as simple as next to your name it says your id number
this is easily the best suggestion ive seen concerning this matter very much supportedalso now the support button is gone and we still cant have a frigging vote function with these superunbelievablyawesome forums they spent so much time coding on
ya
im still surprised they do so much to change the game and still brush over this
as cool as this looks imagine them being blown up by the next fleet to come along simply because they look cool i like it i think but they can go boom
youve failed to explain how a ship cloaked unmoving in space with no one at the keyboard is actually winning anythingthe problem isnt the cloaked ship the problem is that youre afraid of the pilot you see in local that you dont know and cant find
nerf being afk while in station or pos
nerf afk cloaking by nerfing the infallible intelligence source known as local this will empower nonafk cloakers and all will be well with new eden
why are you flying a billion isk ship in nullsec at a location that anybody can warp to without alerting you to their presence any battlecruiser or stealth bomber will do for belt rats
so what you are saying is that you would be okay if the player cloaked is removed from local after some period of inactivity correct and if active again will show up in local again rightthen why not support a solution instead of waxing two pages of politico
sorry to be rude but most people have no idea how the gang links work1 gang links dont work in warp so ship needs to be stationary2 gang links dont work when cloaked3 if cs is on grid nobody is calling it primary due to huge tank capability if you call a cs primary you are doing somethink wrong4 if you cant kill a stationary uncloaked ship you suck at gameand btw that someone has a pos is no reason to nerf somethink becouse everyone and his grandmother has pos for staging caps fleets etc
thats genius i dont know why i didnt think to ask the gang to sit politely on their gate while i warp off to dock get into a ship with a probe launcher probe out their alt take him out and get back to gate for a quick fightand thank you i know how gang links work i still think it makes absolutely no sense to promote a meta where its beneficial to have an alt in a combat ineffective ship sitting in space at a pos next to a station or otherwise not being part of the combat that it is providing spreadsheet statistics tofinally i would like to point out that everyone and his mother do not have a pos for staging caps and fleets not all space battles are for sovereignty or involve capitals many of the better space battles involve fleets of single digit size gang sizes keep getting bigger because people keep adding alts and parking them in space
given the forcemultiplier if the cs is in a gang of more than 10 or so fighters youd be doing something wrong not calling it primary after youve taken care of ecm and logistics
i messed up my original name and spent weeks trying to think of a new one feeling the pressure of it it pretty much broke the experience for meultimately any problems that people can think up with name changing are problems with solutions and not even difficult solutionsi particularly like the cooling off idea
i sincerely hope that if they do i get something out of it free eve for life or a really wicked unique shipim a fan of cloaky cruisers hint hint
ever wondered about how boring lowsec can be and how it could be changed thats in fact a very good idea would like to see that coming thumbs up
while interesting this idea is a little one sided isnt it i mean everything im reading is about killing pirates attacking people with gcc and destroying a viable and flourishing playstyle choice which no one asked you to destroythe only people that dont like low sec are those that dont understand it or are afraid of it if anything gcc needs to be limited not expanded if you want to kill pirates then come into low sec and trythis idea has some merit but itll never fly
a questionhow the  do you know that cloaker is really there not afkby your logic its a valid tacticbut no one in their right brain would ever answer in local if they are there if their soul purpose is to spyhypocritical muchseriously peopleget over yourselves afk or notthe point is it wont matter a damn if ccp nerfs localyoull just  about something else stop the evemail spam
let them use fuel so they run out
cloaks are fine its people expecting bunnies and flowers in null sec that need to be fixed
tbh cloakers in system dont really bother me i deal with them in the same way i would any other neutral that comes around and thats mainly by ignoring them and getting on with playing the game the way i would if they hadnt been there in the first placemy problem is the fact that you can go into a system and do something that no one can counter like i said in my original post i dont care what the counter is as long as there is a counter you win because no one can do anything to stop you doing anything you want as long as you are cloaked if thats not winning in this game then plz explain what you would accept as win in this game
and once againyou fail to answer the ultimate questionwhat can that cloaked ship do to you when its obviously no where in sightthe solution is to have a combat fleet ready to go and play it smartcomplaing about it wnot solve anything a cloaked ship cannot use any modules short of propulsionthats itall you have is the presense of a nuet in systemor a red thats itif local was removedand it likely will be youd still be screwed over regardlessthis entire arugment is a farsetotal waste of timethe counter is obvioususe that head of yoursand stop whining stop the evemail spam
im glad he won in spite of you not voting for him
dreads are already significantly underpowered for the type of ship it is designed to be10 bs should not be able to nuke a dread in under two minutes nor should the dread have to take 3 siege cycles to kill off a carrier dreads are only useful in site as designed to be but the current state of dreads requires you to bring a blob of them to be of any worth just to smash a posleave my supers the  alone until you fix my  dreads if pos fuels are a requirement i want a mobile lab optional forcefield and manufacturing thing in it so i can build my  via my supers instead of wasting time fueling backup poses
yes fix dreadnoughts
and why would you want to punish small groups and solo players they are already at a disadvantage to your1 mindless blob of 50 f1f8 droidsi say keep and even boost offgrid boosting alts one of the precious few things that help single active players1 your doesnt mean you personallypain is weakness leaving the body
or even before if its not one of the cs with significant ehp bonuses because the loleos isnt bad enough
to do this then they would have to change the mechanic so you can have multiple people boosting fleet at the same time even if only one of the boosting is actually taking affect this is because command ships can and will among the first targets in an engagment so there need to be redundant boosters or else boosting becomes near useless in large fleets
sorry but part of the consequence of doing crap to ruin the rep of a character is the destruction of the sale value allowing people to change identities at all will allow people to use this as an exploit to avoid any consequence of actions other than a small service feei vote no friggon way  remove the cloaked from local free intel is the real problem not afk cloaking 
at one point the game didnt allow more than two word in character name and it also didnt allow any punctuation marksthere are people with typos in there character namesthese are valid reasons to have ones name corrected by a petition and gm interventionpain is weakness leaving the body
names and reputations should always stay with characters sold on bazaar they cannot be allowed to change their name if the toon is bought similarly if you change your name you can never sell your toon reputation isnt rooted in you the player its invested in the toon that earned the bad rep if toon xxx became known as a notorious thief and pirate this does not mean that the same player cant play another care bear toon this is the basic tenant of any rpg but the notorious pirate should be penalized for the rest of the characters life for his sins in other words the sins are born by the toon not the player  in contrast to floppys post  this is how legal entities work a company can have bad debt or be legally sued but that doesnt mean that the ceo is personally liable as long as the sins of the toon are branded to the toon forever in implementation i may support this feature
not sure if seriousare you guys reading the previous posts before you post some of this stuff let me try this final summary once againit would be a cosmetic change only the reputation of a toon hisher standings and employment history past transgressions enemies friends contacts all remain the same there would be a clear indication in the biography of a character regarding any previous names namechanging would be allowed very infrequently with a lengthy cooloff periodthe inconvenience of checking an akatab in somebodys biography i do not feel justifies the absence of this feature which judging by the likes received is something people would like to see unless you have a more compelling argument please refrain from the whole toon should always be linked to hisher reputation  as nothing about this proposal allows anybody to escape this prospect
its not destroying anything if you feel that this is onesided against the pirates then how about some ideas on how to balance it right now all the advantage in lowsec goes to those who dont care about their sec statusthe pirates they can dictate the fight because the good guys cant engage just anyone there is no incentive to go out to lowsec other than purely wanting to get involved in pvp at the cost of security status even then its hard to get a fight that isnt horribly onesided or just run into a gang running disco on a gate or station im trying to find a system which creates enough feeling of balance for all parties that more people go out into lowsec creating more fightsi do understand lowsec ive spent a fair bit of time on pvp roams and exploration there i learned the hard way how to live out there for extended periods of time and got to know some of the people who live there id wager that 95 of the lowsec occupants i met were pirates they spent all their time fighting each other and ganging up on any passersby they didnt know and like hell half the friends i made out there i made because i successfully evaded their traps and stuck around in local to chatthis isnt just about killing pirates this has always been about getting ships into lowsec creating fleets starting fights and creating a stepping stone for youngersmaller groups that want a taste of fleet battles and sov without getting dragged into the politics and sheer scope of nullsec i really think if something like this mechanic existed more carebear corps might venture out of hightroll that is unless youre saying that you cant deal with a fleet of pubbies coming out to lowsec and trying to take you one i understand not everyone is up to thattrolld
most of us happen to like low sec just the way it is and while certain elements need to be tweaked addressed and otherwise balanced  we dont want low sec to become another null or hisec region and that is what you are proposingyou make the assumption that something is wrong with low sec because more people arent there and that by somehow making it safer more people would fly into low and have picnics it wont happen why because people like me live there and i will only blow up their pretty little ships even more than i do now boom dead miners and carebear ships all over the placeyour idea is interesting but if people had the guts to come into low sec theyd be coming into low sec making bounty hunters or police or territory modules or any of the other ideas ive heard over the years wont change the fundamental issue  low sec is scary and bad people live thereim sorry about that but me and all the other pirates like it like that if it changes it wont be low sec anymorenow having said that there are things that can be done sec status is something that needs addressed gcc needs to be fixed based on the truesec status of systems and not just globally and others but anyone can already attack a pirate any time they want without taking a sec status hit and they dont do it
this subject should be discussed in full detail but the initial idea is worth supporting1
i dont want to make it safer i want to make it more dangerous for all parties i want there to be battles not little frig fights and the occasional roaming blob of doom that i see out there now the problem as it is now is that the 10s are only threatened by each other and anyone not looking to pirate really cant survive in lowsec its the leastpopulated part of spacefrom what ive seenand the low popularity means that the hard truth of it is that ccp isnt going to care much what you think if they can find a way to make more players happy i even recall some dev posts on the old forums about fixing lowsec i want to offer something that will augment lowsec and give the pirates more and bigger pvp fights if you think my proposal wont do that id love to hear what you think might make low moits not about having guts to go to lowsec its about having a reason to right now the risk vs reward ratio is way out of balance with the rest of the game my old corp ran mining operations in low just to see what kind of isk we could makeit wasnt significantly more profitable than highsec mining and there was the constant threat of piracy i ran exploration through there frequently but again found highsec to pay equally well basically right now theres one thing to do in nonfw lowsec be a pirate or look for pirates i know some people run l5s in them and there are some lowsec explorers but for the most part the space goes unused
any real beginner in eve is in a rifter tackling the ships in fleets exactly like those the op linked
heres a better idea instead of making pve look shiny why not make it fun
i think there are more important things to fix or improve other than the graphics right nowat least with the current graphics the current load on the computer and the internet is really really small
while i agree with the statement of the last poster in so far as whiners should just be more combat ready there is an psychological effect of having a red in local continuously which is the reason why i advocate the timed removal from local for non active cloakers it makes the difference between having to be combat ready 100 of the time to just the time when the cloaker decides to activate a module or decloak or cyno
even then you choose to let that cloaker effect you to that degree and if they accomplish that much they win stop the evemail spam
of course you cant do pretty much anything while cloaked either you also cant do anything about people you wardec that stay in stations until you give up the dec are they winning really really weak argument
the single most talked about nonproblem in the game  remove the cloaked from local free intel is the real problem not afk cloaking 
what all this talk about winning are you all born in the 90s constant evasion is fine constant potential cyno is just an unfair advantage dont get me wrong i love afk cloaking myself but im happy to play psi war with my prey by popping in and out of local just to see them flee if my proposal is implemented that is presently always being in local is boring and encourages me to afk of course i can still replicate this effect by zipping around safe points but not afk that being said id much rather the current system than some cloak fuel or other cloak gimp
not sure your reading my post or someone elses how do i know if someone is there or not i dont not sure what the answering in local bit is all about doesnt seem tot refer to my posthypocritical no i dont think so im just agreeing that everything should be counterable in some way and you should not be able to affect someones play while you are 20 miles from your pcif ccp nerf local well it becomes irrelevent afk cloaking will end becasue there will be no reason for it the psychological warfare element will be gonewhat i am saying is that if you are afk for long periods during that period you shouldnt be able to affect what other people do
the part youre failing to grasp is that the only way they affect what other people do is if you let them affect youyou know whats really fun seeing someone in your wormhole catching their name and adding it to your contacts and having no idea if theyve left your hole or are waiting around hoping for a kill no local at all to see if theyre in your system we had a stealth bomber hang around like that for a few days the trick is to not let them keep you from doing what you do but to simply prepare better you tank a little more you watch dscan and your overview a little more intently when running pi you dont pull up to the planet and park you come out of warp immediately initiate warp to the next customs office then you grabswap your materials out while your ship alignslocal has made you weak and your arguments reflect that i can see him hes spooky he might kill me while hes afk waa grow a pair and counter him you can easily sneak into a neighboring system to do whatever you can alter your ship to give you survivability you can be alert use dscan use the ability to have multiple overview tabs use your friends and allies to work together withcowboy up son the universe doesnt give a crap if you die or not
this tbqhif you people cant figure that outyou have no business throwing a bloody fit in the first placeenjoy local while it lasts wimps because its going to go straight to hell when its goneyou havent experienced sheer paranoia until youve lived in whs long enough to know what its like to argue with yourself if someone is really there or not stop the evemail spam
i echo my proposal again  which really is a local fix that happens to fix aft cloaks tooall ships off your grid disappears from local after 15min of inactivity use of modules not cloak make you show up againforces people to toughen up and adds new cloak tactics decloak and show up on local to freak out the locals also enforces that you be at the keyboard to engage in this psychological offensive blissfully ignorant ratters get to live in their fantasy worlds until you show up with a cyno or not everyones interests are served
bleh mines better 1 when you cloak you disappear from local2 when you cloak you also lose access to local you cannot use local for intel gathering and would be required to more actively do so3 when you uncloak theres a 30 or 60 second delay in being able to light a cyno preventing abuse of the disappeared from local to hot drop fleets completely unaware
close but your 2 gimps cloaking as used for legitimate intel gathering the other 50 of the reasons why people cloak and your 1 would make for weird cases where you can see a ship on grid but its not in localmy point of having any ship go off local once afk wasnt decided randomly its intended to allow for the benefit of the doubt so that people would not be able to identify cloakers in system by their blinking in and out of local all the time currently any red in system is also not similarity instantly identifiable if victims knew that the red is a cloaker then once he pops up in local again victims will expect a cyno and prepare or flee taking away completely the whole tactical surprise advantage of covert ops all together the primary 50 of the reason why people fly cloakers so we can agree to disagree which one is better but why dont we let the public decide which is the least disruptive to all parties yet makes everyone happy
2 balances is and makes cloaking more strategic as a counter to being invisible in the systems think current wormholes youd also be responsible for actively gathering your intel you could be cloaked off a gate for example and have some friends at other points and no one would have any idea youre there1  if youre cloaked youre not visible on the grid anyhow when you uncloak you reappear on local and can use local once again 3 bring balance if youre cloaked but in local they know youre there the stupid will get caught the cowardly will stay docked and the smart will have the means to try to survive should you attack with the delay on the cyno its a balance for your invisibility from the system while cloaked the stupid will still get caught likely they werent paying attention anyhow the cowardly will crap themselves then likely get caught or get away depends on how you fit your ship the smart will still likely have a good chance to get away only theyll be doing so to get a change of underwear
this this hard
sorry i should have been more clear what i meant was for the cloaker you would have people in visual but not on local this seriously gimps cloakers besides being weird making notes of who comes in and out of systems is a big part of being a covert ops pilot and a fully intended function of cloaking this would take that away or make it much harder restricting covert ops to only do visual intelligence gatheringyour 3 i can accept but i think that having all afkers go off local is a more general fix to local keeps cloakers more or less anonymous and why gimp legitamate cloakers even more it really is just the afk for days with an alt for the sole purpose of putting ratters on edge which is the complaint here
bump fo loving
making a certain ship cost a little more to run is not really viable on the blobs look at how much isks etc say pl get for their contracts they can afford it only people you would be hurting are the small alliances that dont have the huge logistical backbone that some of the bigger alliances havenerfing supercaps is stupid all that ends up happening is you change the flavor of the month instead of having a large blob of 40 scs you will have a blob of 300 dreads as more people can afford to use em your not fixing the blob your shifting what they are using make titans and super caps more expensive instead of a sc 14 bil to make why not 60 and make a titan 200 yeah pl  goons  drf will still be able to afford them but they will be able to afford less of them and maybe use them less as loosing 10 in a battle will hurt any wallet
the original balance for titans was there cost ccp didnt think people would make tons of them trying to balance them by adding more cost will not do jack to balance them
so your idea of a solution is to make supercaps much less fun to own but leave them just as overpowered in combat as they are yeah you might want to think that one through a bit furtherthe problems people have with supercap proliferation arent related to them using insufficient ice products what good does it do me that a titan pilot has to jf a few extra gscs of whatever what i care about is how effective his titan is vs subcaps punishing people for owning supercaps does not equate to a useful game balance change
the only real solution to supercaps is obviousmegacaps
itt someone with a lot of pi alts
hey guys i know i made this thread originally for the old forums just to let you know i am working on a new one however it will be a while due to the recent dev blogs and annoucements and blue posts made by several devs many of these topics are going to be removed mostly because they will have been fixed so hang tight for a few more weeks for those blogs to get out and a new list for the forums will be upthank you spitfire for keeping this up and alive
you mean like squad booster wing booster fleet booster the system is already in place and has been for quite some time but people dont use it because it is more convenient to park a single uberlink boat somewhere out of the way even then it is a simple enough matter of using ones mouse to assign a new booster should the need arise 
this
on the topic of having a permanent number associated with a character  i can see the appeal one could even call it a pilotUFFFDs cerification number for the role playing community and even change UFFFDborn onUFFFD to UFFFDlicensed onUFFFD i dunno about some of those nefarious aspects listed but for now iUFFFDll add it to the debated feature list
remember when posting on forums it is essential to actually read the topic UFFFD otherwise you might sound like the person quoted above
i apologize if this sounds rude but assuming you are aware that the current valid reasons to have ones name corrected by a petition and gm intervention is for inappropriate content andor capitalizationUFFFD then youUFFFDre supporting a restricted form of name change where essentially only if they add a third word fix a typo or add a punctuation itUFFFDs ok
what youve written is a variation of the debated feature character transfer currently listed as i wouldnt mind adding another andor to thatbut if youre going to bring reality into the argument then you must consider that name changes are allowed in realitysinsUFFFD are already UFFFDbrandedUFFFD via the aka feature  in fact what youre proposing almost infringe on the sins are born by the toon not the player by passing the sins on to a new ownerplayer itUFFFDs as flawed and superfluous as your use of the term UFFFDsinsUFFFD instead of UFFFDreputationUFFFD your propagandizing has clouded the possibility that a good UFFFDreputationUFFFD may be used nefariously as well i donUFFFDt mind either way  both prove the feasibility of name changing
i has a better idea why not let ccp give every actively paying player only 1 chance to rename their characters some exaggeration intended tbh id like to change my name but at the same dont want to for that same reason that i dont want to change it should remain in what the original statement about making a character name should be permanent if you bought your characters or made a change in decision i say to you all make a new character with that name
once ccp allowed the transfer of characters the whole concept of your name being your reputation became obsolete 1 like to this threada big thumbs down to the idea of the character name reverting to original upon transfer  serves no purpose and could devalue the character no jno is not a typo name a shrub after me something prickly and hard to eradicate
paulize so you agree with me in principle yet you still feel the need to reiterate and pontificate im beginning to think you care more about winning in this forum than the actual proposal here to answer your single point in your response worth answering a bad or good rep staying with the toon affecting the buyer of the toon is exactly what we want remember you too think character transfers are bad  am im not one to repeat arguments already stated for the sake of it  buyers need to do research on the toon they are about to buy and make a choice on it no doubt the rep will affect the price and please you know full well what i mean when i used the term sins and we both know full well it could go both ways please dont patronize me nor the intelligent readers of this forum buy harping on semantics we are all adults here  well most of us anyway  people who spell like a fonics robot im looking at you 
and to the person katie frost who quoted the number of likes as circumstantial evidence of the importance of this proposal you should be aware of the skewed sample space here only people who want a name change will vote like people who dont need one wont even read this thread as the affected population is a small minority of the eve population compare this to a proposal that will boost hybrids or gimp cloaking you will get less likes for those threads because the topic is divisive and not likes are not counted and many will be on the fence but no one needs convincing that these other proposals are a lot more important to all citizens of new eden than name changing
that is from the rules in the character bazaar forum your sins are kept even if you change your name that is what negative sec status is for kill rights and with the proper implementation of this feature you can find out if the character was a thief i think this would add to the flavor of tracking down a thief they want to change their name to avoid being tracked down it seems like it is pretty easy do to irl so why not in eve another possible feature rather than an aka tab why not require an agent lookup that can say this character has gone by these names in the past adds flavor and rp value
solutionhave a name change history
id like to bring the idea back up for consideration by the devsi woud like to propose to ccp that the hundred million or so deaddormant trial accounts that have never been activated since trial end from the last 7 years be deleted and the names contained therin released for new playerscharacters namespace and server space will be releasedthe whole eve community has known for yearswe need namesccp can simply send an email giving them notice like the emails we all get inviting us back after 6 months of not playing and then terminating the accounts after the given time my proposal is for dormant trial accounts only if a player has activated then in all fairness they should be able to keep name and character for any future usethoughtsoriginal thread
i agree with this all additional i wanna make a quick note that the covert ships in general blops covert ops recon etc also have less ehp then their counter parts t1t2faction so in respect they should by technical terms be more lighterfaster so id like to ask on the note that their max velocity  agilityor even reduced sig radius be changed a fair  to make up for that loss of ehp
imo blackops have enough dps blackops dont need cov ops cloak cloak speed is good enough blackops could use no scan res penalty bonus could use larger fuel bay just to make it more desirable to fly around it should be still good idea to just fly through gates to save fuel however as it currently is its not really encouraging to even undock with these ships main idea here is that if you go in deep 00 2030 jumps from nearest station you can dock you really need that fuel its too much to assume you have haulers alts with you for everything fitting stats on these ships are truely horrible they need better tank and capacitor whatevs you should be able to fit tank at least comparable to tier 1 battleship they shouldnt become cloaking gankmachines tho but i think size and speed and battleship class scan res should take care of it quite much 
expanding on some of the ideas presented here they definitely need to have at least as good a tank as their t1 counterpart no amount of bonuses will be compelling if theyre too fragile to be put into action i love the idea of a ship maintenance array id take it another step and make it large enough to hold a single frigate allowing one pilot to swap between a bomber and a covops as needed this makes a small blops gang a lot more versatile and gives another reason to put a black ops ship in the field negate the scan res penalty of fitting a cloak this might be done just by giving the ship a scan res bonus making a noncloaky one useful in its ability to rapidly target smaller ships fuelrange changes sound good but definitely need careful consideration to avoid overpowering the ship
currently i always have 2 windows the overview and the people  positions window opened because the context menu is not clear enought to manage many positionswould be possible somehow to add custom positions to the overview so im able to warp to them and always have the positions created for the current system in the overviewor is there already some switch to enable this and i missed it the whole time im playing eve 
are you talking about putting bookmarks on the overviewid like the ability to put them on the overview and as icons in spacebasically the same behavior as beacons this is part of the were in spaceships that fly faster than light why dont we have this ability set
my apologies if im not grasping something how can the cloaker have anyone on visual but not in local oh wait i get it now heh had to type it for it to sink in ok lets think wormholes this is an everyday thing we see bad guys visually and there is basically no local thats how we do our intel find em fly in cloaked look at them get names sneak in to a good place to provide a warp in for allies trust me theres nothing odd about it whats odd for me is seeing all these people in local when im back in empire and having no idea where they are but thats because im used to it not being there believe me cloaking isnt gimped at all without local around it awakens the hunter in you ship on dscan ok where check for combat sites what type of ship does dscan show check known wormholes if you suspect theyre open throw out combats out of dscan range the very thought of local ever appearing in wormholes not that thats an issue would effectively ruin a huge positive of themhaving cloaked vessels disappear from and not have access to local would ultimately enhance cloaking by making covops for example much more interactive youd have to work a little more for intel no more so than in wormholes already plus you could maintain a true element of surprise that the label covops implies youd really need to spend some significant time without local to truly appreciate the beauty of its absence
adjust probes a little too there sits a fix to intel gathering and knowing when someone is active in the system probing cloaked is common so it wouldnt gut intel abilities if the probes gave back the right types of informationps as to wormholes and no local unless youd be willing to drop a gate to your wormhole that anyone can find with the click of a button unless you would be willing to allow cynos to be lit in there so others can jump in dont bring the we have no local outevery last kspace system has fixed paths to them which can easily be seen kspace residents do not have the ability to collapse an unwanted door to there systems and cycle it else wherethe style of play in eve from within wormholes is radically different in more ways than just having no local and to inflict this portion of your life on the rest  id say your portion should also change so you have a fixed address that can be invaded just like theirs can be invaded the above would pretty close to destroy wormhole life in eve  its also about as harmful to game play as gutting local without what it provides for those who do have fixed addresses that all others can easily find and fly tono  wormhole life isnt easy but it sure as hell has some facets to it that make it workable dont mix  match across space without being willing to live under the same threats across the board and your we have no local is well offset by some other things that you can do to protect yourself  things kspace residents dont have
having random unknown gates suddenly appear in your system without any warning is no picnic either depending what youre doing the first time you have a clue the enemy is there is when they decloak and show up on the overview so yeah theyre different but having cloaked vessels disappear from and be unable to use local adds a little mix of em a little spice to empire life that we experience on a daily basis its balanced more interactive and better reflects what cloaking should be
the immediate disappearance from local of a cloaker imbalances the status quo in my opinion when coming up with a solution to a problem its usually best to just address it in a way that changes the least amount of other factorscurrently a cloaker enjoys anonymity they cannot be distinguished from other people in a system as they are just all in local as you well know knowledge is worth a lot in eve making cloakers immediately disappear from local when they cloak will make them easily distinguishable from others thanks to the mwd cloak procedure when entering systemshaving everyone disappear from local after a timeout maintains the anonymity that cloakers now enjoy
it doesnt imbalance it in my opinion it rebalances it keep in mind the status quo is what people are complaining about with regards to afk cloakers with the immediate removal of the cloaker when cloaking from local and the immediate inaccessibility of local to the cloaked ships theres a balance still its different than what were used to in kspace true but still a balance the added power you get with the added anonymity come with an added cost but then again its still less of a cost than you get simply jumping into wspace you can always uncloak and reaccess local you can always learn to watch local a little stronger for people that seem to blink in and out to get an idea if theres indeed a cloaked vessel in system yes it would require a little adaption from both perspectives but again its less of an adaption than if you jump through a wormhole a little rebalancing would be a good thing again my opinion youd have a more active intel gathering requirement while cloaked youd have the anonymity of being truly cloaked not simply invisible but seenit makes me wonder if we posted a thread in general comparing the two ideas how well theyd be received

i can fly command ships i can provide fleet bonuses to me it doesnt make sense that a ship that is not participating in a fight can influence the fight your whining is very similar to the nanowhines from back in the day the only way i can win fights is to exploit this game mechanic you mustnt take it away from meif fleet boosters had to remain on grid to provide boosts there would be strategic and tactical decisions to be made no longer would you just pile six gang links on a loki to give you more tank and better webifierscram range with ongrid boosters you have to make decisions about tank speed and which boosters are most important to youthis suggestion is about having to make a choice between having your cake or eating your cake you shouldnt be able to have bothbut please keep trying to play the ongrid boosters would encourage blobbing because offgrid boosters are the only hope of defending against super cap hotdrops card it really is quite funny
what use is that when the ship has moved 50km away by the time you arrive on grid you get to interrupt their bonuses for a few seconds while they reposition to a new grid but then you have to probe them down again and warp to their new locationkeep warping little interceptor youll catch that fleet booster if the enemy doesnt lay a trap for you firstin starcraft there is a unit called the arbiter which cloaks all nearby units the catch is that the arbiter itself cant be cloaked so its a powerful unit but it has a vulnerability then theres the siege tank which can hit units far away with a very powerful attack but to use that attack the siege tank must commit to remaining stationary for at least three seconds time to deploy fire a shot then withdraw for every ability there is a vulnerability this is called game balancein the case of offgrid boosters the vulnerability is being probed down but you have a counter for that which is to be moving quickly and warp offgrid when someone arrives ongrid with you your links will deactivate but only for a few moments if they persist you will know what they are flying if the attacker is flying a cloaky ship they will not be able to catch you while cloakedwhen it comes to ongrid boosters there is always the option of using gridfu to stretch the grid in such a way that you can safely boost from hundreds of km awaynow certainly information warfare and the command ships which support it arent particularly popular there are ships with bonuses to repairs which would probably be better off with bonuses to resists same tank more ehp but those are issues that can be addressed at the same time or even prior to removing the ability to fleet boost from offgrid
yes you can have both but it should required bringing more pastry chefs to the party  pretty sure ccp classified deliberate grid manipulation as undesirable ie exploitive you will be gm smacked messes up the database or something  way old blurp so wont try to find it so dont ask 
anchoring objects offgrid from a pos in order to force the grid around the pos to be smaller and thus forcing all ships to be well within range of the pos guns was declared an exploit no other gridfu was declared exploitative that im aware of
i agree with the proposal ships giving bonuses should be on gridi agreeconsidering t3s should never have overshadowed fleet command ships thats not a bad thing
yeah  i am arguing the feasibility of name change  i agree that your argument may increase the feasibility butUFFFDUFFFDwinningUFFFD youve ignored i wouldnt mind adding another andor to that just to have another roundUFFFDreiterateUFFFD had you just read the op properly i wouldnUFFFDt have had to write it againUFFFDpontificatingUFFFD you were using sins for its heavy connotation  yet you so beautifully enacted the terms greek etymology that i couldnt resist pointing out that you had UFFFDmissedUFFFD half of your argument just to use the term if youre going to argue about patronizing and semantics towards the reader then abandon your rhetoricthe single point in my response worth answering was sins are already branded on the character via the aka feature
im thankful youve understood that the feasibility of name changing takes precedent over the details  as youve given your support while continuing the debate of a debated feature
greek what am i talking to a person or a wikipedia bot yes it was and yes i knew that and yes you knew that i already knew that too  or did you forget that i have been part of this thread from the beginning you will kindly note that i wasnt quoting any of your posts but your ego made you think i was arguing against you i was in fact responding to some other posters on this discussion that were advocating that sins are to stick with the player that was the whole point of my post only your ego made you think that my post was a challenge to your position so you start laying on your rhetorical arguments line really it detracts from your credbility stick to the topic at hand im actually agreeing with you so long as the fundamental tenant of sins will never be forgiven are upheld

yeah i was checking up on some names and the one i wanted was taken by a 03 trail account still in the naval academy it has been inactive for almost a decadeclean up the database and rid those dead accounts1
i got a better idea that ccp might like that wont totally  off ppl who log in after 37 years of inactiveness to find no characters on their account in most mmos when characters are merged to a new server free character name changes are given to players whos names would be taken why dont we just apply a similar concept and simply clear inactive character names and give them random generated serial numbers once the person starts his account again upon logging in will be notified that player has lost his name and must rename his character before logging in simple lets not go around deleting ppls 
wanna point out the emotionally disturbed people that get hacked off logging into a game they never subscribed to 37 years later finding that their free trial chars are missing imo send them for some mental counseling or a refill on their prescriptions the op isnt talking about paid accounts only purging trial accounts that never subscribed  only several year old trial accounts at that this has spank to do with something anyone has paid for
this is a good idea though it seems to me that with the allowance of last names that people really shouldnt have that hard of a time coming up with a namebut it does seem like a good idea to delete the old trial accounts
plus wan
agree but only for trial account dormant for a period of time not for any non trial account in other words any account that has ever has a subscription active is off limits  remove the cloaked from local free intel is the real problem not afk cloaking 
confirming that cosmos do need some lovewith ccp zulus latest dev blog maybe they will finish this feature setsome method of keeping track would be great the journal seems as good a way as anylets hope they look at fix this
i was almost a year into the game before i stumbled across a blog post about the cosmos missions they definitely need some love
but i like it when things go booommm keeping it under ccps nose till they update pos
what you want is called null it is a region located all around the edges of new eden head in any direction and youll get there eventually you can own the systems there the rewards are very high and it is full of battles all the timeenjoy
this guy says it all
no no no no will you stop writing stuff i have to agree with its goes against my antigoon work ethic
ships designed to cloak should stay cloaked  everything else is open for debate
i liked the crazy idea that make super caps suseptable to mining ships would be funny seeing a titan being chased by a bunch of hulks and covetorsor a possible smaller ship that cant be touched by super caps but can be easily destroyed by other ship typesie a small suicide ship
another goon whine
also for the love of god please make the science and industry window resizeable to a decent minimum size at the moment it wont shrink past approx 16th of the total screen space on 1080p and even set at its smallest its only got useful data on 16 of itself when in pi mode
i dont mind name changes though i agree that there would be pros and cons in the absence of name history depending on how much control players wish they could havei think that having name changes should be possible and that name change history should be optional during the name change process after all not everyone is running away from other peopleharassmenttheir pasts currently i imagine that criminally inclined players can have many untainted accounts plus have the option to purchase untainted yet welltrained characters thereby having ways to do their worst under fresh personas if this is what goes on playing under an untraceable new identity is already a part of evethe idea of putting name changes on a very long timer is okaywith the way eve works i dont think there is a way to stop players who want to be underhanded this is the universe of celebrity justice with no jails as a fairly new player i try to figure things out and have fun and dont truly trust anyone since they all might turn into sharks its quite an unusual experiencethe fact that criminal type players would probably take to name changes like ducks to water can either be seen as increasing the amount of challenge in the game or as a nightmare depending on ones opinionin eve online safety is a myth in other mmos i could feel secure but not in this one eve online is meant to be hazardous so i dont support making it too warm and fuzzy i came because of incarna adverts and because its dangerous herefiguring out past character history would make more sense in my opinion if it was because of applying a new private investigation skillset and if it was pricey to do that would make more sense rather than making character history an easybuttoncheerssapph
this just occurred to me most criminals love their reputation they want to be recognized and feared those who dont are already quite adept at changing characters on a regular basis either by biomassing and remaking alts or buying new toons try to change the name of a 10 pirate or famous scammer and theyll refuse their names give them powermostly i just dont want to get stuck with an alt with a bad or nonsensical name from the bazaar because it was all i could find with the skills i was looking for
i totally stopped reading this a few lines in but i think we agree or something yay done
drat then im stuck at the being a  because if we keep throwing that term around i think were all going to sound like idiots
thank you for your rational and wellthought post amidst all the chaos
theres a nice idea not only make it possible but incorporate it into gameplay private investigation is one suggestion but people could think up others as well so that your new name is your new name you do indeed get the relief of being a new person however people can still look up your history with the appropriate servicesskillsiskyou could also consider a feature that allows the namechangee to decide how difficult it would be for others to unveil hisher history with a fixed limit so that it isnt possible to make it impossible  only a stronger deterrant you can really play with this even involving concord agents or some such thingthis extends to the idea of making it impossible for other players to reach that history at all without the changees permission this simply means that when a player with a changed name is entering some highvalue situation the other parties can simply give him the choice reveal your past identities or leave more shenanigans can then ensueor combine both of those ideasi like it this requires that all characters do at least have something accessible by all that reveals simply if their name was ever changedi do believe history should never be truly impossible to view and i believe people who petition for a change for reasons of semantics should be free of all this and simply get a straightforward change as things are currently i support this old idea even more now because it is something very important to many people and can be incorporated into the game in quite a good roleplaying way it would be a win win
i agree completely with this even though ive never had issues with unavailable names only so long as the activated accounts arent even touched ive been inactive for 12 year increments during my time as an eve player and having my account deleted or even having to rename my player would not make me happy1 for the idea maam
i absolutely disagree with you lowsec is still within the sov of one of the 4 nations and so crimes commited there by pirates should still carry the possibility of being punished i believe the general idea of this was that even as vast as the nations navies and police forces may be they simply dont stretch or get funding enough to fend for all of the low sec areas so they simply dont do it instead they have this new option to chose a much easier and potentially profitabl option for the players concord opens itself up more to players and allows them to go after outlaws which now have a concord bounty on their head additionally any player who had destroyed an innocent persons ship or esspecially podded them is now flagged when in low sec for a concord warrent and may be dispatched but not podded as opposed to how outlaws would be treated within a certain time limit lets say a week or two after that time they can no longer be blown up due to that particular crime but if they commit a certain amount in a specific amount of time their security status goes down at a higher rate based on the crimes and estimated value of damages and of course also the regular ways sec status goes downthis may sound like a carebears method of trying to make low sec safe and more like high sec but quite the contrary there will always be pirates and raiders in low sec this idea and general and what ive said here i feel are simply means with which to give even more profit to players and more career options while at the same time criminals might finally have t o pay for what they do to the average players you still will run the chance of getting your ship blown to bits if you go below 05 but at least you know that theres people you can actually count on to try and do something about it
low sec is most dangerous place for piratesbeing under 5 sec is great risk like having gcc at gates or stations counting out ship maintenance bay  rr exploitingwhat low sec needs is not safety or more risk for people who actually have balls to aggro someonei could agree with more severe sec hits everywhere but then everyone would just pvp in 00 or suicide gank in hi sec and sec rat in 00 solow sec used to be somewhat viable place for catching logistic transports to 00 but since ccp gave them near immunity to everything jump bridges jump freighters covert ops haulers blackops titan bridge general rage logoffski web warp go figure why no one hangs around in low sec anymore not to mention that missioning and plexing in low sec became less good plan doing anything at low sec belts has been pretty useless like forever
theres plenty of room for piracy in 00 no why make it safer for pirates in losec theres plenty of piracy there  doesnt seem in danger of being wiped out at all  and since when do gate guns bother losec pirates  they sit and tank them all day

ehehe i forgot to add the private investigation concept to the debated features section but its updated nowso how about a rant only two csm members have posted in this threadnaught both were postandruns and showed no attempt at understanding the topic either clearly vote paulize dninjer for csm well maybe not seriously
good proposal the journal would definitely be a good way to track the completed cosmos agent missions
yep poss need to a not look like a flaoting junkyard and b have a fuel that is one cell built from the current pos fuels so you onlu need to carry that one item not 7have a racial fuel cell for each race made from the ice and pi products each fuel cell or rod lasts 3 hours on a smal pos 2 on a medium and 1 on a large simple make life easier looking after poss is not fun or enjoyable but is necessary can we try and make it as painless as possible please
when mittens and i agree on something its usually a good idea we agree on this
usage of containers are such a paineg freight containersif you somehow use them and drop them inside a pos in you cannot take stuff inside and bring them back they are such a pain because somehow too big for a normal industrial they are pretty much useless and a waste of time to get rid of themonce you jettison them almost unable to take back into the cargoholdi dont want describe all circumstances but try to work with them with a jump freighter its ridicolous how stupid it is to work with themalso you cannot put small containers into big containers to sort stuffyou cant rename them inside posthe list of what you cannot do with containers but what you expect is longer then the list of what you canplease check this out and try to fix itthank you 
i like the idea but as has been mentioned before in the thread it shouldnt be so onesided gcc beacons following pirates through warp makes life really easy for the prospective bountyhunters and thus should probably not exist unless theyve done a lot to lockdown the system and make it safe at lower levels of security itd probably just be fine to have gcc beacons lighting up at the location the criminal was at when he committed the crime only updating with each new criminal act that way vigilantes have somewhere to start but still might have to do a little work to track down their targets especially if the guys show a little caution and have safespots insystemas for the rest of it id be inclined to reference that corruption idea the mittani had back when though that strays a little beyond the point of the thread my point here is that if the vigilantes can set up shop in a system doing things to make it safer for travellers and honest folk the pirates should be able to do the same thing setting up shop in a system to make it more dangerous for the lawmen and more appealing to outlaws
the idea of pirates being able to take a similar level of control actually makes sense when you say it like that  so you could have some systems under the influence of pirates others under the influence of deputies  i know a lot of ppl who would love to participate in faction warfare  like experiences but who dont want to have to sacrifice balanced standings or go into total war mode to do so  seems like one key to making this work is to make it somehow easier to get into and get out of  iewould be nice if your corp could easily take a weekend and play a pickup game of deputies and pirates in the nearby losec area without having to ruin their high security standings and for those of us that care nrds nearnrds etc without having to go rogue and become pirates basically killing all targets you see as current losec roams really push you to do
i agree the characters faction and corporation standings should be listed

i would like to at least see some constructive feedback from them not no i cant make fun of people if they can change thier name or already tried dont want to try again because im lazy and in it for the free trip i know there will be those for and against i would however like to see an attempt being made
i suppose i should add that plexes shouldnt mainly spawn at downtime but that should be pretty obviousmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
this idea would generally make lowsec default to being more piratefriendly with things like kickout stations and slower sentry guns making it easier for pirates and outlaws to escape or tank only when there is a concord presence occupying the system does it become similar to what it is today
1 not sure2 cosmetic only3 aurum the nex store 14 no 25 no 36 no 4 7 yes 58 no9 no  saving my free aur for a new synthetic right eye 10 no  but i might once their isk value is actually remotely acceptable11 yes  but with good reason ccp didnt exactly help the situation at the time12 yes  i wouldnt trust mittens or any of the csm with my wallet but i do trust them with my opinion13 not sure 614 yes  we already pay ccp with our immortal souls to get turned into backstabbing dirty stinky pirates 15 yes  on multiple occasions more people should vote imho 1 replacing the nex and aur with player producable clothing would have been a better option if ccp needed microtransactions in the mix make the materials to produce these clothes exchangable for plex and give more of them to people that bought the materials directly with  dont hangburn me for this it was a spur of the moment thought 2 you are paying for someone elses subscription and they give you isk in exchange  no extra isk is injected into the economy because of plex just ask akitat  she knows all this stuff better than i do 3 while plex can be seen as fast cash they are a two sided deal you need someone to buy the plex from you to get the isk additionally 350 million isk in todays eve online is not a great deal apparently 4 eve cannot live off microtransactions however i believe the eve trial could be extended to 21 days with a full 30 days on a buddy invite 14 days is not enough to really experience any part of eve that might make you stay 5 i once bought two plex when i began playing  years ago at least 12 of the 750 million isk from the plex i sold on the market is still in my wallet to this day every isk wasted hurts like a knifestab to the heart  6 its a wierd question because you can only buy characters legitimately with isk if you got that isk through plex should the same argument not apply to the character someone took the time to train this character before you bought it it wasnt just created out of thin air afterall im leaning towards a no but its almost more of an ethical debate since one person can have more than one account they still need to pay for that account though either with  or plexfinally bump for great justice

this is rather funny considering what i saw this past saturday at a department store decent pieces of clothing nothing actually designer ill point out technically costing 45 affordable only because theyre labeled as marked down  almost halfprice between 20 and 30it certainly doesnt mean i think ccp was right to use their pricing scheme just noting real clothes can and will cost about as much if you want good sturdy attire that actually will last you instead of cheap threads that cost 5 apiece and may well fall apart within a year or soi dont think you realize that these still qualify as military advantages faster mining cycles would give those who buy them the ability to claim resources faster for their corp or alliance to then make ships faster to fight their wars with bolstered supplies faster highsec travel would allow a combat force to move into position far easier through empire space breaking warfare in new and unusual waysin eve everything is ultimately military or pvp even mining industry and trade whether you realize it or not
1 should there be microtransactions in eve yes no not sure x dont mind2 what kind of microtransactions would you like to see in eve none x cosmetic only those that give an ingame advantagei do like the suggestion of others to allow wisbased gameplay items once wis has gotten some polish but i also would have liked seeing as also mentioned by others the microtransaction system merely add things to allow players to make all of the items through the existing industrial system and then sell them on the market however i still dont mind the system as it is all that much3 list any of the following choices that you would like to see removed from the game plex aurum the nex store x none of the abovei will say that i would not be opposed to seeing aurum removed  it does seem rather unnecessary4 plex  microtransaction yes no not sure x somewhatcertainly not the same as the nex store but it still counts in some form5 do plex give players an ingame advantage yes no not sure x somewhatit benefits more than just the one who first paid cash though so its certainly more acceptable as a method of gaining ingame advantage  somebody had to earn that isk you get from plex someone had to manufacture those ships and modules and such that you then buy with that isk and you doing business with them benefits them in ways already covered by other contributors ultimately theres multiple parties involved and they all get what they want out of the deal if you were just gifted something ingame for plex or  then just you gain full advantage and no benefit is imparted to the ingame market which is a bad thing tm6 should the subscription model of eve have changed after the introduction of aurum and the nex store yes x no not sure7 have you ever purchased plex x yes noto clarify i bought plex to help my corp out ive never bought plex for private use  it either went to the corp or went to hardware whose only purpose is corporate operations like a capital ship or went to comrades who needed more game time and either could not afford it or otherwise the existing methods of payment were not available to them and i just happen to be the more financiallysound member of my gaming group while being loyal8 have you ever purchased aurum yes x no9 have you ever purchased anything from the nex store yes no x not yet10 have you ever purchased anything that was originally purchased from the nex store yes x no im not sure11 do you think the playerbase has overreacted about the whole microtransaction topic x yes no not sure12 do you feel like the csm or any individual csm member has fairly represented your views on microtransactions aurum and the nex store yes no not sure x well enough13 do you think that buying a pretrained character is like being able to purchase skillpoints yes no not sure x somewhatthis really does depend like plex use on things as it stands someone put work into a character and set a price for it which could then be bargained over and that price was in isk which again had to be earned by someone ingame at some point even if the purchaser just cashed in on a bunch of plex this and the plex questions require quite a bit in the way of splitting hairs and such since they are rather murky subjects14 would you play eve if you only had to pay a subscription fee when you wanted to train skills yes no not sure x not if it means most veterans myself included would essentially stop paying to play since they already have virtually maxedout combat skills and consider the rest of the skills not worth training wed have most of the playerbase not paying within a year of them starting because they really can have all the skills they really need to do well in that short a time15 have you ever voted in a csm election yes x no not suresadly i have never voted despite being in the game for 3 years now i would like to be involved in the system my excuse is as lame as most peoples excuses in the real world who has time to follow politics and enjoy lifeeve as well
supported displaying how much is in storage would be very nice
a name change should come as part of transferring the ownership of a character
you think it is small scale when all runs to plex to pvp after announcementand how do you prevent me and damar for swarming alts to open lot of plexes around fw area giving false alarmsand it still does not remove basic problem if there is plexing group of people who kick your ass everytime you meet them you stop to care about plexing because it does not matter anythingfw has lot of features that makes it good but ccp balancing couple bugs and fact that it does not matter anything makes it unplayable as warfare on long term
thanks for offering your thoughts on this good question letUFFFDs say i am in a frigate and running a minor plex 3 enemies come in frigates letUFFFDs say that is too much for me to fight i have several options 1 see if anyone from my militia is near and can help 2 move over a system and open another minor plex now if all 3 come to fight me i can go back to the original plex if they keep chasing me then i am effectively tying up 3 of their pilots all on my own if they only send 1 or 2 after me so one can stay and run the original plex i may fight them 3 i can hop in a cruiser or assault frigate and run a medium plex now depending on what they have handy we may have our fight same thing would apply if i am in a medium plex and they come with 3 cruisers if i have plenty of ships that are fit out then i can get in a smallerbigger ship and run a minormajor plex depending on how well they have their logistics i may get a fight the idea would be that if they run me off my plex they would have to run a longer timer out based on the fact that i ran the timer out somewhat but by doing that they would get a somewhat higher reward plus dont forget my militia would also know i entered the plex too so i may have some friendlies randomly roll in im sure you have seen this plenty of times even without the notification system and what greatcrazy fights this can create i would kill or chase off your alts and run the plexes myself your alts would just be doing me a favor in finding plexeswell if they are better at pvp then they will deserve to win but again the idea is that there will be lots of plexes running throughout the fw regions so if they are just blobbing i would do what i describe abovemake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i havent heard any objections so far i think this idea needs more visibility
i thought this would not only be really funny but would also make sense concord should also jail the pod of an offending pirate after they destroy the ship this pod would be in a stasis period of 48 hours where no game functions such as chat market and so on would work they float in station in a pod and cant do anything except pod themselves to get out this jail would also play the banana phone song over and over
im going to pirate you now
go for it

counterproposal people who run military missions for an empire faction should be valid war targets to members of the opposing factions milita this would be really funny and make sense i mean if you shoot at military ships thats an act of war right their captains quarters should also play in the navy over and over
somebody needs to learn what trolling isthis is a legitimate postthis is a trollthere is a difference
i think that would actually be interesting brings a whole new level to missioning and pvp in empire
ifand thats a pretty big iiiffffone can get away from concord after doing something bad in high secthen we can start to discuss the punishmentsuntil then no
no i think he is actually going to give you some loving
as someone who engages in lowsec piracy i support this idea anything that would make lowsec a bit safer and allow antipirate types to have some real effect means more targets for me to play with and more pew pew if only deputies can see someones gcc then there is already a bit of a balancing factor to this as anyone in system who is not a deputy would not have any notice of a gcc event not really a big boon for the pirates but its somethingbesides being a warpable beacon wont help the locals catch you just keep warping around the system until your gcc wears off i imagine that activating a cloaking device would cause the beacon to disappear what about wormholes if i cant dock or jump i should still be able to pop through a wormholewhat about allowing a pirate corporation to take control of these beacons then what ovo
i didnt see the part with slower sentry guns in the opif they slow sentry guns are we going to see instalocking thrashersstilletoes on every gate catching frigates long enough for a second point then warping offmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
1everythings air droppable at least once
dont think it was it would probably take 3 posts to put all the information together at this point as people bring up balance concerns ive taken that into account and suggested changes or additionsthats one of those balance things to consider during developmentid see that as being a valid stratif the pirates can prevent a fleet from taking over the concord outpost and beefing up the gate guns they should get the benefit of being able to catch and kill most targets they find
so whats the problemis it the afk cloakers that are causing these issues is it cloaking or is it just afk in generalhaving people disappear from local when they cloak will not help as you dont know if they logged off or just cloaked up if i wanted to play with your mind i could then do 2 things log off or cloak which would effectively remove me from local on both occasions thus rendering the argument that im in a cloaky obsolete i could cloak up a number of times and then just log off for the rest of the daynight thus making you more paranoid thinking i have cloaked am still in your system and ready to hot drop a fleet on you at any moment while all along im running incursions on an alt making money 40 jumps away if however the afk issue itself is addressed than we might be on the right track if you go afk for more than lets say 30 mins you get logged off automagically that is not a typo i did that on purpose this would remove you from local and make you guys who are paranoid about cloakys appearing off your starboard bow a little less paranoid would it not oh no it wouldnt because the ones that are still there in localwell they might not be afk after allthe same could go for stations also seeing as i could have my corpalliance all log in and sit in a station all day while being afk thus giving you the impression that its not a good idea to hang around due to the fact that you might get blobbed by all us afkershowever setting an auto logout for being afk will effect all you afk miners out there and we cant have that now can wemy opinion is play cautiously if you dont want to risk it then dont be out there expect the unexpected as it will happen and when it does just be ready to gtfo as fast as possible if that wont workbring some back up or even better have your clone up to date
i like the ideas in this thread pi needs more work defiantly to turn it into a full profession
while ccp has a priorty list that may or may not most likely and sadly not include pi feature enhancements a feature update that provides a time to completion of the installed programs on the extractors as well as current storage capacity would be very handyits very similar to everything else we currently have from industry activities via the si window to the market to our character skill sheetall of which converge to meet the goal of getting pi done quickly so you can buy more spaceships
supportedwhat id like to see on that tabyou open the tab same as now with a list of every planetsingle click a planet and underneath it will list every installation there is on the planetinstallations will list the followig extractor heads number of heads what its extracting extractor time and current total amount storage facilitiesspaceports amount of space left in them possibly add the ability to click on these and get another expanded overview of whats in there industrial facilities what they are manufacturing time till next batch is complated optionally add the stores of the products needed for the manufacture and howmuch of what is available in them command center level cpugrid in useleft howmuch m3 storage is left expandable with a list of whata is in there like a storage facility
while not trying to change the topic i see no need to post a completely new thread either  a thought comes to mindsome featurettes that are associated with this topic should also be consideredlinking pi to the contract system such as  the ability to buy and sell colonies this idea should be vetted in light of dust 514 the ability to contract ie courier and item exchange items directly from the customs office hangarand lastly the ability to operate corporate pi colonies which would be linked to the corporate roles system in the same way as they are with possin my opinion this would go a long way to fully integrating planetary interface into eve online and place it on par with the other industry professions
naga tokiba wrotesupportedon the pi tab i would like to see whats being extracted whats being produced weather extractors are running or not additionally there should be an option to reinitiate an already set cycle time program from the si window once a planet site is set there should be no reason to be forced into to planet view unless the site itself needs to be modified i have five accounts and all have alts dedicated to pi all accounts are paid for by my production there is no reason for a simple restart to take nearly 2 hours when a single button can restart current program and have all five accounts done in 15 minutes
with the corporate involvement in pi the customs office needs to have at least 2 tabs for storage one for me and one for the corp i can then keep a portion and also give a portion to my corp which will give access to any approved individual to make a pickupcorporate access and interaction to pi is a must especially with the coming dust 514 as it stands now pi is a one person project meaning that if i create a site nobody in the eve universe can touch it once dust 514 comes in these sites with then be under fire which will ultimately mean me against the universe the corpalliance will need to know when it comes under fire as a pos does and be able to defend it accordinglythe last potential connection is to allow corpmates access to your sites for any reason ie on vacation waiting on bail hearing etcthe last two points will take a lot of consideration for the mechanics but with the oncoming dust 514 they will be necessary
t3 are supposed to be more specialised i think if you want a particular bonus only and want it as strong as possible t3 should be the ship you use t3 boosting is just the new falcon alt its a serious amount of bonus you get here not to mention you can dic nullify it and it makes a great scout too  probes etc as for unprobability its still  hard to scan down a t3 running eccm and any discusion about cs balancing isnt really the point herei just want the old days of flying the claymore back
would support this if it were paired with a rebalancing of the warfare processor subsystems to make them more practical for ongrid use and a reworking of the squishier fleet commands
perfectly reasonable
supporting this post
i like this proposalevery reason to bring people to populate lowsec is goodhowever like others here i do believe that this is a onesided proposalstrengthening the good side is a valid idea filling a missing piece of gameplay in lowsec but it might as well discourage pirates to actually go fight in those playersecured systemsmy point being could we imagine a system that gives a bit of reward to pirates in those playersecured systems deputies would gain concord lps for bringing pirates down so why not give a similar reward to the latterthe system could work as follow in unclaimed lowsec systems pirates could gain tiny lp reward based on ships ss difference etc with the cartel counterpart of the official empire for kills in playersecured lowsecs pirates would get an overall better lp reward and a special bonus for taking down deputies themselvesfrom a rp point of view it would reinforce the idea of lowsec being a buffer area with the nullsec cartelcontrolled areas and also give motives to pirates to fight in those deputiessecured systemsjust my 2 isks
i like the idea of pirate lps for killing deputiesif you want to take it a step further and create lowsecspecific pve content you could have pirate and concord missions where the job requires venturing into enemyoccupied space again probably better for ccp to put that sort of detail into it im more interested in creating a new system for small groups to get more action
actualy that will not effect afk miners att all depends on timer if you run with bonuses each 10 mins you defently ned to do somting with that char you cant just wait longer
eh this is exactly why it does help
and even more is possible how about a template system for site creation eventually it will be required to relocate a site on a planet that is if you are a serious in your pi entrepreneurship site setup involves far too many clicks just to arrange my intentionsthese templates are to be of our own design as to permit our own philosophy on what is the correct way of doing things there can only be so many structures as permitted by command center limitations perfect placement to minimize resource usage can be quite a hassle the template constructor would provide an intuitive grid placement system blanket assignments for product choices alone would take 12 of the time off site setup the template can do this as it is in most situations unlikely a single site will produce multiple productsthe need and process of the the extractor head relocation does make sense and i am not sure how to improve that but the setup of everything else is far to tedious and time consuming the clickfest of pi has the potential to be a mouse killer all by itself a template system would make pi a more appealing activity in the eve universe a benefit for all both on the individual and corporate scalethen there is the potential involvement of dust 514 that will
i agree with what you say there should be some sort of reward for doing plexes however nothing in a game matters except the game itself what does winning at amateur baseball or chess matter yet people enjoy those games the thing is in order to be good a game needs to be fun and perhaps even require skills that people for whatever reason value athleticism toughness intelligence whatever the main problem with occupancy plexxing is currently the most effective way to run plexes is with pve alts this tends to make people not value being good at running fw plexes if being good at running plexes was a better indicator of pvp skill then i think this goal of winning faction war would be more valued and therefore sought after people would want to win faction war if winning faction war was an indicator of pvp skill people who just say they want winning faction war to somehow give them isk or something miss the big picture isk can only be used in this game if you have nothing to use the isk for in game then there is no point in getting it if you have something worth doing in the game like winning faction war then you have a point to get isk people who think the reason to win faction war is to get isk are mostly putting the cart before the horse people often miss this key point so ill give an exampleconsider lotteries lotteries are stupid games winning requires no skill anyone values and looking up numbers in and of itself is not fun if the lottery only paid UFFFDgame moneyUFFFD that could be used to buy more lottery tickets and never paid money that could be used for any other purpose no oneor very few would play the lottery the only reason people play the lottery is to win real money UFFFD not because it is fun or demonstrates any sort of skill that is valued in the community well the same principals apply to faction war and eve generally if the only thing you get is isk that can be used in game but the game itself involves no skills the community values and is not much funUFFFDi think you can see where this is going giving people the ability to play a bad game longer will not make it a good game ccp needs to change the bad game mechanics of fw occupancy to make it fun and involve skills people in this community value if they just say UFFFDhere is a bunch of isk for doing this thing we know is boring and meritlessUFFFD they are not improving eve they need to figure out how to make fw plexxing fun and UFFFDwinning fwUFFFD be something players think demonstrates meritorious skills i think this proposal is a good way to accomplish thatmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
then i expect to see some sort of results
interesting but then i demand the ability to kidnap people in high sec and keep them hostage under the same conditions until they pay their ransom
no concord should biomass them instead
im sorry but how does this allow continued freedom of gameplay in which you want to do the penality for pirating is already negative security status in which you must then ratcarebear in order to regain security status now you are proposing to take away peoples game time in which they pay for or at the expense of podding themselvesnext you are going to suggest that piratesoutlaws once reaching 5 security status are banned from high sec for 6 months or some 
oh noez someones suggesting actions have consequences
locking someone out of the game for engaging in valid gameplay is never an appropriate consequence
i support this idea if you sec status go back to 00 after punishment
i like the idea but instead of holding a control bunker or at least in augmentation of it it should require a pos presence as wellthis would ensure that the industry element of a corp is in tact and make eve itself more balanced
this is a good idea but i would push it farther and make the control bunker a type of pos or maybe a type of tcu perhaps require a concord charter as a fuel requirement and a certain level of corp standings to anchor and maybe a certain corp sec status to keep it online
the only thing a mandatory pos would ensure is a headache youre delusional if you think a pos brings about industry industry may require a few poses but it doesnt work vice versaanyways op i have to say this is a great idea but i have to strongly disagree with the gcc beacons following players that would just swing the pendulum too far against piratesyoure going to get systems where there are always deputies online and moving beacons would basically make any nonfrigate piracy an act of suicide while confining piracy to frigates seems to make sense in practice it would be bad gameplaya general one time beacon at the gcc site would allow pirates to make short work of soft targets but for anything serious theyd be taking a big risk
fleet up with someone and try to catch them using warp to member its not as easy as you think remember than when you warp to a moving target you warp to where it is when you click warp not to where its going this will just mean that pirates in concordcontrolled systems would have to be willing to run like hell for 15 minutes
 add skillz in science mechanics and industry  and then some use of reports and a few other material to then produce a blue print that will create a self deploying command center and installation template  just a cool thought to compliment your idea
again not trying to get off topic but even within the pi viewer there needs to be an update to the hudcase in point the home button and close button in the current iterationthere should be a button for each installation type or at the very least the extractorstake for example a gas planet  if you have command center upgrades to lvl v and your not just doing pi for base or tier i or ii production then you might be forced to be creative with your extractor placement which will inevitably be away from your command center so why should any pilot have to hunt for ones extractor simply because its not next to their command centeror when the supply line is stretched half way across the planet and you have to repeatedly drag the cursor to get to the extractorthis is a sorely needed pi hud update
this is a well thought out ideai followed the old link and it has good support1 from me
i would only support this after a certain amount of time for accounts that were never paid
10
get rid of the unpaid trial accounts first definatlybut deleting old characters that dont get used no thanks those toons might have legacyshistory attached to them or more importantly many veteran eve players return eventually
only if they have only been never paid a dime trail accountsanyone who had paid for the service should be protected from having thier names wiped out dust 514s cpm 1 iron wolf saber eve mail me about dust 514 issues
just alow for similar names its very posible to do so if you code it propperly and give and number to the end of name wich cant be seen
fix pls
ive often wished for a mission journal history even for noncosmos missions  maybe we could add history for all missions
jesus mani remember seeing these pictures and getting so excited and then forgetting about it again as nothing happend here for all of you whom did not have the pleasure of seeing these when they origionaly got postedorigional thread
4th link for exhibitde is broken
great idea to help flesh out the pirate side
my problem with afk cloakingits killing fleet fights is currently uncounterable and its forcing a shift of gameplay that requires you to have a second account if you want to peeveepee in 00what is becoming an ever increasing standard  is that players should have alt accounts which have a cloakey covops and covert cyno generator owner of the player moves the chararacter to system x his mates whom also have cloakey alts set them up in system y z and a  meaning that over 50 of the constelation has an afk cloakey with covert cyno capabilitiesafk cloakey is left to be afk while the owner focuses on his main character which is pvping elsewhere ratting in a wormhole basicly doing whatever heshe wants to do at the timewith dualscreens or simply tabbing to the afk cloakey character at regualr invervals to check local chat and dscan looking for easy targets if the people in the system move to another system no problems youre mates probably jsut told you as they noticed local spike on their afk cloakeywhen a target presents itself 1 minute later theres 3050 people in system their targets dead and theyre allready in warp towards the exit as they know the path back to their blackops pilot is clear as they have their other afk cloakeys in the next adjacent systemshonestly  what can you do to counter thathow is this a good fight or fun for anyone other than the turkey laughing manicly as he lights the cyno and the fleet that jumps in to kill stuff they know they have absolutely no chance of being able to survive or pick off any of their crew as they essentialy pick and choose all their fightshow can one counter this without having double their numbers in system 237 waiting for them to strike which is not a viable solution afk cloaking needs to be looked at unless you want fleet fights in 00 to be replaced in their entirity with blobs supercapblobs and hotdrops because at current why would you go out with 2050 people roaming around looking for a fight when everyone else just hotdrops onto you or onto other targets its too easy and provides too much safety to the attackers in regards of the people doing it never having too initiate a fight that they are not certain that they will win even more so if they are operating from a 00 npc station which in effect makes them unevictable
are you sure you understand what is discussed in this thread or what afk means for that matter pain is weakness leaving the body
yes when a player is not actively using the client  or at their computeragain  theyre not using the afkcloak for anything other than glancing at the screen every now and then theyre flying around having a blast doing missions etc on another account therefor the clien that hast the character thats cloaked  is afk and not being used for the mostpartstill applies to the they are there but are they realy there aspect of afk cloaking  and it seems that for the mostpart of this thread the coupling of the afk cloaker with hotdrops hasnt been discussed
then its not afk cloaker but pretty ordinary scoutwatchmanworks as intended theres no requirement for a certain minimum number of mount clicks or key presses per minute and some activities  like being watchman or mining or missioning  naturally require less number of mouse clicks and key presses than some other activitiesbecause its a logical absurd and this whole thread is mentally challenged anywaypain is weakness leaving the body
agree that this demonstrates much of what is wrong or right depending on pov and what type of play you personally are into atm with 00 today  but separate issue from afking or afk cloaking imo we dont need to nerf 00 a lot of ppl like it the way it is  but rather create new 00like spaces that allow for additional types of game play iesmall homesteader regions  regions where cyno  transport is horribly limited etc
abstract tldr removing ice from high sec would greatly benefit the eve market in many waysbackgroundive traded ice for several years ive watched market trends as well as ridden events like todays oxygen isotope runremoving ice from high would cause a very big change in eve starting with the more obvious rising iso prices which would directly effect pos fueling costsless supply in empire would decrease the amount of macro miners in eve i do not have real statistics however through empirical data ive seen many people warp to the belt cut for a while and warp offmost of what ive seen is not a group activity but a solo activity a solo activity that seems like it would be easy to accomplish with a botwith rising pos fuel prices many different markets would be effectedrd prices would go up bpcs would increase as well as bpo research with an increase in bpc prices t2 prices would also suffer the trickle effectwhile supply and demand are always linked if ice products rise in price pi would suffer a shortfallif a corp can not afford isos they will also not be purchasing coolant for example if a corp can not afford the fueling for a tower they would be less likely to buy a tower further trickling pi and pi manufacturingt2 production speculation is a very interesting topic indeed currently fuel already costs close to the gross of a creaction twin tower setup complex reaction further fuel price increases would drive the t2 margin down cutting supply of lower end reactions when the lower end reactions suffer a supply shortfall however it will in fact drive down more valuable moon minerals down as well technetium should fall as well as r3264 matsonce the markets reaches a state of equilibrium overall t2 production should become profitable again with the more abundant creactions value increasing where the current bottlenecks value decreasing ie silicates go up tech goes downplease note i said ice should be removed from high sec not low seclowsec ice abundance would still allow availability for aspiring corps to access however people whom reap benefits from botting or going afk would not be able to gain resources as easilyfrom my mathematical simulations i would expect isos to equalize around 900isk1100isk per six months to one year after implementation

tldrships require fuel to warp industrial and t1 frigs require very little fuel battleships require lots of fuelship fuel proposal v0991 a the goal is to encourage solo and small numbers equivalently discourage blobs encourage use of small and t1 ships equivalently discourage large and t2 ships the main idea for achieving this is limiting ship travel distance for combatships a single solar system can support the daily activities of a limited number ofpilots exception mission running hubs so people tend to spread out however the easytravel allows the blob to form quickly and go anywhere i expect making travel hard forcombat ships to act as a force which tends to keep the people spread out  for any givengroup it would be easier to attack them with small numbers and it would be easier forthem to attack with small numbers  because the blob would be slow and costly to form andmove the concrete mechanism to achieving these goals is introducing ship fuel in order to be able to warp a ship needs a certain amount of fuel per au stored in a fuel bay in addition to the capacitor in the absence of fuel a ship can still warp but at a greatly reduced warp speed something in the ballpark of twenty times slower so nobody is left stuck in spaceshuttles and rookie ships do not require fuel the fuel bay is separate from the cargo hold game balance is affected by modifying two variables one variable is the volume of the fuel bay which determines the maximum distance a ship can travel without refueling the guiding principle behind fuel bay volume is that harmless ships travel long distances dangerous ships travel short distances second variable is the fuel consumption per au for each ship class and for each ship within a class again harmless ships are cheap to deploy dangerous ships are costly to deploywithout picking too much on what is harmless and what is dangerous taking into account the fuel consumption and fuel bay volume here are some tentativedistances for different classes of ships with base distance traveled without refuelingbeing 1000au t1t2 industrial ships jump freighters mining barges orca rorqual  100 1000 au covops not bombers t1 nonfaction frigs and destroyers  70 700 au t1 nonfaction cruisers and battlecruisers  50 500 au t2 frigs faction frigs t2 destroyers  33 330au force recons and bombers  25 250 au combat recons hacs fleet command ships faction cruisers heavy interdictors logistics strategic cruisers  15 150 au field command ships battleships  10 100 au numbers are tentative and while the concrete values may decrease the proportion shouldstay very similar the goal is for t1 frigs to be able to travel across a region and backwhile battleships to be limited to 45 average systems without refueling may needtweaking some systems radii harmless ships travel much dangerous ships travel littleb nature of the fuel it would be preferable to have an wholly different kind of fuelrather then reusing ice products because increasing their demand willaffect negatively other venues comedy option  npc good sold onlyfor aur seriously probably a new planet commodity would be a goodideac fuel tanker class ship a new class of ships is created under advanced industrial ships  tankers their roleis to accompany fleets and refuel combat ships they have a large fuel bay and it ispossible for other ships to refuel from tankers in space it is not possible to refuelships by any means other than from tanker fuel bays and personal or corporate stationhangars specifically it is not possible to refuel a ship from any ship cargo hold ornontanker fuel bay two new ships are created for each races  blockade runner tanker and deep space tankerbased on the existing transport ship hulls with the cargo hold bonus changed to fuel baybonus the base fuel bay volume is subject to game balance with the goal for a single blockaderunner tanker to be able to increase the effective range of a 34 cruiser hulls to thenext class and a single deep space tanker to be able to increase the effective range of34 battleship hulls to the next class bs class range to hac class range t1 cruiserrange to t1 frig ranged related skillsthe fuel consimption is affected by the skill warp drive operation which is modified byadding to its description each skill level reduces the fuel needed for initiating warp by 5thats all for nowps naturally there are also jump bridges and cyno jump mechanics which also will be scaled down drastically this will be amended in a following version of the proposalpain is weakness leaving the body
you do realise there are plenty of systems that youd be making it impossible to cross in anything bigger than a frigate right i dread to think what would happen if you actually wanted to use a bs or a cap in actual combat with this frankly awful proposal are you trying to make it completely and totally impossible to function away from empire how exactly would this encourage small gangs when you can cover maybe a dozen systems round trip with a hac gang maybe twenty at a push in bcs youd kill small gangs completely itd be impossible to actually go anywhere without multiple tanker pilots and who the hell wants to fly a slow lumbering unarmed and paper thin hauler when everyone else in the gang is in a hacthis idea is awful in every conceivable way would make it virtually impossible to actually fight and actually taking sov just wouldnt happen ever againtrolling removed zymurgist
great idea lets kill roaming gangs all together and if someone feels bold enough to even bring out battleship lets limit his jumps by fuelmaybe leave faction warfare and go have some real pvp maybe
there are tons of systems in eve 100 aus across and several on the order of 250 aus imagine trying to move a fleet of 20 bss across a 200 au system now everyone drops out of warp at different locations due to slightly different quantities of fuel then a hauler has to warp to each ship and drop fuel so they can warp again and it might require multiple refuels to get across one system this proposal basically makes titan bridges and jump bridges teh only effective means to move a conventional fleet im sorry but you really need to go back to the drawing board because this suggestion is gamebreaking bad
yes thats why i have written that some system sizes would need to be changed no i am not what in the proposal would make it impossible to function away from empirethis is written in the proposal peoples activities make them spread naturally across systems it would be slower for people to concentrate in a big blob this applies both for attacking and defenseyou would be able to cover more systems with t1 frigates and cruisers you may maintain strategically positioned fuel depotsi think you havent read carefully the proposal and dont understand it and its implications well yes there are some weak points that im thinking about but you didnt seem to notice themplease try to be constructive youre not scoring anything on the forumspain is weakness leaving the body
yes thats why i have written that some system radii would need to be changed do you see any significant issues which may arise if some systems are made smallerps i have also written that in the absence of fuel a ship can still warp but at a greatly reduced speed in fact the warp drive may operate in two modes switchable via right click menu hotkey etc  one fast consuming fuel and one very very slow consuming only capacitor yes if they stay in their current form thats why i have written that their range need to be drastically shortenedpain is weakness leaving the body
as we all know low sec is empty lacking content and so onsure we have fw blobs pirates camping and roaming incursions are ran there sometimes but not fequantly because hey there is hswhat this is about is adding more content to low secover the past few years we have seen improvements for hs 00 and so onthe only major change they made was that bses will spawn in some ls systems wow wee not compared to all the love hs has been getting and low seccpp should add more content to low secsuch as 1 having pirate missions in ls these missions would not be located in a station they would be an agent in space this will allow ganking of people at the agents who are rolling missions the lp scale will make the null sec ones still better than these lowsec ones this would not be anything major because all the coding for agents in space is all ready there and mission data is all ready there2 fw improvements a having controll of a system would give bounses to that faction for running lets say a complex that would yeild faction drops at the end it would be a complex that would spawn randomly in system owned a faction it would have an officer npc of lets say gall fed it has the chance of dropping faction mods these would not be soled and would have a few rooms like other faction warfare sites they would have a beacon people could warp in on so pirates and other people can come in milita memebers would be able to see these on their map in their rejoin as a hostile attack of an opossing faction on their teritory it would take about 510 people to do them a maybe incorparate some sleeper ai3 sytems bounses for pirates a pirates would have the ability via acivity as of killing other plays and a system of ship point vaule would remain in the system so the system where fw lp points that base the ships modstypescale to award the corperation with bounses these bounes could do the followinga sentery guns do less damage a volleyc while in a system with a booster upgrade it reduces the negitve effects of the boosterd system bonuses would not be listed on the map etc this would also help a pirate group of getting a larger bigger bad group into this x system they do most of their activity ofc the bonuses would go down over time and there could be other factors of loosing these points one could just be straight up loosing ships in that system
