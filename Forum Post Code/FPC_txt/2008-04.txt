zensti have a wet dream that roughly looks something like thisplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesit should be self evident what it shows  and im not going to spend alot of thought on it here unless by demandas i honestly dont see ccp
i disagreefirst of all most csm candidates point out how much they know about the game etc if you csm people only needed to listen why would you need that knowledge just jot down whatever were saying and pass it on to ccp simple no anyone could be csmi think you need to participate in any discussion on the forums here were trying to convince each other of various points and nuances related to whatever topic and its better for us to convince you that what were saying makes sense than it is for you to just copy it down to give it to ccp without caring about or understanding the details id rather argue with you than write tornsoul give this to ccp blah blah blah and bring back an answerbesides sometimes a this wont work because of x reason is just as valid coming from you as it is coming from ccp since you have all that experience with the game and can tell what works and what doesnt we dont need to wait for ccp to tell us that they wont add arkonor roids to lowsec for example you can explain just as well as they can why thats not balanced and wont be added should a discussion about it spring up
i agree experience and knowledge is important attributes for csm memberswhich is excactly why i also saidi didnt intend to imply that the csm should simply take anything thrown at them and present to ccp without giving it some thought and giving some feedback themself as wellin fact i believe that feedback will be the main factor by wich the csm members ultimatly will be judged
i implied in my earlier posts in this thread that i have done that and considered listing them here as well but it seemed this thread was about you so i did not deem it appropriate to expand it to include your opponents in here actually it was another candidate that got me checking up because from my view it seemed they sort of appeared out of nowhere i appreciate the addition of more calm and well reasoned voices on the forums i just wish they had been around more and found the reason they now appeared was for the csm why not before if they are so interested in evewell it is not necessarily repeating when responding to a lengthy thread your voice can be used to further debunk an idea or to support it with new arguments or just a vote as it were for the idea or you can modify the idea and bend it a different direction based on what others have written well you are correct csm should listen but presumably the csm members are elder statesmen of eve who can sort through the muck and recognize the gems to present to ccp it is fine and indeed good if they present ideas of their own for consideration this shows the rest of us the thrust of their thinking and how they handle themselves in the face of flames and their willingness to modify their ideas as more information and new ideas are offered for instance if someone was just sure that concord should be in every system a and will not bend from that view i think it is safe to say we would not want to see that person on the csm i am not implying you do just using an extreme to illustrate the idea not trying to be a pain here but with no posting history to speak of along those lines how are we really to judge
i was thinking along the lines of perhaps putting it in winterblinks thread with a post for each candiate that could then be linked to along with the other links  and perhaps serenity steele will pick it up as well
good ideai had not considered that i was waiting for the other candidates to stick their necks out here for me have at
the forum stats were added to all candidates on monday night now if i could just get xml of those stats and show it in a graph 
yeah i saw that steelehowever what imperator jorah did was more of a qualitative analysis of the numbers rather than just listing themthe quantitative listings youve provided via evesearch are handy as well  not taking away from that at allbut id like to see the qualitative analysis for the others as well  i find it interesting 
this is going to be hard to pick i agree with the agenda you are putting for the torn luck to you
good luck tornme and ts go way back weve built big together as a team me behind the scenes with all the crazy ideas and him in the foreground being steady and cautiousi know torn personally as a reliable and levelheaded person hes not going to storm into ccp with ideas for sweeping and ultimately unrealistic changes hell be able to get the job done i think better than anyonei think that his campaign website is a prime example of his ability to be realistic about what he can accomplish and how he plans to accomplish itim of course about as biased as one could be but wouldnt you be biased if your best friend ran for electionbig and tornsoul both care very much about this game weve built up a family around it whose ties run deep we regularly meet in iceland for fanfest having a large percentage of our members attend both 06 and 07as for the old websites record of tornsoul being a member since 2002 i believe that tornsoul founded big as soon as he found out what eve was long before beta even started so big has existed as a group since long before the game was released through beta from the very beginning until the presenthes watched the game develop from the start and i think has a good grounding in what eve was meant to be and where it can feasibly goand as far as anything soul of fountain has done weve just joined so im sorry if youve had misgivings about them  but weve only been in the group for a few daystornsoul isnt that active on these forums for two good reasons first of all because bigs forums are quite active in themselves and tough to keep up with second because the trolling in these forums can be so intense as to drown out any real discussion about basically anything me and torn have both felt that one of the best places to discuss anything about eve in a civilized manner is to be at fanfest drinking beer ppeople with long forum resumes or a history of combat experience does not automatically make them a good candidate youve gotta look at the whole picture youre not sending a character to iceland youre sending a person and you dont want that person to be nothing more than just an angry nerd or obsessed combat pilot with lots of time to kill just because that character has been loud on the forums and gotten many kills ingame does not make them the best person to guide ccp in developing evei dont think it really matters much that hes not been engaged with the ships  modules forum is mere ship balance or module fitting issues the only thing that youre concerned with in this game there is a lot more to eve than ships and shooting i like my share of pewpew but this is a have with far more levels people only have so much time an attention to spend on a game in the first place and you cant be everywhere at once  on all of the forums all the fan sites running a corp being ingame having a social life and a job irlps we were never in cfs we were in fa who conquered cfs space and were subsequently booted out
it would seem volt silenced everyone there must be more people though who would like to know my stanceinterest on this or that subject thoughor something completly different 
er du dansk 
tjah mit bud er at danskerne vil overtage csm
this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
 last but not least  the stuff that really really needs to be fixed because its outright brokencan you name 3 or more outright broken things with the game currently
ja  jeg er dansk and ill be at the gankaton this comming saterday 3 broken things at the top of my head  territorial warfare pos warfare beeing just one aspect of this  but probably the most visiblemoaned about thingjumpgatelane distribution leading to such things as jitaa myriad of gui stuffmenusinterfaces that really should be fixed admittedly few are game breaking but still
ermm okay call me stupid but i dont think its self evident will you elaborate or is it to say empires should be spatially divided by lowsecnullsec oh if so then that is hot
self evident after all then i could write page after page after page after page about all the good stufftm such a distribution would do and fascilitate in evebut again way to radicali dont see the majority of the player bases wanting iti dont see ccp wanting it or rather deal with the outraged player base if forcing the changetoo radical  is why its just my wet dream
if ts does not have time for eve forums why should anyone suppose he has time for csm he certainly had time to promote big stuff on the forumsif ts cannot stand the trolling why should anyone suppose he is now able to stomach it what about the inevitable trolls that will pound on the csm having a forum history does not make a good candidate but it does give people here and ability to see who the candidate is what they are about what ideas they support and how they respond to varying ideas and people we just have to go with you and a few other peoples opinion that ts is a really good guy he probably is but i would really like to have seen someone who exhibited a concern and put in an effort to make eve better before the csm came on the scene if not for the csm i think it is safe to assume wed never see any of tss ideas
really not going to vote for someone running a lottery
erhermtornsoul isnt that active on these forums doesnt equal if ts does not have time for eve forumsive already said that i read a humongous amount of posts on the eve forumsid say i spend an average of 1h a day give and take keeping uptodate on various topics of interest  and watching for new interesting poststrendsim no longer the most prolific poster around aka active on these forums granted i mostly prefer to listen read and internalize whats going on  for that big picture feelmost issues have most sides debated to death by thousand of other peoplewhile i understand where youre comming from with regards to knowing who i am i simply dont or rarely have the urge to repeat what has already been said just to say see me i also think x on issues 1 through 5000 im sorry but that just doesnt ring my bellif it makes no difference if i make a comment to a post or not i usually prefer not to make iti prefer to make my opinion known where i feel it either makes a difference or adds something newthe frequency of this seems to not be to your personal liking  so be itwill it mean i wont get enough votes  maybe so be ityou saidive always appreciated the work and honesty with which big has done its thing for eve at large and respect the job it has done for the eve communityand now you sayi would really like to have seen someone who exhibited a concern and put in an effort to make eve better before the csm came on the scene if not for the csm i think it is safe to assume wed never see any of tss ideasthose dont equateone paragraph is about big the other about me specifically and honestly saying i havent done anything for eve before the csm those two go very much hand in hand though so what you say about one goes for the other as well to an extreme degreeso both cant be correct
ill take the baitwhy on earth notid be very intersted in you elaborating on that  seriously
i do not think those two statements are at oddsfirst though realize my last post was debunking the notions i quoted in that postas to what you said big has expanded eve in interesting directions but as i noted before it did so entirely for its own benefit that is 100 fine and cool eve as a whole benefitted from what big does but it is not altruism that drives bigtornsoul as a csm candidate is a different matter while pointing to what you did with big is worth noting it is not the whole answer tornsoul is not a big representative in csm tornsoul is supposed to be a representative of all the players of eve on the csmwhat happens if an idea comes before the csm to propose to ccp that is contrary to bigs interests if you had posted in the past i and others would have a sense if you will argue for changes that you feel are overall better for eve or if you will protect your corner of it you can see this clearly in many threads from other people some few will argue for a better eve most will kick and scream if you mess with whatever it is no matter how unbalancedi find the notion that you do not reply because all you have to say has already been said puzzling surely you have some spipn to offer to an idea or lend support for a really good idea so maybe ccp will pay attention or have a new idea all your own you would like vetted on the forums you certainly seem a bright guy and it sounds like you have lots of ideas i for one would have liked to hear them and discuss themi am merely noting i have no good way to assess the above i also noted before there are some others running who are equally lacking in this department so ill have to wait and see and i do mean to point this out in the csm candidate thread when i get some time i know it looks like i am here to bust your balls but that really is not my intent
would you still want the job if there was no free trip to icelandhonestly
and im trying to tell you they are if you have a different opinion then ill simply accept thatas a hypothesis say big was making mostall of its isk from t2 printssay a game change was suggested that would render t2 prints nearly worthless comparatively but would benefit eve overallid back it in a hearth beatto even have a chance of you believing that apart from believing that i generally dont go around telling lies  id have to tell you a bit about bigbig as a corp is extremely adaptive we dont put all our eggs in one basket goes abit against the hypothesis about making most isk of t2 prints  but follow me here so any game change regardless what ccp might throw at us would not hurt us muchand were the kind of corp that thrives on a challenge theres simply so many ways in eve to have your funmake your isk that i honestly dont fear ever hitting that big over eve or eve over big dillemmabecause should it come i know what id choose alreadyyes i also have a big obligation towards the well beeing of my corp and its members as well but trying to influence eve simply for the sake of a personal or proxy via my corp advantage simply wont happenim simply not wired that wayyou can believe that or not  it wont change a thingits simply how ive always run my and bigs affairsthe only example i can give of this thats remotely relevant is all the times the big lottery have paid out prizes to ingame enemiesnot excactly helping big supplying our enemies with isk is itits not the best example so no reason to knitpick at it but its the best i can think of atmlike i said earlier im honestly looking forward to seeing your analysis of the other canditates so dont worry
already answered once in this threadbut ill quotewhat i forgot to mention in the above quote but which is noted on my campaign website is that im also going to ff08 this year i assume therell be a ff08 ofc the free trip to iceland for csm members really isnt a lure for me  due to the timing of it having to take days of workand come ff08 i can easily afford to pay my own way to iceland i got a well paid job  so shrug
guys seriously those are damn cheap shots not even i would go to those lows i personally cant imagine for a minute anyone who would go to those lengths to get a free trip to iceland the application process setting up a website making stuff up to get people to vote you and finally releasing your real name to the whole of eve just for a holiday that you spend with some internet geeks discussing the future of a game of internet spaceships alrighty get a grip
you are definately gonna get my votes aswell 
thanks zola
i vote for yuo to
no thanks  didnt you make enough of a mess of the fa back in the day

now as you can probably guess im in the camp that feels that local gives us too much intelligence and actually reduces the opportunity for combat since in the current state of play everyone knows too much about what the likely opposition has on the table and can simply opt not too engage if they dont like the odds sure you can duck this a little if you are the owner of a jump bridge or titan or to a degree black ops covert portal or if you are really cheesy you can do those horrible login trap things  but all of this is only powerful because otherwise your enemy knows precisely what you have in local and the next local and can react accordingly what if that knowledge wasnt free wasnt near omnipotent what if tactical uncertainty existed and fcs and residents in 00 space could only be sure about what existed within range of their ships sensors what if scouting performed a far great role what if you could simply hide a reinforcement fleet out beyond the orbit of a distant planet what if you had to actually use big probes and exhaustive longrange scanning to ensure that the enemy had nobody one system over to jump in once the battle had startedit would make combat more hazardous itd lead to some terrible surprises of course it would be scary for territorial powers because theyd need to do some actual active patrolling to know what was passing through their claimed territory rather than just putting alts in stations it would be scary for npc hunters to a degree since theyd need to have the long range scan open and check proximity rather than just watching local but  it would also mean that hostiles hunting those ratters would have to scan and search systems properly to find their prey rather than just burning through every system in a wide area until they see people in local of course some changes would have to come with this 1 the map intel would need to change and stop being a freelunch no point being a ninja ratter watching your scanner diligently and counting on the security of a big system to protect you from bad guys when the game map is happily announcing to the entire server that youve killed 1001 guristas in the last 8 hours anyone hoping to come and kill you should at least have to make the effort of scanning for wrecks as they pass through the system and make the connection2 the long range scanner should become more customizable and user friendly  it should be able to give a proximity warning if you set it up that way for example if you were ratting youd want any new ship contact within your maximum range scan to pop up on your screen with flashing letters and an audible alarm thats just reasonable payoff for the fact you are no longer able to see enemies come into local3 cloaked ships are another problem realistically you are going to have to be able to scan for cloaked signatures and be warned of their approach you shouldnt ever be able to narrow them down or get specific ship information or warp to them but if there is a cloaked ship in x range from your ship you should get a warning thats again the payoff for the removal of local think about it  without this and no local then all npc hunters would automatically die from cloaked recons warping to their belt and scrambling them for a gang to come in and kill fair is fair4 but there can be some excellent things too in my story i make reference to the fact that signatures are unknown by class by specific in that order when first detected all traces should be unknowns and depending on the ships involved the skills even the modules of scanning ships the process of refining the contacts into detailed knowledge takes time and maybe a bit of luck this stuff makes for drama and excitement adds some gray area and uncertainty to the engagement envelope and adds another layer of possibility to warfare
but the big thing is that removal of local and some in game map statistics tools in order to make 00 space big and scary and spacious again  a place where anything can happen and its possible to stage ambushes to evade patrols to find surprisebattles and where intelligencegathering and successful recon plays a vital role makes nonconcord unrestricted space an open environment of danger and possibility  and will make for some excellent space conflict and dramaas for the chat aspect  other players have already addressed this make 00 and potentially lowsec constellation based chat where your name only appears in the chat window if you say something people who want to chat can do so people who dont want to be seen for combat purposes for ratting for transit whatever dont immediately get ratted out to everyone else in the system so this is a post to kick a discussion amongst csm candidates and the general eve populace  what do you think about removal local chat from 00 and how do you envisage the game developing from this if it happens are you for or against the idea and why is thatlets have a discussion
thank god a real post for a change good your back jadei agree that local needs to go
kudosagree with all that the story helped to make me want these changes even more i hope ccp gets the same feelingit would perfect if you added this to your planscans done in 51530 degree range also show the ships pilot informationand nonpilot ships are taken out of the ship category on the scanner move them to a different categoryedit last additionadd a character count that works this way it shows one of the following messages wont show any number just one messagepopulated system this means theres more people active than you and your gang people do only count after staying 5 mins in the systemlone system this means you and your gang are the only pilotswhy a tiny bit of information is necessary just not to spend hours with the fleet ops just to discover youre alone in the system so you wasted your time this marker would at least give you a hint and since people only start to count after 5 mins in the system it would not ruin the stealth operations and it wouldnt confuse you marking as active people who are just jumping through gates
yep the highest level of intel on contacts should be pilot information agree also you should be able to remove not piloted ships from the focus search also something just occurred to me in the spirit of making intel gathering vital and removing all the free lunch intel from general game systems pilots should be able to toggle off the appearing with online status in other peoples address books if they choose no reason why an enemy should necessarily know with perfect accuracy whether x pilot is online or not this addressbooking of hostiles is another localish cheese technique of metagaming too much knowledge of the tactical situation in my opinion as always though im very interested to hear from other people on the issue
multipel acounts running same time still have bonus ingame intel and all no
good idea or maybe a do not show my status to the enemies of my corporation thing btw what do you think about my last idea edited on my previous post
im not keen because it would allow an alternative to actual scanning when people were hunting for loners in 00 systems for example its not a showstopper and i could definitely compromise on the issue but i do feel that focusing the 00 combat intelligence on the what you can scan from your ship angle is the way forward any kind of metareporting tool or functionality is giving away information that is not really earned by any positive effortif one group manages to sneak 20 ships into system or adjoining system whereor next too where another group is gate camping with 10 ie the 10 dont have a scout in scan range of incoming gate i dont want the 10 group to suddenly be alerted that this is now a populated system and smell a rat i think they must be attentive to scans and intel gathering or face the chance of being jumped by and losing initiative
potentially of course if somebody is putting a cloaked scout at a gate with and checking long range scan while also running a bs client elsewhere then he or she will get a benefit from that  but thats eve really ccp coded the system to let people run alts and multiple accounts and some things will never change
hmm  where to start enjoyed reading the fiction the game change suggestions are nicebut you lack 2 things1 log in traps become more effective2 oog out of game tools will become more effective even eve voicehowever its the best local replacement proposal i have read so far including one or two of my own eve is seriously lacking in information and sensoric warfare except ewar and this could give covops pilots new potential however i fear without automatic response tools ie your mentioned proximity alert this will kill the individual player other than pirate in lowseci have to word my next iteration on local removal in featuresideas forum
the changes youre proposing are too sweeping too big for ccps baby stepsthat said1 id be in favor of deployables that give the local sovereigns some sort of advantage as far as map intel the problem with map intel is that its too blackandwhite either you see everything everywhere or the delays half hour 1 hr 24 hrs are too poor a substitute for a suitable fog of war id prefer deployables that give the sovereign an intel advantage with the provision that an enemy scouting force can sneak in and take out these intel deployables before they transmit their warnings wanna be stealthy work at it2 im all for that also for a hud minimap of local and shiptoship communications so that if youre a fleet of 50 ships and each warps to a belt to check it out the information of whats present at each belt is then available to each ship in the fleet in the local map  overview  scanner window  all integrated information screens3 i think that a cloak that can be detected somehow is  well not a cloak if local is removed and we have to rely on scanning and proximity for information then stealth is good enough so id say remove cloaks and replace them with stealth ship is visible but hard to probe down lock on etc etc etc4 we already have an unknowns indicator and we will rely on it heavily once local is removed its the lag an empty system feels different than one where a 100ship fleet is waiting for youand anyway ideas are nice but everything that we suggest still is too big too radical for ccps baby steps so good luck
jade interesting idea but please either change the thread title to remove the csm part or move it to your campaign website the csm has note been voted on and you are not a member of it yet
jades post was a fun read just what i wish eve to be recalling someone on the forum somewhere mentioning passive scanning this made me come up with an idea after reading this threadactive  passive scanningpassive scanpassive scan would be a window with a button that says passive scan this window will paint contacts with weak shipsignaturestrength this way you can get a list of contacts mostly of ships but without indication of ship types or any location in space now cloaked ships will show up as weak contacts but they will likely be much nearer your position and if the passive scan is used when a recon is 30km off your ship the enlarged signal strength by nature of close proximity will indicate that a cloaked ship is nearby you would need luck or be tiringly paranoid to spot say a recon trying to catch you offguardthis passive scan may be used to gain knowledge that a cloaked ship is nearby especially if you accidentally happen to fly 30km near it clever manouvering may enable you to actually triangulate the position of a cloaked ship like a cloaked haulerwith recon ship they might be more stealthier and harder to spot but they will show up as weak signals but indistinquashable from regular passive contacts far off your positionactive scanactive scan will be a way to both search for and pinpoint the distance and vector to another ship a list of contacts will be displayed with info on shiptype distance and vector the important thing is that when a pilot presses the active scan button in the scan window his ship will radiate a much higher signal strength for the next 60 sec revealing his position to anyone simply looking at their scanning windowi like the notion of this making for a cat and mouse game where you can relax abit more if you are a miner or simply staying put at a safespotthe activity with active and passive scan will serve as a limited intel tool in a star system that no longer provide guaranteed intel on local pilots as well as giving people a fair chance in spotting launched probes doing an active searchprobing tools would perhaps need to be changed to balance the power to probe so that the prober isnt wasting his time doing so by having potential targets just warp away too easilyany ships that is not cloaked and is within visual range would show up differently on a passive scan indicating that these contacts are visuals
well we need a roadmap for change really many these things dont all come at once  but we should know where we want to be heading and its important to communicate that knowledge to the devs at ccp yep dont mind this in theory at all agreed thats all good stuff well its a visual cloak i guess with some ew stealthing think star trek i guess they always seem to know there is a cloaked ship out there somewhere maybe reduced detection range and such  but you do need to give people in localless setting the ability to be warned on cloaked ship proximity or cloaks become overpowered and npc hunters are dead meat sigh lag eh id rather not rely on that for detection mechanics well its still about vision at this point and im pretty interested to hear how the csm candidates and general eve populace feel about the local removal options for 00 all the best though and thanks for replying
i see your point ive changed csm discussion to csm campaign  in the prefix letting people know its to do with the campaign not some formal csm discussion subject that seem okay for you
yuor idea is good but i beleive by makig client to run one per mechine woudl make your porposal viable oterwise it is goign to benefit multipel acount holdersit is liek take 10 steps foward and 5 steps bakward
to be honest jenny eve benefits multiple account holders full stop and taking 10 steps forward to go 5 steps backwards still means youve gone five steps forward but then ive always been a glass half full kinda chap reallythank you for your feedback though its appreciated
is it even technically possible to only let one client run per machine i know that windows will let you start multiple copies of singleinstance applications if you run them as different usersalso i have access to about 4 computers in my house that can run eve so that issue is moot anyway
by the way id like map statistics to have new options in the 10 minute range that means ships killed in the last 10 minutes you know all the info
an excellent post jade my personal view is that the visibility of local channel is a problem because it operates at a consistent uniformity across an entire system what do i mean by this well regardless of where you are in a system local sees you  perhaps the omniscience you refer to in your post what systems lack is any sense of terrain theres nothing to hide in or behind no way to manouver and attempt to conceal yourself wether thats for offensive purposes or defensivei have suggested an alternative link under sig whereby systems have a form of weather  micro climates around planets and across space these microclimates  environments act to divide local into a series of sub channelsfor example all category a planets would create a yulain feild around them if youre close to a cat a planet you sit within that local channel stars might be surrounded by a different radiation enabling some scan frequencies whilst disabling othersthese fields would shift move expand and contract creating a dynamic shift of system weather and creating localised pockets of scannable space its the 18thc equivalent of hiding in a fog bank we could expand upon this idea by considering that certain microclimates are more or less common in certain regions of spacenow players have the opportunity to plot their course around through or into specific microclimates to wait in ambush or conceal their location from roving pirates an additional layer of tactical decision making evolves perhaps even a career path of pilots who specialise in tracking weather patternsthe solution need not sit wholey in the domain of the scanner we must consider also the topography of eve  the interstella equivalent of mist darkness woods and valleysc
remove local but add a radar type screen its totally idiotic to hit scan every few seconds if you want to know if something gets close
nice little story and a good description of the direction eve could go local could remain as a chat interface just remove the ability to view people in the system ie they are completely anonymousinvisible in that window until they choose to speakim not actively engaged in 00 warfare yet but making changes in this direction is going to make things a whole lot more interesting ill wagerregarding map intel aswell as already mentioned far too much intel can be viewed from it in turn this would encourage more timid people into low sec if their presence there wasnt a bright burning beacon on the mapid suggest a new line of pos sensor arrays networking relays etc etc which grant the command of an alliance these vital bits of information on the map this would tie in fantastically with a command room feature in the ambulation expansion if you want your numbers hidden from an enemy alliance then forward task groups would be required to removedisable these sensor outposts00 space is meant to be the wild west of eve just who is providing the data everyone can view on the map in the fiction there is no explanation for iti really feel that changes in this direction are overdue and would open up so many exciting possibilitiesdo it ccp make your space the cold dark void it really is
yes soem steps forward is good in tis case i perfer bacon and lokal chat to even up teh game as a cuonterif all is unkwnon then everyone and famili flies gank squad 237taht is my unbaised view
you seem like a good candidate but i need to know a few things about you are you open for suggestionswhat do you mostly do in evemeritsdo you care about industrial sidedo you know much about it
teh idea is to maek it harder not unposibel
i supprot this invirometal effect and mabe line of sight but mabe that lag to much
im not suggesting line of sight mechanics  moreover dividing a system into seperate fluctuating environments i dont believe it will cause significant lag because essentially youre just breaking local down into seperate channels based upon where a ship is local is still there  its just much more localisedc
i knoe the line of sight comes form me
i know you wanted this discussion to include the csm candidates to hear their opinions on the idea with luck they will show up and make their views knownif local is a concord empirefaction maintained set of systems that based on the security of the system tended to break downin 5 or higher space these systems are well maintained thus local remains as it isin low sec these systems do not work as well they are not maintained and so the local channel may fail to keep track of anyone in that system when someone uses a gate docks in a station or speaks in local the system tracks them if they are in proximity 100 km of a gate or station they can be tracked after a while about a minute there is a chance 20 per security level that the system will maintain that tracking so in 1 space there is a 20 chance that the pilot remains listed in local 80 in 4 every 30 seconds after the first minute another check is made until that check fails or the pilot triggers the tracking againafter tracking is lost an interaction with the system as listed above would be required for the system to start tracking the pilot againin 00 space there is no tracking talking in local using a gate or station will cause you to show up only for as long as you are talking or within range of the gates or stationsplayer controlled areas sov level 1 can install tracking systems the data can be encoded to allow only alliance members to gain the information but hacking skill with a decryption device would allow enemies to also get the data and that data can be disseminated to the fleet more role for the intel folkscloaked ships when cloaked should never be able to be scanned perhaps at most an unknown signature at a minimal range similar to all ships at extreme scanning range that are uncloaked noncovert ops cloaks should use cap as long as they are on and the amount of cap should be based on the size of the ship and no noncovert ops ship should be able to remain cloaked indefinitely 10 to 30 minutes at most at which point the cap is gone as well covert ops cloaks will also use cap but a minimal amount easily maintained by the ships that can use them i would also add forced recon and stealth bombers to those ships that can use the covert ops cloak
eve doesnt have an email field for this sage
am i wrong in thinking the idea of csm was to provide a certain degree of transparency to ccp act as an oversight commitee and work to prevent scandals and endless tinfoilhattery and not make players into pseudodevsa lot of the candidates seem bent on using their potential position in the csm as a platform to lobby for their own pet peeves game design changes etc etchave i got the wrong end of the stick
pretty muchthe csms role is to relay to the devs cuurent topics of concern or debate amongst the eve community  if thats tin foli hattery fine but it could equally be ballance issues new features and so on and so forthclearly its beneficial that we the voters are able to view the candidates in as transparent a light as possible after all once voted in theyll be in the room with ccp we wont csm members will likely have personal baises towards various aspects of the game that they view as more or less important and equally views on how those issues should be adressed jade constantine is simply being transparent is this instance and calling on other csm candidates to offer their views should they wish to do soc
on the flipside does being a csm mean you should halt your personal take on eve and not share ideas about where eve is heading development wisethe local chat is a hot topic lately and not so lately having the problem and ideas for solution made so eloquently and creatively rather than just rants is goodthumbs up from me
ill delete my longer post and say my views quite simplyyou wont get local chat functions removed without some dumb clause for replacement mechanics ccps idea of change is trivial and only a kneejerk reaction to years of player ing theyll remove local chat in the same way they removed instajump bookmarks the mechanics may be changed but theyll be used to achieve the same resultsthe best youll do with csm isa convince them to reveal the details of their replacement mechanicb get them to reveal their timeline for replacementand if youre really loudc push them to bump the scheduling and priorityd solicit another idea for replacementyou will not succeed in making the game any harder than it currently is
thats really not what we are asking for here options and depth iseach ship they insert into the game adds both those thingsits not too much to ask for that to be applied to the local chat issue
that makes no sense because the inclusion of so many ships has watered down eve im asking for the complete removal of local chat functionality without any need for replacement if the scanner gets looked at then it should be for the improvement of existing functionality and userfriendliness its important that you realize the whole problem of local chat is the artificial restriction of player interactionallowing more player interaction in 00 is the same as increasing the difficulty of eve which by the way is the same thing as adding options and depth ccp could remove local chat list tomorrow the game would be better and the problem resolved
i very much enjoyed the story there excellent stuffon your points1 the map intel would need to change and stop being a freelunchi would somewhat agree with this i would like to see the map intel available on the map be based on what your corpalliance has come into contact with in these areas rather than losing all information on the map2 the long range scanner should become more customizable and user friendly  it should be able to give a proximity warning if you set it up that wayanother stellar plan i like the thought of this and helps keep things interesting too3 cloaked ships are another problem realistically you are going to have to be able to scan for cloaked signatures and be warned of their approachthis i have a problem with if this is done what would be the point in flying a covert ops force recon or black ops ship with a cloak at all there wouldnt be any which interestingly enough highlights a problem with the whole remove local idea and rebalancing existing mechanics to fitdespite not liking the idea of making cloaked ships detectable as it breaks the entire spirit of the thing i am forced to see the sense of it in terms of game balancing as much as i dont like it but i still feel there should still be a way however difficult for the cloaked ship to remain completely undetected by potential victims or you are killing off dedicated cloaking ships as a viable choice and this to me at least is totally unacceptable great stuff calais you got my vote p part of the problem here is that space in eve remains pretty much two dimensional in some respects despite the three axis take planets and moons for instance regardless of where you or others warp from everyone ends up at exactly the same place when warping to zero being able to hide your ship on the dark side of the moon would be a scifi wet dream come trueand aside from from warping from room to room spamming the bookmark button there is no way to take advantage of the space inbetween you should at least be able to warp to an approximate point in space at will from a combat perspective this would cause a problem for scan probing but that itself could be solved by the very same mechanicthe solution here would be to allow different types of probes to be deployed within the sphere of influence of other types which would in effect make it possible to create a sensor network within whatever system you are insecondly the probe network and the results thereof you create should be accessible by all members of the gang and as a corollary the workload too as probe deployment itself could be shared between members the analysis itself would have to remain the domain of those ships specialized in it to make sure that we are not making the obvious ships redundant in this matterthis would make alongside removing local a very interesting environment indeed dark and scary where good work tactical environments ccp had a sticky about this a while back and inventive shenanigans are rewarded wow well thanks to the op for an excellent thought provoking and inspiring post and to the surprising lack of rabid trolls many well thought out ideas in here i hope know ccp can pull some good stuff out of this thread
perhaps the issue is more than local chat showing the game has drastically changed with the introduction of cloaking and capital ship types some areas have advanced while others have not advanced to remain balanced for example sentry guns in empire i remember a time when you could not tip cans without concord intervening or when you couldnt tank the gate even in 04 with ship changes and equipment upgrades this is now possible so this is now an imbalance local is used by fcs to gage when to engage how many there are to engage i feel removing local would create more of a blob mentality and remove the tactical that makes real battles funperhaps there needs to be a percentage of detection on ships that use devices not meant for them cloaking devices were meant for covert ops originally lets say a raven has a cloaking device on there should be a detection penalty for fitting it to a non covert ops shipsince capital ships have been introduced some gangs run with a cyno to bring their caps in if engaged so no longer a tactical battle but a blob festalso instead of pushing for game changes maybe discuss how to balance what is currently in game and work towards fixing the lagmy perspective of a csm is howwhat can i communicate to ccp to make this game better or ccp has this idea what do you as the player think as opposed to i have a campaign some good thoughts but perhaps not all agree and some dont come to the forums to have input in it a csm should give and get ideas in game it will allow a larger player base of input and like a diplomat explain when one idea has to come before another so people know they are being listened tomy perspective of a csm is like being a diplomat you listen to all and represent them if you have an idea allow everyone the opportunity to critique it as they allow you to critique theirs in game i have a feeling it will be like negotiations of howwhat to do first 
i think the fundamental data for radar is already in the game ship sizes and masses indicate how big their blib would bei love the idea to remove the metalevelintel that local is right now and replace it with a line of ships and skills that are fokussed on just that intel awacs capital ships anyone
if there is one thing id like to see come out of csm it would be for ccp to understand local as the intel tool is totally weak  and even if a longrange scanner gave someone the same benefits as watching local it would make sense and they would still need skills and modules for it
over the next couple of days im climbing ben nevis and snowdon so apologies for not being able to answer questions during that time however i will catch up on this on my return thanks for your time
i like the idea in 00a number of points ive added on multiple occasions over the last 4 yearsleave the amount of people in local x just not namesallow  standing pilots to show upon a sidenote if the csm candidate could have a platform for things like these i think youd see alot more involvement from the community some of the replys to this thread lead me to believe peeps are running for csm just get a free plane ticket a news item and some drinks although pedros all your wildest dreams will come true might should be avoided
im pretty much agreed with dc when you read a lot of the responses in these sorts of threads its hard to miss the notion that many players these days feel they have some sort of right to be able to minerat in 00 theoretically the most dangerous areas of eve while taking the most minimal of precautions to protect themselves no scouts no team work to secure an area etc even many of the suggested alternatives amount to the same basic thingccp really do need to just bite the bullet and make 00 the dangerous space it used to be high risk and high rewards for those with the brains and balls to make it therecertainly some mechanics such as cloaking may need looking at but eve really needs the sort of challenging environment back that it once had
so you are in favour of them removing local
before removing local nerf the map less is more as jade said all that intel from the map is hindering not helping also nerf the overview people need not see who is in what ship they only need to know the ship and its corporate affiliation let them guess the rest
2 things herei love the idea it would make eve much more realistic even though we know it isnt and never will be i also loved the story and was very very disappointed when i read about how it wasnt true i have only a few suggestionscloaked covert ops shouldnt be seen on the passive radar as someone else suggested but should be seen on the active radar but as a sevearly reduced signiture that would increase if theyre using mwd that could only be seen within line of sight aka 250 km recons should be seen in passive radar but as a reduced signiture that mimics that of a frigatestealth bombers shouldnt show up in passive and should show up sometimes in active depending on the radar operators skills and the stealth bombers skillsi cant agree with the em current idea while very good and ripe for imaginative use it doesnt address two problems with it we cant really move around in space even at the very fast speed of 310 kms we simply can fly fast enough to make it feisable otherwise were stuck again in the warp to 0 problem someone else mentioned this could be solved by having an overdrive option it takes a full minute to start up and it takes 30 seconds to stop but allows you to go at maybe 10 or 1 of your warpdrive capabilities you also go in a striaght line the community is constantly complaining about lag but i cant see this helping in anyway but thats not a real problem and i can see how it wouldnt contribute much to the lag anywaysi also really liked the idea of sovernighty and stations they should be able to place armored and defended outposts in space that actively or passivly scan the area with the active ones showing up in the scan quite easily this puts a whole new use to the skill of hacking a covert ops could warp to it while cloaked and hack it they wouldnt have to take down the cloak and be able to insert a time trojan in the form of datachips in 51015 minute increments so a coordinated team can swoop in and take down the intelligence network and actually be able to do covort op like thingsnow for the metacomment ccp probably wont listen to us and its both good and bad that we can accept that but at this point harping on that is avoiding the purpose of the thread which is to simply talk about something we wouldwouldnt like
righto fair enough old chap yes definitely many of the ideas ive presented in the csm manifesto are just that suggestions and ideas from other players with experience in these elements of the game i feel its important for a candidate to be good at listening and have a feel for which genuinely good ideas need to be promoted to the highest level of attention most actual gameplay is fighting at the moment 00 empire wars constructing tactics and applications for new technology etc etc im the executor of star fraction alliance that takes some admin but ive got an excellent director team to share the work load heres an example of what i like to do operation fedaykinhmmm gameplay merits or personal merits not sure exactly how to answer that star fractions tech2 industry very important to our alliance  we have an extensive suite of blueprint originals and build all interceptors assault frigates most recon cruisers 4 hacs 4 command cruisers and a wide variety modules and equipment i do take an interest in the current state of play economically  though the day to day management and planning of these things falls to sf alliance director talent generally
the csm is and will never be an oversight committee and they will more that likely act as a damage control if some scandal does happen again besides what corp in real life wants their clients to go in and act as a big brother to prevent a scandal now there are some that are running for the csm that think they will have the idea that they can go a say to ccp change this and this so that they and their corpalliance can get what they want and the few that have only applied to get a chance to get a free trip to iceland a very bad turnout if they get electedbut the fact is that the csm is players that will have a direct line to ccp that can handle issues and ideas with the direct intent to be open minded to it and voice what they think is the best for the community and what thy want and they shod look at both sides of the issueidea and discuss for both sidesat least that is how i foresee that the csm to ccp will work in generaland to the op i like this idea and it may open up for a new ship class and a mini profession alsothough the local channel can be changed so that in 00 it only displays the resent talkers and no way shod it display the numbers in local and no way to use it to get names out without people talkingand i think it can be adapted to low sec as well and ofc it is up to ccp if it is implemented this way
the view list of the csm candidates i think jade constantine looked the best but there were some issues id have liked to have known about before throwing my full weight into it but with these ideas and goals as well the the opinion on bacon i think i just found my candidate ill have to point this out to my corpies as well much thanks for the effort jade
untill you can adress how miners who are required to be stationary arent even more screwed than usual by these proposed changes then nothing will be taken seriouslymobility and gank owns stationary and defense this is hardly arguable if something makes mining even more dangerous than it is in low and nosec now then you can expect people just wont mine or will empire hug or at best blob up even worse
wouldnt the removal of local chat also mean that you remove a way to socialize with people for good or bad after all in my experience in high sec local is quite often filled with interesting chat between parties that would have probably never talked to each other because they wouldnt have known they are there new players would be harmed too by removing the first channel they are likely to ask for helpso there needs to be at least a replacement of sorts to ensure that you can still socialize with unknown players otherwise eve can get a mmo where you feel pretty lonely just jumping around in empire seeing all the people in local since you barely see them all in space gives a feeling of actual population since you know all are players i doubt 700 people in jita are all alts of one person but rather alts of 700 persons knowing that it provides a special experience once you think about it
please remember that we are talking about the systems where there is no public concord controlled communication channel well where the shouldnt be anyi think the changes would be radical but absolutely awesomeadding real reconnaicance to the game would rock on the long runand i think that everyone is well aware of changes needed be it miningshiphighrisctanks  or tech ii mining ships  or awacs caps or anticamobursts alot of possibilities and also alot of time being not perfectly balanced so what come on guys if eve stops progressing yes radical progressing that might be disliked by changefearers it will soon enough die now if we want to keep playing eve and ccp wants to have a lifetime income by providing eve there have to be changes big changes changes that give rebirth to eve as a game im looking forward to faction warfare im looking forward to ambulation and i shure as hell would like to see recon and surveilance become what their name suggest
for economic reasons local cannot be removed ccp cant afford to lose that many accounts they tried it once by accident it was quickly reversed
i like this idea for 00 certainly i wouldnt like to see it removed in empire space though as it would make empirebased wars next to impossiblegood ideas and well presented though
yeah i mean i love cloaked ships too i really do but you do have to look at the gameplay angle and ensure there is still balance that gives people the opportunity to fight back i guess you just have to get back to the idea that the cloak is a visual cloak primarily and hides people from visual sighting and with the reduced scan result showing cloak present not range or direction thats enough warning for people to take counter action and look to their defense bare in mind that with the system im suggesting in the op all ships would give some kind of result on the lr scanner so the cloakers would still have an advantage of hiding their ship type range direction etcnow cloaked ship outside of lr range scan is completely undetectable perhaps you play with the stats a bit and have the maximum range that cloaked vessels get detected even as a general unknown trace is lesser than max range for conventional vesselsin the bit of fiction in the op i was describing the main advantage of the cloaked ships in the engagement being unknown wild cards side a had its 4 falcons side b had its 4 sabres the conventional ships got detected one by one by recon ops except the 4 side b ravens that warped from beyond the orbit of the last planet  the cloaked ships were the hidden assets that the fleet commanders knew were out there but couldnt resolve with any specifics until they decloaked thats how id see the cloaking device function in in a map and local free environemnt  but you do need a payoff to allow the possibility of detection of presence alone to replace the disappearing local chat register in my opinion
thank you radcjk much appreciated and please pass my best wishes to your corp
heres the thing soporo at the moment the map gives too much information how many in space how many npcs destroyed how many jump activations and local lets me know when i come into system there is somebody there all i have to do as a hunter is zoom about with a ceptor and quarter the belts and look for a barge the hard business of knowing where to look amongst the 1000 stars is already done for me in the proposal im making in the op this map information is not available you can hide your mining op in the darkness of space choose a system with 12 entrances have a scout at the entrance in scan range or a system over if you want to be really safe otherwise rely on your obscurity in the depths of space and add proximity alerts to the long range scan and get out if you think incoming traces are hostile these things cut both ways they really do i tell you if im out hunting miners belonging to a hostile nsbi alliance in 00 i can cover 4050 systems in a hour zipping around in a ceptor and zooming in on map traces and bring my gang directly to you take away that map and local intel and ive got to work at it  learn mining habits put your names into location agents watch my scan use probes be very aware of counter ambushing its all a good balance reallyif its scary for a ninja miner in the bigblack in this system its scary for everyone raiders defenders pirates and piratehunters everyone has imperfect information and works on gutreaction instincts and fragmentary intelif you are mining as part of a big 00 entity then they should be protecting you not just letting map intel and local do it for them
this is a low secnull sec proposal there id advocate replacing local with constellation delayed chat where you only appear in the constellation chat window if you chat people who want to chat can do people who want to remain stealthy can do that too in high sec the local situation should remain unchanged to properly illustrate the contrast between outlaw and policed regions
id be chuffed if local showed everyone in the system in 10 to 07 and then only showed those that spoke in local chat from 06 to 00 the buffer of 06 and 05 would stop high sec alts or bacons watching ship movements near most lowsec entry pointsid love lots of other cool stuff like restricted scanning and interference from astral bodies but theyre probably something to dream of in the far distant future 
until you have a system on paper that does not fall into all the pitfalls that need to be avoided all of the wishes and wants for local are just hot airespecially when there are a number of quick fixes that will solve pretty much all of the problems except the feel problem that can be implemented swiftly and easilyie let people scan cloaking ships add 5 minute ratmining aggression timer dont show in local until you decloak from jump inyou still show if using a cloakan increase in the time and effort it takes to find ships is plain and simple a decrease in the amount of combat that will occur this is for two reasons the first being that it takes more time to find targets the second being that players are more likely to run together for protection when they have less information to deal withboth of these things are not good for the gameedit too little information and its too hard to make decisions instead of doing things people dont do thingseg with no local and no replacement no one would do anything without a cloakand dont rat or mine at all because everything they do could have them run into 50 cloaked reconstoo much information and its too easy to make decisions when risk and reward become perfectly clear only rewarding actions will be taken and no combat occurs because everyone runs away if they cant win an upcoming battle such very few upcoming battles become real battles
a bit of a ramble ahead since i have a migraine disrupting my train of thought its not related to this promiseremoving local would require huge changes to other systems as such it could not be done in the foreseeable future without the risk of causing massive subscriber defection heres whygetting fights in 00 is hard enough right now the map and local are the only ways of even knowing if anyones in a system at all and for alliances that control more than one system this allows them a quick way to know where to respond to removal of this intelligence provides them with only one alternative that can provide a similar level of securitygatecamping lots of itwithout local or the map alliances that are serious about security will just form enormous capitalsupported bubbledropping gateblobs on entrances into their territory and gank the pants off anyone that enters its a remarkably simple solution that does nothing to improve the game and as a matter of fact just makes it worse about the only thing that can survive such a gateblob would be roaming nanogangs which are already widelyseen as being far too common all this will accomplish is to make 00 even more inaccessible except to the very experienced and the very rich and will make alliance security take even longer and be even more boring not everyone wants to dedicate their life to claiming virtual spacethe funny thing is the people this would screw over the most are smaller alliances who will have no hope of holding any space whatsoever they already dont have a prayer against the modern deathstar pos towers since they cant always be available to fend off attacks from larger groups bent on stealing their space as with this change they wont even know theyre there until they start firing at a tower and by then theres no time to scramble a large enough defense force while larger alliances can afford to amputate access to their space with the above tactic while still having the capacity to respond to anything that slips pastadding new modules that benefit the defender overlook the fact that defenders already have massive advantages while taking it away from the people who need it this would simply make gatecamping more tenable as it would be easier to stumble into one for the people just starting out in lowsec ecp8r is camped enough already even with the map and local thank you adding specialized ships with special modules simply assures that every gang will have one or two of these ships and nothing will effectively changemustnt forget the effect on lowsec either this would also make gateblobs and stationcamps more common there as most pirates will not search every single system with scan probes just for the possibility of finding a mission raven which is already nearly impossible to detect even if you know where it ischanging local means that the benefits of reduced intel will mostly be reaped by large wellentrenched alliances with strong intel networks and by roving nanogangs capable of escaping gatecamps in populated low or nosec space im just cynical enough to point out that you and your alliance historically fall into the latter categoryas for cloaked ships cloaking makes you invisible for a reason  so nobody can find you thats the whole point of cloaking the devices are expensive and require a good bit of training to use and carry hefty penalties on nonspecialized ships theyre fine as isall in all reducing intelligence makes warfare more static and uninteresting when no side wants to take risks what i see a lot of people proposing is a return to the trench warfare tactic of the world wars only in space as a predominantly highsec carebear with eyes on eventually moving out to lowsec and nosec i dont want to have to gather an army and fight the battle of the somme just to mine some crokite how would you address these new problems
id counter by saying without the map intel and absolute intelligence tool of local you will have a situation where a space claiming alliance wants to secure its space will have to split its forces amongst many gates and choke points and will become more vulnerable to feints fake attacks hit and run and blackops deployment deeper into its territory take away absolute information and risks need to be taken it becomes far less effective to blob since intruders will simply attack on different fronts this is a common hobbyhorse argument any time a change impacting alliance life in 00 is proposed the small alliances will fair worse  but i really dont buy it reduced information means opportunity for everyone and makes space bigger once again it becomes scary for everyone large alliances cannot afford to permacamp all the entrances to their space with limited information and no local hotdrops are dangerous they involve risk fake attack happens and counter hot drop is made that means another entrance is open and undefended small alliances slip through the gaps and take advantage of the fact their presence is no longer immediately highlighted on the map for everyone to see
ok so youve removed local and map intel and have completely ignored the suggestions to replace how that info is gatheredare organised gangs with scouts into 00  lowsec such a bad thing or should we all be making our way solo vs ai in this gameis intel sensor pos arrays etc becoming an asset that has to be worked at by your alliance defended by them implimented by them a bad thingwould being harder to locate in low sec due to less intel really deter people from going there or would more people fancy their chancesoptions are a good thing more involvement is a good thing less important things automated and requiring player input is a good thing sure youll have to be paying attention to your scanner if you venture into low sec for some high reward activities but you wont be a shining beacon on the map for all to see eitheri think putting intel gathering into the hands of the players is such a cool prospect if youre organised and wily youll have the element of suprise against your enemy if youre disorganised then youll be walking into traps left right and centre until you change thatrather than looking at the map  local and getting specific numbers of an incoming blob and meeting it with a matching blob guerilla warfare is going to become alot more attractivei think changes to this aspect of eve opens up way too many cool avenues to be ignored
you forget that the gate campers rely on map and local information too itll be much much easier to attack gate camps with benefit of surprise with no local warning for the campers jump in a victim empty industrial to get aggression jump in a counter gatecamp gank fleet from another gate thats moved into position from another entrance current system the campers see local bloom and all deaggress and jump out this way we get a chance for engagements happening from imperfect knowledge and this in turn will make gate camping itself more hazardous involving more pvp and consequentially giving more opportunity for blockade runners and travels to slip through the gaps into deeper 00 and protective obscuritywell im not a pirate but i already search most systems i send gangs through with ceptor patrols and scanning on the chance of finding 10 hostile nsbiers the diligent and the cunning will benefit  the lazy and uncreative will find it more difficult lacking map intel on dead ships will put the onus on locals to band together and report the presence of hostile camps  lacking map intel will make it easier to surprise those camps and scatter and destroy them well cynical or not  i will tell you that i and sf historically use whatever technology we find appropriate to fight back against superior numbers and blob fleets blackops ceptor gangs nano ew superiority hot drops remote repping battleships cloaked recon patrols  whatever whatever well adapt and make use of whatever technology exists to allow us to fight back the game has changed many many times in our lifespan as an alliancecorp and we always make the best of the situations what i can tell you is limited intel does not benefit centralized systems of control and the giant alliances will find it more difficult to patrol and control their space instead of being spoon fed free lunch from the map screen and local updates theyll have to go out and patrol and thats a good thing for the game in my opinion
i think you should reread the op and look specifically at the mention of cloaking devices there and in follow up posts youve missed the point really it would not be possible for people to find cloaked ships with the scanner in my proposal  just that people should know they are out there  somewherei dont think youve proven that assertion with your post allaria admittedly you havent yet seen the situations in 00 with your own eyes the reality is that if you wanted to go ninjamine some crokite in 00 at the moment youd be much better served by a removoed local and reducedremoved map intel and force the alliance hunters to actually search for you rather than simply looking at the map and confirming with local when their scouts arrive and proceeding to keep an afk cloaker logged into your system for the next 23 hours until you get bored and log out  make a mistake and warp to the gate
fog of war is quite a staple in rts games the element of suprise and ability to outsmart an opponent make for alot more excitement and options rather than just clashing head on with everything you havei know eve isnt an rts but alliance warfare shares alot of parallels with it while an effort is made to gather intel on real threats it opens up the chance for lone opportunists to go about their business
agree as danton said a page ago  restrict available information makes the game bigger uncertainty and unknown disposition of enemy forces will make for more chance and meeting engagements sure but itll be much easier for those that want to go deep and hide to do just that id believe that restricting map toolslocal will lead to more conflict between groups out looking for trouble because neither will know the precise advantagesize of the other but will make it more difficult to find people who dont want to be found and thats how deep 00 should be
some pointshit and run and feints already work pretty well thats why you hear about nanogangs every time you turn around  they are the ideal in hit and run and theyre already doing just fine feints are commonly used by larger alliances when attacking poss since 50 people in frigates do not equal 50 people in battleships and capitals waiting to hotdrop on your pos while youre chasing said frigates as for black ops they cant do anything as it is anyway a reconbased gang can already do what it wants in most 00 space without needing a large expensive vulnerable black ops tender these changes wouldnt affect their ability to do thatnext point small alliances will fare worse with any change to intelligence for one simple reason  larger alliances have more people and thus more people they can dedicate to intelligencegathering an alliance of 1000 people can easily afford to dedicate 20 highlyexperienced pilots to scouting and recon while that might be half the people that a smaller alliance has online at any given time  they cant afford to take such measures plus smaller alliances have a harder time pulling off feints and sneak attacks because they often dont have the people to do so if you have 40 people online and you need 30 to launch a serious attack you only have 10 to feint with whereas your defender who benefits from interior lines as well as numbers has 80 people available and can counter both fleets with a group of 40 of course even if you slip through undetected theres no guarantee youll find anything before you get spotted since your intel is worse than that of the controlling allianceonto what koro said intel in the hands of the players does make lowsec more dangerous because of one simple rule of piracy the only thing that making targets harder to find would mean is that people looking for targets will go to places where targets are most likely to be found  gates and stations thats why historically pirates plied known trade routes between major ports  they knew they would find ships there same goes for eve only in eve you cant catch the ships in transit so you need to catch them at port making it harder to find ships off the trade lanes will increase piracy on the trade lanesback to jade gatecampers ones with half a brain anyway dont rely on local at all an alt in a newbship or better something that cloaks sitting on the other side of the gate theyre camping is a far more effective earlywarning system than the map or the directional scanners since you not only get the advantage of knowing whats coming but also who they are and what ships theyre in the map and local have nothing to do with itmost people will not scan systems asis because its usually a waste of time removing local will make it a genuine waste of time  would you be so keen on checking a system that might have a ship in it or would you rather limit it to systems you know have ships in them i hate to agree with a goon especially this one but goumindong has a point when he says restricting intel reduces fights because hes right the only thing more painful than flying around in a gang for three hours without finding a target is flying around in a gang for three hours looking for possible targets that may not even existim not going to argue the cynicism point simply because thats a personal opinion however limited intel strongly benefits from centralization as that way everyone knows what intel is available rather than some people having some parts of it and not being able to put two and two together thats why militaries require soldiers to report so that an intelligence specialist or command officer can put all the various reports together and get a good idea of whats going on alliances with the experienced manpower to dedicate to central intelligence are in a much better position than alliances that cant
local as a game mechanic is just awfulhowever it has been in the game forever and as such an equilibrium has built up around it it defines how miners ratters pirates high sec players low sec players 0 sec players solo players corp players small alliance players and mega alliance players operate in this game yanking it out will have repercussions to every playstyle in the game i believe that local should be replaced with a proper sensor and intelligence gathering system however i am not really invested in the status quo so i dont really care which way they equilibrium shifts due to such a change naturally people who feel that it will shift in a direction that is disadvantagous to them will oppose it whether for good reasons or bad ones you just wont escape it
allarria kriss in response 1 nanogangs in the current environment are another item of discussion altogether really i have my own opinions as to why nanogang has become the primary mobile force in 00 warfare and it has a lot to do with the gradual spread and empowerment of pos equipmentjump bridgehotdrop with full map intel and local monitoring black ops ships provide a covert portal to a covert cyno that doesnt appear on the map 2 your point of large vs small alliances doesnt really work since the ratio of alliance size doesnt map directly on the potential game impact of local removal and making the landscape much bigger through limited intel if you have 40 people online you can make a roving gang of quiet competent capability  at the moment you plunge that into large alliance space youll be scouted and countered and hotdropped on through jump bridges without local chat and reduced map options you have a far greater chance of penetrating enemy borders and finding an enemy gang that has not been configured precisely to counter you3 gatecampers rely on local sorry allaria but thats just the case yes they run alts in systems around  but those alts are watching local  often by the time a force lands on the gate its too late the clever ones are watching localscannersthe map for blobs also trust me on this ive fought these people for a long long time4 re the restricting local  reducing fights its just an incorrect assessment people play this game for fun they want fights roving pvp gangs want action at the moment the problem is that its too easy to pick and choose your perfect fight if you have a gang of 10 people out and you meet 15 from your scout intel watching local you might think the better of it and run if you meet 2030 you definitely will  but without local you arent suddenly going to lose all desire for pvp combat in eve  youll still be out looking for trouble and watching the scanners but it will be more difficult of judge the odds and numbers in advance opting out of engagement on first comparison of local numbers will no longer be an option5 re the big alliance thing and intel if you have a huge multi region alliance with 500 people in chat the current state of the game allows them to see precisely where an incoming group is and track its movement through local scouts they can see ninja ratters rogue miners  where npcs are dying where jumps have occurred they can focus their whole strength on the precise point of incursion limited intelligence means that imperfect intel traces will need to be investigated properly by intelligent scouts and patrollers and groups will have to be split up in no way can this be construed an advantage foe a large regionally distributed power over a smaller focused territorial entity with restricted critical focus
and what will be the difference 1 small alliance vs large alliance well in the current situation both have the same intel gathering local just the large alliance can throw more material into actual combat that will be the case with or without local so this is nonargument2 hit and run  nano  they are there because it is so easy to avoid combat with map and local you need to be fast to catch somebody also they are best at disengaging when things turn south ie local jumps too much with reds3 so the smart gate campers in lowsec already have scouts at the other gate without local nothing will change for them again nonargumentas you correctly mentioned the reason for lowsec gate and station camps is the nature of lowsec no bubbles absence of local will have realy no effect on thati can only agree with the waste of time scanning an empty system in place of just looking at local but thats one minor annoyance now you have to work for your targets big problem pirates have to find targets and not just wait for them 
jade youre contradicting yourself nowbut before i get to that part ill reply to the other points1  nanogangs are a problem for a thousand different reasons that have already been beaten to death i was just mentioning one that was relevent2  your point of large vs small alliances doesnt really work since the ratio of alliance size doesnt map directly on the potential game impact of local removal and making the landscape much bigger through limited intel  put that in english please a communications expert like you should not be posting something so incomprehensible i will try to respond anyway more players  more people available  more coverage  better intel  win all your proposal does is put off the hotdropping of the small alliances fleet until somebody runs into them and reports them3  gatecampers rely on local because local is there if you remove it they will simply use alt scouts like most of them already do they will just need more of them4  its been proven statistically time and again that while most people play eve for fun they are not looking for pvp all that your proposal means is that it is even harder for these people who are looking for pvp to find each other and all roving gangs will catch are the occasional ratter or miner not anything challenging like another fleet5  larger alliances can easily control more space than smaller alliances because larger alliances have fewer chokepoints per system than smaller alliances controlling less space some of their systems and constellations cover others  sending someone to guard an apartment block is just as productive as sending someone to guard an individual apartment except that the guard can now protect many more apartments most space is the same way  regions have very few entry points per system compared to individual components of those regions that point aside most people already will not engage a force if they dont have good intel on it  simply knowing how big a force is tells you nothing it could be 100 frigates it could be 100 titans youd better go look before you suit up for a hotdrop ehyour contradiction you want people to have more fun pvping but make having fun harder to do by making fights especially good fights harder to find you encourage blob warfare and gatecamping by making pvp riskier most pvpers are riskaverse so the greater the risk the bigger the blob while limiting the chance that a small roving gang which will show up only as a tiny blip in local or on the map and thus probably be ignored will have of finding opponents i for one fail to see how making pvp harder to find will make pvp more fun if anything i think itll be more of a pain in the arse i dont want to have to fly around for an hour scanning four systems just to gank a ratter in an enyohugh thats precisely my point removing local has no impact on most of these things so i dont see how its going to make any difference
allaria most of your post is just repetition of the previous one so im not going over old ground its easy to play quote wars contradicting each other endlessly but with such a gulf of understanding between the core concepts well agree to disagree where views are incompatible and move on just a couple of points to close on since im talking in this thread specifically about 00 and lowsec where actual pvp combat is prized by the player base im going to take your comment with a pinch of salt and just roll my eyes at the notion of such statistics the notion of the good fight is by definition a subjective one a good fight tends to be something that has the advantage in your favour to the other guys its as bad fight currently knowing the numbers in local exactly its too easy to decide against non good fights ie  where the numbers are roughly even or against you not knowing that intelligence in advance will lead to more genuinely objective good fights which are not in the numerical advantage of either side necessarily but ends up in a battle that could go either way in any case weve argued back and forth on the issue and were disagreeing on interpretation not fact statistics or otherwise so well leave it there thanks for responding to the thread though
but you are the one disgreeing with local removal and putting up nonarguments where the absence or presence of local has no impacttry one reasonable argument where removal of local will have a huge impact i have one ninjasolo mining as those ships depend on very early warning or protectioni can see only positives if a resonable and effective replacement is implemented thats one big if i am all for local removal when that if is solved until then it is up for discussion
heres the endall argument then hughif removing local has no impact why remove it ccp did it once by accident and there was open revolt do you think theyre going to make that mistake again i dont think they will unless they have a very very good substitute for it waiting in the wings thus i like you am against local removal until theres a wellplanned practical alternative thats been welltested and ready to go which there isnt right now so that makes me against local removal at this point in time
because local creates perceived problems1 people scream for cloak nerfs2 bacon3 cloaked rat farmers4 logoff tacticsetc etc etcthese are all there because of local and you are against local removal at this point because there is no alternative solution  i do agree thats my stance too but you are agreeing against local removal as such not agains the solution voiced by jade thats a principal difference
here is my reason for removing localit is really bad ui implementation to me at least staring at a list of names waiting for it to change is not my idea of playing the game and it has an uncanny resemblence to what raiding in wow is like there is no skill involved but it is just an exercise in endurane to see how long you can stare at the same list before your eyes gloss over
jade hasnt voiced a solution jade has reposted the same ideas that have been doing the rounds of these forums for months i want to see something original not the same old dead horsesedit torik how would this be any different from any other system that would be implemented people will check for new hostiles as frequently as possible when in hostile territory
after you please since you are so intent on attempting to rubbish the suggestions people are trying to build here
anyone who votes the removal of local gets a  in my booknow about those cheap cerbs
jade ive never been a massive fan but youre far and away the best candidate you have my votes
great discussion  id love to see the perfect information of local replaced with something where recon within a system is a tactical advantage
great postnerf local nowand while you are at it make stations destructable or let the attackers pillage them
have a quick attempt at making something new this ones even thoughtout and detailed it took me all of half an hour have fun flamingstep one make similar intelligence tools availableyour turn
wasnt a flame dear you just seemed very counter constructive to be honest it doesnt even require new ship types but that never hurts the systems are already in place in eve map data local logs scanners all that needs to change is how they are accessed and who has accesstake a look at any contemporary strategic game and info gathering  fog of war features in it knowing what your opponent is up to at all times makes for a very unexciting strategy gamebut since youve taken the time to conceptualise a new ship type ill go have a look 
obviously any replacement system that would require people to keep staring at a display would be just as bad any workable solution would have to involve automated scanning and proximity alerts this would then have to be balanced out with equipment sensivity range signature and power usage issues ie a scanner setup that could detect people at the other side of the solar system would give out a ton of false positives eat up most of your power and make you detectable by people with much weaker setupsedit that ship idea of yours would fit this kind of setup nicely a highly specfialized ship setup that would provide great scanning but would not be very functional in other ways due to all the equipment and power sources it has to carry
i have not read every post but have seen some references to this so i will reiterate hoping for some clarificationin general i think local is a problem but the solutions so far seem lacking1 while i like the notion of bringing skill back to scanning i am not keen on the idea of having to spam a scan button while miningratting in dangerous space just not a good game mechanic as some have noted there needs to be an automated system in place but how far does that go before you are essentially back to localfurther when i am in low sec or 00 knowing who just jumped in is very helpful to me as a minerrattermissioner even if i have a 100 someone is there buzzer not knowing who it is means i will be running for a posstationss every time the thing goes off the only alternative is to have a large gang with me if i ever want to go into dangerous space and that simply is not possible most times so removing local to me would effectively block me out of doing anything in lowno sec on anything short of a largeish gang basis2 added to 1 above is the removal of map info often when people get ganked at gates and complain here they are told it is their own fault for not checking the map even though the map is a lagged and imperfect tool for this it is better than nothing without that info i am utterly at the mercy of gate camps use scoutsfinestill does not sound like a gameplay improvement except for the piratesagain in a general sense i like the notion of info warfare fog of war general uncertainty and so on as a practical matter though i am not seeing how this improves much
ill bring up an idea for discussion that could replace localjust go back to basics have a pinnable window that functions as a realtime radar screen one that maybe looks like a shrunk version of homeworlds 3d navigation interface put a radial button in the corner that switches between active and passive scanning active scanning would bring much better results but it would make you easily detected passive scanning would be reliant on other energies illuminating or reflecting off of someone else such as someone using an active scanner nearby other ships which would be illuminated at great range for a sensitive passive scan which could be affected by special modules fitted in the highs lessening the chance that a cloak could also be fitted including any firepower the strength of the passive return would of course be affected by each ships sig radius giving an aggressive and large fleet extra presence in system if there is no active scanning within range of a passive receiver all ships would only be illuminated by perhaps the level of their powergrid or their proximity to a star or other source of energy the level of passive return would dictate how much information is received on the shiptype and general location signified by the size color and clarity of the blip on your screen pilots would be unknown until close contact is madeeven though active scanning would make you clear to any passive viewer the benefits of it would be enormous for the aggressor though they would be unable to warp to their contacts they would know exactly where they were what they were flying and who was flying it though they would have a shorter range then passive scanning and they are unable to detect cloaked ships they would know instantly when and where that ship was if they uncloaked and they could position themselves to trap the contact and send probers to find him the range of this active scanning should be short maybe 10  15 au with skills or fittings available to improve ithum shrugany thoughts or improvementsoh and btw the reason i think cloaked ships should be left alone is because they are already limited greatly in firepower you cant do much even with a recon without support
jadeevery time i read you inspireits a pretty sure thing youll be getting my votes
i think cloaked ships should show up as unknownsundifferentiated from a rat or a cosmic annomoly on the scanner and thus not trigger the proximity alarm otherwise i feel it would disadvantage cov opsrecon players too much
confirm sir
yes local gives too much intelligence but scanning gives far too little intelligence
i support this would be a nice antimacro thing as well imo no more local jump loggofski
what he said counts for this thread as well as for the stuff on your websiteop was a nice read and the proposed fix for the loss of local is the way to go sure its a huge step but i think its for the better of the game space will become bigger and scarier teamwork will be more rewarded good thing for a mmo soloplayers can use the proximity alert or something similar more adrenalin more tactic more fielding t1 stuff more ships blown up etc etc im all for itkeep up the good work
excellent op and a generally excellent idea not entirely to my taste but not far off either a couple of things i would addlocal chat should be turned from instantaneous mode to delayed mode rather than remove it all together ie you have to say something in local to appearall ships should have a broadcast identity option which automatically places your name and perhaps ship type in local when turned on this should be compulsory in 01  10 sec with the punishment being a global criminal flag when turned off though it should have options to automate it based on sec level of system etc to prevent accidental concordokken this should be optional in 00 again with the option to automatically turn it offon when you enterleave 00 as it may be desirable to turn on when operating in safe alliance space in order to avoid scaring the crp out of each other by showing up on scan without warningi agree that the onboard scanner should definitely be improved  the absolute maximum range of the ship scanner should be increased maybe even unlimited but with lower resolution and less information available at longer ranges should be built into the hud rather than rely on a popup window should be hotkey controllable as much as possible should be filterable and have user defined presets as opposed to simply using no filters or the overview filters however i do not believe the scanner alone should be able to provide automatic warnings of a ship entering range but i think an automatic scanning module would be a good idea however when in operation it would kill your engines cycle time of 5 seconds or so this would reduce though unfortunately not remove the viability of the autologoff tactic employed by many ratters in 00 as opposed to the automated scanner option which would make it easier but would benefit stationary operations such as mining ops which would be those most at risk from removing local the ability to detect the presence of a cloaked ship but not its precise location or ship type i like a lot if local was removed but cloaks not changed then these would get a big bonus that i do not think is needed
nice readhowever before anything else you need to decide where you want pvp to go whether you want it going fun way or real way what you described in your little fiction is real way fun maybe to selected few also you skipped the boring stuff you know all the void scans before that fleet got its fightyou are looking at this from fcs point of view sending people left and right scan this report that camp here warp there etc fun huh now reverse the view  a reasonably bad analogy try putting yourself into role of single infantry unit in an rts game fun huhyou need attractors in space for fights to happen they can be gates poses or intel that theres juicy target one jump ahead as much as your little story could look awesome on 6 oclock news channel would have trouble all the other days when nothing could be reported since i very much doubt anybody would enjoy coverage of some fleet spending 10 minutes scanning a system for 10 systemsbut most importantly im afraid thisholds true so whole debate is pointless imho
lol if local gets removed you guys are gunna be sooooooooo sorry
is an fps game more or less fun for knowing who is in the next room is an rts game more or less fun for having fog of war turned on if everyone lacks perfect overview and tactical information then all is fine and balanced eve wont suddenly stop undocking if local went away in 00 people will be ratting patrolling agenting and building pos and whatnot and since these activities will not automatically signal presence on the map and in local there will be a radical upsurge in that rarest of eve engagement paradigms  the meeting engagement depends really in game my character can fly pretty much any kind of ship sometimes i fc sometimes i scout sometimes i tackle sometimes i like the standoff nano stuff everything has its appeal and i tell you there is enjoyment to be found buzzing around in a crow quartering systems looking for targets as much as in ordering a fleet around its different kinds of fun granted but sometimes you want to kick back and just find and tackle while somebody else makes the big decisions for a change in the localfree environment every decision would be more exciting and scouting even more critical  wed have a lot less x contacts in local immediately runlog offdock stuff going on it really doesnt take 10mins to scan a system  trust me on this
thank you guys  really is much appreciated comment all the best
so your proposal is only no local in 00 since the vast majority of 00 is empty what you just said would seem to be the case however in low sec i think it is completely wrong i have tried my level best to find low sec that is mostly pirate free i was moon probing so i would spend a fair amount of time in various systems and i never went more than 15 minutes and generally a lot less time without some pirate zooming throughwhile on the face of it your suggestion means the incoming pirate would need to scan the system to find me in practice i am long gone the second i see him pvp  pve fit so if i am doing anything except hunting other players i need to get the hell out fastwhen you spend enough time in an area of low sec you learn who will leave you alone and can continue whatever it is with some assurance youll be ok with no local i would have to assume everyone is a bad guy meaning i would be running for a posssstation every few minutes not funfurther with no window to look outside of a station how do i know if i am undocking into a station camp with local i can get some sense if bad guys are at least in the system with your proposal undocking will be an adventure every time and frankly that stinks
im open to persuasion on the solution for lowsec gut reaction is that local should be restricted in some form there though whether it be delayeddisplay or simply not there yet to see i guess im a bit luckier than you with lowsec though last night i made an appalling gaff and delivered a friends ship 40 jumps to the taleend of space to hakana system through some really lonely unoccupied lowsec when i should have been taking it to ihakana at the other end of space and let me tell you it was a big slow ship seriously though pirate camps in lowsec  yeah i can see a problem perhaps allowing the map intelligence for lowsec but not nullsec is the way to go im actually in favor of windows for stations but i think we might need to wait for ambulation to get them
thank you for answering question you didnt know i asked
poasting on teh intarnetz takes zero intelligence
dammit the eve forums just ate my long and thought out reply and i dont have much time to retype it they really need to do something about this   it told me i wasnt logged in and didnt at least do me the courtesy of keeping and posting the content i just typed when i did log back in againanyway long time no see jadeive got a couple of concerns regarding your suggestions my apologies if they have already been addressed in previous replies im trying to finish typing this before i get ready for work and dont have time to read the whole threadokay my concerns are twofold that this will decrease the chances of getting an engagement and increase the likelihood of blobbagethe first is pretty straightforward greater difficulty in locating people and knowing whether they are friendly or hostile will result in more time spent searching sometimes fruitlessly and less chance and time spent pewpewingthe latter is also fairly cut and dried if a bit more indepth first and foremost your proposed system would seem to favor numbers when searching for enemies more people to case a system would result in better chances of finding something to shoot assuming theres anyone to shoot in the system in the first place the second is simple human nature increase the uncertainty factor and people will take steps to ensure that if unforseen events do occur they will be ready for them i see the upshot of this as most gangs bringing more numbers to ensure that if they do run into something they didnt expect theyll have a greater ability to deal with it tbqh i find your ideas intriguing but these concerns would have to be addressed before i could endorse themnow lets see if the forum gods eat my repost this time im copying what i typed beforehand
then again these games are fundamentally different not only do they offer some certain and important information regarding opponentsin more rtss is where the opponent starts how many of them are there and with what resources in fps games its how many of them are there and their base capabilities but they also are more or less riskless if you lose the game the time it takes to start again is near zerobecause sides are not fixed and risks are higher makes eve fundamentally a different game from these and then the analogy breaks downthe argument also breaks down due to time that you increase the amount of time it takes for the engagement to happen may reduce its frequency this is especially true for deep 00 ops an increase in the time it takes to find targets combined with the both the decreased likelihood that people will produce and the increased likelihood that they will form together for defense mean that engagements are more likely to be much fewer with many more people on either sideshe has said it wont happen the way we claim but hasnt put up a strong argument to that effect
hey there wrayeth nice to see youre still around and up to mischief no problems ill summarize the general answers to the concerns belowwell lets look at what happens now we put together a gang or go solo we check out the map perhaps looking for blobs we set the autopilot destination and then move quickly to the trace location our scouts are ahead in local and they report the presence of ships as they pass through if we see a group much bigger than ours we generally evade if their scouts see us coming they general evade safespot dock logout or cloak etc etc the problem is we have too much intel about enemy dispositions you almost never get the wonderful meeting engagement in eve since both sides are instantly aware of the relative numbers and generally have time to evade in some way to avoid a pitched even battleremove local and map intel and everyone is in the dark beyond the range of their sensors well still go patrolling well still have forward scouts to report on gate camping and run through systems with max range scans but we wont have the certain knowledge of x enemy ships in system and neither will the enemy have certain knowledge of our numbers now some people say that this means everyone will just go and hide in dock and never fight but come on wrayeth guys like you and i know that people play this game for fighting fun and games as well as anything else people will be patrolling theyll be baiting theyll be setting traps theyll be maneuvering forming pincers feints and reversals and all that lovely stuff wed like to be happening and remember in actuality this isnt so different than we have to do at the moment we bring a gang into system and just seeing people in local doesnt get us fights and kills  we have to narrow down the position of enemy ships and search to find them thats why scan skills in interceptor pilots are so vital removing local if anything increases the chance of getting fights since people are not getting immediate baconstyle warnings of enemy presence yes and no realistically 20 interceptors cant search a system much faster than 4 its not just a numbers game  its pilot skill at play most systems in eve i can confirmdeny enemy presence in about 2 mins without even looking at local right now  open system map plot a triangle course that takes in all major groupings and cruise with max range scanner  its not rocket science might seem that way in theory but remove map intel and everyone has uncertainty  large space holding entities will need to spread their intel and patrols wider to actually control space they will be vulnerable to false intel feints unknown traces etc also if im a 10 man gang meeting a 100 man gang my scout intel is still going to pick up a huge blob on the scanner and bail out blobs are slow  and they need intel to pursue after all
would this idea of the removal of local be acceptable if changed to a less efficient local chat based more on the new player help channel if you have not started a new character in a while or it may only be on new accounts but you can watch the help channel and never be listed on it until you speakthis is like playing hide and seek at night you have a good hiding place as long as you stay quiet it remains a good hiding place talk move or as i did once snore and your good hiding place is no longer as goodthe only added functionality would be that local would not show everyone in system it would only show those that have used local i would also add 2 items first is a timer second is system detection system detection is any uncloaked ship within x km of a npc structure gate or station would be detected while they are in that range ships that are detected are shown as they are now in local the timer is once you are no longer detected talking or within x km of a structure there is a chance that the system will lose track of you and you drop off the local chat list just like you had left the systemit is not the elimination of local but the modification of how it works
i have to say i agree with wrayeth and guomindong herei think the proposal as it stands could potentially lead to a dramatic decline in the number and quality of fights by encouraging ganking and blobbagewhile the more pvp oriented small gang corps may go to the efforts outlined here i suspect that many groups will simply fall back on the old safety in numbers philosophywhile i can see where you are coming from jade i think you are totally misreading how the majority of people play this game what will happen when a pilot is ganked by 10 enemies will his own alliance send just 10 people to respond when they have no clear idea how many enemies are in the area will they assume that the 10 pilots are merely an advance guard for another fleet 2 jumps away while there is already a tendency to blobbage i can only see that being worsened by this proposalyes they can dispatch scouts to scan all the surrounding systems which could be a very large number of systems but that takes time organisation and willwe already see people on these forums complaining about nanohac gangs and the pointlessnesseffort required to engage them speed gangs have not resulted in more pvp unless you count the ability to catch the odd careless npcer as pvpbecause many players cannot even be bothered to gather the required ships to combat them and this proposal could produce a similar resultwhile some organisations will make the effort many more will simply blob up or dock up on the assumption that there are many more enemies around than there actually are indeed as with the nanohac gangs they may simply refuse to respond at all because it all takes too much effortthis proposal as it stands will from my viewpoint make eve combat less likely than it is already yes we already have blobs but i think this proposal may actually make the situation worsei do like the whole concept of uncertainty and fear that removing local could bring but i simply dont see how it will encourgage good fightsall it will lead to is the death of careless individuals caught by surprise who will simply get ganked as they already are while that may be good for pirates i fail to see how its really going to help improve the frequency or quality of pvp in eve on a larger scaleof course there may be ways around this but so far i have yet to be convinced
i think some people are making the mistake of looking at a proposal like this and failing to employ any vision or imagination in how the basic idea would be integrated into the reality of the gamesurely concerns like itd be too hard to find fights could be easily addressed during the development of the actual mechanics and solutions found for minor problems such as these i hope csm candidates weighing in can demonstrate their skills in this area especially with this idea which has tremendous potential and meritit would be my expectation that anyone elected to the csm be skilled at constructive criticism and capable of taking an idea and running with it instead of simply offering a shrug and a its got flaws especially when their job is going to partly consist of recognizing good ideas from the community and helping to develop them for presentation to ccp we need council members who can pitch an idea to ccp with maximum effect
yes its quite easy to be visionary when trying to win votes isnt itlets forget about words such as pragmatic realistic and achievable and focus on vision instead it is so much more exciting isnt itrecognising good ideas is fine  provided that they are actually good ideas and more importantly balancedwe can of course all jump on existing lobbies and claim to be visionaries in order to get elected but what exactly will we achieve when we present illthought or agenda driven proposals to ccpshould we all be sheep and quietly accept jade as the all knowing eve meister or should we point out flaws and issues in her thinking so that those ideas can be refined and improved into something that would actually work and might have a chance of being implemented by ccp jade should welcome this opportunity to fine tune her thinkingbut if it is a sheep you want then dont vote for me hmmmm  may have to turn that into a banner
3 simple solutions1rs make the cloaking ships use fuel and only recons and cover ops have a bonus of compsumption and only the covers and the recons have a spacial bay for the fuel who are too heavy and the non recon ships or cover ops dont so 450 idrogen isotopes can last 30 min 40 min 2cond remove tha friking jump freigters and the jump arrais from poses  lots of ppl are in is primary sistem all daylong only left the primary sistem wen they need to sell they y minerals this 2 things only promove the carebears alliances and make the things for this ppl more easy we need 00 like all days i need to cruise 20 jumps to get one hostile mate3rd make the cloaked ship posible to prove they can be proved with special proves and you only can prove the ship like the all days remember  like shoting 3 proves and thath things  so you can scanthe area but still is dificult but still posible to caths the cloaked bonused ships  so the ships who dont have bonus can be proved more easy but still hard to sry mi engrish im spanish and barely can speack sry and by the way im half ork xd to
a couple of others have said the same and ive answered them in detail above  the key point is to understand exactly what happens when the localmap intel goes away there isnt a way to simply outblob intel failures  you have to scan for and discover enemy gangs and use that read intel gathered from ships in space to make the engagement decision i think its a bit ironic to suggest that removing local would actually reduce the quality of fights and encourage ganking and blobs since to my eyes the current state of the game has reached the absolute optimum peak for this tendency already  now were trying to unwind this and improve the territory somewhat as explained in posts above it really doesnt work that way if a defensive force retreats to the blob and doesnt move its extremely easy to scout and avoid the raiders will simply look elsewhere for more engageable targets and the blob will not be able to move quickly enough to pursue  of course i honestly dont think anything could make eve more blobfriendly than the current status quo of jumpbridgeperfect local and map intel and rapid deployment on any movement on that point we agree to disagree but its worth pointing out that the way people play the game is determined largely by the mechanics in place that doesnt necessarily mean its the way they want to play the game case in point your line about nanoships below this is actually an entirely different issue  and something worthy of debate in its own right but i dont believe every 00 raider pilots nanoships because its what they want to be flying i strongly believe that nanoship culture has evolved because its simply the only way to fight in the current environment of 00 where the defending side has all advantages cyno jammed and jumpbridged systems and the ability to focus the entirety of the defensive blob on any incoming force many players would much use battleships rounded fleets slower more powerful vessels but its suicide to do so in the current state of the game enhanced defender advantage and near instant reinforcement by jumpbridge hotdrop means that an aggressor force must be flying ships that can nearinstantly disengage when local blooms on the incoming hotdrop and multiple incoming forces appear our own experience of 00 warfare in providence just showed that hardin  anytime anti cva bs groups engaged providence forces the battle would always conclude with defenders hotdropping double the numbers from jumpbridges and ending the fight with a convincing blob now you cant expect players to keep losing ships on a failed tactic and conventional slow vessels in enemy 00 sovereignty space against jump bridge reinforcement is a failed tactic this is why your enemies in providence moved to nanoships and cloakers  it was a tactic that traded firepower for maneuverability and ability to disengage so the point is  you need to be able to see the big picture its not enough to complain about nanoships you need to understand why they have become the sole practical raiding option
then that brings us into the realm of discussing sovereign mechanics and bringing vulnerable infrastructure outside of pos shields hardin nobody who puts up equipment in 00 should have the option of simply staying docked forever and not defending it this is a pretty essential principle of eveonline if you want to establish and empire then youd better be prepared to defend it but really i think you are making too much of the difficulty of finding enemies without using local as a perfect 100 reliable intel tool anyone who flies an interceptor knows how quickly you can quarter a system and report hull traces to the fc larger alliances will certainly be able to station scouts and cloakers and have a fair idea of enemy numbers incoming  they wont have absolute certainty in the way they do now but people will adapt and war will continue its a bit silly to suggest that everyone would simply remain permadocked forever if they couldnt know for certain what the total number of pilots in local was obviously we disagree i believe that the tactical uncertainty will lead to more incidence of combat because neither side has the option of simply counting local numbers and dockinggoing safelogging off or otherwise making the disengagement decision based on absolute local intel the blob argument is also unproven really and seems more a gut instinct than a reasoned one ultimately we the player base know that there is a problem with the perfect intel function of local and map statistics  ccp know this from a development perspective too question posed in this thread is about how we address that problem and deal with the issues of implementation i think youre a bit limited in your view of how combat happens hardin its understandable because you come from the bias of big alliance pos ownership perfect intel channels for local and jumpbridge hotdrops on anything that moves but on this issue you need to listen a bit more to the experience of pilots that do the raiding thing and arent counting on being able to sit out fights from behind pos shields or deploy overwhelming numbers in friendly cynojammed systemsyour comments on nanoship warfare showed a bit of naivety on the issue i think  try and ask people their opinion on why nanoships have come to dominate the 00 playing field im not just talking about the ships themselves im talking about the big picture of the space combat in 00 and the environments those ships are designed to survive in ask yourself what happens to a nonnano raiding gang that enters providence at the moment and put yourself into the head of a player trying to construct a fleet that can survive being jumpbridge hotdropped and dictor bubbled in hostile space when you can see these things from other perspectives itll be helpful to revisit the local issue i think
you are wrong about what happens in this game when local goes away your argument to support that position is a false analogy and you are also wrong about the ability to outblob intelligence failuresintelligence networks all follow the same laws of cooperative networksnot sure this is the right word here but their value is equal to the number of nodes they have squared larger alliances are more easily able to dedicate more people to scanning and have larger gangs all scanning this increases the number of nodes they have and lets them get better and more accurate information in faster only by increasing the amount of information that parties have access to or removing the ability to gather information can you limit the advantage that larger gangs and alliances have in this regardno the prevalence of nanogangs has entirely to do with the fact that the ships reduce risks much too severelyie they are overpowered defensive gangs for every type of operation that is not attacking a pos are now nearly all compromised of nanoshipsand for good reasoneven fleets today are split into the nanoships and the battleshipsand the capitals a great example is bob which flies with nearly no frigates ceptors or interdictors nowadays simply because they have become obsolete to fast tech 2 cruisersback in the day when nanofibers were 20ms overdrives were velocity agility and istabs were useless this was not the case because you could not make a cruiser as fast as a frigate but with more hit points and better dps
a nice story at the start nothing like it to get the crowd going and slightly distracted through all the hype im not saying thats wrong just simply pointing that out to anyone who may not have noticed it and been swayedlocal is handy but when it is abused then it becomes a problemthe changes you suggest are massive not in themselves but the effects they can and will have you cant simply say get rid of local  and you havent but it does introduce a number of other issues how do you propose to counter the problems createdbacon and tools like it are bad but local isnt the devil incarnate without it we would spend literally hours scanning probing scanning again warping in only to find the enemy had goneetc etcit would make for very boring gameplay and slow everything down to a snails pacei would suggest keeping local maybe in some watereddown state but banning things like bacon and the goons version of it or simply breaking the log server so these tools can no longer be useda watered down version of local might be121 in system114 neutral3 orange standing up to 499 corp ratingsstandings2 red standing 499 to 10 corp ratingsstandings2 war targets anyone you are at war withthis way you can simply see the number of people in the system and if you have any targets you cannot see the actual player  unless of course they speak which would be stupid in a war rightso i think an overhaul rather than scrapping it totally
did you ever try probing befor the massive change to it that was when it took skill to probe out people and not only skillpoints the thing you describe sounds great to me
i like your idea about local not being available in 00 space i also like the idea of local showing pilot numbers and status only overall its stimulated some good debating and discussion its certainly made me think on the issue most players are bringing up valid points and objections this is an excellent example of how a csm forum topic will probably look as you can see its going to be hard gaining 5 player support for an idea even if a representative agrees with the idea its still going to be hard getting it through a csm meetinghowever i must disagree with your point regarding detecting cloaked ships cloaking is essentially electronic detection avoidance with large swathes of the electromagnetic spectrum affected you are proposing circumventing the whole purpose of the cloaked ship it can sneak up on you and lock you down this just makes 00 sec space a little more uncomfortable for its inhabitants and a little more dangerous instead of making them detectable surely a small increase in the penalty targeting time after uncloak would be better this way if you are suprised you may just get time if you are paying attention to get awayrespondthis of course still allows players to sit near gates collecting entryexit information and relaying it to their corpalliances however this is being done icly so i have no problem with it at allarithron vote arithron honesty and integrity you can trust
well i think its important to engage the imagination a bit too  this is a game after all and it does need appeal our sense of wonder and entertainment as well as statgrinding and eft spreadsheet fandom its certainly a big issue i agree hence its a discussion thread and im very interested to here what everyone thinks on the subject and there have been many excellent posts in this thread and a lot of good debate i do think that youve falling into the same mistake as hardin and others to focus on the length of time it takes to scan systems though ashlee  it really really isnt as slow a process as you are suggestingotherwise the concept for watered down local is interesting but i think it will still show too much information and focus fights in on the blob rather than distributing combat and conflict across a wider areacertainly agree on the banning of bacon and other alliance versions of the software though these things need to go
theres also the fact that if and when local is removed there will certainly be a revamp of the onboard scanner that will to some extent take the place of the intel lost via localwhat i imagine is something like a sonar  passively detecting the presence of other players not empty ships within a certain range  that doesnt cover the entire system so you could check for the presence of players by warping to just a couple celestials in a system that eliminates the omniscience of local chat without blinding players so much that they cant ever find each other to fight i think a revamp of the way the scanner works to make it more passive could lead to some exciting things like what jade describes in the op
as always youre advocating unfair advantages and almost no effort or consequences for the attacking party i dont think that the ability for lolkids to log in for an hour ruin someones investment a ship a pos without any danger or effort and then disappearing to brag on the forums is the right direction for eveplease die until you run out of clones thxbai
i was under the impression that the main objection to these changes is that it would make the job of the attacker much harder
while i dont want to detract too much from the main topic of this thread i have to disagree with you with the reason nanoship culture evolved yes hotdropping is one of the primary causes but i disagree that this is purely down to sov warfarethe fact is that some enlightened people  such as omniscient order  developed nanotactics long before they became flavour of the month why because they could see that it allowed them to engage targets with minimal risk to themselves as goumindong has already highlighted the fact is that nano culture had started to develop prior to the introduction of jump bridges this was partly in response to general tendency for people to blob but more importantly became evident with the introduction of carriers and dreads and more laterly titansyes if people really want to roam 00 now in security and safety they are left with little option but to nano but that is not as you seem to want to insist purely a consequence of sov warfare but a consequence of peoples ability to hot drop ships full stop the simple fact is that people who care about their efficiency would still be using nanos even if jump bridges and cyno jammers went away tomorrow in fact if it wasnt for cynojammers people would probably have to use them even more for fear of being titaned in every engagementbut that is all irrelevant anyway because i wasnt actually complaining about you or anyone else using nanos  as i have acknowledged above they are the wise choice in some situations you were fighting a guerilla war against cva  you were outnumbered and outgunned  i have no issue with you opting to use nanos to keep yourself safethe point that i was making was that while nanos may be useful in certain circumstances do not lead to more or better fights and pvp  in fact quite the oppositeand that is how i see a basic removal of local turning out unless it is balanced properlyby all means use the opportunity to smack about cva blobs again and to bang on about your sov warfare hobby horse but please dont accuse me of not seeing the bigger picture when everything you write quite clearly screams this is my and my corps agenda  sod game balanceedit as a rider to that i do want to highlight one recent phenomena and that is that some alliances such as a and tcf i use these two as they are the ones i know about have actually started flying into hostile space in nonnano gangs purely looking for good fights cva has had some great good old fashioned slugfests with them recently purely because they have come to our space and been prepared to fight even if they knew they would probably be outnumbered on our home turf but would get a traditional conventional fight without us dropping a bunch of caps on themthey have been great fun and indicate to me that a lot of the problems that people want to blame on game mechanics are down to their own attitutde towards playing this game and in particular obsessions with killboard stats and efficiency
i dont have the knowledge to really comment on the rest of the post but this phrase for me sums up the main bone of contention in this issuelocal is so important to pretty much anything that is done in the game that any change to it is gonna change the status quo so if you want to changeremove local you have to accept that it will upset the game balance and force a new equilibirum between the playstyles i do not see any way a sensible change could be made that still preserve the current balance in the game
i think you are making a mistake to make the connection between nanoships and removing local youre just confusing two different issues dont really know what you are talking about here hardin reality is you come from the bigalliance school of pvp where possovereigntyhotdrops are the order of the day thats your experience and its obviously your own interest you are right to say im more interested in small scale roving pvp and tactical engagements rather than huge pos reinforcement battles correct but ultimately both interests need representation on the csm so im not going to be arguing you shouldnt be there but dont be silly and accuse me of bias when youre own is very evident on the subject too its different styles of play and both need representation
very true  and you are doing a damn good job of representing your side of the arguement damn this has been a long readhowever no matter how you replace local scanner whatever you are moving the advantange from the defender to the attacker  which in my opinion is completely the wrong way aroundalso  if you think about even modern radar abilities states can see enemys entering their territory sure it doesnt pop a name of the pilot up but it does pretty much everything elsebased on that local or a list of blue neut and reds should be avaliable to every member of a soverenty holding power in their own terratory based on this and i would add that to high sec because the empire factions would have this information too and probably make it avaiable to friendly pilots
not to stray too far from the topic but that may be something that factors into an eventual change to how sovereignty works based on some recent dev posts  there is talk of allowing sov holding alliances to check the logs on stargates to see who has been using thembut back to this topic  i dont think this particular discussion benefits from viewing it through an attackerdefender lens the omniscience of the local chat list is something everyone acknowledges as lacking in dynamism including most importantly ccp so if local is going to go the question is what can replace it that will be fun and functionalanything other than the current system will be in some way a movement towards less than perfect information so how can less than perfect info be fun and not frustrating jades story is great because it highlights exactly that  how a lack of information can be fun instead of frustrating
dont want to argue with you on semantics but ccp has never said that they are going to remove local  they have just said that it is one of the things they are considering
i have from the very start of this process made it quite clear that i want the csm to represent the multiplicity of game styles available to the players of evehowever where i seemingly differ from you jade is that i am not focused on pushing a corp or alliance agendatake sov warfare i have already acknowledged that changes have to be made to create more opportunities for the attacker and where i do disagree with your proposal and suggestions i do so not because i am part of a sov holding alliance or because the proposal is coming from you but because i genuinely feel that some of the proposed changes are unbalanced and will not be in eves long term interestssimilarly on the issue of local i can see why some people are such advocates for its removal however i also see very good reasons why the removal of local would actually diminish rather than increase the likelihood of enjoyable pvpobviously we will have to agree to disagree sometimes but we also have to be able to compromise and adapt our standpoints based upon the input we receive from all the players of eve and not just those that reflect the interests of our own particular corpsspecifically and quickly on local removal1 uncertainty  uncertainty increases the desire for safety safety is obtained by either not travelling to risky areas or seeking saftey in numbers  its human nature the removal of local increases uncertainty gigantically and unless an effective alternative is put in place it is in my opinion more likely to reduce pvp action than increase it2 tedium  making things harder is not in itself wrong i am sure there are many vets who long for a really hardcore eve the problem is there is a fine line between challenging and tedious make life too difficult and you run the risk of driving people out of the game and while we are at it lets just make eve that little bit more unpleasant and daunting for people joining the game after all its not like they have enough to get to grips with already3 solo play  the removal of local will pretty much eliminate solo play in 00 thats fine if you believe that 00 should be a mercilessly hostile unforgiving place but not so fine if you believe in developing economies and creating empires in 00 its not like we should be doing anything that would encourage people to leave empire anywaywhile those are my major concerns there are also big issues around login traps jump scout in scan gate one enemy in local move scout on jump fleet in  theres now 50 people on the gate  no warning whatsoeveralso undocking no local  no idea who is in the system as you cant scan okay lets put windows on the station  erm what if they are all in cloakers okay lets introduce in station scanners  erm what if they are all in cloakersas it stands it just seems way too imbalanced and impractical to me maybe there are ways around some of the issues i have outlined maybe i am just being too carebear for my own good but i honestly think that the removal of local without an adeqaute alternative would severely damage the playing experience for the vast majority of players
imo all that removing local completely would achieve without changing anything else is a slowdown in activity in the general sense ie it would simply add a timesink to the game as both sides would have to invest more time just looking for people and i dont know about you but im up for making eve more fun not lesssee the usefulness of intel provided by local depends not just on the information itself but how it is received by whoevers reading it or even if its being received at all many a time ive caught people who werent paying attention to it just as ive been caught one or twice myself thats what makes pseudomacros like bacon so dangerous to the health of the game it removes that human element of situational awareness that differentiates the smart player from the dumbcertainly im open to a watering down of local to the effect of providing a count of how many blues greys and reds for example along with a reassessment of how the map works with a view to a fogofwar type effect but a complete removal is just not feasible as far as the fun factor of the game is concernedand this is coming from a roamerben
i think something along these lines isnt far from the correct way to go also it might well help with jump in lag all those portaits to fill in names to list etc
well hardin if you want me to accept that you are intending to represent the whole range of play styles in eve and take you at your word on that then the least you can do in return is take me at mine and dont assume narrow bias while claiming otherwise yourself clearly were both very passionate about the game of eve and have different perceptions and experiences in the game and we do have variant interpretations and assessments of current problemsive already said that the csm needs different viewpoints and areas of specialty to succeed fingers crossed it gets that we need csm reps prepared to engage with and inspire debate in the eve community and see good suggestions raised to the ccp council i think if nothing else we can both agree that this thread is an example of the sort of discussion that achieves genuinely useful feedback
fair enough
the only problem with this statement is that you appear to be very keen on pushing this line of thinking even tieing it with your campain in the thread titleand as far as i can see it only helps the small roving pirate and thus you cannot claim to support all the range of playing styles
i have a couple of questions to those that favour the removal of local after reading this thread1 what about local channels primary purpose  communicationscrapping it might be great from an intel point of view but im not seeing anyone putting forward suggestions on what to do about the great big hole in the social element of the mmo that removing it creates every mmo has a local channel because being multiplayer means people talkmight be alright for all the antisocial types out in 00 where every impairor and kestrel is a enemy alt scout coming to get you but back in empire even in low sec its much more heavily used for what it is  chati dont think i favour taking away something as fundamental as chat without seeing better ideas put forward that include this element too2 as a method of encouraging pvpi think the argument that scouting gatecamps etc will all bring more pvp forget one thing the 00 mechanics of pvp encourage blobbing but also territorial warfaresurely this will just create standby fleets ready to engage as soon as the first alliance member receives that handy mail from concord that tells them their pos shields are droppingi mean having a capital fleet to cyno in on whichever system has pos going into reinforced will be the easiest way to protect themah but what about the miners and the ratters you will cry well exactly my point most pvpers responses to a miner or ratter being attacked by a roving gang will simply remain the same lolz and then move on to looking for something to gank themselves instead of defending anythingwhen 00 alliances become about defending their assets more than just pos and outposts then i can see it making a difference to pvp but most alliances seem to me at least not to care about the individual gankings and raids that go on unless theyre the ones doing iteve is 90 aggression and 10 defense because defense is boringraiding fleet in enemy space is far more fun to your pvp player than scouting home systems just so carebear king can strip zyd in his hulk more easily  even if it is for the good of the alliance which in some cases it is and some its notanyway just my views from reading this
you can easily still have the channel when people talk about removing local they talk about removing its functionality as an intelligence tool ie setting it to delayed mode or off so that the channel list wont ever update or will only update when someone talks kinda how if you open up any large chat channel it will look like no one is in until any person talks then only they show2 this is a very legitimate complaint and one that i shareas well as the slanting towards attacking which is why any removal of local functionality would need to be packaged with a new mechanic that had the same key functionality as local this key functionality is 1 presence2 standinglocal produces some other information like name notes based on show info corpalliance etc that does not need to be figuredfor more information see this link and follow the discussion that goes on the discussion that is in the link that is in the link is also a good read regarding the problems of local and why removing its functionality
the problem with removing or delaying local is it is a bit of a conversation killer but then perhaps i am unusual in that even in low sec id probably natter away to another pilot i saw at a station or in an asteroid belt mining of course but i guess its probably easier to adapt to assumed silence with people hidden unless they speak than to no possibility of communication at all  after all if i cant yelp for help and the locals have a good laugh at my blunders it would make the gankings less fun for all the bystanders as for the thread thanks i will have a look
i believe in the long run getting rid of local would create more problems then it solves while there are some inherent issues with it overall its such an ingrained part of the game now i think it would be difficult to replacei look at my own experiences in 00 space in survival mode and as someone who has played this game solo at times i jump into a system im cloaked initially but unless the pirate gatecamp is at that gate i really have no warning am i supposed to stop and probe out every system im jumping thru on my way somewhere not realistic and way to time consuming we might as well just get rid of highways after all i remember 84 jump trips before those came in and before ap now itll take just as long to go 20 when we have to scan people outlikewise now when i jump in i can see local see those orange skulls and think hey there are pirates around here maybe ill scout a bit warp in at 100km to a gate or warp to a safe location before doing anything i have the choice to protect myself without local youre fair gamei completely agree with hardin on this one while local isnt always the greatest it is the way weve played for years and moreso its the way many have stayed alive or at least lessdead for years another point is what i would think would be a decline in combat right now generally two evenly matched fleets will engage sure one side likes the advantage but usually if the fleets are close its hey lets rumble now imagine where you have no idea what the other fleet has right now you can send scouts to other systems to see if reinforcements are there or check the map for pilots in space not anymore i see gank gank gank the end result of doing away with local i just dont believe its realistic and furthermore believe it would decrease the pvp opportunties in eve for 00 dwellers to a point where the game could lose interest to them even with a sonar type of scanner if you cant see the opposite gate your warping to youre completely blind im sorry but if im in a system and i see 20 pirates in local im going to take precautions with this model the only precaution i have is making sure my clone is updatedwhile archbishop is in a corp i do play solo alt characters at times in 00 space and i know if something like this went through as a solo player id be back hiding in empire stuff where fleets of alliance mates can drum up 50 ships is fine but for the solo or small corp player its completely unrealistic right now those solo an small corp players have a life in 00 and local is one of the only real ways they have to protect themselves taken away its gone regardless of what type of scanner you get people want some semblence of security and like it or not there are a sizeable number of eve players who are solo or in small corps i can see them moving back to empire because of something like this after being ganked over and over again by unseen gatecamps i dont think thats what ccp wantsarchbishop
its the eternal question of evedo you want things safe or do you want them interestinglocal is the safe thing right now people are used to it and it provides them with near perfect informationif you remove local no matter what you replace it with you will create a period of interesting where old assumptions mustbe abandoned and new tactics developed
well this is the thread i was thinking of
i must admit straight away that i have only skimmed some of the posts and ignored most as i simply dont currently have the time to give this topic all the attention it requires right nowi agree with the main arguments against removing local in that it would move the game balance quite drastically towards favoring the attacker i wont go into all that again  it has already been covered however i do see the general frustration with local and perhaps its possible to come up with some sort of middle wayso heres an idea that might be good or bad imagine local is updated by either having people using gates into the system taking aggressive action or flying capitalsalso imagine a module coming in 3 sizes frig cruiser and bs this module would have a rather high cpu and power requirement limiting the striking capability of the ship its fitted to but it would allow you to jump to planets and stars within range without using either gates jumpbridges or cynosthe range is could then be 03 light years per rank of some skill invented for the purposefinally this module would have some restrictions on use you cant fit a cloak on the same ship as this module and you cant activate the module for a period of 30 minutes after taking aggressive actionthe idea of this being to give raiders some sort of first strikesurprise capability  but at a cost after attacking you cant cloak or use this supercyno module for an extended period of time making you somewhat vulnerable to the defensive responsepersonally i would also like to see the logoffski trick hampered by letting ships fitted with this module remain in space for 30 minutes after logoff me no like logoffskisi havent exactly thought this one through but the idea might be worth some consideration
i am tired of saying it all over again butlocal needs to die without replacementbuff the scannerthats it repeat that for 5 years  and here we are  sad isnt itccp utterly failed on instas removement so i hardly see anything cool coming out of this change
hat off to you sira very nice post and damn solid argumentscount me amongst the supporters
thank you sinnae very much appreciated
if those advocating the removal of local would answer a couple of quick questions from me it would allow everyone to make a more informed decision for many years now weve seen ccp make some decisions to change the game only to have a patch a short while later to fix some unintended consequence of their improvement 1 if local is removed how are solo players who operate in 00 supposed to live there anymore and enjoy the benefits of 00 space while staying as solo players given the increased risk of ganking when you warp into a gate and have no idea if someone is there or not like a 30 ship pirate blob i would think the enjoyment of the game by these solo players would be greatley diminished i also think they would flee back to empire where they can see whats around them2 on long distance trips thru 00 space are you supposed to stop and scan the system now everytime you jump with some new sonar module sort of thing how long would this take it basically ends autopilot if you have to stop everytime you jump and do thisjades idea is great if we want to change this into eveallianceonline and have everyone join an alliance so we can all fly around in a battlegroup and scan out the enemy the reality is far different for many in eve however and i dont believe making changes to the game which basically lead the solo players to the altar of sacrifice and gankarmageddon is the answer not everyone is in an alliance and can do these things likewise even if people are in an alliance maybe theyre not some battle hungry alliance of pvp killers maybe theyre peaceful mining industrialist carebears venturing into 00 to make their fortune not everyone in eve is looking for endless pvp and wild timeswhile something like that may not be intended by removing local i do believe it would be another in the long line of unintended consequences to ccp patches and improvements those two questions above stand for anyone willing to take a shot at them if a compelling argument can be made ill listen but im going on the experience of someone with nearly 6 years in eve counting beta who has played the solo game in 00 and knows the reality of flying alone out there now there is something that no one has brought up however that surprises me what if in 00 space any war declared enemy doesnt appear in local you can see everyone else like those 15 guys with 100 sec status but if youre corporation is wardecd you cant see those enemies i mean if people want the thrill of the hunt and chase why not this it gives that hunt and chase to those who want it while keeping the status quo for those who donteven so i do see something like this causing pvp to slow down quite a bit as corps are reduced to scanning and jumping scanning and jumping to accomplish anything sounds kind of boring to mearchbishop
some of these issues have definitely been addressed in this thread already archbishop but just to provide a decent summary to your points 1 the removal of local will not really change the solo dynamic negatively in 00 at the moment loneplayers dont really move with perfect freedom archie sure you can warp to outbound  but each time you jump through the gate you take the same risk you outline for the localless scenario how do you know you arent jumping through into a sensorboosted  hicrapier camp you dont thats eve how do you escape well speed cloaks ew maneuverability pretty much the same evasion tools youd need now if you jump to a gate and get caught by a bubble off gate only difference is that when warping to an outbound you can opt to go to scan point and check first when jumping through a gate you dont have that option and that is the current status quoat least with the scenario you outline warping to a gate you have an option of moving with scanner open and being prewarned or warping to close celestial and checking  or if its a common route for you then by all means make a line of inline scan points 1000 klicks or so form the outbound and be warned of the gate status doing this gives you more information and warning than the process of simply jumping through the gate without scout does now2 if you read the suggestion were talking about a new form of long range scanner that is always on and can be configured to give proximity warnings on the acquisition of new contacts yes of course going to outbound scanpoints as a precaution would break your autopilot but seriously who uses autopilot in 00 archbishop3 i dont think your previous points support this concept turning eve into alliance online  on the contrary i believe that reducing the perfect map intelligence and local monitoring functionality will reduce the ability of alliances to control and dominate space and will allow solosmall group players far greater opportunity to evade and exist in 00 without continual interference from sitting powers at the moment any rattingmining op can be seen by everyone in eve by scanning the map discovering the presence of interlopers is ridiculously easy just by scanning through local with a quick trip reduce intelligence functionality and you are making it easy for the little guy to evade notice and isnt that really what you were worried aboutanyway thanks for your comments archbishop and i hope youll read the feedback to your points with an open mindall the best
good writeup
something that hardin wrote caught my attention hereto paraphrase he noted that less information equated to a less safe environment  the options then being to stay in a safe area or to seek safety in numbers thus reducing the viability of solo playits a sound argument in that respect which might point us towards solutionsi know ive mentioned the aspect of terrain in terms of system space as an important factor but ill detract on this for a minute and talk about concentration of forceif we think of the scanner perhaps it should detect not just individual elements such as ships but the combined effect of large numbers of ships in one location for example the scanner might act to detect mass signature readings created by ships in close proximity to one anotherin essence the scanner would actually show blobs as well blobs of mass on radar this might be fairly simple to calculate by totaling the signature radius of all ships within a given grid for examplenow to bring back my thoughts on terrain we can then add an overlay of backround noise and interferance around certain objects  environments in space where this background noise is strong individual ships would be lost amongst the clutter but larger ships  blobs of ships would still be apparentfurthering this subject we can consider the popular active vs passive scanning method here we might imagine an active ping clearing away a certain amount of background noise albiet at the cost of a higher signature radius within a narrow arc of view and rangeeven more tantalising we can see the prospect of camoflaging your ship for specific environments through the use of specialised modules or the creation of probes that produce false images of high mass concetrationsedit visual representationany thoughts on thisc
do you ever log in jade
mmmhmmm but generally quite late in the us tz at the moment lavista i dont often play in the uk tz unless weve got an arranged op drop me a pm on the sf forums or shc if you want to arrange a chat
this is a brilliant idea
yes it is isnt it  anti blob too when you think about itc
agreed to a point although lets look at it a moment from the aspect of the stationary solosmall alliance player in a system lets say the abc mining corp is out mining in 00 and has 34 mining ships or even a rorqual and 2 guys in ravens to defend against belt rats and theyre just minding their own business with the current local system if 10 pirates jump into system theyll be seen with no local that warning is gone sure some proximity sensors might help and the two defending ravens could swap a high end weapon for a scanner to keep scanning but why then would this be any different from what we have nowthats sort of the point im making here with an improved sensor system its really no different from current local people are supporting a revamped sensor and map system to help aid the local benefits lost yet why even dump local if were going to offer totally usable substitutes in the end thats the hidden point of my message either theyll be big changes or it isnt a change at all and i have to agree with some that ccp doesnt move in big steps in the end i think the abandonment of 00 by alot of solo and small alliance players would happen i believe wed see alot more gatecamping and alot more ganking and in the end no real improvementi do agree with you jade that local was never intended to become an early warning system thats whats evolved though and thats what weve had for five plus years while we can tweak it a bit maybe make it so war declared enemies dont appear or something in the end i just dont think its wise to mess withi will agree with you on dumping the map inteligence likewise i dont believe the map should be used for intel maps are for convenience not recon when im driving down the highway and looking at a map it tells me theres a gas station at the next exit but it doesnt give me the price per gallon of gas yes dump the map intel and while theyre at it make the map only informational things like services are great but info like pilots in system corp member locations podkills etc are only intel based who gives us that intel it isnt realisticthat said id support an alternative what if even without sovereignty a corporation could deploy spy satellites that could monitor a system gate you could only deploy a few of them per corp but you could put them where you believe your enemy is operating theyd require maintenance and would shut down after awhile it would require special skills to operate and the benefit would be more realistic then some all seeing map we can pull upthis would be good you could detect a 20 ship pirate gatecamp before you warp in on top of them at leastgood discussion everyonearchie
this is a good example to work with with local the pirate scout jumps in sees players in system and starts hunting for them the mining op sees someone pop into local and knows something might be upwith a scannerbased system the pirate jumps into system and doesnt know if anyone is there and the mining op doesnt know anyone jumped into system now the pirate starts searching for pings on his sonar he gets a hit  but at the same time the mining op gets a ping too and the game is on they both have imperfect informationnow in your example the mining op would actually do better to station their guards at the stargates leading into the sytem then when a pirate scout jumps in they see him but he still doesnt know where the mining op is located and the battle becomes a systemwide situation with a front at the stargate while the mining op in the belt has to start making decisions about what action to take as intel comes in from the front linesthis sort of scenario is just more dynamic and has more possibilities than the current local chat list its not that an improved scanner system would be either identical to local or just not as good  its that an improved scanner has a wider range of dynamic possibilities than local for how intel plays into conflictyour question about if local is just getting replaced by something that does the same thing why bother replacing it is understandable  but the real reason local needs to be replaced is not that intel is bad its that its a static systemimagine eve was a game with a single class of ships that are all fast and powerful then someone suggests getting rid of that single class of ships and instead introducing some ships that are light and fast but fragile and other ships that are heavier and wellarmored but slower the same question you raise could be asked then why take away our ships that do everything if youre just replacing them with two different classes of ships that amount to the same thing the answer is to make the game more dynamicreplacing the static tool of local with a more dynamic tool that can range from being superior to local intel to inferior depending on how it is used will make the intel side of eve more dynamic and more fun thats what id like to see happen anyway
id agree herethe current system is akin to being on a flat becalmed lake the players view is essentially limitless in terms of who is there however if we add storms squalls of rain mist and fog banks to this lake the picture changes and becomes more dynamic and requires more skill as a resultc
but with this example you are showing that you need far more people to do the same op now i havent mined since 04 so please dont tell me im getting it wrong im just using it as an examplein the first instance you have a 34 miners and 12 guards  possibly a hauler or two thats max 8 people now if you remove local you need someone one each gate and in most average systems thats another two people so we are up to 10 and everyones profits decrease now someone warps in the scouts on the gate tell them someone ebil has appeared and they all get to a safe spotthe game has become no more dynamic the results are the same accept you have just made the game a little less fun for everyone 2 people have spent their evenings staring at a star gate and the miners have made less money because of it now mineral prices will rise pirates will start whining that their ships are more expensiveyou get my drift
or you introduce another mechanic a perimeter beacon spy satellite call it what you want but it gets dropped by a member of the mining gang at the star gate that gang member can now go elsewhere in the system maybe mine maybe keep the rats away but he gets an alert as soon as someone enters that gate
existing in 00 would indeed require more vigilance without local i dont deny that but again its as though battleships were great ewar platforms and then ccp introduces dedicated ewar ships and downgrades the battleships ewar potential  people might complain that theyre just requiring them to have more pilots in a gang in order to use ewar but creating specializations in the end makes the game better even if its more workif in our mining op example having eyes for the op was something advantageous then maybe recon probes could be changed to act as those spy beacons that max brought up the mining op could hire a covops pilot to keep probes up covering the gates to passively detect anyone entering the system and give an early warning to the mining op before the pirates know the op even exists
any replacement of local needs to be well workedout so that it does not shift balance around too much but nevertheless manages to add excitement to the game for everyoneone more idea for the pilehow about being able to automatically detect certain warp signatures as well with the chance of your ship detecting it increasing if the ship emitting the signature is heading straight towards youmakes sense from a science standpoint warp drive emits ftl particles if it heads straight toaway from you your scanner will detect abnormal amounts of those particles coming from the same direction
an interesting ideaa pirate sits quietly at a belt ready to ambush his preyb miner sits at a belt sees a warp drive spike on scanner  time to flee works for both parties certainly worthy of consideration ankecps please someone fix these forums this has taken three attempts just to post a reply
ive given up i had a long post and it wouldnt let me post itedit  now its let me post that trying to see if i can get the other post posted i cant be bothered to type it all out again but the gist wasif you do this then what is the point you have just removed local onlt to replace it with something that acts just like local but requires more effortwhats wrong with more effort you might ask fun this is a game its not a second job i will draw another comparason within this game there was talk about people having cyno blockers up 237 in every system which ccp didnt like they were talking about making it having to be refueled every 12 hours or similarthat would have achieved nothing appart from making people feel this is a job rather than a game it wouldnt have taken the cyno blockers down it would have just caused the alliances to spend their entire lives fueling it  and making them hate the game for making them do itremoving local will cause the same if you replace it with a time consuming alternative  people will just do that alternative hate the time consuming nature of it get bored of eve and play less or leave yes thats rather extreme but im just making my pointif you want to make eve harder remove local entirely i wont be happy it think it will be a griefers paradise however the alternative is to remove local replace it with a silly time consuming scanner system which will annoy people who will do it to try and stay safe and nothing will change appart from everyone enjoying themselves less
yeah its a pain  do what i do and copy the whole thing before you post itc
how does the miner know the warp drive spike is not just his hauler coming back to the belt leaving the belt a friendly moving through the system a friendly ratter in another beltetc etc etc etc
i like jadess ideas on this matter a lone hunter in say a battleship would have a snowballs chance of getting somewhere out in null space if he knows his stuff meanwhile the smart ratterminer can hide off the beaten trail and be pretty safe all the morons in the alliance will be huddled around the 34 systems with the best spawns and the best ore guess where the hunters goes looking first
csms take notelocal soulution is simpleanyone in local can warp to anyone with the rules1 you cannot warp to cov ops perhaps probe em out with a long delay which is long enough to catch afk cov ops2 warping to a noncov ops cloak ship puts you in grid at a random distace distance to be balanced on test server3 you cannot warp to someone in deadspace probe em out as usualbingo  local is no longer stupid if you see someone in local you can get a fight out of them if its 00 rather than the current cloak tactics and afk intel bot tacticsalso nerfs all isk farmers as well as all intel bots think about it whats wrong with warping to anyone in local nothing and this will remove all nevitive local problems as well
you make a valid point in all honesty but the scenario i posted was is answer to a specific question about miners and what they could do to remain safe the alternative there was to use either alts or mains dedicated to watching gatesi think we need to peel this back and refocus on why people want to change local then discuss again encompassing all scenarios i really do not think there is a one size fits all solution to this thanks for your point of view its extremely valid
i think local has come to the fore for a number of reasonsobviously players dont want to get ganked by overwhelming numbers the tactic of scouting ahead witha lone ship whilst having a massive fleet a jump or two out is now well used and understood warp core stabs having been nerfed provide little hope to players now in fact virtually no one fits them compared to 2 years ago  a factor exaccerbated by hicsso how does a player escape the gank well he cant  his only option is to run as soon as a hostile appears even just one hostile because of the risk of further ships over the horizon bacon is a good example of the pressing need for immediate intel in this regardand this applies both ways the scout can immediately see if its worth attempting a hunt in a given systemso we have a stalemate the hunters get fewer and fewer hunting kills and so resort to gatecamping hotdrops or logon traps typically utilising overwhelming force blobseven if both sides are pvp centric the fights dont occur as everyone is busy tallying up numbers in local to achieve superiority of numbers thats a cyclical effect with fleets growing and growing until one side looses the tally and docks up runs to a pos or just logs off for the nightat least thats my view  others may disagree c
i say ban bacon keep local and all you whiners about local out there shut up cause you will whine when its gone and you keep getting ganked
weve had local since the game began why should we change something that is so establishedi really am sick of the nerf this nerf that get rid of this do this dont do that attitude of the player base it really has gotten out of handeverything in this game can be overcome used to your advantage if you just think about how you play instead of crying about itits so easy to get kills even with local if you just use a bit of common sense this game has been dumbed down a lot in the last year or so its not the game i signed on for which is probably why i dont play as much as i used to anymoreget over yourselves and get on with the game yes the game sheesh
agreed jade i am so tired of not being able to kill anything because as soon as i enter local everyone and their mother warps out of the belt and cloaks or if i bring a gang of 5 the gang of 3 cloaks because they know i am a gang of 5 if they can at all count this would also help to fix scouts in a station 5 jumps down the pipe rousing the blob as soon as we get close so signed
what everyone forgets is that this is just a game and you are supposed to have fun not make it complicated to be as realistic as real life is so local as it is todayyou jump in sys you know if there is hostiles in it and how much you dont know where in sys they are what ship they are in are they active or not so you have to scan them and look for them removing localyou jump in sys you dont know if there is any1 there but you scan the whole sys hoping there would be some1 to fight now considering avarage play time is 23 hours per day my guess you can cover well over 20 jumps looking for fights you may find some  removing local and making you scan all the sys you enter you would be able to cover maybe 10 sys just maybeso removing local will in that way decrease your chance to find trouble fight do pvp2 the lone raterminer in 00 this kind of player is pve fitted hostiles entering sys will be pvp fitted removing local will make that player spam scan button in order to survive hostile who entered sys looking for targets know that the most probable place to find one is in belts that means that the player ratingmining will see the hostile on scan who is already warping to him checking the belts and wont have time to escape minerrater will have even lower chances of survival if the hostile gang enters sys the bigger the gang less chance of survival as they can check belts in one sweep  reading posts in this topic and others concernig removal of local i noticed its all about making your fleet invisible and undetected by enemy imo 00 isnt just about fleet vs fleet and gate camps  i dont mind if local gets changed as long as there is some other early warning system that gives solo player equal chances of surviving as the hunter will have of findingkilling himps spelling p
were seeing a lot of the same comments popping up in relation to this issue personally i think its just a misunderstanding of what is being suggested and why so this is my take on clearing some of that up1 misconception replacing local is being suggested in order to favor one group or playstyle over anotherin truth replacing local is being suggested to increase dynamism in the intel aspect of the game its the difference between an rts with a fog of war and one without  adding a fog of war doesnt shift the balance of power it affects all parties equallythe pirate will be affected by the same limitations and have the same options to gather intel as the miner or the megaalliance member2 misconception if the balance of power will stay the same why bother changing it at all its just more workreplacing local with a dynamic scoutingscanning intel system would be adding a new layer to the game it opens up new weapons tools and tactics to be used in the intel battle that takes place prior to the combat battle so although balance wouldnt be affected in a political sense the possibilities for gaining and losing advantage would be widened and a more complex game resulting3 misconception the ops proposal is to simply remove localmany straw man arguments can be concocted centering around doomsday scenarios that would result from simply shutting off local tomorrow and seeing what happens but what jade asks in the ops story is that we open our imaginations to the possibilities of trading our static local intel for something more dynamic and layered that can be as simple or as elegant or as complex as we can imagine lets not assume that players would be forced to sit and hit scan every five seconds when we can easily imagine a revamped scanner that automatically and constantly scans for us since the possibilities are wide open let us not be deterred by what is when we can concieve of a better what may be
i cant help but respond to this you actually believe the game is currently hard ive been almost as long as you and essentially started over now but for a universe that is supposed to be brutal and unforgiving they sure put in alot of get rich quick elements over the yearsi dont think i am alone in having my jaw drop to the floor at this considering this is how every major group including cva plays what do you mean by fall back this is being done already anyway short of a few players i very rarely see any cva come out to play without significantly greater numbers on their side i can understand this to a degree people hate to lose and love to win having larger numbers reduces risk and effectively ensures the win but it also removes all semblance of tactical planning unfortunately the state of eve currently encourages and promotes thisyes lets leave large regions of space controlled groups that have now become complacent paranoid and lazy that works much betterwhile im not 100 behind all jades ideas i do like the direction of the ideas some people say this particular idea prevents soloing in dangerous areas well gosh golly what a thought if i am going alone into a bad neighborhood that isnt patrolled at all by law enforcement isnt it reasonable to expect a very high level of confrontation and danger go into that same place with a large group the threat level lowersi do not believe i am the only one who misses the risk from the beginning days of eve as the ing and moaning dragged on over the years ccp made things far too easy and more forgiving and by doing so took away from some of the themed elements now i am going to pick on hardin and cva some more as i have more experience with them purely from an outside point of view but they also make a good example here you have an alliance that appears by just their own manpower to be able to manage 100150 players on average for an active fleet factor in their allies you could see about 200250 on average yet they maintain and control an entire region of systems that is quite large in size does that make any sense compared to the npc empires yes player driven ones are done in a different context but look how easy it is now to pull this off you would expect large areas should be controlled by large alliances that have the manpower and organization to do so however items and ships now exist to make it feasible for groups to do this without much thought which make it feel alot like munchkin gaming i see this idea as one extra step to recapturing some of the elements that made us want to join eve

the council of stellar managementwith this document im hoping to seduce you into voting for me to represent the eve community on the founding council of stellar management csmits an important position and this inaugural council is going to be under the spotlight for its manner its own accomplishments and its general approach to the task at hand its going to be highly controversial in some ways we all know this there are going to be debates and arguments and there are a lot of improvements that need making were going to see big alliances dominate the proceedings on pure number base were going to see special interest groups arguing for radical rebalancing of core mechanics well see cults of the personality and superstars arise in the player domain and were going to see ccp publicise the new oversight and capitalise on player involvement to improve tarnished aspects of their reputation some good some bad some scandal and some genuine improvements are possible but ultimately we have an opportunity here to find a voice and take responsibility for pushing the game of eve in the directions we want to see it go and thats got to be a good thingbut what i want to make sure is that in all the politics and alliance interest and egopolishing there is a representation for the player who like me truly loves that iain m banks dream and finds the imaginative potential of this gorgeous single server environment as strong today as it ever was five years ago and will fight with every breath for the continuation and enhancement of that splendid vision i love this dark and dangerous universe with an adult twist of nihilism and intrigue i adore the battlefields strewn with the wrecks of a thousand ships and the sweet taste of victory made sweeter yet for the memory of defeats in times before eve is a game where a player can make a name and reputation and rise from obscurity to command the attention and notice of the universe i did it once and it was the greatest ride of my gaming life now i want to make sure that every new player starting out in this game has the same potential and opportunities i had and that eve continues to be the truly open sandbox environment where everything is possible for the reckless and the wise alikeapologies then for the long preamble but i thought it best we make sure a compatibility of imagination vision and outlook exists before we get into the nittygritty of the policies and interests ill be presenting below if youve come with me this far then i think we might be onto something you and i maybe we wont agree on everything who does but you will at least understand why im going to say the things i do below and all id ask is that you think a while with an open mind and cast your vote with conscience after considering all the options and possibilities before you and i wont be offended if the vision of chaos and destruction scares you a little bit but really dont we all enjoy being scared from time to timecsm policy advocacylets get something clear from the beginning im not going to promise to be all things to all people other candidates will do that and if you like the safetyblanket of a universal trust me ive got all your best interests at heart message you might not find my politics entirely to your tastei have enthusiasms and interests of my own you see i have things i care about and wish to see improved and promoted within the environment of eve online i imagine that makes me an unwise politician in the context of the csm elections but it does at least ensure that you are going to see well in advance exactly what you are going to be getting from my candidacy if you choose to trust me your vote so here goes
enhancing dynamism in 00 space warfarethere is a problem with the current empire building and endgame conflict engine in eve pos structures for sovereignty the prevalence of cyno jammers strangling open space and nullifying entire ship classes the danger of indestructible outpost spam in 00 cheapening the business and risk of establishing territorial roots at present the speed of territorial conquest in 00 has slowed to a crawl with dynamics akin to the trench warfare of ww1 with fixed positions and machine gun nests dominating the landscape its stopped being fun its stopped being accessible its become a typical mmorpg grind which is a cardinal sin for a game that was designed from the ground up to avoid typical boring grind gameplay in its fluid sandbox environmentthe art and vision of eve the epic space opera has been damaged by the introduction of empirebuilding elements prioritizing defence and safety and consequencefree building in what is supposed to be the most hazardous environment in the game universe the dark and dangerous 00 void where all can be lost to war and fate has changed to simcityinspace where all you need to defend your interests is to keep towers fuelled 247 and ensure your cyno jammer is anchored at the nastiest pos tower configuration possible small scale territorial conflict is not practical anymore since the defence advantage is so vast that massive assets are required to assault even the smallest 00 landholders in essence the balance between attack and defence has gone wrong and needs to be adjusted1 the cyno jammer module needs to be addressed urgently they should never be the kind of starbase module that one anchors in each system in 00 flicks the onswitch and never needs to worry about maintenance or priority ever again at the moment the game encourages each alliance to anchor these things everywhere and in doing so encourages precisely the kind of massive numerical fleet warfare that the game infrastructure clearly cannot handlenobody enjoys laggy blob warfare but that is exactly the kind of fighting required to make any kind of progress against the ubiquitous cyno jammer defended pocket empires across the map right now for eve to reach its beautiful potential as a spaceconflict simulator with grand fleets clashing in vital engagements across multiple fronts in 00 as empires rise and fall the developers need to take a serious look at the implications of all pos technology in general and the jumpblocking cyno jammer module as an item of the highest priority2 make outposts vulnerable to destruction for some this is a taboo subject the idea that a multibillion isk investment in fixed infrastructure in 00 should be destroyable in some fashion frankly horrifies some residents of nullsec and the alliances there but really isnt it contrary to eves nature that its possible to build something in open space and have it stand as an indestructible monument forever more where is the accomplishment in building a station if it cannot be destroyed if your forces are defeated where is the drama and the grandeur of a desperate defence if the aggressors cannot burn and pillage your possessions and obliterate your dreams in a cataclysm of fire and fury
and less poetically  what happens to eve when all of 00 is covered in indestructible outposts at some point in the future when there are so many of these structures that nobody considers them worth defending and they remain as empty shells bereft of purpose or emotional meaning my point is that for something to have value it has to have vulnerability  to build and maintain an outpost should be an accomplishment and defending such things should be a major endeavour and never involve lets go to empire and bore the aggressors and return and put up more towers to get it back in 3 months time when theyve gone away again players risk more total isk loss in the hull and fittings of motherships and titans the game of eve doesnt need indestructible capture the flag gameplay in 00 space3 introduce competitive mobile infrastructure the balance of power in 00 has tipped wildly in favour of the fixed territorial paradigm all technology and advantages encourage and necessitate the establishment of static base building and sovereignty maintenance this forces players through one single set of hoops if they want to reach the highest tech levels and end content for the game the problem is that it damages eves original vision as a playerled creative sandbox for open experimentation and diversity of playstyles sure we need territorial empires and tyrants and star bases and exclusion zones but they are just one part of the ecosystem  they should never be the only optionwhere are the cloaked pirate bases the mobile refineries the guerrilla resistance movements operating from converted freighters in enemy space smugglers and blockade runners spies and assassins rogue traders and loners scraping an existence from the underbelly of these empires there should be advantages for the fixed power but there should be options and alternatives for the mobile force a balance needs to be rediscovered and the high level content options for eve need to be widened and made more diverse to maintain its appeal for existing and new players owning sovereignty 4 and an invulnerable outpost should not be the universal endgame for every organisation in eve4 encourage diversity in pvp engagement opportunity deriving from all the above the challenge for the csm and game direction in general is how to raise the beautiful pvp combat aspect of eve online from its current doldrums to a new height of variety and enjoyable opportunity combat in 00 currently is about pos warfare and siege or securing gates during pos siege there really isnt anything else of value to attack or defend the stated intention of delivering midrange targets for small unit pvp needs to be revisited and made to work this time infrastructure items need removed from pos gun proximity  pos themselves need reworking from the swiss army knife tool they are now to things with variety and specialisation moon mining towers should not be as difficult to attack as sovereignty claiming defence towers elements in the defence grid like system scanners jump bridges and cyno jammers should be vulnerable structures in their own right  not simply modules spammed out within the universal aegis of the ubiquitous death star pos
new environments and precious items need to be found and secured ingame hacking of defensive objects countersiege deployable objects anti cyno jammers forward bases warp range standoff batteries even using asteroids as weapons basically we need more places and environments in which to fight and reasons to do the fighting there diversity and variety are the spice of life and eve combat in 00 give players a diversity of targets and multiple objectives in war and skirmish and youll make valuable progress in the fight to reduce dependence on blobwarfarepromoting improvement and variety in empire warfarewhile the 00 dynamic in conflict has benefited from a vast amount of developer attention over the years the core mechanics of empire war and the conflicts and smaller battles between predators and vigilantes on the verges of policed space has received virtually none at core these tiny struggles between pirate and victim between small corporations fighting turf wars over lowsec assets and trading slights these conflicts in empire between rivals and bounty hunters searching for profit in the slaying of illegals are every bit as important as the vast games of empires raging in deep 00 these conflicts are the content that attract and maintain new players and enrich the environment for all of usnot every eve player has the desire or ambition to fight vast fleet battles some prefer their pvp in small unit scale some like the thrill of lone hunting and there is a whole ecology of stainless steel rats living in the wainscoting of eves society between the safe zones of core empire and the highpressure sovereignty war of playercontrolled 00 and this is not mere minority interest this is a major area of the game for many many people not everyone who plays eve is a 247 alliance warrior in it for the alarm clock pos sieges and blackscreen lag clashes for the honour of the supreme commander of their coalition empire conflict is important and it needs advocacy at the csm to ensure it gets the attention and developer support it needs to reach real potential1 piracy bounties and transferable kill rights there are some very simple but compelling ideas doing the circuits of the eve ideas and suggestions forums allowing surrender for victims powering down of weapons allowing pirates to shoot to disable ie disable a ship rather than destroying it when it runs out of structure both great ideas that would immeasurably enrich that career choice and as for transferable kill rights  its a brilliant concept if you get killed by an illegal in empire you get a kill right on the aggressor why shouldnt you be able to sell that kill right to a 3rd party bounty hunter who must be sec status
so lets go a step further and allow the sold killright to function as a special kind of location agent that lets the bounty hunter track down the illegal and take a shot to deliver a form of justice to the victim its neat its simple and it brings another form of pvp to the game and will make eve more exciting for pirates and bounty hunters both oh yes and make it so bounty can only be collected by the person who owns the kill right no more selftermination by alts for profit successful completion of a kill right contract by an accredited hunter gets lps from concord and can buy special pretty things from the lp shop thats right missions that trigger pvp  why not its this kind of idea we should be exploring to widen the appeal of the game and break the obsessiondomination of massive slug fests only2 enhanced corporate strife open mercenary contracts the wardec system in eve is pretty ancient now and a very blunt stick its largely unchanged since the beginning of the game five years ago one side picks a target votes or selects the enemy pays the fee and corporate  alliance warfare begins there are no win conditions save blowing up ships  outlasting the endurance of declarer  no real structure no penalty for doing hideously badly or award for doing well at the minimum we could do with some kind of corporate  alliance statistic showing their ratio of wins  losses  ship tonnage  efficiency just to know who was really terrible at conflict and who did well very important for merc corporations credibility but what we really need are terms of the fighting  is it to kill ships is it to drive the target from xyz system is it to reduce target membership is it to destroy a pos is it to protect  nullify somebody elses wardec there needs to be some variety and there needs to be a penalty for failing in the objective i remember five years ago noticing the surrender option in the war panel and wondering what the cost was going to be for losing a war that question needs to be revisited and its something we all need to ask and considerplus when a victim corporation has an incoming wardec shouldnt they be able to automatically advertise for help by publishing the plea on a roster of requests for aid that mercenary corporations could answer and accept as a binding contract the mercenaries get involved and automatically get paid a bounty for each vessel of particular type from a fund that the victim corporation establishes at point of bid establish a proper game structure for mercenary work eve is the ideal environment for this i would like to see proper ranking tables and ingame adverts for mercenary agencies trading on their reputation and past accomplishment endless development time has gone into pos mechanics lets have some devoted to encouraging the spread of playerled professions with actual player on player action rather than beating the dead horse of player on pos grinding
3 fix black ops technology its a great idea on paper weve had covert frigates cloaking light raiding cruisers and now jump capable stealth battleships that can make miniature jumpportals for mobile forces to use to jump behind the lines of sitting territorial powers sounds really exciting guerrilla ops tense manoeuvre with cloaks and secret jumps and espionage but the potential has suffered with a sloppy deployment and the universal spam of cynojammers those things again on most approaches to 00 from empire eve is a game of intrigue and spying and all kinds of information and psyops warfare lets ensure that technology to support this career choice is correctly implemented and available to the player base as a valid and entirely playable option i believe the field of blackops should include methods of hackingdisabling player structures planting tracking devices listening bugs and making the business of espionage less meta and more ingame technology with systems modules and skills produced to empower and balance such endeavorsthe current crop of black operations battleships represent a very interesting game development that could deliver variety in play style and great opportunities for new conflict but theyve been introduced sloppily without properly understanding the reality in game at the moment and they need attention so they can support an appropriately sneaky playchoice for players wishing to specialise in battlefield recon and special operations in the eve universe i think most agree at the minimum covert cynofields need to be immune to conventional cynojammers but in addition these ships need increased jump range to allow them to traverse the long realspace pirate jumps between regions and they certainly need radically increased cargo bays to store the fuel needed to jump themselves and other vessels into the combat zone4 ensure faction warfare is done right this is the big one its been promised for years the great hope of the roleplay community postaurora and something that could be absolutely brilliant for everybody who seeks roleplay conflict and pvp entertainment in empire the concept at core were playing in a living universe where npc empires amarr matari gallente caldari and other minor factions are intriguing plotting scheming and ultimately fighting each other our characters corporations and alliances develop standings and loyalties for one side or another through the process of game activities agents and such and could get embroiled in actual conflict with player entities supporting the rival powersfaction warfare promises actual game consequence for these conflicts and reasons for people to get involved in rp campaigns between the npc powers maybe the federation moves on the state and tries to take over a border region thus evicting all those lovely level 4 agents the caldari fans were farming for years wouldnt that convince the caldari agent runners to get involved with the fight and confront the gallante loyalists and runners in a pitched battle to defend their interests is it something anyone could get involved in maybe external corps and alliances sign up for one side or another and fight all opponents in free sanctioned war decs and at the end of the month the side that inflicts the most casualties gets awarded the win real game changes happen war heroes and combat aces are made medals get handed out  rare faction kit to the victorious corps everyone cheers maybe its a dream but its a good dream and its something the csm definitely needs to encourage because its precisely this kind of thing that eve needs to remain fresh and competitive and healthy in the wider game market
fleet battle lag and blob warfareso i think by now youll be getting the point of my candidacy these are the things i care about and im convinced that arguing for increased developer priority in these areas will improve the game and enrich the game experience for everyone im not one of these people that believe there will ever be a silver bullet lag solution that miraculously solves the problem of blob warfare and makes 1000 ship battles run with silky smooth responsiveness i believe the solution to lag is breaking down conflict opportunities into smaller theatres  ive played and enjoyed eve combat for almost five years now and to my eyes and judgement the game simply works better at certain scales than others this is my conviction and its what ill be arguing for  so i guess that means im an antiblobwar candidate as well as anarchist outpost destroyerbut thats my position and its the platform im going to be standing on for the csm elections i think we should be improving the game by adding new things and more variety and enriching the possible career options for new and existing players in smaller corporations and alliances i really think its a mistake to keep banging our heads against the wall of lag cures while we do nothing to practically discourage massive uberblobbing in 00 combat if you make mechanics that force people to blob they will blob the solution is almost childishly simple  change those mechanics so players dont have to blob to compete introduce realistic intermediate objectives and spread out the field of combatwhat if taking down a station took a simultaneous assault by an attacking force on several different power cores at different places in the system not at deathstar pos in one move youd have split up one big blob fight at x point into multiple smaller battles across a variety of objectives the attacking and defending commanders would have to split up their forces into genuine wings and allocate resources intelligently the point is that we should be looking at ways of breaking down the advantage of blobwarfare as a disincentive for alliances choosing it as their preferred option in waging wars at the moment if you have greater numbers there is no reason not to blob out your enemy  the lag and damaged module response time of the big blob fight generally removes all player skill from the environment and turns it to simple weight of numbers and attrition and this is really not anything ccp should be encouragingvirtually all clever technologies die pointlessly in the lag environment and render their presence irrelevant and this really is the biggest challenge to the state of the pvp game in eve at the current time case in point the bomber role for stealth bombers  conceived as an antiblob weapon but its really not going to work when the incoming paper thin bombers are going to be zapped before they load the grid to no appreciable effect the developers need to ask themselves a question  is the best defense to this technology going to be to put more ships on grid and produce lag reducing the ability for anyone to do anything clever if the answer is yes then its back to the drawing boardeve needs more technology vesselsweapons that actually punish the fleet blob cruelly and without mercy how about putting the bomb warheads on a cruise missile that can fly at warp speed for 1au and explode against an object in space with an area effect put 200 ships round a gate and youre really going to be hurting when warpspeed cruise missile bombs start exploding on that gate it punishes the defender for blobbing for a change and that is precisely what is needed
so lets think seriously about the implications of new technology and battlefield weapons and positively discriminate in favor of ideas that break up the blob that drive commanders to make more intelligent decisions and split up their forces to achieve multiple simultaneous objectives and give a role back to smaller corporations and groups of skilled and daring playersthe titan was a great antiblob concept for example doomsday weapon destroying hundreds of ships with one shot  superb it actually encouraged mixed fleets lighter ships that could escape the blast better scouting splitting groups  added a big risk to static gate camping and thoughtless blobbing it was something that meant the commander had to be aware of the danger of a tactical nuke on the battlefield and avoid the unrealistic uberblob that had previously haunted the gamebut combine that with ridiculously simple to deploy and maintain cyno jammer module that requires truly massive blob of ships to destroy at powerful deathstar pos in an environment where only one side is going to have capital ships in the fight and everyone knows exactly when and where the fight is going to be and you have a terrible mess you have gameplay priorities at conflict with themselves and utter contradiction of purpose in reducing blobwarfare cant blame the players for blobbing up when its the only way to remove a module that prevents them bringing in siege ships and getting an even fight and you cant blame the players for opting out of territorial warfare when they are forced to blob in an environment when the antiblob doomsday weapon is kingsomewhere along the road there needs to be some common sense and a general rationalization of the problem with territorial warfare in eve so that improvements can be made to the clear benefit of allit doesnt need tinkering with these things in isolation it needs clear and rational plan with the objective of reducing the necessity for laginducing blobfighting while increasing the speed enjoyment and opportunity for player interaction in the territorial conflict model its a tall order and a complex task and end of the day you the electorate have the responsibility for selecting candidates wholl be able to make these arguments and correctly advise the developers in the choices to be made
candidate credentialsso there you go as i said im not im not all things to all people in this campaign i freely admit i have a very personal interest in making eve better through the specific policy items ive discussed above and im not claiming to be able to represent everyone and everything else with an impartial and dispassionate reserve what i can promise absolutely is that i love this game of eve online with genuine enthusiasm and if you share my desire to see it improved and enhanced in the areas ive discussed ill do my level best to make sure the developers are persuaded and debated in the right directions to make these things happengame experienceso to the funny bit i imagine its possible youve read all that and still dont realise who the heck i am so ill give a little overview of my experience as a player of eve online and what ive spent my time doing over the years to demonstrate if nothing else that ive had the opportunity at least to understand the things im talking abouti started playing eve with the character jade constantine way back in 2003 a few weeks after the retail release of the game i didnt play in beta i didnt even know about the game until a friend of mine convinced me to buy it and plan a corporation that could fight the system and set the universe ablaze on a diet of revolutionary zeal and free space ethics i was intrigued then addicted then ended up doing exactly what was written on the back of the game and started a sequence of wars and conflicts in the interest of free trade and commerce in the player sphere of 00amusingly enough jade was rolled up with mining skills and more than anything i visualized her as a workers revolutionary organising against the big cartels and founding a breakaway movement of capsule pilots devoted to fighting the imperialism of the core empire and founding their own roving communities on graft and free space economics quite quickly the focus shifted ingame to trade in robotics and plutonium running and the corporation i founded jericho fraction became one of the earliest really serious blockade running outfits bringing rare goods with excellent profit margins from the wilds of venal through empire to the receptive markets of khanid and domain for 20m isk profit a cargo back when that was a lot of moneydodging pirates  most notably the famous space invaders  we made a lot of money just moving goods around learned our pvp lessons through evasion tricks and misdirection and invested wisely in funky modules to make our bestowers the fastest industrials in space capable of evading gate camps back when instajumps hadnt been invented and you could still squeeze eight extruded heatsinks into an armageddon without any hint of a stacking nerfeventually though the pirates got organized and the risks were increasing so i decided to join one of eves first alliances and convince them from within to be freespacers in exchange for teaching them about the hallowed plutonium trade runs that were still massively profitable this led to the first incident in a recurring theme of my eve experience  the clash of freespace vs territorialist ethics eves first megacorporation namely taggart transdimensional industries under the notorious randite ideologue ragnar had moved into the venal alliance alongside our own jericho fraction and they wanted mineral rights territorial exclusion to protect those rights and moreover wanted to run venal as a private fiefdom to enhance the power and prestige of taggart itself
this was the archetypal big bad playerled imperialist hierarchy right in my face and i opted to destroy it i committed myself to preparing for the fight to come winning allies hiring mercenaries spies and agents i funded allied corporations manoeuvred wrote press releases and readied my weapons and realized just how alive this environment felt  eve was a fabulously compelling game grand strategy game of thrones intrigue and bravery and brutal realpolitik rolled into one and i was hookedwhat happened is a tale for another time but suffice to say it propelled my character into fame and notoriety and kept her there for years to come other wars came and went and would conclude for me in the greatest conflict in the game to date that we called the great northern war that saw thousands of battleships clashing in the void of 00 while the politicians and heroes of the warring sides fought tooth and nail in the sphere of public relations and influence on the eve forums for the very real advantage of foreign intervention morale boosting and brutal political parody what a gamealong the way ive changed from rebel miner to rogue trader to revolutionary ideologue and guerrilla firebrand ive fought desperate battles ive commanded fleets ive had a loaded freighter killed by war targets in empire that i managed to forget all about ive fought in empire in 00 ive summoned fleets of frigates and deployed massed groups of dreadnaughts in desperate sieges i fly all races of ships and consider the best defence against nerfing is to train whatever looks artificially weak at the moment so one can only be pleasantly surprised when the balancing comesive experienced some of the best events ever run by ccp duelled with murderous rightwingers at the elarel pleasure gardens massacre ran against traderivals for immense profits in the transcranial microcontroller craze debated with sisters of eve and mordu vessels and been condemned as a dangerous outlaw by amarrian patriarchs and enjoyed it all ive played in three alliance tournaments given incharacter interviews for eon the ingame news service third party fansites and seen my words translated into many languages and made friends around the world in the course of playing this lovely gameat the last though id say my proudest accomplishment is sticking with the vision and ideal we had with the establishment of jericho fraction corporation at a friends house in watford almost five years ago now we wanted to take revolutionary ethics and anarchocapitalist free trade bias into this red in tooth and claw game universe and make ourselves famous for the deeds and accomplishment to come we wanted to write our corporate name into the history books of the single server for all to see and live up to the claims on the back of the boxi think we probably succeeded wildly beyond those dreams and its a testament to everyone thats ever played a part in the story of jericho fraction and the star fraction alliance that weve come so far and achieved so much against dreadful odds and terrible foes to stand where we are todayso if i can promise nothing else then i promise great endurance and commitment to the cause
player notesmy real name is andrew cruse im 39 years old a selfemployed communications and business writing professional from the south of england ive had a varied education mingling sensible qualifications with the esoteric ive got a masters degree in arthurian literature and in the course of earlier adventures in the realm of venture capital startups ive appeared on television in the guise of an expert on internet censorship and consulted for the gartner group at international conferencesthough eve was the first massively multiplayer online game i ever played i do have a long history with social gaming and game communities having been involved with societies in oxford and bangor and spending most of my adult life playing games in all shapes and sizes within my extended group of friendsits a little strange to step beyond the veil of character anonymity to the general community in this way but hey ultimately i imagine none of us have anything to hide and were all decent normal people behind the avatars and online namesso there you go thats what you get for voting for me long term eve player loves iain m banks style space opera and wants to see the drama maintained in eve online with enhanced and brutal warfare in 00 and empire im not associated with any particular large player alliance ingame and consider myself independent of alliance politics and able to make my own decisions on principle and convictionvote jade constantine for exploding outposts in eve online
this is a post im going to reserve for links to interesting threads and general discussion items that arise during the campaignspace reserved winterblinks csm infozone threadcsm discussion  local chat removalcsm discussion  bounty huntingkill rightseve cast candidate interviews mine is the last third
anyway all that said and done and if you chaps are still alive after reading my csm campaign manifesto ill be happy to answer questions about my candidacy game interests voting preferences and general approach to the csm and all matters eve online in the remainder of this thread please keep it constructive and respectful and ill certainly do the same fire away
jade  you edited your title out its an unfortunate feature of previewing an edited post before submitting
jadeobviously as a known rper  immersionalist or whatever tag people want to stick on it these days i assume youre pretty interested and encouraged by the forth coming ambulation projecthoweverwhat do you think ambulation should have thats trully interactive beyond clothes shopping and running bars is that all ambualtion can or will ever amount too and if not what should its final realisation bec
got it thank you serenity  im still busy touching up the format a bit
well it definitely needs gambling games brutal death match fights histakes poker cruel blood sports and seminaked karate girls fighting for money in gallente lowsec hubs serious answer is content that promotes the seedier side of eve and makes the game universe come alive i have to admit ever since i heard about ambulation i had this secret fantasy about playing a ten billion isk sit down poker game on a soon to be exploding player outpost out in 00 with isd covering the detonation and imminent bankrupcy of many of the players which as anyone who might have read it will recognize as close to a famous scene in consider phlebasbars and shopping are all very well but it needs the ability to gamble and win and lose and change the situation in the game to be meaningful as welli dont think it would be appropriate for eve to have a combat engine that affects pod pilots though  just detracts from the nature of immortal captains with instant recloning for my taste maybe espionage hacking planting sensors on the avatars disguise kits listening bugs on the hq maybe that sort of thing would be interesting but honestly i think its going to going to be seedy bars in empire styles adultthemed entertainment histakes gambling and people playing spacepool for the pink slips of their faction battleships and at the end of the day  doesnt sound too bad
if i said i would vote for you under the condition that you reply to the question following mine in one sentence do you think you would be able to
id give it a go
please summarize why you not only think destroyable outposts are a viable application to eveonline but the methods of which they could be destroyed salvaged rebuilt and defended would you change the current pos structure as well within eve and are these thing that youd push for if elected to csm
hello allin summaryi love eve and i want the csm to work i want it to be made up of 9 people who do actually represent the varied playstyles in eve i want a group that will look at ideas debate them seriously and then come to informed decisions for the overall benefit of this game and not a csm dominated by vocal individuals dedicated to promoting their own playstyle at the expense of everyone elses i do not believe as some people seem to do that the csm is going to be successful purely on the basis of having good communicators sure good communicators are necessary but at the end of the day if the csm is going to work and is not simply be a pr stunt for ccp then it will be the content and thought behind our suggestions which will be more important than the volume and tenacity with which we promote them otherwise we may as well just leave it to the forumsi want to be one of those nine members i want to try and contribute to the process of improving eve whether or not the csm will work only time will tell but i certainly will be doing what i can to try and ensure that it doesif you want to find out more about me then please visit
i was going to ask you a detailed and insightful question so i scoured your blog and the eve mag article you wrotei now realise that i was almost certainly at uni with you im 33 so now i have an even better questionwhat did you think of the security staff at the stumble inn think carefully before you answerc
lol  what a coincidence you know i stood for elections at rhul too had the most unfun weekend of my life as an nus delegate in blackpool in the middle of winter regarding stumble inn security staff from what i can remember i had no problems with them  although by the second third year i had graduated from stumble inn to the happy man  much better looking lasses there

biggest issue in eve right nowwith the growth of new edens population the pod pilot community is diverging into two distinct groups empire pve and 00 pvp which each have incompatible desires and visions for what they want from eve you can see the symptoms in threads about everything from jita lag concord warp0 bacon piracy criminal flagging all the way to war dec mechanism fleet combat pos boredom and titan envy i believe that by providing tools to enable interaction between the two groups their their gameplay will be connected and goals aligned for the future of eve eg a marketcontracts to sell services exploration intelligenceeg a marketcontracts to sell kill rights to bounty hunterseg a market for share trading new eden is i hope always going to be a harsh place so isnt it better if you can run missions for for your favoured alliancebounty hunterpirateprotector than some soulless npc wouldnt it be great if your alliance could buy intelligence rather having countless alts to run that capabilityquestions i invite you to post any direct question on this thread if youre looking for a response from a broad number of candidates post a thread candidates your question and ill respond thereover to youaway until 12 may edit back nowdue to a preplanned holiday needing a rest after the empyrean age updates to the strategic map book and needing to be fresh for the csm im away until 12th may pirating in the caribbean its unlikely ill be able to find an internet connection on the highseas so ill answer your questions on my returnremember  transparency trust vote serenity steele
you mention 00 pvp and empire pvp however what is your opinion of lowsec as you seem to have left that out you could answer it in the other candidates thread
a very interesting and concise analysis at the end there  you focus upon trading mechanisms in terms of bounty hunting and so forth whats your view regarding the cliff edges that seperate the geographic elements of high  low and 0 space  should the sec rating system and the laws that govern it be blended as opposed to being so distinctly differentc
hello allmy name is mongwen real life name karl fredrik and i am running as a candidate for the first the council of stellar management csmi may not be as known as the other people in the running at the moment but i hope that does not exclude me form getting your vote if i do get elected i will do my best to serve the community and my view on any issue that the council will get and i hope that the elected council will help making eve go in the right direction and become better than it currently isi am not running for my alliance or my corporation i am running just for the love of the game and i will accept any out come of the voting and will give 100 if i do get on the council and i will not be a yes man since i really want to understand both sides of an issueidea before i cast my vote on the matter info on both sides can come form both the forums in game and the council members them self and i dont mind getting flamed for things i say or do but if i am wrong i can be the first to say that i amon the issue that people apply for the council just to get a free trip to iceland i can say that i did not apply for the csm for the trip i applied to make a difference and love of the gamein game i am the guy that created united corporations against macros ucam close to a year ago and i manly hunt farmersmacros to achieve the goal of disrupting them form making isk and i started eve as a care bear doing allot of trading and mininghauling and still have a alt on a different account that i still use for mining and building stuffthe issue i may be strongest at is the fight against rmt real money trade and i will base a lot off my views on ideasissues that can affect farmers in a bad wayif you have any questions please reply here or send me a mail in game and i will get it answered as soon as possiblemongwencsm candidate
mongwen can i ask what your opinion is on gtc sales under the ccp secure system is this a good or bad thing for evec
in my honest opinion the gtc system the secure trade has its pros and conson one side it can be looked at as a cheat for the sellers to get isk using real money and creating an unfair advantage to others but it also creates a way for the players that cant afford the monthly fee to play the game given they pay for their game time with in game currencythe other side is that it crates a way that in combats the rmt the farmersmacro miners do create and i would rather let ccp get the money than someone else and give someone to play longeri have been on both sides of the gtc buying and selling and i have a the view that it gives the legit player a chance to obtain isk without giving real money to someone that exploits mmo players for the sole purpose of making real money

these sort of posts allowed then i thought under 18s played
typo fixed do you have any questions
yup i have onewhats your view on the jihad swarm conducted by the alliance of which your a member do you believe the ends justified the means in this instance and how do you counter the charge that your a member of an alliance that some have described alternately as griefing ie destruction of players assets without any cause  justification or as attmepting to break eve and bring down the gamenote i am simply asking you goumindong your view on these accusations  criticisms and i am not expressing a personal view on these accusationsc
actually i havegoonswarm have an interesting history and reputation given this can you explain how you would serve the interests of the wider community on the csm council what would you do in a situation where alliance loyalties dictated one thing but overwhelming support for an idea indicated anothertake carebruce hansen
as briefly as possible what are the core axioms and principles that lead you to your views on how eve can be improved no more than 10 please
highsec is safer not safe if some members of goonswarm choose to ride bikes in empire and blow up haulers then that is there right so long as they do not exploit the systems in place to keep that working it is not hard to defend yourself from these types of attacks a friendly logistics ship in the belt with a single rep will likely make attacks fail as well there is always the option to preload concord in the belt via a suicide attack of your ownif the playerbase has a problem with that they need to get together and do something about it and there is certainly things that they can do to stop these types of things from happeningas well i am not sure i would qualify jihadswarm as griefing it may just be that the motives just arent clear
as thread title what do you think about how lowsec works today does it need a boost does it need some kind of new gameplay element does it need more security is the risk vs reward worth it etc etcalso most importantly what would you do with lowsec if you become a csmkind regardsjm
most importantly i would listen to the ideas about improving lowsec from players that live there and those that would like to live there then if there was enough support for an idea id debate it in a csm meeting and vote on the issue after carefully weighing up the ramifications and advantages  disadvantages afterall thats what ill be elected to dothe reward is definately worth the risk if you have nerves of steel and of course a good cloakertake carebruce hansen
lowsec could do with a boost having been in lowsec a few times now the bounties are definitely an attraction but that is almost directly proportional to the danger i myself would propse an insurance multiplier for lowsec only please discuss on my thread at csm candidate nickaelhoopas arithron stated in the post above i would also listen to the players who live there and have to fend for themselves on a regular basis and at a meeting if elected would raise the points delicatly as any wrong changes could become catastrophic
as said by the guys above me  the csm is there to listen to players concerns and act on them firstbut to the question low sec currently has no role other than being a buffer between empire and 00 that may sound like an obvious statement but most people ignore it id like to see it become something more strategic than it already is and have a role other than for moon mining cynostaging and gate camping then again its not something i think about regularly so some discussion from those that use it regularly would be welcome
im a massive fan of low sec because i feel it best represents the dark underbelly of eves cosmopolitan society what id like to see is more flavour added to low sec smuggling gambling dens ruined stations rank with decay hidden gates and losts ruins of alien species filled with their debris and forgotten techi dont really want high sec  or 0  i want to see something new a place of danger terror even something that makes the inquisitive and curious mind want to stay despite the filth and squallor low sec should be a pirate haven  not waterd down for high sec mission runners  we already have thatc
lowsec needs a mechanism to enforce player control that is it is difficult to police lowsec via player mechanisms in empire everyone is policed in 00 the owners of the space police it as they wish in lowsec players should police it to an ideal faction warfare might be this method i dont knowi also dont know how we could reasonably make player police in lowsec and make it reasonably contestable
ok  youve had tarminics fluffy carebear hug a csm candidate question who would you vote for other than yourself and much back slapping and mutual respect ensuedbut seeing as youre all running and its a competative field and this  well this is eve were talking about not some council byelection deciding the fate of the local post officeso if you were not in the race which candidate would not get your support on the basis that you dont believe theyre qualified or who hold views youre utterly againstplease be as specific as you can in your replies whilst retaining a civilish tone by all means respond if you feel another candidate is misrepresenting your views c
jade constantinepushing an in game agenda with no thought to balance the good of the game nor the way in which games are played he demonstrated that he has no clue about how people operate this makes him the most dangerous of all the candidates towards the games good health and continuance
i consider being loathed and feared by goumindong to be a positive feather in my electoral cap
very witty however goumindong didnt say at any point that he feared or loathed you but that you arepushing an in game agenda with no thought to balance the good of the gameis he correct in that view if not why notc
noone untill its shown that these csm types can actually make a difference i believe its just a nice little ploy by ccp to show they are listening to the communityi would vote for chribba in the future if he was to run for csm however

1 seeing as your a nonvet do you think eve should be dummed down or made somehow easier for new players2 whats the biggest turn off for new players in your opinion and what would you suggest by means of encouraging new players to stick with the early weeks and months3 considering your relative lack of experience do you think youre ready for the csm role nowc
1 to be totally honest eve is very simple to use at the moment although i have noticed that a lot of new players have been asking me about the ui being difficult to understand and some what complicated to get used to i am considering putting across as one of my point that during the tutorials buttons that need to be clicked on by a player have a bright red border so they can easily be recognised and memorised for future use2 simply people baiting the new players and destroying them for no reason at all would be the biggest turn off in my opinion although there would be an evident lack of comments on the forum about this due to said players leaving the game for good i would love to discuss this further with the community but my current idea employs new players not being able to go in lowsec and porably within 2 jumps of their home station for the first week until they get used to the game and its mechanics3 i would not say that i am clueless to the game i know a lot and i would like to apply that in my campaign but i need input from players to make the right decisions to take forward to the first csm meeting providing of course a chair is woni feel that anyone can be ready for the csm role they dont need to be 3 years old and have x amount of level 5 skills the only quality that i feel they should have is the ability to listen communicate and learn as well as being able to stray away from their first opinions in favor of something more adequately suitednickaelhoop
well i dont know how the system will works but youve got my votebecause1 your scottish2 your a young guy and i think a trip would be good for you
i thank you for your comment although i feel that the grounds on which you are giving me a vote is slightly unfairi would love to gain votes through my campaign as well as gaining help from the community through ideas and general suggestions that i can mull over and think i am also not doing this for the trip i couldnt give a hoot if it was two minutes down the road i am doing it for the chance to change the game for the better helping the people that need it the most and working with the winning candidates would be more than enough for myselfbut if you want to give your vote to me then so be it im not going to stop you thank younickaelhoop
check the new players missions the string of 10 missions require to get to a station with inventing facilities and that is not generally feasible in 2 jumps limiting the range of a new character to 2 jumps for a week can be a heavy limitations it will make the game feel small and restricted and get a lot of new players in 45 systems with problems of lag and heavily depleted belts not allowing them to enter low sec for the first week instead is a good idea i recall being pod killed the 3 day or so as a small trauma especially as i wasnt getting why they were doing that
the current state of the cloaklogoff mechanics means that 00 ratting is safer than lvl4 missions in lowsec as someone who does the odd bit of solo pvp now and again it defeats the purpose to find system after system of log offcloakwcs ratters what are your views on cloaklogoff tactics and your views on addressing this balance
my view on cloakers is that they are fine for use in 00 sec space the player using the cloaker afterall cant rat or mine etc when its being used they are designed for covert ops so i guess youd have to class ratting in 00 as such pve as opposed to pvp afterall 00 space isnt just for pvp gatecamps warp bubbles and the like give you good and valid methods for thwarting these sort of ops at least the person doing these type of things has thought about what dangers lie ahead and taken ic steps to prevent ship lossas for logging off in 00 space are you saying that only ratters and a small percentage of explorersminers do this or would you agree that it happens in battles also personally i dont think its honourable at allas for wcs assuming you are referring to warp core stabs see post regarding cloakers i would apply same ideas since also a valid ic thing to dologging off is a hard issue to address we all have to do it sometimetake carebruce hansen
my views can be seen here and up until about post 65cloaking and log off mechanics need a change because they allow players to too easily avoid combat when they would rightly be corneredwcs however is not an issue they pay for that ability in lock time and range and bubbles and hictors plenty strong enough to reduce their use
propose a dead system void of belts planets stations in parallel to jita which autopilot 100 routes through rather than jitaless afk traffic
good idea somewhere for pirates to hang out in to get all those nice haulers even better youd be assured of plenty of traffic and hence targets
im not sure if youre being sarcastic arithron or if you sincerely think its a good idea i like the idea keeps jita from being crowded by travellers if people are afraid of pirates in the travelling system well they dont have to use it
with all the whining that currently goes on for  against t2 bpos what would you see as the way forward on this issue are you for them remaining turned into long run bpcs or should they be removed altogether this is an important question as we need a resolution on this before we head into tech 3 theres a lot of speculation round this and as yet ccp have no answer
the way someone writes a haiku says a lot about them in my opinion did they just snap a sentence into 575 syllable groups or did they put some thought into it to be cunning or wittyand thus i pose a challenge to our candidates and what the hell players too please post only once and explain in haiku form what the council means to you to us to eve to pants whatever for examplesomeone to stand upand speak about the issuesto scary vikings

hellocurrently if you want to wardec an alliance you get slapped with hefty concord bribe bill after alliance p nerf having a good empire war has been  well hard how do you view current system of wardecs do you think they should be lowered so you can dec with lower cost how about restriction only 3 wars per corporate not alliance is valid or notthanks your local banned forum troll
i think the current system in place is adequate for the majority of players and alliancesthe way i see it is that it gives you sufficient thought as to who you would want to wardec and is it the right thing to do it also allows you to concentrate your members during important conflicts obviously this doesnt apply to major alliaces with huge numbers of corporations involved instead of them being spread out thinly fighting 20 other alliancesas for the cost i have never seen the bill can anyone give me a price
youll probably hate me for this but i personally think the price of current wardecs is minuscule compared to the isk that is flowing into the economy at the moment the cost of setting up an alliance used to be a major effort now it can be achieved within a month by a single player when you take all that into consideration the way the wardec system is structured around an isk value makes no sense any more unless it scales with eves economy  which it isnt and would soon make it impossible for the poor to wardec the richso i think a new war dec system needs to be implemented  i have no idea what it should be isk does need to be involved but maybe base it around the sovereignty system in that its x amount of isk per system controlled to wardec an alliance with a minimum base amount empire based corpsalliances are then cheaper to wardec whereas disrupting 00 alliances empire work becomes slightly more expensive and gives a reason for alliances to contest for 00 space again its only an idea and one i just thought up randomly but a decent discussion about it has been needed for a while now
every point is valid albeit good or bad as some people may have guessed from my post i dont really have an idea of the system at the moment i openly admit that and i guess it is one con of age of my character and my knowledgethat a good idea omber zombie it shows you have a working knowledge and a possible solution to a problempersonally i think more ideas should be conceived to help players not to make it easier for them to be blown to bits just my 2 isk 
interesting topiccorp level i dont think the current war dec system is 100 good main reasons is that the corp that gets deced can avoid it to easily and the aggressor can withdraw form the war even if the war is set to mutual in cases the corp they deced is to strong for them to handle alliance level most off the alliance on alliance fighting is out in 00 and there you really dont need a war dec as for empire wars it is totally different since there are no real way to set a goal for the war for both corp level and alliance level as for costs they are fine as they are though i like omber zombies idea though it is just tossed out there restriction is there due to a reason though it should he higher than 3 active decs form a corp and still be unlimited for alliances maybe a small boost for active wars from a corp form 3 to 5 
a simple questioncandidates i would like you to point to what you think is the most pressing concern for eve today whats the first item of business you want to bring to the table when you meet with ccp and why is that issue so much more pressing than any othersrules1 whilst you may describe the primary issue in your opinion local lag the pilgrims uselessness etc please refrain from describing your solution to this issue2 please do not post more than one consecutive post in reply being concise is a virtue me looks pointedly at jade3 you may respond and counter other csm candidates arguments eg i dont believe goumindong is correct becausenon csm candidates are welcome to press csm candidates for more detail or advance the argument for an alternative big issuec
well since we dont actually bring issues to the table you do via the csm forums i find this a difficult question to answerif i was a player not running for council i may post a topic on the csm forums about changing some things for characters that think pvp in empire such as gatecamping and killing shuttles is a good thingtake carebruce hansen
sorry  to clarifyas we dont yet have a fully operative csm forum  based upon recent forum activity what do you percieve as being the critical issue for players at this timec
other than lag which none of us can really do anything aboutthe current state of starbase and sovereignty warfare specifically how it pushes smaller alliances out of the game or to put it more simply attacking stuff is too hardthe second most pressing issue would probably be speed its current implementation and how it marginalizes lower skilled players and many ship types which ought to be valuable in all types of warfare and the third would probably be increasing ui functionality in all systems especially the scanner activation and reload of modules and the fleet command tools
the primary issue in my eyes is simply keeping the new players playingi have heard and read of countless cases where new players have fleeted up with people and then without warning popped this has to stop and then all the other issues can be raised after all there is nothing worse than coming into a new game with little or no knowledge and then suddenly getting destroyed with no reason what so eversure you can discuss the state of the economy no comments made just an example but it will only get worse of there isnt an assortment of new players coming into the game to support itsimply put all new players should have some sort of safety system in place
well my primary issue is why do we need a bunch of players who win a trip by popular vote to go to iceland to tell the devs what the primary issues are when they know full well what they are because they play the fricken game anyway i feel like ive been taking crazy pills
i think they thought it was about time they gave something back into the community something that made them more involved other than filing petitions and making complaint posts
any chance the csm candidates could post there views on removing local as thats one of the crucial things for me and a lot of others when it comes to desiding who to vote for
you understand they arnt being elected as devs to decide on this kinda stuff yea
my view on removing local dontits been fine for yearssome nice ideas have come up in other threads regarding some possible changes that would enhance local for some different types of players eg war parties however my feeling is that local in empire where 80 of the player base is is fine the way it is afterall it doesnt tell you much except who is in systemtheir locations are still for interested parties to discover i have read some funny posts regarding local eg some players watch local and logoff when they see aggressors entering so what they didnt want you to shoot their mining barge up so you can get your name on a killboard somewherechanges in 00 space could have merit although it would need some careful thought about exactly what changes to make if possible to change local for just one security status this might be a good discussion on a csm topic forum any decision taken by the csm council would still have to convinve the ccp devsanyway theres my 2 isks worthtake carebruce hansen
but the csm will have a direct line to the devs and the ability to bring issues to them for ccp to addressrespond tothere has been much discussion of the local channel on the forums and only a few vague hints from the devs about their plans for it the csm would be able to directly raise the issue and make recommendations that ccp would respond to with direct feedback on the concerns raisedhence these sorts of issues are important because it will be the elected council members who vote to decide what issues will be raised and which will be left alone
csm discussion  local chat removallinks to a discussion thread i authored on the subject short answer is i think local needs to go in 00 for sure and needs serious attention in lowsec it is important we get significant upgrades to scanner functionality and ease of use at the same time though as part of the same discussion i believe most commonly available map intel needs to be removed from 00 also kills pilots in space npc ships eaten that kind of thing
delicate matter i dont think that local should be removed form all of eve and i do know that it is a powerful intel toolhigh sec as it is today since it is way to easy communicating with people that live in that area of space and its a way to encourage socializing with otherslow sec only shows recent talkers same as alliance and other public channelsno sec no local at all but that depends on morebetter functions added to the local scanner andor by other meansand i do agree with jade that with the removal of local in no sec other forms of intel given by the map should be removed as well so it can fit into the risk vs reward in 00
who would it beobviously you wouldnt be running if you didnt think you were good enough for the job but if you werent in that position who would you vote for and why would you vote for them ive already posed this question to a few candidates so if youre one of them you are under no obligation to answerthanks in advance
vote abstain
interessting topicthe ones analysing the candidates the most are the candidates themselves i guess
i would probably go omber zombie hes a veteran player and i have known him a long time not that our paths crossed that often he is a solid chap with good ideas and i think he will make a great contribution to csmalthough have to admit that if verone hadnt stood down he would have been my first optionedit also i overlooked serenity for whom i also have great admiration for in terms if the tools he has developed for the community
hardin or bane glorious though i have clear biases in those two directions its still probably the best of the lot i was liking verone before he backed out but that is moot nowall i know is that it would not ever be jade constantine
having read all the campaigns made by all the candidates my vote is still undecided i will not however be voting for myself as that in my opinion is big headed and somewhat selfishin the current standings i would give my vote to ankhesentapemkah subject to change as stated above because she has a strong mind and doesnt stray far from the set objectives which is a huge bonus also her ability to listen to other players and their views is great
i would have gone for lavistavistalavista vista mostly due to the work on the eve bank and i see him as a trust worthy guy
i think me and hardin are going to be swapping votes for pretty much the exact same reasons
id vote omber zombie edit i have removed all references to ruminant mammals of the ovis genus
i think serenity steele and dierdra vaal are best of the rest at the moment communityminded excellent knowledge of specific game areas clear platforms and no nonsense

hi as this is an issue close to my heart after reading your blogs do you think that being a single woman will help or hinder your campaign to become csm has it helped or hindered you in eve as a whole what are your views on improving the environment for women in evethank you for taking the time out to answer
i dont think women should be able to vote or run for elected office how can you convince me otherwise
i rule
destructible outposts promote genuine riskreward dynamism in the 00 environment and provide a focal point to exciting war climax engagements they would be destroyed by self destruct sequence triggered by the conqueror defended by potential reconquest during destruct timer to cancel the explosion rebuilt for a discount from the ruins of the destroyed station and salvage would be in the form of hanger access in the wreck additionally id like to remove sovereignty claims from pos and return these structures to a purely industrial function and yes these are things id advocate to the csm if im elected

does that mean i get your vote viper
as much as id like to see quite a few of your points implemented ingame i think its a bit too early or perhaps just the wrong time entirely to see them worked into current game mechanicsalso do you feel there is a problem with nanoships currently and what would you do to fix if so
well ultimately for these changes to make it onto the dev schedule the community need to be in favour if i get elected i can advocate these changes if the community wants them i can vote for these changes to make it on the agenda but ultimately it will come to a discussion with ccp council question you need to ask yourself is are you for a candidate who has these interests in the game and has the kind of vision for eve ive expressed in the manifesto every example and idea in the long text above is there simply to inform you how my mind and imagination and sense of game balance and development works its so you get a handle on how im likely to vote in the event i make it through the election im being completely open about my interests and personal preferences here and if you like this stuff then id like your trust and votei think its more a problem with conquerable 00 infrastructure and defense advantage nanofleets are popularessential because any raiding force in 00 sovereign space is likely to get jumpbridge hotdropped on by twice the number of defenders utilizing the rapid logistics of their pos networkthis means attackers honestly cant fly anything other than nanoraiders with any reasonable expectation of getting out of engagements that turn bad quicklythe problem is the prevalence of jumpbridges and horrible sovereignty mechanics that allow the defending sides to instablob large ships and hotdrop on any engaged raiders short answer i dont think the nanoships are to blame reduce or restrict jump bridge spam and slow down the rate that defenders can congregate on any incoming raid and youll see more conventional gangs and fewer purenano fleets i fly these things myself viper at the moment sf raids 00 almost exclusively with polycarbfitted ships because to do otherwise is crazy  you just get bubbled and hotdropped any time you commit to a larger fight with slower ships id love to be flying battleship gangs again but its not going to happen by nerfing nano  that stuff will just reduce all incidence of raiding playstyle not convince people to suicide vulnerable slowboats to the inevitable hotdropnanoships are expensive vulnerable and easily countered by the appropriate countermeasures at the moment they are niche performers in a landscape of hotdrops and jumpbridges and 00 blobbing outside of that landscape all traditional balance still applies and nano isnt a problem
one of the things i love is how many culturevariant names i see on ships in game theres a chap i see with the surname horza as well and its interesting that in banks first novel the anti proto tragically greek githero is an enemy of this amazing culture hes createdi suppose youre aware of how horzalike you are in this context jade there are several candidates id like to support and will should they be elected but i know that if theres anyone who can be counted on to balance the megahugealliances interests in space in favor of keeping freedom and openess in game itll be you so given one vote i give mine to youeveryone hopes and wants a neutral csm board everyone also hopefully realizes that its impossible to achieve fully i think and hope d youll keep out your own issuebias when you can but i want some of that bias represented on the csm for the benefit of the big players as well as the small few things can kill a game as quickly as massive vetblocks getting everything they want too fast regardsbhand yeah im piloting a ship named the bora horza gobuchuledit oh brilliant i get around you and my posts get all wordy and by the time i get to the end i forgot my original question i hate to bring any hint of the local rules screw local screw you brouhaha in here but when ambulating and no excuses about being podtied into concord and sensors and comms and godlike infosystems can be made should we know who else is in station in any way or find out the hard way by running into themdammit i dont want some godmode knowlege of who else is in station i want to walk down a corridor turn a corner and stop dead as hardin and i come face to face blinking for a secondor go instation ask my agent where someone is and get the answer two floors down hillarity shall ensue oh yesssss
i wanna know what experience you have with industry in general are you able to represent the people who care about the secondary market for instancei mean i guess most people have highsec characters in order to make isk which does something carebearish but is the same true for you and do you have any experienceif yes what is the most annoying thing for you when you do these things
can i just say  this is why we need jade on the csm
as far as im aware jadeand as good or bad as i may think your proposals are none of them will be implemented as the whole point of the csm candidacy is not to change any of the game mechanics but to see that the game is being ran fairly and so we dont get a repeat performance of gms helping out there favourite allainces or corpsanyway good luck jadebut as you will prob already know my vote will lay with someone elselolregardsrenosha
i thought that was the purpose of ccps internal affairs departmentafaik the purpose of the csm is to act as a layer between ccp and the players to communicate the concerns of the playerbase to the developers to identify good proposals and suggestions and advise ccp from the point of view of a playerthat role i think fits jade like a glove
points 1 and 2 respectively of your manifesto are only a single solution to point 3 would you still support cyno jammer mechanics and indestructable outposts if some alternative solution were to be found that allows for many more gameplay styles including your own alliances revolutionary andor guerilla style insurgencyand if not why not
thank you harlequin brilliant to see you back in the game and on the forums by the way and yep good old horza well if the federation is the proculture and im profoundly anti fed nationalist it kinda makes sense its certainly a role im happy to play  and thanks a lot for your vote its an exciting and dangerous time in many ways the wrong alliance blocs could do a lot of harm to the game and i foresee the first csm being a defining moment for this community really like ive said in the manifesto  my voice is there to speak for players like me that still love this eve dream and love the potential opportunities for cybernetic rats in the stainless steel wainscoting of overarching alliance power screw the end game lets keep fighting in 00lowsec with no local rules id say we shouldnt know who else in the station until we meet them in empire thered probably be a docking roster or something and concord oversight but with these shady locations in marginal space i think the captains will want their privacy a bit then my friend youll be reaching for a virtual blade or snubnosed projectile hand cannon and be cursing the devs they said no for station combat in eve damn straight
i dont do industry on my account or alts never have really so speaking personally as in have i ever done much building nope most ive ever built would be a couple of cruisers torpedoes cap charges or something from tech1 blueprints however in my corporation i currently have directors who are amongst the most effective industrial producers in the game at the moment in the tech2 market and in the capital market these guys really know their stuff and suffice to say i do get to hear a lot about the challenges and issues to particular elements of the productionsupplymarketing process can you be a little more specific as to which secondary market elements youd like to know about and what concerns there are please i dont have any specific iskmaking characters and as i said have no real handson experience with this specialization  i generally pvp for money when i need to know i ask people who are experts in the field rest assured if it comes down to voting and informed choice on such issues if very thoroughly briefed by people who do know everything there is to know about these areaswell chatting to some industrialist contacts im hearing the following issues at the momentvery high price tech2 dyposium moon derived components reactor units shield emitters etc etc questions about the distributing of these moons perhaps there should new seeding of moons in lowsec perhaps generally feeling the distribution is currently wrongissues on establishing more factorylab slots  pointed out that pos management isnt fun and some industrialists like the shipmodule building game but dont want to get into pos management to enlarge slot availability emphasis on fun production empires rather than baby sitting the pos tamagotchi monster on production some people lament the batch system of ship building output ships  questions about whether it would be possible to have things coming out of the factory in single units againextra skills needed advancedadvanced mass production maybe call it industrial empire or something  5 factory slots a level same for lab operation basically industrialists dont like the necessity to have multiple production alts just to get enough factory build jobs running would much rather further specialize on existing production characterssame for market sales more skills beyond tycoon wanted production efficiency implants would be niceon market pvp standings based tariffs ie if you are 10 from the buyer you pay a penalty fee if you are neutral you get the market price if you are 10 you get it cheaper that kind of thingjust some issues im hearing about lavista
common misconception that renosha and you are in quite famous company amongst those making that mistake ive given a detailed answer to this subject already on shc herethat refers directly to the csm pdf made available by the organizer brief summary1 csm reps can ask questions and make proposals to the ccp council on issues of importance to the general health and future of eve2 csm reps can vote on whether to escalate a public motion 5 electorate vote to ccp council response important we get a fair and balanced csm council to ensure that good public motions will get supported and encouraged  59 rep votes needed3 csm reps can and will advocate and debate in direct interaction with the ccp council in iceland to influence official judgments and decisions on the issues raised4 csm reps are responsible for communicating back the results of these motions suggestions questions etc and ensuring that the eve public are engaged in process of developing the game at no point in the founding pdf does it state these issues are solely involved with corruption investigationsinternal affairs oversight or policing gms and ccp staffour prospective job as csm reps is to watch for hot topics from the community inspire and encourage good debate and raise popular and important topics to the csm shortlist and refine that down for the agenda in iceland face to face talks will decide the outcome of the issues and ccp undertake to give us detailed answers and feedback
exactly so and thank you
i really like what i read on you manisfesto although most of it sounds like a long shot it is definitely what i would expect to change in eve to ensure it remain fun for allquestions1 what is your view on empire dwellers specifically the mission running pilots who would not even risk isk and limb and stays in npc corporations do empire complexes and basically complains about pvpers hassling them to get out more or the typical carebear that most pvpers tend to refer them to2 do you feel that player run corpsalliance should have an idealminimum size before being able to form compared to current mechanincs that allows pilots to form corpsalliances on a whim wihout any other pilot support3 what is your view on current insurance payout mechanics and how do you think we can improve if you think something is lacking from it4 what is your current stance on the rmt issues in eve including ccps method of handling the problem and how do you think we can improve the managements of it5 would you support a dumbed down eve if it can attract 50 more subscriberslooking forward to your replies cheers
yup you have my vote so far and most of my mains corp members votes as well
jade how can support destroyable outposts when you also claim to support dynamism and the little guy destroyable outposts hurt smaller alliances who wish to play in the 00 sovereignty game this is because large alliances will destroy outposts of their competitors and anyone wishing to enter space must build their own these outposts must be defended and it will always be very hard for a small defender to defend against a larger one the attacker then destroys the outpost and leaves and if the small alliance wants that space they have to put up another outpostbut if the outpost cannot be destroyed then they do not have to furnish the cost a second timeor first time if they are going after one already built they attack and the larger alliance has to commit forces in order to keep that outpost out of enemy handsinstead of just destroying it and then coming back to destroy it if they put up another how can you reconcile your positions when they are mutually exclusive or do you simply not care about small players and instead care about pushing your corporations agenda for the game
its a far wider impact than just small unit pvp consequence really the current terrible situation with 00 territorial warfare affects everyone involved with it this really isnt just small unit raiding corporations wanting to be able to destroy 00 holdings in an eyeblinkunder the proposals i made to illustrate the need for dynamism in space combat youd still need to fight a significant military campaign to gain the ability to take and thence selfdestruct an outpost this stuff will be of the utmost significance to all sizes of alliance and territorial entity and will have a real impact on the current sprawling afkdefensive playstyle that populates 00 the problem at the moment is the wasteland of empty systems with more pos than players and cynojammersarranged reinforcement battles ensuring that if somebody does want to change something its going to be a laggydogpile battle rather than decent fleet fighti believe eve needs destructible outposts to make 00 powers take their holdings seriously and apply the proper active defensive effort to make sure they cant be taken and occupied for little real meaning otherwise the landscape eventually gets filled with a desert of semi occupied flags that increase in number and blandness until nobody really cares who owns what and nobody has the defense focus or inclination to engage in serious fighting to defend them allow an aggressor the option of razing an outpost it takes and suddenly 00 becomes interesting again and powers have to make a significant commitment to defend the critical locations ironically some have claimed that this would lead to a situation where huge 00 powers would automatically destroy all the outposts of smaller powers but what it really achieves is to make anyone more circumspect in regard to overstretch and overgreedy landholdings if youve only got a couple of outposts youll fight with your whole fleet and focus to defend them and retake them in the selfdestruct countdown if they do get taken if youve got 100 outposts you dont really care about and the farflung locations are attacked then sure youll lose them because you dont care enougheve is a game where commitment wins fights dedication brings results a smaller corporation can achieve fantastic victories over a much larger corporation just because it has discipline good activity clear goals and focus same really on the alliance level a bloated 2000 man alliance is comprised of any number of people at varying levels of commitment to the cause and if they are trying to defend dozens of outposts simultaneously theyll do much less well than a focused smaller alliance concentrating on just a few at the moment the primary argument against destructible outpost concept comes from lazy large alliances that hate the idea that smaller focused groups will make them pay for their greedy land grabbing and lackluster defensive commitment with focused assaults with slash and burn objectives eve status quo as it is now allows these lazy powers to pretty much ignore the activities of smaller groups because they know at some point in the future they can just come back and reclaim what they have lost make it possible to destroy outposts and suddenly war becomes real and threats significant  eve 00 changes from simcity to civilization and gets truly dynamic again
no the lazy powers simply wont hold the space they will instead simply destroy the stations and then not bother to defend it because if anyone puts anything upa daunting task they can just come back and blow it up again all the benefits of denying space to your enemies and none of the work
thank you glad you feel that way its definitely what im aiming for and to demonstrate the right kind of thinking in the csm role people have a right to play the game in any way they choose really if they dont want pvp its up to them hisec missionrunning in npc corps is pretty damn safe and only suicide ganking is really going to be a threat to their way of gameplay  but is quite easily prepared for and countered what id really like to see is these guys and girls lured into higher risk systemslowsec and such by excitement and rewards not by nerfing or damaging the hisec experience but just by providing more content and interesting bits and pieces in more dangerous space i think people adjust to the pvp environment of eve at different rates and nobody says closed to possibility forever one of star fractions industrial directors hasnt pvped for 45 years at this point but a couple of weeks ago was coming up with ship loadouts and concepts for giving it a go and seeing if that part of the game is fun thats the point people choose their level of risk based on gameplay interest and potential profits should point out that while our industrial director hasnt actively sought spaceship combat against players for most of the game hes been dodgying pirates blockaderunning ducking and diving while making filthy amounts of isk  its not an insulation from the rest of the server just a way of handling your preference in interaction interesting question but im going to say no there shouldnt be a restriction if an individual pilot wants to form a corp then invest in alliance creation skills and payment just to have a flashy logo and more expensive incoming wardecs then its up to them they need to pay a maintenance fee for the alliance and it gives them certain functionality  thats fair enough i would however be in favor of introducing a clean up maybe yearly check to remove defunct corporations just to free up names and office spaces id actually love a more dynamic insurance system that ups your premiums if you keep getting blown up and makes you pay a premium for insurance if you are low security rated i think there is a lot that could be done with the insurance system to make it more interesting and let standings play an increased role on the whole i dont like the minimum insurance payout either i think it puts too much isk back into the economy from fights and eve needs cashsinksfiscal impact to strip money from the economy and let pvp battles and slaughterfests in 00 actually reach critical dispute resolution levels when one side literally is out of cashi dont like rmt in the game i think it spoils the environment and balance of play absolutely not eve is pretty damn successful as it is
its good to see some things never change jade im delighted you stuck to your ussual propaganda method of throwing a novel at any potential opposition in order to avoid any serious criticism while i doubt i hold any true significance in your eyes youll always be remembered by me as my first real enemy although at the time i had no idea of jericho fractions history despite our ups and down you are for the moment looking like my canidate of choice if for no other reason than that i know you ruthlessly persue your interests and they happen to more or less correspond with my own that said there is one issue that i would seriously encourage you to either clarify or reconsideryou frequently mention eves sandbox nature and seem to claim that maintaining this unique quality is of the upmost importance however this idea of corp stats surely goes against this lets take your example of the credibility of mercenary corporations with their stats published to the world a huge chunk of the game is removed namely propaganda fame and respect are things i feel should be worked for on all fronts indeed jericho fractions own former and continuing fame were heavily influenced by propaganda campaigns let us now move on to consider the individual players taking myself as an example my first ever war was against your own corporation a mere few weeks into the game i lost more ships in that month or so of war than i have in the last year or two do i regret it not at all one of the most enjoyable times in my eve career and certainly the most educational it destroyed the noobish preconceptions i had about pvp and taught me to think for myself and more importantly outside the box while my triumphs were few they were each a true triumph for me atleast and i hope you will atleast agree that i was almost always willing to fight now let us consider the new player of today how many would be willing to be so daring to lose so many ships in the name of selfimprovement and sheer fun if their stats were to be forever publicised to the world their embaressing defeats highlighted to the eve community their corporation or avatar ever a laughing stock among those who know better such daring rookies are few and far between as it is should we discourage this minority with such a ruthless punishementall i can really see this sort of change accomplishing is encouraging the already widespread paranoia of losing ones ship already blobs are wide spread people take unneccesary precautions to protect their precious pixels bringing to light who was really terrible would merely further reward this type of general cowardice and reduce the enjoyment of pvp i myself am reluctant even to use killboards because it encourages me to take the same precations in the name of stats reconsiderregardskehmor
you were my probably my 2nd ever 1v1 pvp victory kehmor and i promise you back then we werent much more seasoned than you were as a fighting corp pojos typhoon schooled us all while the war was on i still remember our caracal duel distinctly and im very glad you have stuck with the game yourself well remember this stuff is going to happen in some way or another with faction warfare there will be dynamic results based on ingame accomplishment ships killed lp collected establishments nuked widgets salvaged etc etc every merc corp of note at the moment runs a killboard and invites their clients to take a look at it to assess whether they are worth hiring  why shouldnt this functionality be tapped into to make a more useful wardeclaration and fighting system you are certainly right with regard to jfs early history we were a tiny corp with a huge reputation and used pr to emphasize all victories and positively paint our defeats the same could still be done  ultimately you cant lie about killing ships or getting killed and not be called to task about it on the forums anyhow you have to weigh up the current problems with the unfocused wardec system against the benefit of hiding or occluding engagement stats i think absolutely you won a tonne of respect from us for engaging and fighting hard for your rp principles as caldari nationalists and im really glad you took a positive experience from the conflict continued
well bare in mind im not talking about personal stats here im talking about a warsystem actually tracking the results of that war and leading to a result based on the actual engagements in space while its active im not suggesting every pilot in eve has a public kill record that follows them around like a bad smell if they got blown up a lot as new players this is a corporate reputation thing its useful for mercenaries to opt in to a public assessment of their capability to make it easier to sell their services  that would be their shop window really otherwise its a game mechanic thing to assess whether a war is still active and in the balance or whether one side or the other has won we could certainly compromise on the suggestion and make the public side of conflict result listing an optin option that merc corps could agree to if they think its worth while for them other conflicts would be resolved by comparing the hiddeninternal engagement stats but unless they are mercs and trading on results thered be no reason for them to publicize these things i dunno i can see your point on the personalindividualcharacter level yes in general i agree not every eve character should be tracked in this way and there is no purpose for the publicizing of performance on the corpalliance level unless its a merc corp that wants these things made public as a sales technique of course in the bountyhunting suggestion i link to in the op there youd have an example of bounty hunting players listing their accomplishments on a leader board too but thats again an optin profession choice rather than a general tracker as to people being embarrassed about losing and just playing even more carefully  well like i said it shouldnt be a universally reported thing for everyone im primarily interested in this functionality for a interior mechanic for deciding concord wars b external opin listing for professional entities and c leader boards for eves deadliest bountyhunters flashy showoffs can certainly pursue flashy showoff pr results but the average eve player shouldnt be punished with embarrassment over terrible kill figures anyway kehmor dont worry about me going all elitepvp on you i lose loads of ships and list them all on our public killboard aways ive always considered being brave enough to keep fighting and take a bullet for the team is a much better assessment of whether i want to hire someone than absolute killboard efficiency anyways  the people with the best ratios in eve tend to have a very boringselfish fight style that doesnt work well in our alliance anyways hope this addresses your concern somewhat kehmor and again very glad youre playing and i hope youre a stone cold cerberus ace by now
just wanted to let you know you have my support jade ive taken the time to read through many of your posts in the past and more recently with your csm candidacy and i must say more often than not i agree with you you have a good grasp of how things really are in eve and what the true causes of many of the problems this game hasall that being said you officially have my endorsement and will have my vote when the time comes
you didnt actually answer my question i get what youre saying and i agree about the problemshypothetically if i did have a solution that had significant advantages over yours and fewer disadvantages or cons solved all the problems you cite and more would you drop your solutionwhat im really asking is are you willing to lay aside your own ideas and represent the ideas of others if they are better than yoursedit and argue others points with the same vigor
im not really keen on playing games with arcane debating techniques spoon thumb and i dont like leading questions  hence the way i chose to answer you earlier i much prefer people to just come out and say what they think make proposals let us all take a look at them and give appropriate value to good ideas basically just say what you think i cant answer your question above for example because its a logical trap i have to answer yes or it means im nuts but i am interested in hearing your solutions to the problems of 00 sovereignty and overpowering defense advantage though and if i like what i hear ill be very happy to support your ideas and advocate them i dont care which organization you are from if youve got good ideas that are in the interest of dynamism in space combat ill happily support them yes absolutely
despite my link below  i stand by to shatter your doubts right heremission statement interview open q  a mission statement   i am a 39 yr old it engineer living in finnland with child dogs wife and a sauna  i am playing this game since beta and i enjoy all aspects of it  i speak fluid german swedish finnish english and some dutch  i enjoy deep respect to and from my friends and also most enemies in eve   i applied for candidancy because i feel i need to do everything  to make this game as cool to others  as it has been for me   i think amongst the most common topics like the several obvious game balancing factors  and teh fact that every aspect in teh game seem to favor the big alliances and their warfares  except the it infrastructur which clearly doesnt support that kind of warfare  there is  other very important minutes  the game athmosphere it lives from the backround stories events and the few roleplayers too  i would want to ensure these aspects are not been forgotten   please reply to this thread or send me an email ingame or here timo a t deich org  i will answer all questions in this thread  
i will vote for you if you refer to yourself in all offical csm material as hardon
this quote is taken from hardins csm sitei have a question for hardinafter stating the above on your site how do you plan on downplaying the fact that you have been heavily influential in the leadership of a large alliance that has controlled an entire 00 region for 4 years the cva has many influential allies in the surrounding regions the core of whom are referred to by outsiders as the amarrian block if this is not a megablock would the term huge describe it properly
always nice to answer questions from my friends in star fraction firstly we have only fully controlled providence for less than a year  not four yes our influence over providence is something which has grown slowly but steadly since the launch of operation deliverance but by no means could we claim to have controlled the region until relatively recentlysecondly i would hardly call myself heavily influential within that bloc if that is what you want to call it i am not the leader of the cva although many assume that i am simply because i am the most public face of the alliancethird the cva itself only comprises 789 pilots currently and that is after a year of growth a look at this 
how neutral against changes in game mechanics like the proposed destructionable outpostsor rebalancing of bridges jammers etc
i have already said elsewhere that i am open to suggestions in these areas provided they maintain some balanceeven regarding the issue of destructible outposts i am not without compromise as i said on the ooc forumsi am not necessarily opposed to outposts going pop provided that  ccp reduces the effort required to build and maintain them comes up with a workable solution to the issue of peoples assets stored in those stations  that there is a reasonable time lag destruct countdown involved so that the people who want outposts to pop have to maintain control and defend the station for a reasonable period and there are other options than the black and white suggestion that outposts simply exist or dont exist others have suggested the idea of derelict  disabled stations which also have promisepersonally i dont think outposts should be destructible although i will look at both sides of the case because i believe they are a key part of the process of developing 00 and attracting people to come and live there  something which will enhance pvp opportunities not hinder them yes they do mean people can play dock monkey but hell its not hard to avoid pvp in 00 even if there isnt a station in local if people want to  so stations are not the problem but in addition to that i also like them from a roleplay perspective they add a permanence and a history to the game that no other structure does i am looking forward to the day that eve front in game wiki goes live so that i can write a history of unitydeliverance reclaimed in 9uy detailing the various sieges  so that when a pilot jumps into the system they can get a feel of the epic battles that have been fought over the station and i invite you to do the same zoolkhan while ushrakhan no longer have the station it is still a legacy and reminder that they were there  that they existed i hope players of eve in 10 years time can jump into 9uy and look up the ownership history of the station and get an idea of the ebb and flow of eve politics and warfare whether or not cva still controls it i also believe that some of the proponents of destructible outposts are not seeing the larger picture they seemingly wish to turn the clock back to 2004 when a small number of mega alliances owned huge tracts of space  simply because there was no way for smaller alliances to get established and defend their claims if outposts were destructible then the megablocks would simply play a scorched earth game and there would be no real motivation for smaller alliances to populate 00 when everything they build could be torched at the whim of megablock enemy this could be rectified by making outposts cheaper to build and maintain so that they are not so much of an investment risk but i have my doubts about how realistic that is i believe the opportunity to build outposts and then effectively defend them against the blob is one of the reason 00 is becoming increasingly crowded and increasingly fractious divided and warlike  which in my opinion is a positive trend in eve because it inevitably leads to more conflictsaying that i also believe smaller guerilla forces should be given more options to annoy a sov holder without the need to engage in full scale pos warfare for example the ability to completely shut down a station no services  including no docking for a specific period ie two weeks obviously something like this offers huge potential for pure griefing so again the mechanics would need to be closely examined before being implementedso in summary yes it is my personal belief is that outpost should not be destructible however if someone can come up with a good compromise or suggestion that addresses some of my reservations then i am not going to rule it out simply because i am a member of the cva
hi hardinive noticed you havent weighed in on many any of the whats the most important issue questions  can we get a definitive answer on what you feel is the most important issue that you would bring to ccp as a member of councilspecifically your response to this question in the evemag interview is very vague  you say you arei hesitate to interpret this as saying you will champion the rights of sovereignty holders without a clear confirmation from you  is that the case
my question was simple hardin i was not asking for your opionion but if you can ensureneutrality on that topic even though your alliance has  what 8 ops now and potentially a lot to loose if the current game mechanics would receive a change in favor to the attackersthis comes down to the ability to divide ingame from oog  someone who can divide itwould spot the inbalance and perhaps initiate a change although it would not make the ingamefriends and allies too happy a unpopular decision so to speak can you handle thatperhaps in fewer lines
well you have my vote hardin good luck regardsrenosha
sorry if this has been asked before butwhat is your opinion of the local chat channel and its powerful function to allow people to completely avoid pvp
i am not going on to csm to champion anything for anyoneunlike jade for whom incidentally you seem to be doing such a great cheerleading job i do not believe that at this stage the candidates for the csm should be sticking flags in the ground and drawing lines in the sandi believe that approach is counterproductive close minded and certainly not the approach i would expect from someone who is try to convince us that they are willing to work as part of a team because that is what the csm should beyes we are all to some extent biased based upon our experiences in this game as indicated by my post above and yes i expect some hearty healthy debatehowever if the csm is to be effective its members have to be open minded and make decisions based upon what they think is best for the interests of the game and not just for the benefit of their own alliances or playstyles and i am afraid jade just hasnt convinced me on that scorei really dont want to spend a week in iceland with a bunch of people who have already decided how everyone else should play the game and who are not willing to compromise because they have already sold their souls to a variety of forum bandwagonsfortunately i am confident that the majority of candidates dont want that either
well i did already answer this kinda in my blog wwwhardinfaqblogspotcomis hardin biaisedyes i think anyone who says they are not biaised should be shot as a liar right now there are things in my eve history and how i play the game which have influenced my perspective on certain things these perceptions could be regarded as bias but similarly can simply be seen as my point of view while i do believe i am openminded and open to new ideas as every amarrian should p i will be honest and say that i am not a blank page and that i will not automatically endorse every idea suggested to me in an effort to win this election that said i am in general an amiable chap and will judge every idea on its merits  not on the basis of which person or alliance proposed ityes i can separate ingame from out of game and as i have said before i will not support cva interests simply because they are cva interests  although of course my experience will colour my perspective on certain issues and it will be up to other csm members to change my mind or vice versa at the end of the day i am an eve player who loves this game and wants this game to improve maybe it is a naive hope that csm will be successful tool in that improvement process but i certainly want us to make an effort
but surely if the csms role is to raise issues before ccp at some point you have to choose what issues to raise will you shed some light on what sorts of issues you personally would bring up for the council to vote on and then present to ccp or would you not bring up any issues and only vote on others proposals
i really dont think raising issues is going to be a problem  as this forum already demonstrates i mean exactly how many issues can we get honestly expect to get throughif no one else decides to raise them then amongst the first issues i would raise ismacroers reducingbacon banningroleplay enhancingpos warfare improvingpos maintenance simplifyinglag destroyingnewbies encouraging00 developingmarkets improvingdev transparency illuminatingdestroyers boostingsomehow i think others may beat me to it
posting my opinion from another threadsimilarly on the issue of local i can see why some people are such advocates for its removal however i also see very good reasons why the removal of local would actually diminish rather than increase the likelihood of enjoyable pvpobviously we will have to agree to disagree sometimes but we also have to be able to compromise and adapt our standpoints based upon the input we receive from all the players of eve and not just those that reflect the interests of our own particular corpsspecifically and quickly on local removal1 uncertainty  uncertainty increases the desire for safety safety is obtained by either not travelling to risky areas or seeking saftey in numbers  its human nature the removal of local increases uncertainty gigantically and unless an effective alternative is put in place it is in my opinion more likely to reduce pvp action than increase it2 tedium  making things harder is not in itself wrong i am sure there are many vets who long for a really hardcore eve the problem is there is a fine line between challenging and tedious make life too difficult and you run the risk of driving people out of the game and while we are at it lets just make eve that little bit more unpleasant and daunting for people joining the game after all its not like they have enough to get to grips with already3 solo play  the removal of local will pretty much eliminate solo play in 00 thats fine if you believe that 00 should be a mercilessly hostile unforgiving place but not so fine if you believe in developing economies and creating empires in 00 its not like we should be doing anything that would encourage people to leave empire space anywaywhile those are my major concerns there are also big issues around login traps jump scout in scan gate one enemy in local move scout on jump fleet in  theres now 50 people on the gate  no warning whatsoeveralso undocking no local  no idea who is in the system as you cant scan okay lets put windows on the station  erm what if they are all in cloakers okay lets introduce in station scanners  erm what if they are all in cloakersas it stands it just seems way too imbalanced and impractical to me and if it was going to be introduced should have been introduced 4 years ago maybe there are ways around some of the issues i have outlined maybe i am just being too carebear for my own good but i honestly think that the removal of local without an adeqaute alternative would severely damage the playing experience for the vast majority of playersi also forgot to add sociability to that while many players do not interact outside their own corps many others do removing local could make eve even more unfriendly particularly for new players place than it is nowthere options about how you could reduce the impact of removing local  for instance the channel still exists but only people who talk are shown and instead of a complete list of everyone in the system it instead shows a break down ofblues xxneutrals xxreds xxwar targets xxnot sure how practicable that is thoughin summary i believe the removal of local without some adequate form of replacement will actually reduce pvp opportunities based on my understanding of human nature it will lead to a reduction in quality pvp and increased blobbage and gankage  particularly of individuals and small groups it will not infact make targets easier to find and kill because those targets will have either moved to empire or some other less risky profession
thanks thats the sort of thing i was asking afterid like to hear some specifics onroleplay enhancingpos warfare improvingpos maintenance simplifying00 developingas your ideas on exactly how these areas can be enhanced improved simplified and developed are central to what you would supportpush for on the council and thus important for us to know
hey there guys finally a section where i can be cool and have a question thread i hold off from posting it in general discussion till the csm forum was running but here we are first of all welcome to my thread please feel free to post questions my campaign site is heremy discussion on the state of the economy is hereas for real life i am a student from denmark with my main interests in computer science and physics so for the majority of the actual length of the first csm i will be able to dedicate quite a good amount of time to csm should i be electedthat is about it for now ill expand this post as we go on but now i gotta get some breakfast and catch up with all these sweet threads that just begs to be answered if you wanna contact me you can either evemail email or catch me on messenger my details are on my campaign site i appreciate your support guyscheerscharlie lavista eriksen
heya lavista vista glad to see you have a spot one question i have yet to see answered exactly how will we vote i ahve looked over as much as i could and no where do i see that discussed might you know btw i do know some want it changed but changed from what
well as i understand it heres how it goesfrom monday may 5th there will be a link on the frontpage and likely also on the login screen which will take you to the website where you will be able to vote for 1 candidatesyou can vote with several accounts and people are allowed to vote abstainthe top 9 candidatesthose with most votes will get a position omber zombie wrote a nice post of what he wants changed one of the interesting things i agree with him on for instance is that 1 vote isnt enough we have 2 groups of people the pvp and industry guys while they might overlap i would still love to vote for 2 types of candidates to have both aspects of the game representedbut hopefully we will learn something from the first time and csm 2 will be even better i know i will try and make csm 1 as smooth as possible if i get elected and hopefully i will be able to pass on tricks to the people on csm 2 to keep the success going if it turns out that way but for csm 2 we will probably see a person have like 3 votes which they can spread over 3 candidates that would be nice
thanks ever so much
mynas says youre a bob altanyway with your already in depth experience with ccp i feel there could be a conflict of interest between your other projects and csm could you ever see this becoming the case even the slightest possibility
mynas says a lot some would say too much
ive taken your suggestion and answered it here
imo the cliff edges 05 to 00 gates create very interesting game play and a diverse environment i wouldnt like to see the cliffs blended into lowsec i would be very interested to see if an alliance could affect a lowsec environment themselves and how this would can be made interesting and rewarding gameplay
good day to you ms steeleim thinking you will have a good chance of getting my vote even if you are caldarian you have done some really great projects for the entire community rivaled only by chribbas workmy question  as a full time thief which has been serving the rens hub systems since 2004 i would like to know what improvements you think could be made that would effect the pilfering profession in a positive wayi envision better directional scanner  bring back the old scanner displaybetter scan probes  make them as effective as when they were originally releasedskills and equipment to allow the anchoring of secured cans that have expiredperhaps a new ship class for thieves and salvagerswhat are your thoughts have a nice day menod penter  mayor of rens
in my experience all an alliance or corporation would need to do to exert an immediate influence on a lowsec environment is gather a couple of command ships bs and a hic or two on the lowsec side of the divide and do pretty much what one does with the same kit in 00 itself  what with the gate guns being as rubbish as they are as it is im pleased that youre running serenity itll make it that much harder for me to decide who ill be voting for when the balloon goes up
this is a question i intend to pose to several candidates who fit the same categorygiven the likelihood that many players may vote after doing nothing more than reading the candidate profiles here why is it that you felt it unimportant or unnecessary to exert a minimal amount of effort and post some key aspects of yourself or points of your campaign as i see it the candidate profile is the single most important place to get your point accross clearly and concisely as it will be read by the most players and many will never see anything else based on this it seems you expected people to vote for you based solely on a trite catchphrase rather than anything of real substanceif you could not be bothered to do the work necessary to put out your information in your profile why should we believe that you are up to the task of doing all the work that will be associated with a seat on the csm
i gave this specific issue a thought before running for csm i see a potential conflict of interest between the player bases views i have to represent as a csm candidate may alienate sections of the player base against my projects i dont see my projects effecting my performance as csm since the projects are driven by desire to improve the eveif you are referring specifically to any commercial interest i may have with the strategic map book my agreement is with the publisher mmm publishing not ccp so i dont see a conflict there
interesting profession and not one i morally support but accept it as part of the eve sandbox off the top of my head in terms of the features for thieves i would think along the lines of the ability to skillbased hack secure cans anchored in space  perhaps linked to the duration before expiry of the can similarly perhaps for hacking pos you could even extend it to hacking secure cans in corporation hangersto balance this maybe the skill level of the anchoring person determines the level of difficulty to hack the can and a killright or similar given to the person whos can was being hacked  a longlength timeout on being able to make another attempt on the same canto make this effective would need a mechanic implemented to buyingselling killrights for bounty hunters to track down and kill thieves to be effective imo this area is all about balance as a thief you could game this mechanism by manipulating the market for your own killrights thus buying up anyone elses ability to kill you at prices under the value of the cargo you looted  or game the mechanism by looting your own alts cargo to bump up your kill prices to high levels  this in turn would would need to be balanced by bounties on your head  of course you could game that by placing a massive bounty on your own head and only undocking to loot more of your own cans that would need to be balanced by displaying how many killrights are currently in circulation for your thiefand so on  at the end of the day it needs a good thinking through of the issues of balance
there were a couple of reasons i was close to the deadline before organising my personal and work life to be ready to take the commitment the csm requires im not one for long speeches the intention was to have a simple message that is easy to remember while highlighting the core values i bring to the role it should ring true to anyone who i have had contact with in eve i aimed to pique players interest to click the link for my personal siteyour assumption that i could not be bothered is false
no i was just putting that there as i am currently at work and dont have the time to fill it out properly yet  better something for everyone to read than nothing at all
vote oz for his drive for a different voting system
you dont have your corptag on and i dont recognize your name additionally i have to ask a question so i dont get the hose for trolling how do plan on overcoming the slight obstacle that no one knows who you
a fair question thank you for the opportunity to replyi am known in the eve community but maybe in different circles than those you travel within i have been mostly involved in the scienceblueprintmanufacturingtrading side of eve for the past 25 years ask about try the bpo channel  im that guy that has been asking for conflagration m bpos for the past 2 years i realise that it is hard to get a feeling for candidates that you have not personally dealt with ingame before i have nothing to hide so feel free to pose reasonable questionstake carebruce hansen
to all candidates what changes if any would you suggest for the invention processfeel free to admit a lack of knowledge on the subject
three words more decryptor seedingprices for these since they now coming from exploration sites have gone upwards and now make module invention using them unprofitable for many modulesi also have seen some good ideas regarding mepe research after invention on bpc what do others feelthink about such ideastake carebruce hansen
like arithron i whod like to see more seeding of decryptorseven the idea off mepe research is somewhat a good idea that will level the playing ground between bpo and copies though it can have a bad turnout in the long runediti have just started with the invention part of the game so i dont have any extensive know all to it
hi all wow looks around and looks for a spot to camp at ill try to keep it short an simple but if you have any questions by all means feel free to askto vote for me click herewho am i in gameive been playing since november 2006 i play and live primarily in 00 spacethe corporation i am in is not currently affiliated with the great war and have chosen to go it alone for the time being seeking fun pvpmore detailswho am i out of gamei am 42 years old and work in tech support for the uk national health service ive ran various guilds and community sites over the last several yearsmore detailswhy should we vote for youthose that know me know that i am fair and impartial my belief is that the role of the csm is to bring player issues to discussion via the csm forum interviews have focussed on asking me to reveal what issues i believe are important and while that avenue has scope and engenders an almost presidential style election i believe it is inappropriate as views can and possibly should change given new informationi do feel it important though that ideas and views can be discussed that way you can get a feel for a candidate but hopefully that does not get mistaken for an agenda my only agenda is to work with the other csms and ccp in order to help a better experience for the players come to fruition more information to vote for me click heremy main campaign pagemy blog in chronological order most recent firsta compilation of recent interviewsthanks
goons care first and foremost about making the game fun to play because goons play the game first and foremost to have fun and this is where my loyalties lie we arent here to make partisan game changes that only benefit us but benefit the game as a whole goons wont play the game if its not fun they will go ride bikes instead such it is in the best interests of goonswarm to make the game fun for as many people and play styles as possible and i cannot see that conflicting in any way with what is best for the community
how do you feel about s actions towards ccp were they the wrong actions for the right reasons or otherwise please explain in detail
besides the very obvious balance there are a few key axioms in eve that bind it together1 eve is game and should be fun2 specialization should produce decreasing marginal returns3 everyone and everything has a role4 there should be no hegemony of the rich or oldalso see point 25 risk should correlate positively with rewardif you can hold to these then you can really make the game a better place for everyone involved currently a few are failinged if i mischaracterize your question please let me know and ill change it right up
whistleblowers are important and need to be protected but i am not knowledgeable enough on the subject to know just what it was he did and what he did may not be kosher if all he did was publish information he gained from willing sources no big deal if he used malicious means then its much more iffyas he likely would have had no reason to take such actionshas taken other actions against player groups and many times these have been malicious and illegal and these types of activities should not be toleratedi hope to get a feel for what ia is doing to police the developersno developer should probably ever be coordinating an alliances capital ops and planning for instance but i am not sure about what types of information we will have access too nor what we will be able to release
quoting this
so which is it
what do you mean the two positions are not mutually exclusive
also do you have a campaign platform at all as i havent seen anything even hinting that you do
it would help if you actually had a signature idk
try turning signatures on in your forum optionsotherwise click here
this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
im curious in a game thats so intensely capitalistic why do you think that there should be no hegemony of the rich where are you going with this idea
the logoffski issue1 capital logoffs 15 minute timer2 bs logoff at jump in
can you expand on these points plsthey already do as far as i am aware its called stacking penalties can you be more specific plsis this in reference to the titan and the fact that a lot of your alliance seem to think a blob of friggies should be able to tackle and kill them or are you referring to something else and if so whatthis point seems to be saying that those who work hard are smart successful and have been working at it for a long time should not benefit from itid like you to also explain this in detail as well pls
question please explain the answers in this postto start with lecrotta i would appreciate it if you did not troll this thread you have a main and can post with it and if not then your previous statements disqualify you from having a reasoned debate on this subject as can be seen by the ignorance and strawman you have already spewed forth in your short time here egbut to answer your questions the list is a guide of how you ought to balance eve such the i thought this happened has no relevance if its happening its good there are areas where it is not happeningspeedagility and tech 2 cruisers specifically and these break a few of the other axioms as well but that is really besides the point other than the issue that not conforming with the axioms they ought to be changed so that they doregarding titans again this is a point of balance everyone needs to be useful in order to keep everyone having fun no one believes that we should be able to kill a titan with frigates please refrain from strawman in the futureyou are confusing hegemony with benefit they are two very different terms with two very different meanings eve has never been a game where the rich or old can dominate the poor not in design ideal nor in execution there have been points where this has failedand fails now but it is still a core design principle to give an example of this hegemony in another game you could look at wow if you are not level 70 with epic gearor very close dont bother fighting others keep grinding npcs and run away from the othersbut eve is at its core a pvp game and hegemony destroys that especially hegemony of the rich and old for they offer no real way to breachthere is nothing to explain maybe you should try a dictionary if you dont understand what is going on with such a simple statement as this oneand now to address the nontrollhegemony of the rich and old creates a perpetual subservience of the poor and young this is explicitly bad for the game as fewer players will wish to continue past their trial why would they when they cannot have any effect until they are old and rich where in those who are old and rich now will be even more powerful by the time they get therethis point goes hand in hand with the specialization point and the riskreward point when there is a hegemony of the rich and old they are able to exploit low risk situations for higher reward and their specialization is rewarded in strength and not just versatility instead of having a higher risk for that higher reward and less value for that specializationthis creates old guards that only die when their will to play the game ends this is not fun for anyone really it means less young people will continue to play the game and it means less change in politics and sovereignty the game thrives on both of these things
i was not trolling i was asking for clarification on several of your points and i would post with my main but he is banned for posting cat pictures on caodnow i downloaded your documents and read through them and found them well presented if a little vague and now im asking for clarification on the bullet points you put on here you did say you would answer them after all
can you explain what you want clarified because most of what i posted is fairly self explanatory do you want to know why i think these axioms are central to how eve should be balanced do you want to know what a specific balance created by these i think should be implemented
you posted a list of ideals and not ideas now ideals are great but you can use them to justify all manner of unnecessary changes after the fact so what i am asking for is a list of things that you consider are most in need of changing with these ideals as the principal reason for the change2 specialization should produce decreasing marginal returns3 everyone and everything has a role4 there should be no hegemony of the rich or oldalso see point 25 risk should correlate positively with reward
the same thing i said in the top issues threadspecifically i want to make it much easier to attack strategic and economic pos modulesthough i would add a reinforcement timer on them i want to reduce the strength and effectiveness of aoes there was an idea of making a dd into an ewar module which seemed like it would be really nice to keep it useful but not overpowered and game breakingi want to possibly move dreads off grid from their targetswhile only making them effective against poss and capitalsregarding speed i think there needs to be more and stronger counters i think that smaller ships should have more inherent advantage via sig radius and speed and i think speed mods need looking at this touches on hegemony role specialization and risk specifically probably my web idea though final numbers would need to be tweaked and i would either revert speed mods back to prerevelations status or i would separate them into speed  agility and  signature radius with no overlapui just pertains to the usability of the game in general which touches on point one and the rest of the points if it increases functionality in a way that takes a lot of the disadvantage out of not knowing the ui
without wanting to be accused of being a strawman it seems to me that all you have done is rephrase your pet gripes about the ddd nano and cloakingscanning into a more positive sounding format id hoped it was not true and that you would have put together considerably more and varied content but it seems im going to be disapointedthis is what i feel a candidate should offerbut all you seem to be doing is pushing your own agenda and personal issues from your own limited perspective of the game
i am not sure why you would consider these pet gripes if i have ever had a pet gripe it would have clearly been the amarran problemsand i disagreed with many of the solutions they implemented these problems shown in ddd nano and cloakingscanning are problems which are very significant and integral to the gamei also note how you conveniently ignore the issues with poss they are not pet issues of mine but issues which affect all players in the game in negative ways they are the largest issues of the moment and since that is what you asked about that is what i talked aboutthere are certainly others remote sensor damps and tracking disruptor stacking the inability of small ships to be valuable due to webs the problems with leadership skills the problem of tieringyou will need to scroll down to post 11 the direct link does not seem to be working the problems of overlapping ship design which currently effects the maller prophecy abaddon tempest punisher as well as a variety of other ships and how we can quickly and easily make good changes to pos warfarethere will certainly be moreui usability bad target calling mechanics problems with deaggressing timers not scaling well problems with specific ships lack of market based economic warfare lack of structure to form proper isk based loans and other contract overhaulswhile good they can easily be improved but if i had the time to deal with all of those i would be a game developer and not a csm candidatedo not be confused with the issues i bring up and my own agenda most of the time i will bring up an issue because i feel that changing it will benefit the game as a whole also do not be confused with my ability to recognize good ideas and expand and bring them forththe simply pos spam solution and the movement of dreads off grid were both not my solutions i was not the one who originally proposed increasing the drone bay on the tempest i was not the one who originally proposed increasing clip size of artillery i have not been the first to want market based economic warfare i was not the first to propose simply scanning down cloaked ships nor was i to propose rat aggression timersi think i am absolutely certain that i was not the first to come up with some afs being moved to the leadership line i am not under the illusion that my ideas are necessarily the best though naturally i feel they have strong merit or i would not have proposed them but i do feel that the ideas i propose and bring to the table whether or not they are mine are all strong ideas and the problems that they hope to solve are all important
i will not deny that some of your ideas have merit although a lot of them seem to reduce the overall effectiveness of single ship typesstyles of fit and lean towards a one ship can combat all style of eve and while this may seem like a good idea to less skilled and newer players it also takes away the ability for ppl to put together a gang or fleet of varied specialized ships and pilots in favor of conformity and universal fittingship types
motives for jihadswarm as stated by the goonswarm repvile rat emphasized that this was not a campaign against new pod pilots but against those who by now should be making it in lawless space with all of its dangers sourceie goonswarm has a definitive view on who should be playing where and doing what and those who do not should be coerced through force that sounds pretty clear to mehow do you reconcile this with the public statements of members of goonswarm that they are not in fact playing eve but instead playing their own game this game is one which transcends eve and in which fun is defined as causing trouble and distress for others and for which the end goal is to make other players close their accounts and stop playing sourceapparently not all of your alliance agrees with the motives and objectivs you claim they have why should the playerbase trust your motives to be any different
in this case they are either kugutsmens actions were right or they were wrong which is it
i never intend to move towards one ship can combat all styles and would say instead that i want to move away from that i think you are referring to nanoships at the moment so i will address this with regards to that with nanoships it is the exact problem that the tech 2 cruisers when fit for speed are so strong that their abilities overshadow the abilities of all other ships and fits to the point where if you want to competeand by compete i mean kill these types of ships you need to have about as many of these ships in your fleet as your opponent it has come to the point where major alliances simply dont use frigates anymorea good example is bob which no longer flies interceptors and dictors in favor of recaonshacshictors simply because the frigates are superfluous in all types of combatthe specific problem can be exemplified by looking at two specific ships the first is the thorax and the second is the brutix when fit for speed a brutix performs the same role that the thorax does except better it has more hit points more dps longer rangelarger blasters the same size drone bay is faster and as agileor more agile and as fast it locks targets faster and has a better active tankwhen both are fit as such and this is not it does any one of these things but it does all of these things better at the same time unless the thorax fits speed modssomething it should not have to do for various reasons the brutix actually makes a better thorax than the thorax
actually the brutix fits the same sized guns just two more of them than the thorax and yes its a better ship than the thorax in all regards cos its a battlecruiser instead of just a cruiserit seems to me that you want to stop ppl from upgrading as nobody who can fly a ceptor or a af would fly a normal t1 frigate nobody who could fly a interdictor or hic would fly a ceptor and so on and so on your trying to devolve ppl ships and modulesfitting styles who have spent a lot of isk and time training for ships that are improvements over lower sp ones they have outgrown
from reading what g is saying is that 1 set of ships isnt supposed to obsolete the other in other words the brutix obsoletes the thorax making it pointless to use a thorax a battlecruiser should have a role not obsolete its smaller variation i have a  though for g i understand your reasoning behind the brutix and thorax what are your ideas behind thorax and diemos obviously the diemos obsoletes it do you believe the t2 ship should be penalized or left as is
no the brutix will be fitting higher tier blasters not larger as in large  medium larger as in bigger unless the thorax is fitting neutron blastersin which case the brutix has just as much rangeno its that the upgrade from these types of ships is much too severe the value you gain too much it is not that people should not be flying these ships but the advantage that they bring does not correlate with the risk currently the game is very nearly dont come unless you can fly a t2 cruiser or better because they pretty much obsolete everything below themit seems to me you are simply attempting to strawman me instead of addressing the actual argument
posted with an alt kaben usually dont care who i post with but will post with main
most of the t2 ships should be left as they are so long as the means that they use to make themselves overpowered is reduced that a deimos is stronger than a thorax is not a huge issue since both are very generalist ships and dont benefit from the advantages of speed mods the increased benefit of flying the deimos comes at a significantly higher riskwhich is not really so with a brutix due to insurance and also not so with the majority of t2 cruisersit would be nice if the deimos had a specialist role like most other hacs but i dont see that as something we could reasonably change todaythe key point is that there is a much smaller difference between the deimos and thorax than there are between the other hacs which mainly comes in their ability to be fast agile and do significant dps outside of web range without sacrificing much of anythingsuch instead of the deimos being 25 better than a thorax at its primary roledps in the short range with 2530 more ehp the hacs are 25 better at doing dps with survival rates with 50 more ehp while going 100 faster while being able to dps from 50 farther away these factors combine to make them be able to disengage too easily disengaging too easily lowers risk below the value that will correlate with our increased riskreward model that eve has going for it
how is it whether his actions are ok are dependent on information that i do not know about and such cannot answer nor is it exclusive that you ought to protect whistle blowers but not protect illegal actions to obtain that information
a t2 cruiser or better fitted t2 costs at least 200 mil with rigs how can you say that its wrong for a ship like this to far outclass all ships below it cos as far as im concerned it should far out class them this is my issue with your ideas as they are reducing what ppl have ratted trained and paid monthly fees for a long time to achieve yes in eve right now there is a lot of t2 ships about but also there are a lot of ppl training for them because they are great fun to fly remember your make eve lots of fun number one rule
another question which you will probably ignore as well but i am asking it of several candidates who did the same thing so in the interest of fairness i direct it to you as wellgiven the likelihood that many players may vote after doing nothing more than reading the candidate profiles here why is it that you felt it unimportant or unnecessary to exert a minimal amount of effort and post some key aspects of yourself or points of your campaign as i see it the candidate profile is the single most important place to get your point accross clearly and concisely as it will be read by the most players and many will never see anything else if you cant put forth anything to catch voters interest here theyre not going to bother following a url with no description attachedif you could not be bothered to do the work necessary to put out your information in your profile why should we believe that you are up to the task of doing all the work that will be associated with a seat on the csm
vile rat is no longer the goonswarm diplomat nor would his word be taken at face value goons like to have fun and if people think that we have some grandoverarching theme and act on it we will have fun its funny when people think that we are doing things for reasons other than to have fun like we have some campaign against the people in empire no jihad swarm started when one goon was like im having fun suiciding hulks in empire come suicide hulks in empire with me and a bunch of goons screamed allahu akbar and bought some suicide shipsyou are misinterpreting the statements he is mentioning how you can win at eve because in eve you will not destroy a person unless they stop playing since the advent of jump clones you simply cannot ever permanently destroy a character goons play goons in space they do not play eve this means they are out for fun first and foremost that they dont care if you have fun at the same time does not mean that they do not want the mechanics that the game is played via to be fun and fair it simply means that they are going to use those mechanics to have fun and if someone gets in their way then its not their faulti am getting to them all it just takes time
then i guess the question would be which takes precedence protecting whistleblowers or not protecting illegal actions since you say you cant give an opinion for lack of information then take it as a hypothetical lets assume for the sake of argument that kugutsmens actions which led to his whistleblowing were in line with his history of less then legalappropriate means if this was the case should he be protected as a whistleblower or subject to the legal consequence of his actions by the very definition protecting and not protecting someone are mutually exclusive they are opposites for crying out loud
a thorax with a estamils modified invulnerability field costs over a billion isk clearly it should far outclass all ships below itfurthermore they are expensive because they are so good and their loss rate being much much much farther below others actually makes them much more isk efficient instead of less as dictated by the standard riskreward model in evepeople have ratted and trained and paid monthly fees for a long time to achieve a lot of things and each and every time it was imbalanced it was nerfed many times with good cause would you like to to run through the times the omg but i trained for it argument has been used to justify unjustifiable positions i can guarantee it will take me a long long time to come up with all of themisk has never been a reason for ships to be imbalanced and never will be
if he obtained the information illegally then his punishments are understandable as are criminal charges if not then no it was unwarranted
if they arent going to be bothered to follow a link they arent going to be bothered to read a description if you do not believe that what i wrote regarding that shows that i am up for the task then i dont know what to say
but that is the issue bud you think that the difference between t1 cruiser and below vs t2 cruiser is out of balance while a t1 cruiser costs 45 mil base unfitted and a t2 cruiser costs 100 mil base unfitted this alone should make the t2 a massively 20x better ship but if you fit both with t2 stuff and rigs the difference is slight compared to the cost in isk and training time
a tech 2 heavy pulse laser costs roughly 100 times as much as a tech 1 heavy pulse laser clearly then the tech 2 heavy pulse laser ought to be roughly 100 times better than the tech 1 heavy pulse lasernow that the idiocy of that argument has been exposedif t2 ships become less valuable because they are no longer ships that you can get in and if you are smart and careful never lose while still engaging then their price will fallit has always been the case that ships do not gain value linearly with their cost
was he the goonswarm diplomat at the time of this statement if so it is still a valid representation of goon policy if not and it was an unauthorized statement contrary to the will of the leadership of goonswarm then where is the public denounciation of such policy as the work of a rogue member and not representative of the alliance as a whole if you dont keep control of your members public statements you are responsible for whatever perceptions those statements createit worries me if the goons think that the only way to win eve is to make other players quit is it not enough if you simply drive other players from your space force them to withdraw to where they are no longer a threat to you or is the only possible method of winning to harass such players to the point that they delete the game from their hard drive this seems to be what he is saying how is that misinterpreted what part of it have i got wrongalso how is it beneficial to the continuing health and growth of eve if your goal is to drive players away chasing away players has the inevitable outcome of reducing subscriptions less funding for ccp and the eventual destruction of the game in this light shouldnt there be a different goal to your gameyou may be playing eve online but be warned we are playing something awfulthe ability to inflict that huge amount of actual reallife damage on someone is amazingly satisfyingthe way that you win in eve is you basically make life so miserable for someone else that they actually quit the game and dont come backquotes taken from source linked earlierthese statements speak volumes about what type of game the goons are playing eve is a game about spaceship combat about risk and reward about gain and loss when all done within the context of the game it can be fun regardless of which side of a battle you are on but there is a limit this all stops at the keyboard except the goons take it beyond that their game is to make players miserable to completely destroy their will and desire to play thats really great for community building and a great perspective for the csm isnt it fair enough you seemed to be responding out of order and so i jumped to a conclusion my apology for the mistake and my thanks for taking the time to respond
look who is the strawman now im not saying that a t2 cruiser is 20x better nor am i saying it should be and i am not saying that pulse lazers should be 100x better in fact as you clearly point out the differences are very very slight compared to the cost in isk and training time for both ships and modules in regards to t1 and t2 also insuring t2 ships is pointless so when you lose one its a big loss instead of just a insurance cost when you lose a t1 ship
when there are over 60 candidates you want people to go and read 60 webpages i think thats a ridiculous expectation your initial profile should give enough for a player to decide if they have enough interest in you as a candidate for it to be worth it for them to follow the link and read more the profile statements provide a snapshot of who you are and what you stand for and should be a means of narrowing down ones choices not putting up any information in the statement either shows you are lazy too busy to do something important or have no platform on which to run
this depends entirely on how often you lose them insuring a hac is pointless because you can reasonably expect to hold onto it for more than three months not because it would not offset your losses no if you can reasonably expect to lose any ship in 3 months then insurance is a great deal in all instances no matter the ship
or it means i miscalculated the number of people that would be running and was optimistic that people would take the time to get to know candidates through various outlets that it is not there is not an indication of lack of work maybe a little idealism that people will take a little time
personally i dont think g has a prob with t2 ships i believe the problem stems from rockpaperscissors in that there is a counter to things but the problem stems when someone introduces dynamite in this case dynamite needs a counter and from looking at what the devs do mostly is remove dynamite from the equation leaving us again with rockpaperscissors until someone figures out how to make dynamite again
i can accept that explanation were there fewer candidates i can see it being fairly reasonable to assume that more players would look at individual sites however regardless of the number of candidates i think there will always be a certain portion of the population who will be just interested enough to look at initial statements but no further with this in mind i think it would be in every candidates best interest to take any opportunity to describe their platform particularly in an official listing where you will be compared sidebyside with all the other candidates im afraid that this may be a costly miscalculation for you and others oh well at least you put up the url some didnt even bother to post a single word
in jv1v when goons were fofoing in local after a successful battle a gm asked remdeialthe goon ceo at the time to make them stop he responded i am just the head of an internet spaceship guild i cant make them stopgoons arent a massive collective as we may seem if you dont trust what i am saying and instead think that jihad swarm was some machiavellian scheme against players in empire then i wont be able to convince youthere really is no way to really beat a player see ra for a good exampleor goonswarm anyone can simply run to lowsec and build up to attack you again this is fun and good for the game since it continues the dynamism that we understand that you cannot truly beat someone without making them quit only means that we understand the nature of the gameif we drove everyone out of the game we would not be able to have fun this would be bad for the swarmyou need to understand a bit about goonswarm and its history to understand these commentsspecifically bob saying they were going to grief gs out of the game which is what started this whole mess in the south and these proclamations there is a lot of group mentality in the swarm but its entirely due to fun and not due to some malicious feelings for the game or its playerswe move to hit morale because that is how you win its how you win on the sov map and its how you win in the game and its how you have fun goons dont win when goons dont log on and this holds for every single alliance and organization in the game we want a game we want to log into to play its that simple
goumindong what subforum of sa do you find yourself browsing the most
thats nice but it completely sidestepped the question the statement was publicly made to ccp in the form of an isd anouncement it was made to sound as if it represented the alliances objectives as a whole if it did not and was only the words of a single member then your authorized reps should have been doing some damage control since they did not i have to assume that the motives for jihadswarm were as publicly statedgoonswarm is an alliance an alliance can remove corps that dont adhere to policies a corp can remove players that disobey orders failure to keep control of members is a matter of choice not ability i agree it would be bad for the game as a whole for players to be driven to quit why then is this an oftstated goal of the goons to make others miserable to the point of forcing them out of the game if you truly believe that this is the nature of the game and the only way to win then i have to conclude that we are in fact playing two very different games i play for my own fun and experience not to destroy that of others ill blow up their ships theyll blow up mine i may try to make it difficult for them to operate in certain regions of space i may try to wear down their wallets until they cannot afford to fight me for a time but once i have forced them to back down i do not pursue and harass them until i have made them miserable i do not make it impossible for them to do anything in the game until they are forced to quit if they can build up and later come back great we can have some more fun if they quit then they no longer play and i no longer have a potential opponent so we both lose making other players quit is by no means a way to win eve id have to say that with some rare exceptions everyone loses each time a player quits because then there is one less person contributing to a game that is built on player interactionhaving said all that i have to admit i have a bit more respect for you than certain others of your alliance you have not attempted to deny the history or objectives of your group you do not obscure or ignore what has happened in the past i cannot agree with or endorse your rationalizations for such history but i appreciate that you at least seem to be honest about it
helloi decided before i sat down for this intro that if i spent more than five minutes writing it ive probably spent too long so ill keep this short and yeah my whole slogan thing is on the candidate listing page hereim just a guy who has a lot of interest in balance and improving eve online overall i originally started as an amarr pilot two years and five months ago when a real life friend of mine who was a career pirate convinced me to try it out i joined goonfleet and eventually he sort of got tired of the game as is natural and moved on to other things however many of my goonfleet friends and friends from corporations and alliances outside of or not even affiliated with goonfleet have also left eve mostly just to burning out naturally these people brought a certain enjoyment to the game that i wish could return but that cannot happen until i help alleviate the things that made them burn out in the first placeback in 2006 mr rooflez  then a member of goonfleet  made a thread that convinced the developers to buff battlecruiser agility in revelations following his example ive done my part to give useful feedback to ccp to help the continual improvement of eve over the past year i have worked very hard through posting on the eveo forums and reading peoples thoughts on game balance i have given feedback and ideas to ccp some of which was actually accepted and implemented such as the free move feature for easier fleet organization implemented in trinity last december ive also bugreported some very harmful bugs and exploits that have reduced lag and made the game more fun for everyonethe things i think the csm should put priority on discussing are in no particular order1 making pos warfare more accessible and more fun2 helping encourage small gang pvp or simply encouraging more enthusiasm for pvp in general3 buffing uppertier large autocannons they really need it4 making the game more accessible to new players5 capital ships online6 improving corporate tools7 reducing lag of course8 making the user interface more digestible and intuitivethats basically the whole deal my website is
it seems there is a lot of talk about bacon  and other local monitoring tools  i think it would be nice if all csms could post their opinion about these tools in this topic
they will be gone before the 21th june 2008that is my stance and prediction
first of all i guess ccp in person of grimmi postet the point of viewnevertheless future csms should keep this discussionthis problem in mindpersonal statementits a a mixed blessing on the one hand those guys who have a disadvantage outta that execrate bacon on the other hand those guys who wanna do afkmining are affected in their kind of gamingimho all those things should be banned regarding the minigrobot fact
hiposts ive made about bacon can be found here so you can understand point of viewbacon aint sizzling and here where i describe it as unbalancing and an evil applicationalthough as others have noted ccp have promised removalrendered useless i hope to see that actioned very soon and hope im not alone in that opinion
bacon is bad for the game fingers crossed ccp close the logserver data glitch that lets this program and others like it functionif bacon is still around should i be elected of csm ill certainly be voting for this to be raised as an issue and condemned by ccp
yep exactlyif it isnt fixed the first time csm talks to ccp i for one will make sure that ccp posts an update on what is going on it needs to be fixed and it needs to be fixed sooner rather than later
 i fall under the same view of the two posts above me
i think the issue that bacon has raised is a deeper one than most realise the issue blew up into a massive controversy only after a particular group developed it and then publicly offered it to the community the fact is other groups had developed very similar tools to do the same job but kept quiet about them notably goonswarm ccp have acknowledged that they were aware of this use of the gamelogs but took no position or action on it until it became public if the logs are encrypted to prevent their use as ccp have said there is no easy way to monitor if such tools are being used all someone has to do if they hack the enctyption is to keep quiet about it i believe it was kerion in an interview on evetv at fanfest said that he knew there were more devs in the goons than some other alliances i believe to is the primary role of the csm to check that ccp maintain a level playing field for all and that their employees are prevented from gaining in game advantage using the internal affairs dept vigorously and proactively i think the bacon affair has once again shown that ccp take the view if the player base dont know about an issue it isnt a problem csm members should be duty bound to hold them to account and prevent such things from happening again
i am 100 against it mostly due to the way that it uses the logserver log and it will give an unfair advantage compared to the people that dont use it and the shear possibilities that can be built into bacon macro like behaviour can easily be added to the programi do not support bacon or any other program that uses unintended use of gamelogserver logs
imo low sec is the bastard child of 00 and empire circa 2005 its unbalanced in terms of risk and reward in different activities personally id rather be in empire or 00 any day of the weekit needs changing how exactly is up to players that live there and those that dont see it as a useful play experience bridge to 00 to put their views forward id weigh up their views try secondguess ways any multipoint solution could be gamed to break lowsec entirely and then put up a case for the changes
ive been playing eve online for more than a year now and since then ive done almost everything there is to be done in this game  i have a very broad range of experience most particularly in the following areasim an internet spaceship fleet commander and have been for about the last nine months ive fcd gangs of between 5150 people including capfleets and coordinated between gangs of up to four alliances at a timeive flown nearly every shiptype from frigates to carriers on my three combat characters i have something like 250 kills on my corps killboard so im a pretty experienced pvperive developed and installed moon mining chains for both corporate and personal use and spent twelve hours at a time anchoring the damn poseswhile were discussing poses ive theorycrafted and installed about two dozen control towers ranging from small minmatar ratting poses to large complex reactor towers to factionfitted domination control towers ive also done my share of pos gunning and have killed dreadnoughts using only the control tower itselfive incapacitated cynojammers with battleship gangs and sieged towers for hours at a time ive also provided the cyno for numerous hot dropsive fought in lowsec and escorted freighters through 0004 space for dozens of jumps ive also nearly lost a freighter but thats a story for another timeyou could probably say that im an experienced player based on the above and its the experiences that i have in this game that i believe make me a pretty good candidate heres whyi know eves game mechanics better than most and i know how they can be used effectively i have a wide breadth of knowledge and the context to know how game mechanics interrelatei know how to communicate and i have nine months experience in doing so as an fc in real life i am also a damn fine public speaker albeit an extremely nerdy oneplaying for so long and across so many parts of the game i know exactly how some areas of the game could be improved  and have demonstrated that in the features and ideas forum
what is your experience with the industrial side of the gameyou say you have done about everything to be done in this game but the only thing remotely close to industry is the moonmining stuff but thats more pos warfare related
quite a bitive developed installed and maintained half a dozen lowend complex reaction chains for both personal and corporate use i think youre confusing pos logistics with pos warfare as well these chains were established in feythabolis months after the region was secured so without shooting a thingi have a bpo collection of my own and have been producing in goonspace for personal profit for some time now ive also been producing for my corporation at times using the corporate bpos particularly in the leadup to an offensiveon the corporate industry side as well ive been responsible for the logistics behind moving billions of isk in materials from 00 to lowsec and vice versa on a number of occasions im very well aware of freighter mechanics as well both on the side of 00 freighters and the afkinhighsec kind
everything you have mentioned so far is on the massive scale large gangs billions of isk chains of poses etc what is your experiance of and thoughts for those of us who live a smaller simpler life
ive only been involved with corporate and alliance activities for about six or seven months now prior to then my activities have been entirely smallscale ratting for personal profit running small gangs around space smalltime production and at times a little mining as wellthe thing is ive kept to that im australia so being part of a usbased alliance its extremely difficult to raise anything other than a small gang to run around with in the first place likewise for the first three or four months that i played i ran around in poorlyfitted vigils as i learned to play the game wellso i think i have a pretty solid level of experience of the simpler life in these games do you have a more specific question for me to answer based on that
will ccp be releasing a verified list of candidates alternative character names across all accounts
id happily list all my characters but i doubt ccp will list not verify them due to their privacy policy
ok i will probably lose popularity point by asking this eventhough ill not hide behind an altawhat would be the added value of this except optentially destroying the candidatesingame experience already before the voteb some of us have several accounts how deep do you want to digc what do you expect to findexample from a csm povingame i might be a cap pilot and my alts help me with logistics cynofields etcand one could assume that a csm would appreciate if the ingame enemy finds out about thisby fair and conventional means
i agree to a large degree some people will make themself vulnerable by revealing altspersonally i have a pvp charactertempler relleg ceo altlavista ceo ebank altebank lavista research altsly le livista vista a hauling alt which is being deleted now in order to make more research characters because lavista can fly a hauler nowim known as chadk other places on the internet chadk was my first trial account chaddy is a character of mine but i havent played it for a long timeso i have nothing to hide but i fully understand if people dont want to release this information and i fully respect it
the three characters i use most often are called daveydweeb dannie trejo and mahfreightah
i loled a bit in real lifeyou can say a lot about the goons but they are very creative
you are representing the community as a person and we need to judge you on that basis simply taking the actions of one character in a multicharacter game is not a good enough measure of someones worthiness as a community representativei want to know all your characters from all your accounts which is why i would like ccp to provide andor verify the list i would even go as far as requesting ccp to list the names of any character you have owned in the pasti hope to find nothing but i expect a few worms to crawl out of the woodworki can appreciate the example you provided of how this could ruin a candidates gameplay but honestly the pros outweigh the cons here far more damage can be caused by an unworthy candidate being accepted onto the council than by your enemies having a list of your alternative charactersgranted this runs a little deeper than at first glance but that is exactly why i want this list revealed
its a pretty good injoke too 3
i could imagine on ventrilo please dont shoot maaah freigtah11111
actually it was suas so quite the opposite
i disagreea we are not crimals be brought in front of a tribunalb we have very little benefits from doing this the danger of corruption is lowthe personal effort and investment too high for doing something bad imonobody would waste so much time energy and personal life just for having a laugh at somebodys expensec if ccp would give in they would have failed to announce it in time  which was before application phase for csm when the conditions have been set and the candidates have agreed to those and started to scan their passworts  now its too late one cannotchange the rules of a game after it has begun10 for arsenal no wait  the judge walks on the field he announces a new rulethe goal is not valid unless the goalkeeper admist beeing atheistd i would expect the benefit of the doubtbut most of alle one should judge us by our rl actions and they are yet to come and not be distracted too much from ingamestuffif someone would approach me in private and requests to knowmore about me i would like to have the ability to decide on a case to case bases whom ias a candidate but also as a player can trust and whom notwell this is my 2 cents and you yet have to name a proper expample for what your reason behind this is  other than unspecified dangersi am still eager to learn of what dangers it is youre fearing that would not be compensated automatically by a 9 heads council with most different folks sitting in it from most differentdirections and the brain that ccp has  the existence of a council doesnt mean they do follow every bad advise that could possibly result from the council of mordor that is not disclosing its alts
i have already listed them on my blog but for the sake of public recordhardinsiobhangaint killler
no i dont think ccp will be doing this and for the record i agree with zoolkan its nobodys business really ccp have already done due diligence in checking rl identity passport and location data and ensured candidates have a clean record to run
its not really about that i need to make a judgement on your character from a very limited amount of information i cannot exactly send a private investigator after you to delve into your personal affairs the only recourse i have to assessing you as a person are your replies on this forum and your activities within a virtual universeccp have the ability to supply me with that information about you and rather than me needing to convince you it is the correct thing to release that information you should be convincing me of the evils of doing soarguing from a privacy aspect is ludicrous when you have supplied your country of residence and full namearguing there will be a diminished gameplay experience for you also doesnt float asking us to judge you on your rl actions and give you the benefit of the doubt could effectively turn this first election into a wasted vote and any subsequent vote for a firsttime candidate we cannot judge you on your rl actions so we need to be provided with the next best thing
youre misinterpreting my reasons for wanting this information to put it bluntly i do not care about the crazies that is ccps concern and you are correct im sure they have done their part and will continue to do so by putting procedures in place to deal with any potential nasty situationsi want this for one reason and one reason alone to judge your character by having your actions on all characters across all accounts brought into focus that dictates the only reasonable way in which way can interpret your character as a personit is my business it should be everyones we are not voting for a forum personality or famous character we are voting for a person and we deserve the right to see their ingame roles in an entirety
i rest my case thank you for taking the time to respond
i have only my main goumindong a market alt loany and a throwaway alt that may be used to haul stuff around empire they are all on the same account
i just have the one account and the three characters on itmy main nickaelhoopa refiner until i get my skill up imitai veroneand for the same reasons above a trader garofalo
i dont think its much to ask for alt namesthink of it this way i as a voter and not going to vote for a person who personally scammed a few hundred mil from me why should i if one of the alts did something in game i didnt like i really dont want to reward that person by voting for them in something that can really effect the gameanyone that says thats wrong is only fooling to themselves if i was running for csm and went around suicide ganking haulers destroying barges scamming people all over the place and being a general ahole in game would i expect people to vote for me if they knew who i wasso i dont think its much to ask for alts the only people it will effect is the people that use their alts to be aholes in game
i already released these names before into the public domain on another threadarithron mainantarre sales and aquisitions fellasharyn swallows entertainment and telemarketingtake carebruce hansen
by some weird turn of events the above post ended up double postingsorry bout that
though i dont really see the need to give out that kind of information and i dont need tobut since i dont have anything to hidebolla my builder t1 and t2 form inventionmad pirate retired suicide alt that now acts as my back alt 3 noob alts used to look up market prices and scouts
im with zoolkhan and jade constantine on this oneimo its simply not relevant im not revealing the name of my exotic dancer or slaver hound eitherid just like to clear my name anyway by adding that my alts aremynas atochsirmollebutterdogliliankhani hope managed to offend a few people by failing to list their names
judging by how goons play the game id say i prefer jades take on things metagaming and suicide ganking campaigns just arent cricket
egit goes on for quite a few pages before it gets derailed
wont support any one from the goon hive bob or any one who is pure pvpi will vote for those who are for solo play belive in empire as fairly safe space and industrailes and the little guys
he is completely incorrect of course but id invite the general eve electorate to have a read of my csm manifesto thread and decide for themselves really if people like what i have to say and agree with my thoughts on the vision and direction for the game thats good enough for me ive no time to waste with petty sideswipes at other candidates theyll be judged by the electorate soon enough
candidates who are incapable of civil objective or logical debate i dont fancy spending 3 days locked in a room with people unwilling or incapable of delivering results
your words not mine
absolutely agree serenity fingers crossed these attributes become apparent over the course of the campaign and voters make an informed choice to avoid the bad apples
why anyone would vote for goumindong aside from goons is beyond reasona candidate having no appreciable platform to speak of as of this post while being part of a 2000 player alliance that takes pride in pushing gamebreaking metagaming tactics to their limit seems rather disingenuous to me
please keep the slander and lies to a minimumspecifically not only do we not push gamebreaking metagaming tactics to their limit but i indeed have a platform if you are inclined to read it and have had for quite some timefurthermore no goons will be voting for me
im not interested in sending uneducated easy to impress nice people to ccp the candidates who basicly say ill be nice to you vote for me because you can and generally show no critical facilities are just going to be a waste of timeif the idea is to help transparency and keep ccp honest  we need to vote for the difficult candidates who can argue coherently and rigourously jade and serenity are nice folks but i cant see that advancing the game just reinforcing the status quoi want someone to take the devs and designers to task and review their procedures and strategies
i would not vote for anyone in goon their declared way of playing the game is just not compatible with the way most of us want toaside from the meta gaming element they are more responsible than any other alliance for the whole blob fiasco we find the game in now
somebody who doesnt understand reason that is about it but im really yet to see anybody for who this is true
same the goons have enough numbersfriends included to vote themselfes in they dont need my help 
simply put i wouldnt vote for any candidate belonging to one of the big alliances and who is playing eve for less than 3 years
i wont vote for people with a strong bias people who i feel are from groups that have done eve a dis service or people who are capable of writing 17 paragraphs without actually saying anything
well i was actually discussing this with jade recentlyisnt it better to be biased than just saying vote for me im not biased and i will listen to everybody to me it shows to me that a biased person actually knows something where the nonbiased person doesntalso according to some people my whole document about the state of the economy10 pages or so said nothing also isnt a good politician a person who can write alot but say nothing yet have the listener hear what he wants to hear in the end the csm has to represent the community so there is a balance
im entirely serious when i say this jade constantine the ability to communicate concisely is crucial in the context of the csm whereas jade chose to post a 7100word essay across fifteen posts just in order to introduce himself
i want the csm to be unbiased as i want them to translate our problems and requests to ccp without any personal agendas unfiltered regardless of playstyle or possibly ingame backgroundpeople who write without actualling saying anything will smother any discussion into nothingness resulting in nonaction and never actually getting to the point of a problem all that adds is static lowering the signal to noise ratioi understand the principle or a majority vote but thing is were not voting to elect for a group to be in control were voting for a comittee to help the powers that be in our name theres a huge difference in requirements for both types and as i see it people confuse the csm with running for elections while having your own agenda and having the power to make decisions thats not what the csm isps i dont want a politican that tells me what i want to hear i want a politican that tells me what he thinks pinpoints problems and gets to work to solve them
csm has to vote for an issue before it will even reach the iceland agenda so while the agenda of the individual isnt as important it is still important in order for people to see that this candidate that argue about things can do so in a clear manner and in general has a cluethe role of the csm is an advisory role as well as a link between ccp and the community if 5 out of the 9 candidates doesnt agree with a topic it just wont be discussed at the iceland meeting if the csm is just the yespeople of the community i would hate to see where eve would end up
theres a difference between filtering out idiotic requests i want my insert ship to have 888 slots and 99 resists and coloring the problems and requests of the eve population for your own benefits before pesenting them to ccp
how do can i support jade constantine
im really ntot sure how a request can be to your own benefit while it might be in my interest for instance to change the way the market works it doesnt mean i want that for person benefityou have to come with an example of how a csm member would be able to colour problems and requests and actuall have ccp do something about it it seems extremely unlikely leave alone impossible for it to be as big a problem as you seem to make it
if the majority of the csms are from big space holding alliances then the chances of a request from the playerbase lowering the defensive posiblities and making it easier to attack sovereignity systems will probably be watered downif people feels that eve should be more catered around teamwork and thus jumpfreighters should be nerfed and that carriers should be even less useable as haulers because that in effect increases the size of the universe also it narrows down the area of influence an alliance can have and advocates more teamwork and effort into holding spacepvpers would love that alliance holders traders and industry alts would hate it it would however be better for the game itself long term so if the csm is made up of mostly pvpers then the idea would be looked into and worked out and presented to ccp the ones that would not benefit from such a change would discard it either immediately or simply by covering it with bull and then forgetting about it
doubtful youll find that most sovholding alliance members think that pos warfare is too easy for the defender an attitude that i can certainly appreciate as someone whos been successful on both sides of that coinive incapacitated defended cynojammers with a battleship gang and killed dreadnoughts from the safety of a pos force field i think you can probably guess which position i preferred
i wouldnt vote for any candidate using the csm as some kind of personal soapbox from which to lobby ccp about their pet peeves with regard to game design and balanceas far as im concerned the whole point of it is to provide a little transparency to the goings on within ccp and help avoid tinfoilhattery on the epic scale of several wellknown threadnaughts and perceivedimagined issues of the past few years not to give a select few some kind of direct channel to the devs with which to attempt to influence the direction and design of the game which from the sounds of some of the candidates forum utterances some of them believe is the caseedit just realised that this was directed at csm candidates but meh i stand by my opinion and hope im not alone
that was the original idea of csm but if you believe the trolls ccp changed it and converted it into a pr trick
youre not alone bolded for truth
goumindong would be the last person i would want as all his ideas and calls for nerfs involve no real in game experience flying the ships in gangs or in actual combata candidate should have a solid background in the aspects of eve he has opinions on carebears on carebear issues pvpers on pvp issues with even these issues divided into sub groups each with positive and negative proponents
on my personal opinion i wouldnt vote some of these goon peoples question is whyi think that these guys are not just headin in for the game itself rather they are standing for an interest of an alliance of more than 4000 people not to forget the homies and buddies in addition who certainly have enough informal ingame power which might be completed by the factor of more direct lobby work via one or two csmgoons
delete
please keep the lies and slander to a minumum i both have ample in game experience in gangs and actual combat
as i have said before i do not consider 206 kills and 24 losses over 18 months real in game experience considering all the aspects of pvp that you wish to change
experience is not measured in kills and losses it can be a good indicator but it has no bearing on the pilots skills ability and knowledge of the systems you should also note that many people who do meet your criteria for kills and losses agree with me on many of the core issuesi think especially ironic was dinique over at shc saying how terrible i was at ship balance and then proposing changes that i had been saying were my ideal changes for the ship for quite some time anyway here is an example that shows why experience is not measured in kills and losses which pilot is better the one who fights when he cannot win or the one that runs away when he cannot win clearly the answer is the one who runs away when he cannot win and we do a lot of that in gsthough we certainly make mistakes all the time even though we have a reputation for suiciding into fleets a good example a few weeks ago i got to be active nearly every day of the week on fleet ops in a bs defending and assaulting poss this earned me one loss and about 10 various kills and maybe 3 or 4 kills in real good combat this happened for various reasons but none of them detracting from my experience the other day i had time to go out and do some random roaming pvp and all it garnered was shuttles and podsbecause that was all that was around aside from the large bob off gang that engaging would have slaughtered us and then another i get to bait and kill a rapier and gistib crow but none of these are good indicators of my experience because they dont tell the whole storythen of course there is the standard play time issue
while i understand that a individual can gain some experience in 18 months i find it hard to reconcile the fact that you make claims of experience enough to know that things need changing in all the varied forms of pvp in eve while your stats clearly show otherwise and you also point out yourself that your gameplay time is a issue in regards to your lack of kills and losses implying that you cannot log in and play much and that also adds to your lack of actual in game experiencenow i am not saying that you are not entitled to an opinion or that on occasion you may be right but you claim first hand knowledge of problems with the game when your ideas clearly come from others whines about life and eve not being fair because they lost a few ships or cannot out think or fly a enemy
slander again my ideas do not come from others whines about life and eve not being fair because they lost a few ships and cannot out think of fly an enemy to the contrary they are amalgamations between the better of eves players who think that the state of the game is a problemshould i say that the people whom i argue against simply have no skill and bury that lack of skill and intelligence behind overpowered tactics so when someone comes along and says hey this is overpowered they naturally flock to defend the mechanic which makes them look better than they areshould i instead say that these people are unable to see a difference between a wish to balance the game and a wish to nerf other players that they think any part of the game that is unbalancedno that would dilute my argument and do disservice to the people with whom i am arguing against as you do yourself by making this accusations the arguments that people are using to defend the things that i am attacking are the same arguments that they used to defend other overpowered tactics which have been nerfed for the good of the gameremote doomsdays and speed mods come to mind the defending case is pretty much the exact same as it was before the first nerf and is just as wrong and the case has not changed muchas i have explained stats do not show the entire picture do i have a killmail on the carriers i helped kill in the campaign against corm and risetruncated not that it would matter i was shooting at fighters most of the time do the killmails show the intelligence of the people i fight against nootherwise the recent solo rapier kill would read olol dont bump a battlecruiser off a station in an aggressed cruiser you dolt instead of what it does otherwiseregarding time to log in and play yes my time is restricted though not more than most people and nor would this matter as lessons are not learned immediately but in time
im not voting for any goon or anyone else whose grouppersonal history is contrary to the betterment of the game and the purposes of the csmalso not voting for anyone who couldnt put forth the effort to make a good first impression by actually listing useful information about themselves and their campaign in their csm candidate profile submissionand im not voting for anyone who refuses to clearly state their position they are either being deceitful in trying to be all things to everyone or are comletely uninformed and ignorant of the important issues or are incapable of forming an opinion and arguing a point of view none of these are conducive to a successful csmill definetely agree here i want to know a candidates mind before i trust him with my vote everyone has a bias i just want to know what bias im getting before i vote um no that may describe a successful politician but definetely not a good politician theres an important distinction such a politician may be elected repeatedly but he is not likely good for the interests of those he represents saying nothing and letting everyone hear what they want is just another method of lying through your teeth and obscuring the truth it also does not speak well to your skills as a communicator if you cant convey your ideas clearly so that everyone understands your meaning if everyone has a different understanding of what you say there is a definite problem either you are incapable of communicating properly or you are being intentionally vague
i would not vote for a person that is not open with the voters and a person that can not work in a team setting
scammer asks for help completing a missioninvites mark to gangmark in warp inbound scammer invites a war target to gangmark now a viable war target for nearby atwar gankersmarks pve fitted ship destroyed quicklyexpensive faction modules looted and soldwould you fix the above situation if so howedit post was blank at first
its gonna be fairly hard to fixi wouldnt mind having it fixed but i really cant come up with a creative idea which removes the loophole without removing a feature of the gang system
to be totally honest it isnt our job to come up with solutions to problems i think that is what people fail to realise that is ccps jobthe csm is only there to act as a bridge between the community and ccp we only report on what people want to fix or have looked at and then ccp developers look into the problem and find a creative solution that will have the least detrimental impact on all of us
complete consent
addendum without removing a feature of the gang system intended to prevent abuse in other ways that would likely be more severe than the one currently being usedespecially when it has a very easy answer on the part of the mark dont respond to cries for help without collateral equal to the value of your ship unless you know and trust the person
there is a famous saying that goes something likethere is a sucker born every minutethere is an easy way to stop this happeningfor players to wise up a little and stop complaining when they do something stupid luckily they get to learn from their mistakestake carebruce hansen
i dont want to remove it though i am probably going to be hated for thiswhen some one is ganged after the mark that has a active war going on a warning is sent to everyone in gang a warning that states that there is a person that has joined with a active war just thrown out therethough the best way to dont help strangers or people you dont trust
i dont think you can reconcile an attempt to fix this scam with ccps established attitude that eve should be a brutal game that emphasises shrewdness ccp has previously publicised  hell glorified  the actions of scammers such as the ghsc and this really is an example of exactly the same policy
i disagree with nikaelhoop it may be ccps job to fix it but its the job of csm to present the player bases arguments for and suggestions how to fix issuesi would support fixing it because the wardec mechanic for gangs is to enable consensual participation in other corpalliance wars by joining gangs at war it is not intended to trap and kill new players of evethis is evident in the facts that a warning message is displayed to new players on joining such a gang notification given to gangmembers when a new wardeced player joins the gangjoining a wardec pilot to gang while someone is in warp is deliberate abuse of this mechanichow to fix it it might be possible along the lines of only enabling players in npc corps to join gangs with other players in npc corps  which in itself has consequences for new player experience that require evaluation
it was merely a thought i had at the time of course if it is decided that ccp will look into it they will find a nice solution but im sure suggestions will be appreciated
and how would you suggest changing cloaking mechanics
i think adding fuel could be interestingcouple that with the ability for one to probe for a ship on grid which will allow you to approach the cloaker would be interestingbut this should only be true for noncovert ops cloaks
who are you asking that question to because i just answered it
any csm candidate that wants to answer the question
my personal perceptioni dont have any problem with cloaking and its mechanics its a possible and legal way of gaming so do ilogoff tactics is a anathema to me according to my opinion in this case the soldier come through its recreancy before the enemy i hope it dont sound so hard none the less this logoff is a security kit in case of loosing connection computer crashed or sth like this currently i see no feasible solution in that case
id prefer a reworking of gate routes  im not 100 certain of the current routing and im a in a lecture and b about to leave it so i cant really do any checkingthough what id like to see is a reworking of the route that instead places jita onto a ring of linked systems with some of those systems then branching out onto the most common routes that way instead of a normal intersection styled crossroad that jams so easily you have a larger roundabouttraffic circle in play this way jita remains a core system but the load is still somewhat distributed out across more systems and potentially even regions  with some smart mappingso assuming you keep jita as some sort of hub  as part of that ring  it could be the best ap route to one or more regions but at the same time the ap will now go via a different regionsystem set to other regions unlike the present routing seems to operateedit if you want to get really complicated you could create a sort of thick internally meshed ring where individual systems form a mesh in the shape of a 3d ring  imagine it like a large donut with a small hole in the middle  so you have to travel via a path one of multiple within the donut to make your way around the hole no one system or route takes you over the hole in the middle quickly but there are multiple routes in the donut that you can take to get around the hole eventuallycarefully breaking up the ring with different regions should completely theoretically break the singlehub mechanicand to get even more complicated when faction warfare comes in whatever it is lol  you could literally break market trade down to constellationsize instead of region size in concert with the meshed ringhowever i dont presume my idea is without holes or not more than one at least
just changing the gates around so its 1 jump from the end of the long jump into caldari space but a deadend system so only traders go there would be nice
add in rotating jita cn 44 so the undock traffic jam can be aliviated
traffic jams at least in my experience havent been a problem since the last patchbut lets face it jita is the product of scale due to the law of the network you cant kill this in any sensible way we just have to fix the underlying problem which ccp is working on
i have never understood why people expect ccp to fix this we pilots control where the stuff is sold and where we go to buy it if everyone and thier brother insist on going to the same crowded system what exactly do you expect ccp to do about itsell it somewhere else at the same price and people will start buying it there or is that to simple
a simple solution would be a avoid system x option for autopilot it would make possible to plot a route avoiding jita with ease even for people that hasnt memorized the systems around it and would be very nice to have in a lot of other conditions
the simplest solution to make the autopilot avoid jita is to add gates so that every system connected to jita has a gate to every other system connected to jita
this might workbut it might too make jita even more attractivejita naturally evolved into what it is today just like rens the players decided to make it their market hubs alter anything and the players find a new place to overcrowd itso far alternative autopilot routes is the best idea i heared to ease the load from jita systemexcept of course adding more datacenter power to the related nodes which might not be as easy as said
noi often take a shuttle and autopilot to jita if my hauler is there im simply too lazy to fly there manually i would rather have it take double the time and be able to multitask than not being able to multitask
eh if you have something in a system you want to pickup and you want to use the autopilot you put a waypoint in that system so that the ap stops there since im not proposing the removal of any gates you would still fly the same route as you do nowthe only difference is when someone plots a route that would currently take them through jita without placing a waypoint in jita whatever algorithm eve uses to calculate routes will avoid jita simply because the extra gates guarantee that the shortest route will not go through it
oh yeah my bad i read it as if you said that autopilot just shouldnt be able to enter jita edit but my stance on to do about jita is in my first post in this thread stops posting during a lecture
im not a csm candidate but i have a constructive opinion a few csm candiates might or might not likejita thrives because of selection everyone knows that if it exists your sure to find it here competition so many sellersproducers you are as likly to get a good price as anywhere else might not be the best but it wont be inflated location have to pass through it for many routes whether shopping or not and its reletivly convinient to get to if you are shopping and volume as byproduct of all of the above theres alot of each thing for sale and inventory moves quick1 selection cant mess with that too much its player controlled who sells what and how many different flavors of it but while everythings in jita not alot in some other regional hubs so diversifying is probably good2 competition this is actually a good thing the bad part like with selection is that its all in jita when far too many other trade hubs have only one or two producers for some high techexpensive items 3 location cant do much about peoples perceptions of convinience but you can fix the through traffic rearrange the gates so that no direct route through any two systems includes jita as a jump but keep the gates to jita in the systems that have them the effect would be a pit stop of sorts where you could get to jita as easily as now but it would be 1 jump to the side of the main highway4 volume here is where i think the key to spreading jita out is much like npc buysell orders get adjusted for demand in the trade market ccp could institute a similar idea for npc taxes the more trading volume is done in a particular system the taxes increase slightly low volume areas have lower taxes clearly greedy regulatory agencies would like to have a larger piece of the pie of a place like jita where they might encourage low tax as a means of promoting economic growth in less developed systems the npc fees are already skill based to an extent so trade characters have an advantage but they could also be made to be standingreliant encouraging through convinience that noncaldari to trade in their own regional hubswhile i leave it to ccp and others more qualified to work out the number specifics the general affect would be to encourage market diversification through people naturally wanting more isk if they continue to sell in jita as the taxes go up either their profits will go down making them likly to look elsewhere to sell or the prices will rise making consumers inclined to shop elsewhere in search of a better deal
how come why add features to disencourage people to do somethingwhy not rather encourage people to go elsewhere what the issues with jita are1 lag2 market mechanics you point out very finely that competition is good but i do think that because of scale the current market mechanics just arent really fit to handle the massive amount of competition anymore but the first point will be fixed by ccp due this yearthe last issue we will have to discuss with the community csm and ccp how we make these handle the increasing scalei came with a few ideas in my discussion thread about the economics but neither can be implemented alone and i think that we will have to see a major revision of the market which changes the fundamental principles of it while allowing reallife like behaviourspotbs uses an interesting mechanics but i dont think it will work in eve asis but its a very interesting concept we could adopt to a certain degree
since the effected players would be travelling through the systems around jita anyway i dont see much of an increase in traffic there so the only extra lag would be the extra gates which shouldnt be noticeablewhat this would do is simply make the players passing through the area avoid jita so they dont contribute to or experience the lag therefair enough as you said there isnt a traffic jam outside 44 since they added the exit angles my suggestion just removes the traffic that is passing through jita without stopping to be honest i have no idea how much these players contribute to the lag so it might not make any noticeable effect to the players in jita all i can guarantee is that people passing through will avoid being caught by jitas various load related issuesid also advise ccp somehow configuring agents in the surrounding systems to never place a combat mission there either by moving agents away from the area or some special tweak to the code so agents in jita will always send players away from it for combat again this is focusing on lowering the number of people who get caught in the lag and i cant predict how much it will effect anyone who is in jita for another reason
right that is what i was wondering about tooi recall a dev stating that the main load on the node is due to items being moved trough the marketitem manipulation in general so im not sure how effective it would be but for the sake of getting around jita your idea does indeed have merrits but for solving lag i have my doubtsso im pretty sure that one of the most requested changes to the csm is to make people able to go around in a circle around jita but i doubt ccp will do it due to having to change the map thus making the new map serenity is making obsolete but who knows ccp might just do it with factional warfare

link to manifestoi am yusra ceo of the political organization per capita or at least what may become a political organization if all goes according to plangiven its unorthodox nature i feel i should to explain the specifics of what makes my candidacy different from the others herethe aim of per capita is to combine the benefits of direct democracy with free market capitalism in other words to enable citizens to vote directly on issues whilst also making moneyper capita is an eve corporation if i am nominated to the council of stellar management then shares in this corporation will be made publically availableas a shareholder your shareholders vote will dictate my vote on the council in other words as a council member i will vote on each issue according to the majority will of per capitas shareholders the standard eve corporate voting mechanism will be used meaning that the more shares you own the more power your vote carries being a shareholder has another benefit income made by the corporation will be paid back in the form of dividends the suggested starting amount will be 80 although this can of course be reviewed and changed by a majority shareholder decision once the corporation has sufficient operating capital then this amount can be increased to 100this income will come from two placesthe first is sale of shares the initial initial public offering will pay back 80 to shareholders then after the ipo the intention is to issue new shares as per market demand the sale of these will result in further dividendsof course this has never been tried before so its impossible to say what that demand will be maybe once the ipo is complete shares will only need to be traded on the secondary market but given that in this case money is enabling the direct purchase of power i am optimistichowever this is only the secondary means of generating income for shareholders the primary means is per capitas core purpose any individual will be able to pay to have an issue considered by the shareholders this person can be a per capita shareholder or any other citizen of eve and this can be any issue they choose they write their issue and alongside a payment submit it to per capita for considerationthe shareholders then vote on whether the issue is raised within the council if the issue is accepted then the money is kept and dividended if it is rejected then the money is returned except for a small handling feeshareholders will have to consider each issues merits although they will also consider how much money is being offered given that they earn money from raising issues to the council they have a clear incentive to accept them especially if the plaintiff is offering a lothaving said that if too many issues are accepted then their value declines and new customers will be hard to find after all the council of stellar management will not take seriously a long list of insignificant complaints and our shareholders will have to bear this in mindwe are selling something of value but if too much of it is sold then that value will decline that is the responsibility of shareholders to decide and also my role as ceo to ensure that business value is retainedin terms of trust and transparency im sure many might have concerns i am working closely with serenity steele to ensure that per capita is set up and managed correctly serenity will be acting as a guarantor for the corporation and will be closely involved in its operation additionally we are looking for independent auditors the intention is to run per capitas finances in a way that is 100 transparent to shareholders plus have major decisions dictated by shareholder vote continued in next post 
i feel that per capita has the potential bring several unique benefits to the council and to eveto those that feel this is undemocratic a corruption of politics i would certainly not claim that it alone represents true democracy but as one voice in the council i think it will add valueusing the existing mechanism of shareholder voting issues will be able to be quickly and easily decided within the corporation this provides a way for the opinions of a large number of citizens to be counted in a direct way given that the aim of the council is to represent the community this has obvious merits merits that go beyond our trust in representative democracy alonei also see the marketdriven nature of the vote as a benefit it will enable the representation of money of wealth within eve wealth comes with power and power comes with interest in eve those with wealth have frequently much to say about eve and much to gain or lose their interest is if you like highly interested given that individuals will have to pay to have issues raised it follows that they will focus on issues that matter after all if an issue is trivial why pay for it the barrier to entry becomes a filter for quality a filter that is doublyapplied first by the plaintif and then by the shareholdersit also might make you as shareholders rather rich if any powerful individuals attempt to buy up very many shares or if they pay handsomely to promote their agenda then the profits might be more than insignificant compared to the limited payouts available via more traditional ipos and banking there is at least the potential to make considerably more alongside of course the risk of notin the longer term i see the potential for per capita to become a political party within eve in a real sense the council has a limit of two terms for any individual to serve on it hence i could at most serve two terms as ceo however i could be replaced as ceo having served these two terms and the corporation could continue with the new ceo running as candidate for the csm in this way per capita might outlast the two term limit imposed on individualsbut overall and perhaps most significantly i see this as an experiment in politics an example of what politics can be like if we drop the barrier between capitalism and democracy and stand back and let the market decide to me that is something im curious to see the results of it is also something i think is very very evethank you for reading if you have any questions please ask them here
this is the definition of a pyramid scheme champ
one additional issue that needs clarification i was asked if this is just a plan to scam large amounts of isk the answer is no although the plan is certainly to attempt to make good money for shareholders some details as part of the ipo i will retain some shares in per capita these will be my source of income from the corporation this creates the incentive for me to raise money for shareholders since this is the only way to make money for myself our interests are aligned in other words the specifics of this will be published prior to the election once all the specific details of the ipo are finalized these are currently being worked on by myself and serenity steele the corporation will publish a list of its major shareholders on a monthly basis as well as dividends paid out the current intention is to pay our independent auditors directly from company funds rather than via shares this is to ensure a degree of separation the need for this plus some minor incidental costs eg office space is the reason for the initial dividend payout amount to be set at 80 i welcome all feedback on this the intention is to design a financial setup that is fair reasonable and transparent
so you have an interest in making money off thisthats not a nice attitude
it doesnt have to be a nice attitude what with it being a pyramid scheme and all
if the intention was purely to make money by selling more and more shares then it would be a pyramid schemehowever that part is incidental the aim is only to sell more shares if there is demand if there is no demand then no problem the long term aim is not simply to sell more and more shares but rather to provide enough shares to meet market demand what drives this demand the desire to be able to vote on csm issuesthe primary mechanisms are what is being sold is the ability to vote on issues raised at the csm the ingame share system is being used because it enables a simple voting system that already exists in addition since existing shareholders have to vote to approve the creation of new shares the corporation may collectively decide to stop issuing  the primary source of income if there is any is private individuals bringing issues to the corporation perhaps no one will want to do this but if they do shareholders make money this has nothing to do with a pyramid scheme thank you for asking however
of course i have an interest in making money this will take a large amount of my time to administer for which it is reasonable to be paid plus as i pointed out since my income will come only as a shareholder this creates an incentive to make money for all shareholders its the standard setup used by most rl corporations bear in mind that if the corporation makes no money then i make nonethe amount of shares has to be reasonable if its too much then of course no one will want to get involved the exact amount isnt set yet im working on it currently with serenity and the details will be provided as part of the ipo market pressure will ensure the amount is reasonable
no thats entirely untrue youve already established that youre going to be using the shares to make a personal profit something that no other csm candidate has been crass enough to suggest this is purely for your personal interests and because the degree of profit to be made diminishes with each successive wave of shares and each dividend is drawn heavily from the sale of those same shares it satisfies the definition of a pyramid schemeyour justification for the scheme  other than making money off the idiots who give it to you  is to facilitate direct democracy but when you charge individuals to raise issues and give the greatest voting ability to the largest shareholders youre violating the democratic ideal in favour of an oligarchy of foolslet me also point out that your corporation is a very poor facsimile of the existing system your corp allows people to raise issues which if they receive sufficient support are taken to a higher level of decisionmaking this is precisely the same damn system as the existing implementation of the csm with the exception that its broken csm council members cannot raise issues themselves so youre making a promise you cannot possibly keep
i understand your concerns daveydweeb but you have misunderstood i suggest you read the above again carefully plus what i have to say belowas i have stated clearly the aim of per capita is to combine the benefits of direct democracy with free market capitalismthis is not an exercise in pure democracy i am not claiming this so to accuse me of violating a democratic ideal is accurate that is the whole point it is an exercise in combining two things direct democracy namely the ability of an individual in this case a shareholder to vote directly on an issue rather than leaving the decision up to a representative unlike other csm members you do not have to trust me to vote on my instincts instead you can vote to tell me how to vote directly free market capitalism namely to let market forces determine the value of this direct democracy to allow market forces to determine how much people are willing to pay to both raise issues and have the right to vote on them let the market decidethe market will dictate how much people want to pay to both raise issues and vote if its 1000 isk then thats what its worth if its 1 million then thats what its worth just like the price of any module or ship on the eve market this is no differentall profit will be returned to shareholders in other words the corporation only exists to enable the trade of votes and political issues the corporation is in no way dependent on the sale of additional shares as per a pyramid scheme additionally since share issues must be voted on if the shareholders decide to issue no more shares then none will be issuedi welcome your feedback it is my utmost concern that these financial and procedural specifics are well understood im sure others would react as you do my aim is to clarify
remember if youre for phasing out of tech ii bpos then youre for endless grinding and more horrid pos
i would offer you a longer response but your question is kinda vague you dont put forward any issueas such i think that the t2 bpos are just fine it wouldnt be too smart to convert them into bpcs
with the refinments to invention cartels of t2 bpo holders are no longer an issue the main issue with t2 is high end moon minerals being monopolized by select few alliances
this topic was covered recently in another thread i think the only t2 bpo issue is on the forums i think this is just beating a dead horse
im not sure i see the causal link here
put the damned t2 bpos on the market seed them like other bpos this business where the market is not allowed to do its job and its impossble to get most t2 bpos is absurd
have you tried invention
im guessing youve never tried your hand at invention thenedit efb
2 for you in my books sir
tech2 bpos in the game currently are absolutely fine theyve been shuffled around now and bought and auctioned and traded and reached their current owners through the workings of a free market economy in the game its no longer about freebies from the lottery and now much more about 23 year funding planning on x auction amount if i want to buy myself a nighthawk bpo in the current environment im going to be paying 55billion isk and its going to take several years to pay back the investment thats entirely reasonable and its actually unreasonable to suggest that at any point in the future that bpo should suddenly turn to a bpc and make my investment meaningless invention is a fully viable alternative for startup industrial outfits  tech2 bpo owning is no longer the beginning and end of the equation and current tech2 owners have to bid for supply on components derived from moon minding holdings the same as anyone else does in short i think the tech2 system in eve is currently pretty good there are opportunities for risk takers tech2 auctions opportunities for the average industrialist invention opportunities for cartels and raw materials cartels moon minerals and components and taken as a whole it works
jade is completely right i was gonna write a large post about that now that im home from class but jade beat me to italso you have to remember that t2 bpos actually increase the stability of the t2 markets this is because the build costs on t2the more t2 components the item uses the large stabilizing effect the t2 bpos have bpos is smaller so while they cant keep up with the supply the are able to do it to a small degree and thus decrease the volatility of the market if the moon minerals swingso all in all t2 bpos are good for the consumers they arent an isk printer anymore in fact you will see t2 bpos selling for many times the yearly profit for instance i have seen some t2 bpos being sold at prices which would make it do about 13 return on investment per month
with 300 millions worth of datacores and decryptors i got enough runs to do 15 rapiers it will take me about a week to build them my margin per ship is much lower than the one of a t2 bpo builder but i have more than double his output which mean ill still make a confortable amount of money and thats with using only 3 factory slots i could triple that output easily assuming i had the capital for buying enough construction componentst2 bpos are fine invention is mostly fine too with just the mepe of input bpc and effect of meta 0 items needing looking at
the reason i raised the issue wasnt anything to do with the affect of pure invention per say but more to get an idea of what side of the fence you sit on with regards to the bpos whilst many agree they are fine as they are there are also probably an equal number who disagree and will always disagree as they cant see themselves being in a position of owning an isk printing machine and think its highly unfair that nothing is done about this yes we all know about 95 of the t2 bpos are rubbish and you can invent anything anything anyway but this point of view remains so each thinking they should go or stayit should be the role of the csm candidate to collate all points of view foragainst and remain unbiased towards any side in the csm role
right now theyre only two real iskprinting machines dysproprom moons and invention only invention require some sweat and rare moons require you to be in a big alliance
but isnt the idea that csm should filter out logicless whinei mean im yet to see any argument for why t2 bpos should be removed with invention in placeunless you can give me 1 reason why t2 bpos are bad i dont consider them to be a problem but i probably need perspective and if you can give me a good argument against them im sure it will be included in any discussion to at least try and prove why t2 bpos are bad
in my opinion the t2 bpos shod stay as they are now how that will effect the t3 invention it is a bit too early to say and that some people still think they are isk printing machines should go into a bit more work and buy one for them self and as stated before it is not the producers that get the isk printer at the moment it is the 00 alliances that have the good moons
fwiwlavistasometimes a good illustration of what is wheat versus what is chaff is needed the op is an example of chaff for example
i agree it is chaff i never said im against t2 bpo as ive owned a few and currently own one now i was trying to gauge really a perspective of the csm stance as there are people who would like them removed me i dont know tbh as there are pros and cons and i am hoping to see a candidate who filters the whines from all sides without bias to one camp only
let me see if i am understanding this discussion so far some arguments have taken from other threads the t2 bpos are just fine the way they are becausetheyve been shuffled around now and bought and auctioned and traded and reached their current owners through the workings of a free market economy in the game invention is a fully viable alternative for startup industrial outfits current t2 owners have to bid for supply on components derived from moon minding holdings the same as anyone else doest2 bpos actually increase the stability of the t2 marketsmost t2 bpos arent isk printing machines as invention now ensures that sell prices have to be competitive with invention t2 stuffif they werent ingame many items wouldnt be available as invention costs would be more than players willing to pay for itemssome hardtoinvent items would skyrocket in price if t2 bpos removedthe t2 bpos should be replacedremoved becausecertain corps or alliances have a monopoly on certain t2 items and the lower price cap due to the ability to improve me and faster production rate from improving pe means that they can make good profit and sell below invent costthe price of t2 bpo puts the owning of a t2 bpo beyond the reach of newer players and corpswith invention failures and run limits most players cant afford to invent and compete since t2 holders have an advantage of always succeeding and having lower coststhe requirements for invention coupled with high skills required for many items eg ships means that only older players can realistically invent and these are those players that are more likely to just have the bpo or the disposable isknewer players want to be able to build and sell the more profitable t2 items onto marketsinventors can invent more lots than a bpo can produceof course t2 bpo owners if they wanted could also invent alongside their t2 bpo productionhas anybody have any further thoughts to add to this list of pros and consbruce hansen
deconstructing the cons certain corps or alliances have a monopoly on certain t2 items and the lower price cap due to the ability to improve me and faster production rate from improving pe means that they can make good profit and sell below invent costnobody in his right mind will sell significantly below invention cost unless the market is so saturated that inventors would have bailed out a long time ago anyway so they would only be competing with other bpo holders anywayprices are mainly set by inventors the ones that have most of the potential supply in hands for all in demand items while items not in demand would only become prohibitively expensive without t2 bpos so expensive nobody would bother inventing them since nobody would be buying them at all in the first place the price of t2 bpo puts the owning of a t2 bpo beyond the reach of newer players and corpsthe price of a titanmothership does the same should they be so cheap a 1month player could afford them also the price is 100 set by the players some t2 bpos have nothing but a sentimental value still prices asked are hugebottom line so what if new playerscorps cant afford t2 bpos  its not a good reason to remove them with invention failures and run limits most players canUFFFDt afford to invent and compete since t2 holders have an advantage of always succeeding and having lower costsyou dont compete with bpo holders you only compete with other inventorsyou only need to look at the prices of t2 items that have no bpos in existance to see what i mean the requirements for invention coupled with high skills required for many items eg ships means that only older players can realistically invent and these are those players that are more likely to just have the bpo or the disposable iskthe higher the entry barrier the better the market for those that finally get thereyou only need to look at the t1 market to see what a disaster for profits a very low barrier of entry causesheck i would even argue the entry barrier for invention is not nearly high enough as it is newer players want to be able to build and sell the more profitable t2 items onto marketsif they are so profitable then let them get the needed skills and funding with other activitiesbut as soon as they get there they will realize that its not the milkandhoney land they thought it would be and that simply manufacturing t1 ammo in a mission hub would bring them better profits for the capital they can afford to invest inventors can invent more lots than a bpo can producehows that a con for t2 bpos existing 
its in the reasons to remove t2 bpo section essentially if i understand the argument correctly the t2 bpo arent needed to keep up supply as more bpc can be invented and built from in a month than items built from a bpo alonebruce hansen
really remove bpos in favor of bpcs and well have many more pos churn out bpcs to grind that thing called invention whats not to see
for the items in demand truebut for those items that manufacturing from high me bpo is still barely profitable it would be the death bell ringing
good description jade i agree with this reasoning

i speak as a entity who wants to wardec others not to avoid them thats other debatei want that single corp can wardec more than silly 3 corpsalliances and in alliance wardec prices shouldnt rise 50m100m150m200m  etc steps because having a few wars going on will soon cost one billion each week and as a poor griefer alliance thats alot rich 00 alliances can abuse empire space while poor people cannot get dips on their wealth in form of pvploot
on the whole i think wardec fees are to high the reason for this has nothing much to do with veteran players since we can all afford to throw a couple of hundred million at a wardec for a week or so but it does negatively impact starting warcorps and junior pvpers who can be priced out of the market and forced to do pve and missionrat grinding just to raise the stake for a wardec against an alliance however i do think there is also a problem with the wardec system in and of itself and the lack of objectiveswin conditions makes it currently a tired old mechanic that more often than not becomes a way for people to score the occassional kill and go to ground with no consequence id like to see the wardec fees made cheaper but in combination with an actual resolutionwin mechanic that determines the result of the war if a corporation wardecs a target and loses 75 of the engagements if should probably be awarded a loss and prevented from a rewardec for a month if the exchange remains evenish 2575 war can continue if they actually win they get awarded the victory and some kind of victory boon against the target for a month maybe 1 tax rate directly scooped from losers wallet for the month as reparationsobviously this ties into some of the ideas in my csm manifesto and would have a role for mercenaries involving themselves in the war and having a direct affect on the war stats summary yes i think warcosts should be cheaper because at the moment they unfairly penalize starting pvpers who want an early war with their first corps and since eve is an open pvp game that sells itself on these options and alternatives this is a bad thingbut  war system needs work and definitely needs a resolution mechanic to decide who wins or loses to prevent declared wars from dragging on forever without resolution as they can do when veteran player finances come into the equation
what are the candidates opinion of this little nugget i just pulled out of ahem  anywayccp refuses to classify as an exploit the entire membership of a wardecced corp hopping to a newly created corp to avoid the wardec so lets change it so that if several members or a large percentage of your target corp end up in another you can dec this other corp free of charge i dont mean in cases where a few people bolt from corp a and end up in corp b i mean where 24 people leave a 25 person corp and all 24 end up in corp c which incidently happens to have 24 new members who joined up the same day it was created ive had that happen to me and it was very annoying at one point i felt like i had half of verge vendor under a wardec trying to keep up with it
ive never liked wardec evasion by corphopping while the declared on corp refuses to formally surrender and agree terms the idea i express in the post both above could probably solve this if you made actual corp membership part of the win conditions for a basic war  too many jump ship and the war will be over with a victory awarded to the aggressor the defeated corp pays reparations in some form if people want to avoid paying even that then the corp could go bankrupt and be struck off perhaps detail needs adding to this proposal in formal discussion and brainstorming  but the principle is to bring resolution to wars through what actually happens in game
well any chances must affect both sides and having dished out a few millions to dec a corp only to find out that everyone or close to everyone has left and created a new corp and starts doing the same thing that caused you to dec them in the first place does that sound right now i agree that the last war dec fee nerf was a bit harsh but changing the fees without having the game mechanics in place to achieve something by having a war does not help much
ugh that is a hard one cailais 1 line poor jade 3 but ill try my best at a 1linerthe biggest problem at present is the product of scale scale can been seen in regards to lag economic issues and 00 warfare and quite a few other issuesthe solution isnt sharding fear not
i think the biggest issue in eve at this time is the feeling that the csm is useless will damage the game or will give some people an advantage over otherswill we tell ccp what we want and they will fix it in the next patch no of course not there are a lot of good and helpful posts in the forums there is also a lot of garbage as well as a great number of malicious posts i believe that over time a group of people presenting practical ideas based on what people want to ccp will make this a better game
this statements take balls because every large space holding entity now fear for their fortresses and vote someone who avoids this topici do however concur
tough to pinpoint a primary issue as i have loads if i reduce it to three main issues is that okthe inability to deal with known criminals griefers and other scum that hides in highsec lofty definately needs to go as welllack of content both pve and pvp for solo players and small corpsgroups of friends i hope faction warfare will be a step in the right direction thoughboring rd mining and production needs to be much more dynamic
big issue is really space combat dynamism in 00 and empire and by dynamism i mean opportunity for involvement and participation and good fun pvp00 suffers hugely from massive defense advantage and the blunt instruments of cynojammer jumpbridge sovereignty battle at reinforcement timer bottlenecks and as a consequence resolution is laggy unsatisfying and generally out of the reach of any but the largest entities in the game this really needs serious resolution and i think most of the csm candidates and a good proportion of the eve electorate know thisbut it doesnt stop there evepvp is not just 00 territorial conquest the lure and imaginative potential of eve is in its freedom of choice and sandbox nature where players can choose the profession specialty and ingame focus they want to pursue at the moment here is next to no support for variant conflict mechanics and pvp miniprofessions the war dec system needs attention bounty hunting and mercenary options need supporting lowsec is currently a wasteland where nobody really needs to go this all adds up to a problem with limited pvp opportunity and lack of dynamic lure to get people involved
as stated on my candidate thread
as others have rightly pointed out there are lots of issuesone primary gameplay issue that needs resolving if i was allowed to ignore lag and pos warfare as that has several iterations to go through according to ccp and low sec space which involves a myriad of interconnecting issues i would suggest the retention of new players via implementation of better gang mechanics ie sort out gang mechanicsits not rocket science that we need to retain all players but the number on 14 day trial that get past the initial learning curve only to quit after hitting the very real harsh mistress of eve by getting blown up in a so called friendly gang must number highi doubt many players will want a carebear type of game and would like eve to remain the harsh mistress that she is so i believe discussion needs to be brought to the table on this issuea non gameplay issue but affects gameplay is customer service im sorry i cant stop typing petition queue times and quality of responses need improvement but im unsure if that lies within the scope of the csm im fairly certain that gms are very hardworking people and get a lot of flack however some stress and tension on both sides can be avoided by introducing a service level agreement where customers know what response times to expect and gms have targets to achieve thats one possible solution there are probably more
the biggest issue as i see it at the moment is bacon and other programs that use the log server file in a unintended fashionand ofc farmers macros and rmt that can destroy the game
more i hear from you the more i like what i hear you have my vote
i disagree with this its an important issue that needs to and can be resolved technically in the shortterm its not the biggest issue facing eve today
remove local anywhere in any way and tons of people will find it much less worthwhile to participate in eve its the pirates and griefers who want to nerf or remove local but if that happens the game will devolve to where there are only pirates and griefers and newbs as the newbs get popped and podkilled to satisfy senseless and pointless killboards they will leave the pirates and griefers think eve is an arcade game it isnt
im concerned far more about the social impact of losing local than any intel stuff or otherwisehow do candidates suggest this is accounted for if local is removed from 00 especially considering how empty 00 can be already for people looking for social interactions as well as pvp
when people suggest removing local they do not suggest removing the chat functionality only the intelligence functionalityfor a good discussion regarding this see posts 3865 of this threadand my responses in this thread
i really cant add anything to this post jade hits the nail right on the head as i see it
my opinion is that local should stay no matter what security status you are inbased init is a great social tool and as many people have commented a simple intelligence tool for those that are paranoid
for those of you that feel local should go away based on security level or something elsewould you be ok with local staying if it was less efficient if local acted like the noob help channel and only listed those that used it and only maintained track of those that do a set group of actions like within xx km of a gate or station speak in local and so on
i would like to present a few ideas for the candidates and would appreciate any comments on them00 warfaretoday the state of 00 warfare is seing the blob reign supreme in order to keep it profitable for the players to build up 00 infrastructure the defensive side in 00 has been boosted compared to the offensive one so that it is strongerthe effect of this is that there is little room for smaller entities to challenge the sovereignty of larger ones while you may always fit a group of ships and get a fun fight the chances of having a real impact on 00 is limited how should we find a place for the smaller non nano gangscorpsalliances in sovereignty warfareshould pos defenses be fitted and destroyed much like ships are today imagine fitting a battleship type thingie with modules and the anchoring it to a pos structure a smaller gang could then attack the pos defenses weaken the defenses and get away with loot good idea bad idea rotten ideashould we introduce mini pos and pixi pos that can be deployed at a safespot doesnt show up on overview allow cruiser and frig sized hulls to dock and be discoverable only by the use of scan probes and only if an enemy pilot is docked and active at the pos or he has recently logged off at one the idea is to allow for smaller entities to establish bases deep in enemy territory how should such a thing be balancedsov is pretty much a question of having the more large pos and sov level a question of how long youve had them this effectively prevents smaller entities from challenging sovereignty of larger ones should sov level be changed to a point system where also the mini and pixi pos described above has a value and sov level is determined by how many percent of total points an alliance haswhat other ideas do you have on this topic please also think out of the box throwing up new ideas rather than simply modifying old ones we need csm to be a bunch of imaginative beer drinking nerds who will blend in with the rest of ccp  that way you stand a better chance of spying at hem effectively player enabled contentshould we players be allowed to invent stuff from scratch should i be able to prefit my favourite cruiser and then do an invention run on it creating an x run bpc with modules prefitted on it  modules that i would be unable to remove should such a bpc have a mineral bonus to productionshould i be able to invent new dronesfighters in much the same wayshould i be able to do invention and improve on existing bps ie should i be able to add an extra mid slot to my zealot bpobpc and what should the impact be on mineral cost should i be able to improve power and cpu output the same wayroleplayi feel the the actions of the playerbase has very little impact on the politics of the empires should it be possible for players to somehow impact on how the empires interact or shold this be left to ccpwhen if factional warfare comes should it be possible for the minmatar playerbase to induce the brutor tribe to sponsor an attack on the amarr colonies assigning ships much like fighters to participating pilotswhat if anything should be done to further rp in the world of eveand finallyi have repeatedly petitioned ccp to hand out a free bhaalgorn bpos to pilots answering to the name of octavinus augustus they have so far refused to comply will you as a csm member fight for my rights face up to ccp and insist i be given what i deserve in the spirit of compromise id be willing to settle for 2 zealot bposid be very interested to hear your thoughts on these topics please share
something along these lines would be very cool
relating to your question if someone of csm or csm itself would invent in this case there should be more details announcedon which premise did you call up ccp to hand out this bpoon which premise do you deserve this bpodo you want to buy a csmthe csm with 2 zea bpos
ooh yeah i think its called a forward base although it should be found not just when someone is in one  tho maybe with different probe type or balanced in some other waythe late lamented mankind had or has i think its technically still open one thing going for it  it was genuinely hard to find someone with a small outpost quietly mining semirare resources and often id be scouting my cube far away from everything and find a new deposit of silver or something which funded me for a while
octavinus could please place each of your questions in a separate post to enable answering individually i suggest you will receive more responses this way and it will be easier for others to compare candidate responses
every since i started playing eve lag has been with me those early missions where the accelerator gates fire you into the middle of a hostile swarm on npcs and you die from lag before you ship responds to commmandsshopping trips to jita00 fleet battles where you jump through as gate and wake up in a pod back in your home station never having seen the enemy this my friends if where ccp need to allocate their development resource its all well and good adding new content but its a bit pointless if we cant use the content we already have
is i already mentioned here action on part of ccp is necessary
i agree and to prove it here is my answer to the eve mag
regarding the lag issue  it is an issue granted but i personally dont think its something that is ever going to get solved in isolation through implementation of new uber servers or endless needforspeed refinements and efficiencyenhancing back end alterationsreality of the situation is that lag  a failure in game objectives and territorial conflict mechanics at the moment that have made it too attractive and easy to outblob ones opponents utilizing sovereignty tools and starbase equipment and this is only made worse by the current territorial conquest engine that allows the defenders to specify their period of highest numbers and activity when they want the critical fights to play out leads to dogpiling on an epic scale  laglots of people look back to the golden age of eve when there was no lagtm and large fleet battles happened between adversaries and huge fun and entertainment was had by allpartially this is just nostalgia  partially its the fact that numbers were fewer then partially its the fact that fights were not alarm clock ops and could be triggered at other times than at the defenders choosing and were by consequence far more likely to be uncertain and less numericallycharged affairs all roundsolution to lag  is stop forcing the player base to fight single pitched battles at single points in space at predetermined timesspread out the objectives make defenders guess more keep the battlefield fluid and distributed and actively balance the game to encourage all sides to split their huge uber blobs into smaller task forces pursuing multiple simultaneous objectives at remote locationsits a pretty damning indictment of the current 00 territorial status quo a lot of this could be achieved by simply rolling the clock back to 200405 grade capturable stations and attendant ping pong because at least there you had the ability to spread out an attack force and engage multiple points of enemy vulnerability and encourage the defender to split up their forces if they wanted to stop all the ongoing flips on that particular nightnow i know yes yes all current territorials hate station pingpong because it means you need an actual 247 presence in space to stop the badguys taking the mickey out of your defenses  but really was it so much against the vision and essence of eve when the defender did have weak times and vulnerable periods where particular timezones were a problem for themi mean if im flying with star fractions uspacific wing and were peaking at a half dozen battleships because its our weak tz does that mean that when we get bounced by 20 enemy guys from hawaii our ships should go into reinforced mode and the foes are going to have to come back in euro primetime to finish the fight funny example i grant you but its pretty much the principle of current 00 territorial warfare and its the reason why the critical fights in pos domination always turn into immensely lagfilled nonsensical 15min module lag travesties rather than playing out as decent fleet battlesjust when did we all accept the principle that the defender always gets to fight in his or her strong tz anywayso the point here regarding lag is that i just dont believe its meaningful to name lag reduction as a csm campaign pledge without actually getting your teeth into the core issue of gameplay balance and focus that necessitates laginducing numbersfests as the only method of territorial conquest resolution available to playersdeal with the actual cause of lag by all means come up with proposals to reduce reliance and promotion of the uberblob in starship combat 50 vs 50 works fine in eve pretty much lets have gameplay systems that split a horrible 250v250 grind slideshow fight into 5 different enjoyable minibattles at remote points in the contested territory and then youre on the right track in my opinion
right i largely agree with jadewhat we will see is a large reduction of lag once infiniband hits theres no question about it but it wont happen without a lot of work from ccps side by impelementing load balancing systems which works on the fly its all about delegating services which are taking up a lot of cpu for one system to different nodes this will reduce the cpu bottleneck by being able to offload as many tasks to as many different nodes as possible we still have to consider that it can be expensive to offload tasks but sometimes the benefits will outweigh it a lotso while i agree jade that if there is lag its a failure on the objective of the game but i think jade is missing that its a product of scale and the network effectyou cant stop people from blobbing its perfectly sensible where there is people people will go be it the marketmore to buy more potential sales or pvpmore people to shoot so while fixing lag is a real thing and should be done it shouldnt be done alone we should still encourage smaller groups of people to do something rather then encourage blobbing
yeah but this is the point ccp have continually made the code and network better and more efficient throughout the history of eve whats changed is not that theyve suddenly dropped the ball and ccp devx has accidentally coded if fighters launch  make more lag in the patch code as theyve improved the lag situation player base has gotten bigger single objectives have encouraged dogpiling and more and more ships cram into the same gridsystemnode and make the situation seem worse think of it like a family house perfectly fine when its a man and wife they have loads of space and a beautiful living environment they then have a couple of children then a couple more slowly the house gets crowed the father converts the antic puts some more beds in the spare room and it all gets crowded hes trying hard to stay abreast of the situation children grow up get boyfriends and girlfriends and want to move in more house conversions they turn the shed into another bedroom and partition the living room into another bedsit and all the time its getting more and more crowded eventually somethings got to give and they have to tell their offspring to go and get a place to live of their own because ultimately thats the only proper resolution eve terms  few years ago a 50 vs 50 fleet battle was massive it pushed the server it was epic and impressive and made everyones jaw dropped but as the server has improved fights get bigger and bigger and the server cannot keep up with the maximum blobbing potential of the largest alliances if infiniband and code optimizations allow 500v500 battles to work smoothly then the alliances will bring 1000v1000 and complain about lag ultimately youve just got to split up objectives and bite the bullet about disincentivizing mindless fleet dogpile
strange i honestly hadnt thought of lag as a product of game mechanics in the same why as others seem to havesome observations of my ownwhy do pos cause so much lag indeed all anchorable structures just visit an ice belt to see what i meanwhy do caps cause more lag than bswhy do fighters cause more lag than droneswould it be possible to have the options to remove objects from your view not just the overview
we all suffer fear and hate lag i am not going to repeat already spoken words of the cocandidates above mei would be very surprised though if ccp has not yet figured out that we hate lagthis is why i assume there might be a technical limitation some kind of bottleneck behind this lag which is just not shared with the player base that would be bad press for ccp obviously they cannot talk tech details too much with us wo risking issues with their business partners running the data centers the sql servers or nasit is my opinion that we need to know the issue better in order to address itperhaps we should focus on workarounding what we cannot change for technical reasons setting a more attractive frame for smaller scale combat would be a starti do not mean the usual vaganano gangscurrently there is no way around large fleet battles if you want to conquer territorypeople fear that lag has become an additional defense system people jumping in are ususally those with pants down as the others were already waiting with grid loadedreducing the need of blobfights would be avoiding the lag wo fixing the issue at its technical roots i would certainly ask ccp why they keep it his way and continue to even promote large fleet warfare each time a camera or press pass is waived at their facesi realize that my suggestion does not look convincing on the 2nd look  because even if the need is removed people would still blob for the sake of a swift victory tough topicreality vs marketing  who shall be the victor i direct this question to ccp
i feel the inferband will help when it is put upccp have said the lag in jita is due to the amount of transaction going on and not really the amount of players i feel ccp could improve it by spliting the loads of this area in to three nodes first node deals with the players their ships and cargo in the system second deals with the market and the third deals with hangers this spliting would have benfits to the player just flying though the system or buying items it would also give three cpus of that area however there are downsides first one node dies bye jita also programming this would mean changes to how the current nodes work would bring bugs ccp have a great programming team but they are human and they will make mistakes it however is a limited fix even with this in place it would slowing become a lag fest again to stop this maybe a limit on how much you can have in a hanger at one time i feel ten level 5 freighters of space at one time the limit has to be linked to the amount you have on the market to stop out of date market orders creating overfill
alternatively fix jita lag the same way station office hoarding was fixed look at introducing a system whereby it becomes more expensive to post sell and buy orders in popular stations the more sell and buy orders in a particular station the higher the penalty tariff on orders eventually the free market system will balance itself out and itll become less profitable to trade from jita when other alternative hubs have lower penalty tariffs lazy buyerssellers can pay a premium if they choose enterprising traders and salesmen can establish other smaller hubs eventually jita trade diminishes because if it doesnt the tariff on buying and selling keeps rising month by month just a rough idea but it would eventually work  concept is that you fix lag by better distributing the player base
did you mean infiniband really fast connection between serversthat would help if that isthe bottleneck if it is the cpu or disk io then it helps nothing i am afraidif transactions are the problem then this is database traffic  in which case i would assume the problem to be cpu andor disk io sidedhowever unfortunately i was not beeing offered a job as ccpit service engineer so i shut up herei think though that lag has many facettes and i classify slow transactions in jita less critical than personal losses of subcapital and capital ships in fleet fights due to inabliitiy to actreactrespondwe seem to see the trade hub lag which may be due to transactions we also see module lag introduced by the latest series of patches according to my own experiencewhere a commander would wait for minutes until a pressed button would start to have an effectand then we see grid load delaysand delays due to having more than a few pilots jumping into a system or into a gridthe problem is everywhere and jita  is against popular belief not the reason pall named lag types can be explained with the load of database tablesthe more objects hangar items things in space etc plus change of the object attributestransactions positionchanges session changesthe more the back end side cpu  io is loaded  well i guess another topic is theclientside performancewhen i was on a fanfest 2 years ago they announced the graphix expansion we just started to enjoy they said due to the new techniques of texture mapping use of shaders and whatnot  the load on the client cpu would rather drop than increaseone thing as your rep would be to ask them why they lied
no the issue is cpu
that probably isnt the main bottleneck most of the lag in eve iirc is created by the way that eve sends data to the client which is to say it sends one big packet instead of lots of small packetsthis means that when you jump into a big gate camp you dont get incremental load you get it all at once and that load is going to come in the form of a 510mb packet now if your machine cant handle that 510mb packet or it gets lost or damaged you crash dont update and the server has to send the 510mb packet againthere is a lot of gain that can be had by changing the network structure and i am sure ccp is working on fixing it
ill tell you a little story about another mmo i was in the early beta of this mmo and no it wasnt wow it is older then wow and eve for that matterthere was an issue massive combat on a continent every continent was its own server what was interesting is at 350 people the lag started then at 375 it started to desync at 400 people lag made it unplayable and youd randomly disconnectwhat is interesting about this is these exact same numbers of people on a nod in eve it starts the same thing now this other games hardware would have been 78 years old today and we all know how much hardware advancement have been made in 78 years however i still believe there is an underlaying hardware limit a limit that seems to start getting hit at 350 peopleno matter how many network controllers or type of network was available this appears to be the magical limitnow jita itself can handle 500600 people ive been in there with 600 people however a lone system in 00 space cant handle above 300 it starts to lag out etcalthough im not a candidate i believe the only change to make jita and lag disappear in general is to change mechanics that force people to use the game differently can be as simple as setting limits on orders at stations we all know jita has lots of people because everything is there if the market was changed in a way that people would only buysell in jita for a cost youd start to see radical changesimagine buy and sell orders with broker and taxes directly related to the amount of traffic a system has very much like how much office rental is calculatedyoud instantly see a massive change to how jita works systems surrounding jita would get more buy and sell order 001 isk price changes would no longer cost you 100 isk but could cost you 50000 isk etca small change like that would do radically change the idea of market hubs youd think it was a new gameedit i should point out this would only effect changes to market hubs like jita and not effect 00 pvp or fleet ops
its not hard to notice that some of the candidates are not overly fond of each other in game and on the forums my question is how do you plan on dealing with another csm member that proposes ideas and sugestions that you oppose when you are a memberbe nice be specific give an example of how you have dealt with this both in rl and in forums
just because you dont like them as a player it doesnt mean you cant work with thembut also remember that just because a discussion can get a bit nasty on the forums people often change once its over voice communcation or even in real lifebut personally i dont think its gonna be a problem at all i have talked to a handful of candidates on ventrilo they are all nice people
agreed that its usually easier in person but with the passion that most of the candidates show for the game someone with an opposing view to what you enjoy could cause problems
i guess one could pick up zools noticethe csms have to devide csm work and business from game playforeground is the work on received inputs from the community not to fight out personal belongings from game play imho its a need that csms do this divisionthereby csms have to remain reticent a diplomatic and constructive debate has to be the fundament on effective and successful work
in theory yesbut i think that different perspectives rather cause interesting discussions which leads to a better solution while it might create a heated debatewill happen probably it doesnt mean we dont like each otherwhile i might agree with some of what x says i can still think x is a nice person
i believe once people met in person in game rivalities will step into the backgroundi have not seen any form of council in any part of the world where all would just have friends and hug each other nonstopdebates are bound to happen and probably also needed and ccp is about to offloadthis hard work to slave erm csms but i think most of us are grown ups and as such able to focus on a topicfrom a rl angle which is hopefully not just a direct a mirror of the icig angle
all the people on the csm vent  csm halls channel a few days back sounded like friendly mature people i could work withand as a neutral in game i dont have issues with them in there either well except for the one that hired the trolls and assassins
there is an eve ventcould someone be so kind as to pm me the details or even better post them here for everyone to use thank youanywayi would consider it very selfish if people disagreed strongly on a subject the person should be smart enough to look into the idea and see it the way they see it and possibly say yes your suggestion is better because or a polite i still dont see the advantage of your viewof course i am not saying there will be no disagreement but im just suggesting that every point be conisdered and to be looked at though the eyes of others
ultimately im sure people will be reasonable at the weekend we had a pretty good discussion with a group of csm candidates at the event run by revan neferis i hosted voice discussions on the sf vent for a bit too i think everyone there found it a pleasant experience and there was no childish nonsense some things we agreed on some things we disagreed on but handling debate in a mature and respectful fashion without personal pettiness is the decent optioncsm is a democratic body its down to 5 votes of 9 if elected ill do my level best to advocate and persuade on behalf of ideas and issues i support but if i lose a vote in council i lose the vote  its time to move on this kind of representative body has no use for people who endlessly harp on about discussions and arguments theyve been outvoted on and its important that the player electorate of eve do their best to select a panel of nine representatives who are able to work as part of a team and realize that debate and persuasion and not haranguing and arrogant superiority complex is the route to a successful inaugural csm bodylook for candidates open to suggestion look for candidates able to smile and laugh at themselves occasionallysense of humour is absolutely neccessary if were going to be couped up with crazy eve players for 5 days
thereby i accompany nickaelhoop
no there isntbut i think i will go and rent a 30 slot ventrilo server and have csm people come on there and let people join and ask them questions brb
good idea i guess i cant follow as quick as others do as im not native english but ill do my very best otherwise just imagine this german freak as oneearlistener matchable with a twofingerwriter 
thats ok pi found a host for a teamspeak server as i was unable to get my hands on a ventrilo serveri will create a new post about the server once its up and running
not looking for anecdotal stories or specificswhat degree of social interaction should be supported in the game what balance of pvp and pve content should eve have what scope levels should eve have where in the mmo market do you see eve now and in the futurethat kind of thingedit edit2 ok completely took my sig out now no bias 
imho as much as possible i guess well see what this social interaction really might be when walk on station comes upmoreover one has to write a dissertation on that and even this would not be an adequate answeri think this shouldnt be a question for candidates and those who are currently interested in this politic during the hustings one should think about a general surveyid like to read a more specified question than this oneperhaps i dont get it again 
sorry for being vague again p scope creep
so as far as i see your point of interest id like to know to what extent ccp has project groups on already mentioned problems lags clusterbuilding and servers compared to the efforts they place to upcoming novelties e g walk on stationcurrently id like to see more efforts on already mentioned probs than inventing sth totally new
the introduction of eve voice has made the social side of the game slightly better as you can talk much faster than you can type the introduction of being able to walk about stations and planets i think it is in the works edit would add an element of play that would attract different people who orginally thought the game was all about spaceshipsthe balance between pvp and pve is entirely up to the player in question obviously i would love to see a figure around 50 for each but it will change a substantial amounti see eve up in the top 3 mmos and hopefully 1st in the future as it is an excellent game indeed
just as rl politicians have the same problem populist policies are not always necessarily the best way forward either for the majority or for the long term shape of the gamehow will csm candidated deal with this balance or will they purposely play devils advocate so devs can feed back why they arent doing what the player base wantsedit this question goes out to candidates and the player base
i think time will show whether the accomplished campaigns  populist policies and the persons or in some cases groups will take the disired effect on eve the community would like to seei dont get the meaning of the second paragraph
i mean i havent poured over the documentation about exactly what csm candidates actually do and i think itll be the same for most peopledo people think the csm candidates should be more mouthpiece of the people the representative of the people negotiator on behalf of the people a conduit for devplayer base interactions some sort of arbitrator  middleman
my appreciation of a csmmember is as i already mentioneda candidate has to be a person who might be able to stand in front of the community as a direct organ for the community facing problems with ccp and the invented council without nodding off trying to find diplomatic solutions and who feels himherself responsible till the end for the communitys concerningadditional to thati dont understand it that way that every individual stated petition will be discussed in this csm it has to be the csmmembers job to find a generalized and preferably generally accepted topic which takes place in ccpcsm debatesnevertheless i see the future work of the csm as a continuousfloating process of information flow und actual share to the games development whereby my point of view on nodding off results in this connection the csm and its work needs to be transparent 100
the prime example of a mindlessly popularist policy in this election campaign is reducing lag everyone hates it ccp has been trying to reduce it for years and isnt about to change its priorities because xyz motions are made deploring lag even more there are gameplay alterations that could be made to address and minimize the incidence of lag in key areas sure  like providing disincentive to dogpile reinforcement battles for example but simply standing on a platform of vote for me and ill reduce lag is the epitome of a bland popularism akin to promising tax cuts with no detail or examination of exactly where the money is going to come from rl politicians know that tax cuts get votes because voters are naivelets hope the eve electorate is a little more sophisticated than that
reffering to
manifesto pledges and campaigning on knee jerk popularism
thank you for nothing  i just asked you to whom you are refferuing to
im not going to be drawn on specific criticism of other candidates demos this election is about the big issues and which of us can best represent the eve public on the csm council there is no role for petty backbiting on the campaign trail when we might be sitting together in council in a month depending on the election results
i agree good answer nevertheless i guess youll discuss this with other candidates than me regarding the general thinking of basic needs
edit oops
well this is a good questionim yet to see anybody taking a real stance like i did on the economics of eve if i were to vote based on that i would vote abstainbut pvp wise jade
id probably vote for jade and i agree with hardin verone would have been also a serious target for my votesome candidates i simply dont know despite my age my personal minimum requirements for a canidate isa ability do keep in game events and rl stuff divided example youll see no for matar quotes from me in my campaign or csm related postsalthough i use to be an matari roleplayer b ability to realize at any time that one is just a councillor not a ruler  just the extended arm of the player base not for own ego in council not for own alliance not for own race not for the veterans not for the rookies not for a specific nationfor the entire player base a candidate needs to beusually if honesty and ability meets  there is a candidatethis can be figured out by forum posts sometimes from campaign statements too if one can filter the marketing
id vote for the previous poster zoolkhanreasondifferentiated involvement on csmelements constructive cogitations and advanced aged experience of life which for me would be helpfull to reach a consensus on work of csm with and for the community

ah good times i seem to recall that fight lasted several minutes with multiple warp insouts in order to achieve an ew advantage is till credit your victory to your better skills and thus faster lock time but prehaps that is just me being ussual arrogant self prehaps a rematch is in order anyway back on topic that clears a few matters up however i still see problems arising first and foremost it would discourage pvp corps from recruiting rookies again this is another way of discouraging young players from throwing caution to the wind and getting stuck in to the wonderful world of pvp why would a mercenary corp take the time to train some young blood when he will inevitably tarnish their record with foolish errors while at the moment such losses do little to tarnish a mercenaries corps rep as kills are what the contracter is generally interested in as soon as you begin to introduce statistics such as efficiency the loss of a few t1 fit rifters can mean the difference in getting the job or being shunned as noobs or are you suggesting that the value of losses etc is taken into account were that the case i must question what sort of time commitment such a system would require to implement and whether there are not more pressing matters to attend tosecondly newer corporations or indeed older ones that are just moving in to pvp would be just as open to this bad smell during their initial pvp adventures this would encourage the reforming of corps in order to obtain clean slates something that i think you will agree would take away from the game experience when i consider my character i think of more than just my attributes kehmor has fought in countless wars ruthlessly murdered and scammed he has worked as a mercenary and now in a strange twist of fate finds himself as a pirate hunter i wouldnt trade the avatar for one with twice the skill pointsnow consider corporations when i was a director in blood inquisition i felt a great reluctance to abandon something i had worked hard for now in pak i again feel part of a collective and even another corporation with the same members and a similar name would not be the same thing we have history old grudges and allies that creep back into existence when one least expects it any system that encouraged corporations to abandon their home in order for nice stats would take away from the feeling of meaning and significance that this game provides i am fortunate enough to be flying with a group of ace pilots who can proudly boast their killloss ratios however consider the two year old industrial corporation that decides to move in to the realm of pvp they suffer the ussual newbie losses we all went through in our early days of combat and are left with what a two year legacy tarnished in an instant by a game mechanic unable to recruit and quickly losing members what option do they have but to reroll their corporation and lose the history that came with italthough fully specced in caldari i find i only really enjoy flying the falcon my love of big numbers has seen me convert to gallente gank boats ironic considering my rp roots anyway running out of characters and cba to make two postsregardskehmor
ah seems i was too hasty and should have taken time to read your response properly thus a second post is required afterallfortunately i considered this response before making my initial post and have my next annoyingly petty reply ready and waiting any optional system would not really be optional there is a certain corp pride felt by every member of every corp in eve excluding the corp robbers and freeloaders there would be an undeniable internal pressure for any semiestablished corporation to make use of such a feature any who didnt would again instantly be classified as noobs as it would be assumed they had something to hide so once they have activated this option what then well it is as i said before they restrict recruitment introduce overly paranoid pvp guidelines and generally aid the ever declining state of pvp in evenow this interests me but i fail to see how such a thing could be implemented fairly who is to say that an industrial corp has lost a war simply because they have lost some ships it could have been their most profitable week for the last year merely because they chose not to actively fight and instead continue with their industrial endeavours would both sides have to agree on a deciding factor this seems unlikely to work in many caseson to rewards what do i get for winning a war isk loot sure but from where the losing side prehaps again we encounter issues of what is a fair way of determining that my corporation has won how about external isk or lp is introduced so i make an alt corp and beat it rutlessly into the ground in exchange for the cash how about reputation a big gold star in paks corp info awesome again whats to stop me recycling alt corps in order to aid me in this quest for statusrereading your many posts i also noticed you mentioned a penalty for failing to achieve war goals this does sound nice on paper but certain fundemental mechanics make it impossible to introduce i dont know what you feel these war goals should be but say for example it was to kill the enemy ceo we are at war for a month and it turns out this chap has died in real life what now we are expected to tarnish our record because somewhere in the world a pasty fat nerd ate his last slice of reheated pizza and had a heart attack or say it is to achieve 100 kills within a week the corp we are at war with after losing 99 ships in a day decide it would be best to jump ship and form a new corp until we get bored or indeed consume our very own fatal slice of dominosanyway my last thoughts on the matter for now it just seems to me that this one idea was thrown in there for the sake of attracting a few votes something your campaign has thus far avoided hope you prove me wrongregardskehmor
1 capital fleets logging off when in combat disappearing in 15 minutes2 battleships logging off at jump in and disappearing in 60sis that an issue
ok here is my ideasov 1 is gained by having more pos in a system than anyone else as currentsov 2 and 3 is gained by placing lots of small anchorable structures around a system these serve the npc population of a system basically the schools and hospitals and power stations the infrastructureinsurgents or small gangs can hit these small soft targets if they do it for long enough sov starts dropping if a system is well managed and defended sov starts risingif you just whack a pos somewhere out in deep 00 and just refuel it once a month you dont automatically get sov levels and all the associated shiny toysadvantages no sov steps sov is sliding scale therefore small and medium sized attackers have an effect relative to the time and effort and size of force they put in industrialists have something to do in 00 beyond fuel pos and make guns for pvpers now they can create their own little empires extra effort needed to build sov levels means 00 entities have to concentrate into smaller areas thus allowing for new groups more chance to come in and colonise the vast swaythes of 00 currently claimed by alliances but not really used sov level is relative to the isk time skill in managing and general effort put in rather than just some low constant of effort plus time as it is atmconstants big alliances can still drop in from on high and destroy pos with mega blobs defenders however have the extra option to burn the small target infrastructure behind them as they retreatdisadvantages still need caps to take down pos still get camping at gates raiders still need to get into a system outposts still an issue if left indestructable isk sinks  inflation there is still too little isk being lost by pvpers with result of the real terms value lost from ship destruction fallingim also a big fan of tactical environments and i think they can help remove some of the bland sameness of space just for aesthetic reasons more than anything as well as make pvp more interestingin conclusion pvp in 00 can be made more dynamic and interesting with the above suggestion without actually nerfing cyno jammers or having destructable outposts the issue of outposts which is highly contentious i feel is part of a wider debate of which dynamism in 00 pvp is just one aspect others being isk sinksinflation declining real terms value from pvp losses and reasons jade cites about untouchable assets and trend of 00 filling up with them all of which along with pvp are interconnected
well kehmor the thing about kill records and mercs not wanting to recruit new players  im going to disagree about what makes a successful combat corporationalliance there sure you can massage the stats and play with nothing but uber high skillpoint pvp pros to protect your record but the reality of eve is that people burnout they take breaks they get on with their lives they come and go and have variable playtimes available stats are one thing but having an active and enthusiastic corporate environment is something else and far more useful in the long term in star fraction for example we recruit relatively new players 23 months in game we put a premium on personality and select applicants we actually want to be spending time with in the short term sure this means our killboard stats are not as good as the burn edens and tri uber pvp corps out there we sit on around 70 success rate overall and its good but not that good but it means we are continually replacing numbers and keeping the movement strong and active thats the long term view on playing eve and its noticeable that jf is still around and going strong after nearly five years while any number of statsloving elites are gone to dust and emo selfdestruction point is kill numbers are not everything to your question specifically maybe the merc corp sucks this up and makes it part of the pr appeal promises activity and enthusiasm and devilmaycare hilarity rather than yawntastic cloakedraven bombardment and near 100 efficiencyin terms of the mercstatscontract efficiency id say yes by all means incorporate things like damage caused kills per day activity levels things like this  its up to the merc corp to decide which aspects of its appeal it wants to promote re the bad smell  rerolling corps to lose early records  how about you can reset any time you like pretty much the clients will be able to see when your records date from so if youve reset 3 months ago youll be a relatively new but b will have a clean record to begin from again remember this is at the corpalliance pr level its not about your character specifically and being called on your entire eve recordif an industrial corp decided to change its focus and rebrand itself as a mercenary outfit after 3 years of being uber miners in maut then its not unreasonable for those guys to publicise their results post the transition and begin their new pr history on combat engagements from the moment they choose the mercenary specializationre the peer pressure about public engagement stats well first im saying this is an option specifically for corpsalliance that would appear on an ingame hiring roster of mercenaries  and would specifically track accomplishments over accepted contracts random kills and nbsi wouldnt be relevant just results in contracted mercenary wars and secondly with regard to the general shame at not having killboards etc not everyone in eve at the moment has a public killboard some corps opt to keep their stuff private and that doesnt make them worse or less effective pvpers anybody judging xyz corp entity in eve on appearances alone is likely to be badly surprised sometimeson the warmechanics heres the basic concept you declare war the evesystem then tracks the results in this war tonnageav market value of shipsequipment blown up being the basic measure if the overall exchange damage is  75 or  25 after 2 weeks say the maximum default period then the system is going to trigger a war end condition with either a win or lose for the attackerdefender if the numbers are somewhere in between war can continue
basically if we wardec random fat territorialist supply corp and shoot down 20 haulers for no losses in week1 and 15 haulers in week2 with no losses then the war is ending with a win for us at the beginning of week3 we get a victory boon  x of the target tax rate delivered to our corp wallet for exampleif the fat territorialists actually brought some fighters to oppose us and the results were we shot down 20 haulers and they downed a couple of battleships and the overall numbers remained between 2575 efficiency the war continues and we have the option of continuing the pay the war bill  if we dont and the war finishes in the middle zone its a draw no result whereas if they took it really seriously and hunted us like dogs and reduced our efficiency to 25 wed suffer a loss and involuntary penalty with the war cancelled some kind of automatic warreparations payout added to our alliancecorp bills id see mercenaries fit into this equation by letting them be bought into somebody elses wardec and join their statistics to the allied force in order to proactively prevent the conflict ending with the whitewash win for the attacker  hence again the importance of the performance tracking for registered mercenary corps  so the defender can have an idea of exactly what they are buyingits a very rough idea but it illustrates some thinking of where the wardec system should be going in my opinion csm candidates have been asked questions about the wardec system are wardecs too expensive what do we think about griefing wardecs  should bigger alliances cost more etc etc we do need an answer on these issues and in my opinion the introduction of actual goals and penaltyreward calculations for sanctioned wardecs could add a useful balance and very interesting possibility for the future of the gameits not so much about chasing votes kehmor as in just thinking about problems that have been raised if somebody asks me my opinion are wardec fees too extensive at the moment im obligated to think seriously about the answer and consider the bigpicture pertaining to general conflict dynamism in eve i mean you can say yes and advocate making them cheap but then everywannabe empire ganker and his little dog too will wardec everybody with a freighter for ongoing free jita ganks you can say no or even make them more expensive and then you price younger pvpers and warcorps out of the equation and force them to do their fighting out of hisec the true answer is that the system is too crude at the moment and could be something far more nuanced exciting challenge of csm eve electorate ccp development team in concert is to express precisely what that something should be and agree its shape and rollout
okay then spoon first thing i have to say is that while my gut feeling remains that even sovereignty 1 from pos is wrong i do think the idea of general attackable infrastructure items away from the pos guns and thereby valid targets for raiding and conflict has some merit that though said though why not just make it about planets make sovereignty about putting orbital facilities headquarters administrative hubs propaganda centres and such in the orbits above planets and have the actual sovereignty of a system determined by the collective loyalty of the planetary population let both sides influence this by blowing upestablishing orbital facilities and dropping trade goods and equipment down to the planetary population luxuries and flash grav vehicles to bribe them guns and bombs and nerve gas to increase instability make the business of sovereignty about blockade running interdiction and generally influencing the simulated politics in the systemthats all a bit blue sky and planetary environmenttastic but it would be a way of simulating sovereignty without posand thats a key point i keep coming back too spoonthumb i think sovereignty from pos is the greatest single problem that links all other 00 problems with dynamism they are blobmakers they are the things you have to hit if you want to cause lasting damage and conquest or nullify conquest and the nature of the things makes warfare boring and blobtastic hard to shoot down impossible to destroy in one sitting reinforcement timer means you have no initiative and will have to fight the collective warblob of the defenders and every other nap member in order to destroy it its a concept that hugely damages the warsimulation in 00 the whole reinforcement timer paradigm has had a terrible effect and these are the real underlying issuesnow i like some of your bullets the sliding scale is good its nice for industrialists to have something to build its good to have intermediate objectives for smallmedium gangs to hit but without actually dealing with the problem of pos being the sovereignty claimers at core youd still have to destroy  outspam all pos in an outpost system to take the outpost you havent really dealt with the core issuere tactical environments  definitely i love the concept and it would really help differentiate terrain and engagement variety callais made a really good post on the subject in my removing local  discussion thread herein conclusion while there are good ideas there spoonthumb i still think you havent tackled the basic problem of possovereignty role in 00 wars these things are a strong disincentive to a dynamic environment  they promote forced alarmclock blobbing and a twospeed culture in 00 capseverything else as a concept they just dont work ultimately having a nuanced system for increased sovereignty levels is a pretty good idea but if the foundation level is still about pos spamming you have the same old problem for the attacker in that theyve got to destroy or outspam the enemy pos network to attack the outposts
are you going to answer my questions or ignore me like you do anytime someone blows on your house of cards
youre pulling my heartstrings jade 1 vote
thank you very much for your endorsement its very gratifying to see people taking a deep interest in these issues and looking at the big picture for the future of the game i think its why it was very important to express the whole scope of opinions and general candidate understanding of current gameplay issues the eve electorate really needs to know who its voting for and to have faith and confidence in the vision passion and general fellowgamer insight into these concerns on the csm
1 becomes an issue with uber tanks that can shrug off damage for 15 minutes definitely i know full well that expensivelyfitted amarrian carriers and motherships can pretty much achieve this with triageuber bonuses and simply disappear if things look dodgy much more a potential problem in the small gangpiratinglowsec hotdrop environment too because likely enemies just dont have a dps on hand to kill them in the time limit longer aggression timers on bigger ship hulls maybe 30mins for cap ships its annoying i understand that you might have to spend a bit longer cloaked on disengage before you can log off a capital ship but might be a price worth paying to counter logoffski in fleet combats and skirmishes 2 is just rubbish really it shouldnt happen i guess one fix might be counting bubbles as aggression against an incoming ship even while cloaked so that its impossible to simply do the log off and disappear in 60 secs trick i can imagine that being a tricky programming issue though so im very open to suggestions on this but the principle is clear i think its a nasty little cheatmarginal exploit to do the logoff at jumpin while cloaked and subvert the aggression timerto which on this general subject ill add another peeve based on timers and thats the deaggressionredock timer heres the thing weve been through multiple iterations of ship hitpoint boasts and buffs ships today are 23 times harder to kill than they were a few years ago but redockjump timers are the same as they ever were this means that aggressiondockundock games are more common and powerful than they should be and realistically this is a very easy fix and something id definitely like to see dealt with when 00 fighting becomes about dockundock games with fat tanked ships leaving the bay shooting off some rounds and then deagressing to dock again seconds after there is a problem it encourages overwhelming forcehotdrops as only way of killing in time and is a blob attractor as a result cheesy tactics like these need clear fixes and its not unreasonable to increase the dockjump timers in line with the hit point buffs that all ships have received in my opinion
pos arent broken sov mechanics are pos serve two functions atm claiming a system and boosting sov level you need to decouple claiming sov from sov levels pos make sense as the method for claiming a new system is needed for the levelling which is what i proposedwhy not do this with planetary interaction because you can have both planetary interaction is a soontm id rather not wait a year and a half to see sov mechanics get changed just so they can fit neatly in with planetary interactionin fact the sov system should be changed first so that when planetary interaction comes it slots in perfectly and feels like a mere extension of an existing system rather than something imposed on topto elaboratesliding scale sov should not have set levels instead you have sov points like cuture points in civ 4 anchoring more pos in a system than a rival is equivalent to capturing a city in civ 4 it shows on the map as yours and resets the culture points to zero if the city has temples and libraries you gain control of them and start gaining culture points from them if the enemy in their retreat however burned the temples and libraries you have to rebuild them which takes time and you get no points in the meantimeas you go past certain set levels of culture points you get more squares of land around your city and less angry citizens or whateverin eve this translates into the small and medium sized targets being the schools and hospitals that gain you sov points pos would not get you any points alone you dont magically get fuel bonuses from out of nowhere after a set length of time like atminstead for each sov point you get it knocks some amount off the cost of fuel for starbases because the local population who run your pos and man your reactors are healthier and better educatedequally you can anchor a flat pack cyno jammer any time you want but to attract the specialists who are qualified to run it you need to have a certain quality of life in your system for its inhabitance this level is represented by 4000 sov points or whateveredit this fits in with the complaint that sov is artificial and why should you suddenly be able to magically anchor something that you couldnt yesterday when nothing has changed except a number in some concord databasewhat im really saying is that small corps and alliances should not be able to take sov from big ones but they can make that sov meaningless
thank you proxay and i love the image too much appreciated
o my votes are in for hardin tbh
thanks verone  your endorsement is appreciated regarding kelsins questions i find it quite amusing that you need to know all this information when its quite clear that you are operating as jades chief cheerleader  if not her unofficial campaign manager is there a realistic possibility that my answers will convince you to vote for me or are you just trying to make me say something stupid which you can jump up and down on and go nah na na na nah hardin is an idiot you first asked me which issues i was interested in  i gave you a list  were you happy no  now you want specifics  but specifics on carefully selected topics will you be happy with those  probably not nevertheless i will rise to the baitroleplay enhancing i would like ccp to take roleplay more seriously i know that many knock roleplay in eve but the backstory and history is of interest to large groups of players probably more than we think i would like to see an eve which is more dynamic in relation to roleplay where the old established empires react respond and interact with players and player empires more than they currently doi would like to see more recognition given to pod pilot politics in the shape of empire reactions to the initiatives of both individual pod pilots corporations and alliances  although this is an area in which ccp has already improved massively of late and this is an area in which ccp has to tread carefully to avoid claims of biasi would like to see ccp endorse and support efforts such as eve front  which will give players the opportunity to contribute to the history and immersion of this gameand of course i would like storylines to progress a little faster and more logically hell the amarr empire has been without an emperor for the past year with little to no ic justification it is not good enoughi will also be interested in seeing the details of factional warfare and ensuring that this is something that adds to the roleplay of eve rather than detracts from it
pos warfare improving i think pretty much everyone agrees that possov warfare as it stands needs to be reformed the question is improving it whilst maintaining balancei do believe defenders should have the advantage to reflect their entrenched state and their initial and ongoing investment both in isk and time in defensive structures i dont think cynojammers are the problem unless a defender is tipped off or the attacker extremely incompetent the initial strike to down a cynojammer which takes place at a time and place of the attackers choosing is relatively straightforward and painlessattackers then have the option of leaving those caps in the system until needed in the event that the attacker does withdraw caps from the system and doesnt interdict the system allowing the defender to regroup and repaironline cynojammers and jumpbridges then the attacker is asking for troublenevertheless i do think it is excessive that after reonlining the cynojammer the defender can then move as many assets into the system as it wants using the mechanic of jump bridges the ability for defenders to uuse jump bridges to jump in multiple super caps and caps to defend a cynojammer either via doomsdays or remote rep when an attacker can only use conventionals assuming the attacker didnt leave their cap fleet in the system after the initial attack is imho unbalanced towards the defendermy suggestion would be that any jumpbridges put out of action by the attacker in the initial assault cannot be reactivated while there are poses in reinforced in the system similarly new jumpbridges cannot be installed and activated while there are reinforced poses in a system in this way if defenders wanted to move caps into a system to defend their cynojammerposes would have to open a window in their cynojamming protection which the alertorganised attacker could also take advantage of it also means that the defender will may need to fight to get its conventional defence fleet into the system rather than simply bypassing the attackers fleets by using jumpbridgesi am open to other ideas on this subject  but will not support any idea which pushes the balance too far in favour of either side while siege warfare is tough for the attacker you just have to look at bobs recovery in querious and period basis to see how large well organised attackers can quickly capture space  particularly if the defender is not properly dedicated and motivated pos maintenance simplifying one of the main objections i have to making it easier for attackers to kill poses is the amount of effort that pos owners need to go to to keep the buggers online pos maintenance as most people acknowledge is not much fun and needlessly soif the process of maintaining and refueling pos structures was simplified and made less demanding then i would certainly look more agreeably on proposals to make their destruction more fun too however as it stands i see people investing significant amounts of isk and time in maintaining pos networks with the exception being those lucky few who have the right moon materials and believe this should be reflected in the effort that attackers have to go to to remove themi believe ccp already has some work in progress in this area and look forward to finding out more
00 developing one of the main reasons i was attracted to eve in the first place was the ability for players to build empires and civilisations in 00 empires shaped and molded by us as players and based upon our own ideologies and philosophies  something unique to eve as a single server game over time ccp have released tools which have allowed alliances to start to develop an infrastructure in 00 to actually build real and solid thingssince that happened we have seen a fragmentation of alliances there are more space holding alliances in eve now than at any time in its history and this adds to the flavour and depth of eve politics which can only be a good thing because inevitably it leads to friction and conflict yet despite the tools sov holders have been given we still see the majority of eve pilots based in empire why the easy answer is that they are all carebears  but the reality is that the infrastructure and economy of most 00 regions and even lowsec regions still does not offer the economic incentives to outweigh the risk of relocating to 00  nor does the nbsi attitude an understandable attitude in view of current game mechanics favoured by the majority of 00 alliancesi therefore believe that sov holders should be given further options with which to develop their space and stimulate their economies one suggestion  which i have seen proposed  is the introduction of agents to outposts with sov holding alliances able to pay agents the cost would depend on the level of the agent to relocate to their stations and thus provide another incentive for people to move to 00 of course the sov holding alliance benefits from the docking fees and general economic activity stimulated by this  while the pvpers raiding their space benefit from additional targets without having to worry about their ty sec statusof course that particular idea may prove unworkable purely from a technical standpoint i am not a dev but i would welcome tools which actually encourage alliances to realistically consider policies beyond the simplistic its not blue  shoot it approach and to actually think about the development of their economies beyond ratting mining and moon mining this is something which will enhance the game long term as it will help populate 00 increasing pvp opportunities for us all i enjoy the depth of eve the depth in history the depth of ideologies the depth of its economy the depth of playstyles the depth in tactics the depth of personalities and the depth in politics but am worried that some want to remove this depth and turn 00 into counterstrike in space i have made it clear in my blog and above that i do have a bias in how i view this game my in game experiences shape these views this is precisely why i believe i and other csm members should not be pushing specific policies and agendas at this stage should the electorate have a reasonable idea about our general game philosophy and the type of characters we are  yes they should but we are being elected to a team a team which will look at all these ideas and issue and then hopefully come to educated and informed decisions which are in the best interests of the game if the csm ends up being full of people who are standing to promote specific agendas  with no willingness to compromise and look beyond their own interests  then i am not very hopeful as to how this is going to turn outfortunately i believe the majority of candidates  candidates such as omber zombie serenity steele guomindong zoolkhan and bane glorious to name just a few  do have the best interests of the game at heart and i hope i get the chance to work with them
hardin is a good guy hope i get to see him in iceland
just wanted to post my supportyou have my vote well you had my vote even before benilopax twised my arm hehe good luck mate
posting here to show myour supporthave had many long talks with lavista in vent he has experienced pretty much everything imaginable in eve from pvp 00 and empire to industry as well as a complete understanding on the economic side of thingshe is an intelligent and rational guy who doesnt mind looking at problems from every aspect i dont think youll find a better csm candidate out there good luck lavista hopefully if you get elected youll still have plenty of time for some pew pewgeneral spazceominmatar mafia
ill be voting for this homeboy because hes not zealously for or against any one issue it means his stances are moderate nonextreme and not too crazy unlike some others 
ill ask you the same question i have asked of similar candidates specifically those who seem to feel it unnecessary to tell the players anything about your own ideas and opinionswhat would you say to those of us who believe that a candidates individual opinions give valuable and necessary insight into their thought process as a csm representative you will be required to make choices and decisions on various issues and then vote according to your decision the players deserve some indication on which way you will lean when faced with these situations which will be a regular part of your duties as a representative not stating an opinion makes it appear as though you either have something to hide or you are completely uninformed about the current issues in game or you are just plain indecisive none of these are very attractive characteristics for a representativeyour own thoughts and ideas will form an important part of how you weigh arguments and make decisions why do you not feel it important for your potential voters to know these ideas
i fully agree with this i have discussed it with jade on a few occassions and i think its damn importanti think while individual opinion is important its also important for people to understand why you think so so im trying to take a stance of not just state my opinion but also create awareness of why the issues happen in the first place how it manifests and makes a difference for people and why they should care and how to eventually fix itthat is how i went about writing my first article about the state of the economy and i have been going hard at providing these kind of conversations on the forums as well i think there is so much fud on the forum that i have been thinking about creating a faq for those kinds of things we keep comming to the same conclusions every time someone asks the same question so why not get over with it and make a nice thread which discusses all the issues why they happen and how to maybe fix themthose would be ideas ccp should have a say too as for how they would prefer things in order to make it possible in terms of mechanicsedit rereading your post again you make it sound like i dont take stances on issues and that im just the voice of the community who has no interest it couldnt be further from the truth im heavily biased if you are to believe some
ok people let me introduce myself to youi am a 33 year old engineer living in munich germany i enjoy crunching numbers in games just as much as irl which is quite helpful in the kind of games i favor strategymanagementi started playing eve in august 2005 and my main occupation ever since then had been running missions in highsec lowsec and recently also 00 since my other primary passion besides killing evil people involves the pimping of ships my main focus regarding missions has always been on empire though i also delve into trading occasionally as that is where the really big bucks are made but i tend to find it too boring to occupy me for extended periods of time mining well i did it for maybe a week once in my first month of play never again since then just not my cup of teaas far as killing people goes i am a good guy i guess as in i take great pleasure in dead pirates but could never get myself to shoot neutrals in lowsec out in 00 though i am a firm believer in nbsi even while i consider that same doctrine in lowsec to be simple piracy and thus fight it there if i canand even though i have been in player corporations for pretty much my entire evelife i believe the ability to also achieve things solo is of utmost importance to the success of eve as a gameabout my agendaseeing how i am such a mission  at heart my primary agenda would be to counter the move all l4s to lowesec people that we will undoubtedly get on the council as far as balance is concerned with missions i would fight for the status quo as i see it working out quite okay the way it is atm no need to make it any worse by moving them to lowsec or nuking bounties but neither any need to boost them by increasing bounties or improving loot quality loot composition on the other hand definitely needs to be fixed frigate abs from bs wrecks always irk me lowsec itself and also the low end 00 do need a boost imho but this must not come at the expense of highsec dwellersas far as piracy goes i realize that we need pirates to keep the game exciting but we also need some limits for them to keep them from spoiling the game too much for the more peaceful folks so while i sometimes endorse boosts even for what is my chosen enemy they must not always have their way moderation is the clueonly if you are a suicide ganker logontrapper gang invite sploiter or any other such lowlife you definitely do not want me on the council as i am vehemently opposed to such cheesy tactics that will yield maximum rewards for minimal risks at the expense of unsuspecting playersmoving on towards ships and modules which i consider my primary area of expertise you will get total balance out of me i never specialized in any races ships which means i can and do fly almost every subcapital ship and use all modules to good effect meaning i have no personal agenda to further my race over the others simply because there is no my race instead i strive to achieve my idea of balance which basically is described by different but equally capableas far as pvp mechanics go i am a small gang fellow with very little care for long range fleet fights or pos sieges i am quite opposed to the current nano trend at least for cruisers and above in my book the line between big and small ships is drawn below cruisers so frigs and dessies should be able to nano themselves to their hearts content and the speedtank should be a viable defense for them for cruisers and above though and that includes the vagabond i dont mind them going fast if they are made for that but them using that speed as actual tank should not work anymore
also like i already said the solo play aspects of eve need to be defended there are lots of people out there saying that we could play x3 or something if we want to solo i think this is dead wrong even if in both games everything is just bits and bytes in some computer the bits and bytes on the eve server are so much more real and you do not have to fight with or against other players to interact almost every item you buy or sell is interacting with one or even more than one player something that cannot be said for some offline single player game and for most people whatever they achieve when soloing will eventually be used for pvp even if it is only market pvp which actually is more cutthroat than pew pew more often than notpolitically i am fairly neutral i dont really give a rats ass about any of the big alliance power games the only entities that i do dislike are those that frequently employ the cheesy tactics that i mentioned above and i cant think of any that i particularly like over any others except my own alliance and its blues i guess so if you find your own concerns mirrored in one or more of my points feel free to cast your vote for me and spread the word we do not want a council filled with alliance puppets do wenow some specific issues i see with eve and the solutions i favor1 suicide gankingwhile i agree that highsec should not be safe but safer the level of safer needs to be adjusted upwards a notch or three if you cannot run a mission in the nextdoor system without a scout anymore because people will suicidegank you with 5 t1 battleships for your meager 500 mil in gear something is wrong suicide ganking should really only be profitable on paperthin ships carrying loads of valuables or really pimped combat ships like the ones i fly the solution to this is obviously to do away with insurance for ships killed by concord and that means not even the basic payout but complete voiding nada nothing recently someone posted a good optimization for this you only lose insurance if the target dies if your target lives you get insurance this provides a nice safety net for both suiciders and those prone to accidents with gang members thus it does not even raise the risk level for the suiciders still very close to 0 if you do your homework but it steeply raises the value of bigger ships loot to be worth suiciding which seems like the perfect solution to me not that i would mind complete insurance revoking for any concord kills but i wouldnt want to drown in griefer tears2 the lofty scam and gang mechanics in generalthese two are intertwined so i address them in one topic basically the current lofty scam exploits peoples wrong belief that noone may fire on them in highsec iirc in the past it used to be so that if you were in same gang it was like if you were in same corp ie free pewpew and concord doesnt care this was abused i guess and changed so that it wouldnt work anymorenow that people found ways around that i think it would be time to allow free pew pew among gang members again no more false sense of security no more accidents in highsec gangs no more need for a complicated set of aggro rules applying to gangs and the best protection against gang scams would still be to autoreject invitations just like it is now actually it would be nice to be able to only autoreject gangs but not chats
3 the nanothe population of eve seem somewhat split on whether there is a nanoproblem or not even if judging by the forums and my own ingame experience the supporters are more vocal but the antinanos are way more numerous personally i do see a problemand the problem i see is not the speed in general but that speeds making ships close to invulnerable are attainable by ships that are already plenty powerful even without it basically the entire t2 cruiser classso the solution i would favor would have something to do with nerfing 10mn mwds anything that also nerfs frig sized ships would be wrong imhoalso the whole thing might have something to do with webs making anything caught by them vulnerable to even capital guns while unwebed top speeds make stuff invulnerable even to weapons specifically designed to hit fast ships so the unbalance between highest and lowest speeds might need some looking at as well personally i would find it interesting to see what would happen if webs were completely removed and speeds were seriously cut across the board would probably require way too much module rebalancing to be feasible but still4 skill queuethis is something that has cropped up time and again in the past and while i personally would not really want to see a real skill queue i would like to see something like a backup skill like you set some very long skill as your backup skill and whenever your currently training skill finishes it switches to that backup skill this would prevent sp loss at unconvenient skill end times but would not really allow queueing5 more love for the side factionsthis really needs to happen someday soon who knows maybe it is planned for factional warfare what i would mainly love to see are of course faction ships for khanid thukker mordus etc but also more modules from them and especially modules with different stats like for example a khanid bcu currently has the same as a cn or dg bcu would be so much more interesting if it had for example a higher damage mod but a lower rof mod so you end up with the same or maybe even less for balances sake dps but a better volley6 market mechanicsi find the way the market works fairly stupid always buying from the lowest order regardless of what you clicked and how much you pay is so counterintuitive it makes me hurt and seeing how many other avenues are open for cash transfers these days the argument that it could otherwise be abused by isk sellers is pretty mootimho you should see who market orders belong to or actually allow players to create trademarks under which they can do their trades and then of course you should by off the order you picked not the cheapest one like for example i would gladly pay 10 more if i knew the isk goes to an alliancemate rather than a hostileand of course this would do away with a large portion of the need for 1 undercutting7 fix the forumsand please for the love of god get these forums sorted i had to log in a few dozen times to get all this posted

unfortunately ive already pledged my vote to another candidate but i highly recommend considering this candidate for those still deciding who to vote for
you have my attentioni cant say im completely on board with all your ideas particularly your proposed solution to the lofty scam but in general i like the way you think ill be looking for more from you in the coming weeks
so far you are my best candidate as i agree with most of your points and where i disagree your position dont seem unreasonable there is only a point i think you should reconsideri like the possibility to help some new player but at the same time i want some control on the situation to avoid to be the one scammed it is true that if i am protected with the current system the other party is the one at risk but if someone ask for help he should accept and consider the riska possible solution could be a different kind of gang one were any new member of the gang should be approved by all the member a similar system would be useless for a pvp gang but useful for a pve gang that usually is composed by a smaller number of people 
actually for helping new players i would prefer simply putting in a way to post clickable links to your position in chats when you are not in any gang yourself anyway so people can warp to you without being in your gang at all
so you were too rushed and busy to from a statement which would be the first thing most players see about your campaign and when listed among over 60 other candidates may be your one and only chance to get them interested enough in you to find out anything more it sounds to me as if you either have a poor order of priorities or you just dont have the time to devote to something like the csmwell as a csm you are going to be doing a lot of communicating your first impression is that you either dont have anything to say or arent any good at saying itall it shows is that you like putting up a flashy appearance with no actual substance and that you might know your way around a thesaurus when people go through this many candidates youve really only got one chance to say enough about yourself to get their attention before they move on to the next person in the list trite catchphrases and no information is a poor way to represent yourselfso the only votes you expect or want to get are from those who already know you fair enoughthen you should have said something worth reading something that actually told players about you and what you stood for i find that most people have little appreciation for buzzwords even less if there is nothing real attached to them the fact is that you did not do it if it had been important to you you would have done it the fact that you did not consider your first contact with the playerbase and possibly your only contact with many of them important enough to warrant a little more of your time and effort is rather troubling what your profile says to me is i have nothing to say move on forming a campaign statement for your profile is a minimal amount of effort to convey your ideas to the players ill restate my question if you were unwilling to do this work why should anyone believe you will be up to the work requried as a representativeor would you rather i believe that it was important to you but you were incapable of doing it because frankly id consider this even worse for your prospects as a representative
i think its fair to say that serenity did actually send a very clear message with his first action in the csm campaign setting up the eve csm candidate listing site as a service to the community it said from the word go that he was interested in the process of the council and empowering prospective candidates by helping them link and potentially host their material thats the very positive message i took from his action there anywayin terms of the candidate message on the official listing i tend to agree that candidates should probably have posted more detail there and i would support ccp allowing candidates to change and edit their message there in the run up to the official voting we still have a week to ensure that they are all representing themselves on an even footing and have appropriate time to prepare their platform the actual timescale of candidate application was quite rushed i only finished mine a few days before the deadline and if i hadnt been watching the process of the csm planning as carefully as i had been its conceivable i wouldnt have been so prepared either back to serenity though i think hes a very strong candidate and i hope he gets elected alongside myself and we can work together to make this inaugural csm everything it can be having spoken to and exchanged thoughts and evemails with serenity in the past ive no doubt we can collaborate and progressively discuss issues as respectful and mature players of this game to the clear benefit of the eve electorate and general player base
i have to disagree with the idea that the messages should be allowed to be changed i think that what the candidates posted with their profiles is very telling of what they felt important for a first impression the fact that several candidates were not prepared enough not aware enough or not dedicated enough to make a proper descriptive statement should stand as testimony to their capability of being a csm representativeon a different note another question for serenity steele how do you explain your support and collaboration with yusra in devising a method of organized bribery for the candidates yusra has advocated a system in which candidates votes will be bought by those who can pay and no issues will be brought to the csm without a paid purchase price and in which she will personally profit yusra has cited you as an accomplice in enabling this idea how do you justify support of someting so abhorrent and contrary to the intentions of the csm
thanks for the advice talkuth ill keep it in mind for the next csm as its not possible to change it now ill have to live with itits unfortunate for me that you interpret my efforts as being unwilling anyone should believe i will be up to the work required as a representative because if they read my post carefully they will see i arranged my personal and work to ensure i am able to live up to the commitment before applying
bringing diversity to the eve communityinfinite diversity in infinite combinations represents a vulcan belief that beauty growth and progress all result from the union of the unlike concord as much as discord requires the presence of at least two different notes the brotherhood of man is an ideal based on learning to delight in our essential differences as well as learning to recognize our similaritiesthis is what my campaign is all about in a nutshell i would direct you to my campaign blog for some background information as well as some of the issues that i have addressedthis thread is worth checking out since it contains my views on bacon as well as some other thoughts on the game of evemy hope is to represent all players equally in as objective a way as possible however i would not be completely honest to suggest that all of us do not have our own agendas based on our life experiences and philosophies even our gender and skin color all of these qualities make us who we are and we cannot help but be influencedd by themi am impressed with the field of candidates and am looking forward to meeting others who are chosen my challenge to you the voter is to consider casting your votes for diversity on the council i believe i am the best choice of women my presence on the council would not be as a token female people who know me describe me as fair compassionate persuasive charismatic and not afraid to make a decision and stand by it when challenged i am prepared to meet the challenge and defend my positionsi look forward to serving you and ask for your vote
good luck with the campaign
im afraid your post comes off as a lot of pretty words without actually saying anything a lot of candidates have said similar and i have the same problem with each of them they are not being realistic the fact is that it is impossible to represent all players equally as all the players will not agree on all topics the purpose of the csm as a whole is to represent all players and it will do so by having members who represent different views from among the players which views do you intend to represent when it comes down to decision time which way will you vote what issues do you consider worth your time to address and either support or opposeto be fair your blog does list some actual issues however i would suggest that you put those issues here blogs are nice for going into extra detail but this thread is your primary point of contact with the playerbase this is your official csm thread many will not look any further for ideas that you do not present here youve been much more honest than others about the existence of your own biases and opinions i think you just need to do a little more work to actually communicate themclearly state your issues and goals and you will gather the support of those who agree with you continue to claim to be able to do the impossible in representing all players equally and youll come off as just another politician willing to say anything to everyone just for the votes without clearly communicating who you really are
since my ingame corporation information is missing from my portrait i will state here that i am chief operations officer of sentinels of justice tactical commandi am a defender of freedom and i reject all forms of piracy this is who my character is however as a player i see a role for pirates and piracy its part of the game i believe one of the most destructive aspects of the game is iskfarming andor the selling of isk for cash while there doesnt appear to be a real solution to this problem it does remain that a problemhere are some issues that i have personal opinions about but am willing to consider alternative solutions to the overall problems of pirates having what i call the upper handhigh sec ore thieves need to have immediate kill rights in my opinion longer than 15 minutes the period of time for which those kill rights remain in effect can be a day but there should be an opportunity for immediate action to be taken against someone who steals from your can short of poddingkill rights should extend to any members of your corp that happen to be in your gang when the target is a player that podded you and you were not at warall low sec systems should allow for player corps to defend them without being interfered with it can be as simple as the corp with the most poses in a system given free reign to deal with criminals in any way necessary this also means if a pirate corp happens to have the most poses then they earn the right to defend that part of space gate guns and station defenses would not stop the corp that has defense rights from dealing with hostilesi speak more on the issue of fixing low sec herei am a strong proponent of transparency in the market it is vital that players know to whom they are doing business many corps prefer to give business to those they share philosophy with i see no reason why an open market should not truly be that open and transparenti am in favor of special n00b zones in which skill training takes place at an accelerated pace up to 5 times as fast as normal and where only players with fewer than 2 or 3 mil skill points can be found you can spend as little time there as you choose but why not take advantage of the accelerated skill training all of the activities are available to you that are available to any n00b player except for the ability to join a player corp the market would contain all tech i or basic equipment at fixed prices selling of ores and minerals is still possible as welli am also a proponent of a sort of neutral zone between empire and 00 with a strict nrds policy builtin to the game or perhaps no aggression at all except for entities at war the idea of this would be to show players in a relatively safe way what awaits them in 00 give them a taste of the bounties and privileges of living in null space but at the same time hold some back there still has to be some incentive to move to 00 no poses can be built in this neutral territory perhaps
im sorry but would that be the borda system he advocated which will not work as he intends since it is designed for singlewinner elections and would backfire as it would empower large alliances to elect multiple representatives without the need for outside votes im sorry but its the one issue oz has actually bothered to post an opinion on and with it hes demonstrated he doesnt know what hes talking about
regardless of what system is settled on and who advocates what it is vitally important to get discussion of the csm mechanics on the agenda oz has so far shown that hes the most willing to bring the issue to the table and debate it instead of the usual ridiculous bugfeature campaigns that most of the csms have opted foras long as oz is willing to debate exactly which system should be implemented and participate in a councilwide decision on the nature of the csm exactly which system reforms hes brought up in his initial campaigning isnt that important
i have a couple questions and i dont mean for this to come off as threadting or anything like that but i must criticize this i read a bit of your blog and it seems like the only thing you really wanted to discuss at the csm is how the csm could be managed more fairly efficiently and effectively to this i have two questions1 while it seems like a fine thing to talk about there are only 9 seats available for the csm is being on the council the only way that your csm reforms could be considered or do you think ccp would discuss them and possibly implement them on their own in future csm elections2 if this is not your only issue and i tend to give people the benefit of the doubt so i assume you have other concerns what else do you feel the csm should talk about
what bothers me is that he argued quite heavily in favor of the system even when shown how wrong he was in that the system would not have the effect he thought it would doesnt this indicate that he is not open to considering the ideas of others and will only push his own regardless of what the best option is to me this shows that he doesnt care whether he understands an issue before giving an opinion on it and will cling to his opinion no matter what the facts show isnt this detrimental to the purpose and success of the csm
hi there  i found this forum late so do excuse my tardiness at participating in this forummy big issue is transparency whic is more about ccps relationship with the playerbase than any specific ingame issue although it touched on almost everything ive posted in some of the threads in this forum but you can see my site policies and biography here
ill ask you the same question ive asked some other candidatesgiven the likelihood that many players may vote after doing nothing more than reading the candidate profiles here why is it that you felt it unimportant or unnecessary to exert a minimal amount of effort and post some key aspects of yourself or points of your campaign as i see it the candidate profile is the single most important place to get your point accross clearly and concisely as it will be read by the most players and many will never see anything else yet you felt it unecessary to post anything of any real substance your statement says nothing about your campaign beyond a vague generality it does not say anything about what issues you are for or against it only gives a url for your website considering that your name is just one in a list of more than 60 dont you think it would have been a good idea to give players a substantial reason to follow that link your profile gives a first impression to many players why did you not take the time to make it countif you could not be bothered to do the work necessary to put out your campaign information in your profile why should we believe that you are up to the task of doing all the work that will be associated with a seat on the csm
well for those too lazy or inept to click on a single hyperlink ill post my spiel hereabout meim a 33 year old british guy living in newhaven on the south coast of sussex i am a freelance lamp web developer have a wife a dog and relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis i have some real life political experience have served my time on turgid committees and am interested in politics economics and philosophy oh and i have a law degree but dont let that put you offyouve said that alreadyoh right yeah you want to know moredry biographical stuff first i graduated from the university of essex in 1995 with a 21 honours degree in law after which i went to law school didnt like it and founded a company instead this firm saw me travel all over europe to trade events giving me first hand experience of dealing with the diverse peoples of europe and north americabut times change and supply problems forced it to close at this point i waved a magic wand and transformed myself into a web developer teaching myself php mysql as well as html and css it was around this time fourfive years ago that i started playing eveand your time in evethis is clearly going to be an abridged versionin the beginning i was a n00b i started out as an empire dwelling carebear along with a couple of guys who i joined the game with from our battlefield 1942 clan a couple are still playing anyway i drifted into a mates corporation to help out with a war which was my first proper taste of pvp i loved it shortly after that my new corp migrated out to 00 in time to be a founding corp of fix alliance as the venerable cfs crumbled all around usi spent a lot of time in fix making both friends and enemasies rising to the level of jcos an alliance administrator a director if you will only to depart at the end of a long and bloody war to form pure in the north we formed this new alliance with the avowed determination to avoid the mistakes of the past so along with the infighting and crosstimezone schisms we jettisoned electoral democracy and participative debate this seemingly draconian dictatorial position perversely acted to make pure very free people were free to have fun not having to worry about working out what to do and they were deprived of the opportunity to argue for their own selfinterest leading to fewer fights schisms and factionalism it transpires that benevolent dictatorship is the sweetest form of governemnt after allive not been handson in the day to day running of pure preferring instead to focus on single issues of importance although i was the first external relations ministertoday im involved in coordinating invention efforts preoccupied with the macroeconomic issue of contolling our supply of money with a view to advantageously skewing the balanceoftrade and generally helping out when and where i can i dont pvp as much as id like for a variety of reasons got married got an annoyingly selfobsessed border collie puppy who needs attention all the bloody time and i have to endure occaisional sensory imperfections which would make me dangerous to fly with but i do my bitwhy elect mefirstly and most importantly i am an eve player who plays the game via the client rather than the eveonline forums while the forums are important and entertaining they are for me a poor second to achieving things ingame caod occaisionally appears to me to be nothing more than a really bizarre sciffi flavourerd wwe rant one that i observe but studiously dont participate insecondly i play the game in very broad ways  im involved in invention manufacturing research npcing and pvp i speak to people who do the rest mining complexes and so on so i feel that i have a good grasp of the mood in most areas of eve
i have ample experience of 00 life including operating alliance structures i ran fix for a while i have been instrumental in setting up pure this has involved an appreciation of how to create and operate transnational social structures to provide a kind of coherence for the entity across 237 i should add that this issue fascinates mefourthly i tend to look at issues from a macroscopic level while culling data from people on the ground in pure this means i am looking at issues surrounding money supply as part of broader trading strategy in which i and others are involved this appreciation for how large and often semiimperceptible issues affect individual pilots is i contend something that we as players definitely definitely want to see on the councilfinally i promise to be an effective representative i really want the csm to live up to its promise for useful and frank dialogue between players paying customers and ccp and believe that i can help to ensure that this is what happens i will not be party to any whitewashes or tolerate corruption such as we saw last year i will always try be available for contact so that i may represent your views whoever you may be or an echo of them to ccp at meetings and i promise not to be partisan or to try to abuse my position to benefit myself my corporation or my allianceconcrete proposalsthese are things that i want to try and get adopted should you elect me to the csm1 greater transparency in the petitions process some kind of record noting whos petition gets nodes rebooted for instance viewable by people affected by that decision if you are affected by the resolution of someone elses petition you should have a right to know who opened it and which gm answered it the benefit here for players is that you get less worked up about collusioncorruption because you can sort of see whats gone on which shouldnt really be a secret thing in matters like node reboots and yet right now as weve seen they are the advantage for ccp is that they get to conclusively nail another irritating ghost thats been lingering post bobdev scandal2 improved corp and alliance tools specifically the ability to grant roles to individuals not in your corp communications streamlining and perhaps the ability to set departmental budgets perhaps allowing alliancewide blacklists of dodgy pilots automatically unemployable so long as their name is on an allianceadministered list things to better integrate corp systems and alliance systems all sorts of things really3 push hard for improved nodesupport for system populations  250 so that the mere arrival of a fairly average fleet doesnt tank the node similarly make the usual gripes about lag failing that push ccp to make public whats known about wheres laggiestmost unstable to level the playing field for all concerned possibly via some kind of traffic report when you log in4 lobby hard for the insurance system to better reflect the true costs of purchasing t2 ships
ill ask you the same question i have asked of similar candidates specifically those who seem to feel it unnecessary to tell the players anything about your own ideas and opinionswhy do you feel it inappropriate for the players to have some insight into how you think and where your personal biases arewhat would you say to those of us who believe that a candidates individual opinions give valuable and necessary insight into their thought process as a csm representative you will be required to make choices and decisions on various issues and then vote according to your decision the players deserve some indication on which way you will lean when faced with these situations which will be a regular part of your duties as a representative not stating an opinion makes it appear as though you either have something to hide or you are completely uninformed about the current issues in game or you are just plain indecisive none of these are very attractive characteristics for a representativeyour own thoughts and ideas will form an important part of how you weigh arguments and make decisions why do you not feel it important for your potential voters to know these ideas
hi talkuththanks for asking ill try to answer each point for you if you feel i have not answered sufficiently please let me knowi really dont think it inappropriate to know how i think or what my personal biases are i would like to think i am objective and behaving in a transparent manner but my main concern is that i do not want to be seen to be totally rigid and just have one particular goal aside from serving the players as fairly as possiblei have varied opinions on matters and have posted several times not only here but on my blog revealing those opinions see sig linkmy overriding desire is to have a hand as a member of a team to improve eve in accordance with the csm framework and within the bounds of the role using the assigned mechanismsbut i agree with you however i do make a very firm distinction between an opinion and an agendaweve been here before on this point i think talkuth  ive stated so far my opinions on local bacon the csm itself 00 pos sovereignty low security space piracy and antipiracy missions and miningim not in any way attempting to be evasive or secretive my opinions are a matter of public record and perhaps people agree with them or not thats just naturali do feel though that as a potential member of the csm that you have to have a degree of flexibility and while its admirable to be strong and hold your ground sometimes it is a sign of strength to admit when you are wrong and be able to discuss toward resolutionperhaps its a case of semantics here but i see the role of the csm to bring the players voice to the table and be able to discuss it objectively not to just bring my view to the table i do see your point however and hope that ive cleared up matters
why do you feel that you can speak on the behalf of goonswarm when in fact no one in goonswarm can stand you and 50 of our forums have you on ignore because of your horrible postshow can you claim to be a valid candidate when you couldnt even get 20 people to support your csm candidancy out of a forum of thousands of people
according to the goonswarm killboard you have barely ever flown a t2 ship in a pvp situation an absolution 4 times and never used a hac how can you say that the risk reward is broken on them if you have never flownlost these t2 ships could your opinion in anyway be biased because you do not want to use these ships that outperform the usual t1 versions
sounds kindof out of line as far as representing goonswarm or not as far as i know this csm thing isnt about representing a corp or an alliance but the playerbase as a whole and i believe goumindong is doing relatively well at that
im sorry i thought this was a thread for questions to a csm candidate which is what i didand my point was that goumindong comes up with such horrible ideas and posts them constantly that people just ignore what he is saying nowadays and my mention of support for his candidancy references the internal voting we had to determine which candidate goonswarm as a whole would support for the csmgoumindong would be a horrible representitive as he doesnt have the first idea about game balance or how to make an argument
i do not have an sa account
besides flying with and against these ships besides flying ships with similar characteristics though not all similar and then amalgamating from there besides testing their capabilities in nonlive situations besides intimate knowledge of the game mechanics governing tracking explosion velocity speed inertia et all nothing besides those things i did not have to fly typhoons and domis to know that they were utterly broken right after the rev 1 patch and the same holds true for nanoships if there is a doubt look a killboard like bob and tri and see where their losses crom from and the number of nanoships that are killed by nonnano ships then figure out how many of those were from stupiditylike my last two nanokills which had the pilots had half a brain or were paying attention would never have happenednote there is very little wrong with the absolution in terms of riskreward it is not able to be made into a ship that is able to disengage like its smaller cousins i would be flying that particular ship more but getting my bs out of qy6 was of more strategic importance and the contract system screwed me over in terms of other means of retrievalwhich is to say you cant contract damaged crystals in a gun
i will not be speaking on behalf of goonswarm and do not claim to nor do any of our official reps i will dispel rumors towards goonswarm when asked for me howevernext time i will try to dumb myself down for you and post a bunch of image macros with cute animals on them maybe that will increase my levels of supportthe reason that i am ignored on gfcom is pretty much entirely due to bandwagoningdo you have evidence of this or are you going to spew more ad hominem
then you fundamentally do not understand how goonswarm operates and this misunderstanding is what drives a lot of the funny that we see in the game vile rat could have said anything and this would have been ok with the leadership and the people because as an alliance we dont care what you think and if what you think is wrong and funny more the betterit is in the strictest of terms otherwise there is no game over for the other player as there is in any other competitive game this is very good for the game but as an alliance it has much deeper meanings with regards to how you can win even temporarily the short answer is you will win when you log on and so the most important aspect of fighting another alliance and tacking their space is making sure that you will log on and they will not
you sir are one deluded man i wanted to come up with something retortive but your statement says allclearly the typhoon  domi is overpowered
were overpowered were back right after rev 1 when the istab boost came in back when phoons and domis were going 35kms in tight orbits with stacks of heavy nos and tonnes of dpsyea they were terribly and utterly broken and they got nerfedquite a bit actually
how much dps i dont exactly recall the nanophoon and domi being dps boats when they were overpoweredin fact if someone brought a rapierhuginn with them they were completely uselessthey were flying bricks if you managed to web themleave alone the fact that you needed to fit them with rigs likely snakes and faction mwds if they should be worth anything or pure skillrequirements in order to do dps phoon is one of the most skill intensive ships in the game at present if you wanna fly it right that has always been true the nanotime it had was no different i mean even now if you want to do respectable dps you need a lot of skills imagine how little dps it would do with UFFFD of the damage being reallocated to nos
they were doing 500600 dps in a full 35kms oribt with 4 heavy nos running pretty brokened also they were not much more expensive than any other battleship at the timeeveryone needed rigs to be competitive not that isk is a reason to make things overpowered but their ability to disengage and to move at such speed was clearly brokeni dont really want to get into an argument onto whether or not the battleships that could go faster than interceptor with better than cruiser agility were overpowered or not if you want to get into it you should go check out the threads where ryysawho was flying 5kms  phoons and nightmares at the time pretty much wailed on everyone supporting the other sideacs make up and made up less than 13rd of the dps that a typhoon puts out
coming from a pilot who used to fly one no you didnt need snakes also from what i remember there was a rig that was deleted that added to the mwd bonus ability the problem is that nos and neuts are damage considering they werent nerfed at this time domi did around 400500 damage with drones while nosing his enemy to feed its own cap hungry mwd a huggin or rapier will not stop this ship alone it is a flying brick yes but that is a benefit as webs wont effect it as much as smaller ships it will cause him to flee and find an easier target you did not need alot of isk to build one either a decent amount but considering the payout in terms of survivability definetly cheaper then the old dble repped nosdomi keep in mind not a comparison of price but a comparison of survivablity a good pilot who keeps his eye on local will never loose itdid it need to be nerfed coming from a pilot who just happened to have all the skills needed to fit this style of domi and flew it regularly yes also please dont include implants as a price for the ship if the ship dies they still are imbedded into your skull so you didnt loose themyet only thing you lost was a ship worth about 200500 mil depending if you used a faction mwd not a huge loss especially if you keep an eye on local the ship will more then paid for itself by tenfoldtruthfully it doesnt really matter the point is they were overpowered and as such they were put in there place
well im not saying that they werent overpowered having flown with rysa and seen his nightmare it was just sickbut they could still be countered it just comes down to player skills everything does the nanobs stuff was just easier for people to learn to use properlybut the istab change that came with rev 1 was broken i still fail to understand why they made that change in the first placeand yes there was a rig which gave a mwd bonus it was eventually removed and replace with auxillary thrusters for those who had themi flew the nanophoon once or twice i didnt like it that much sure you can do some decent dpsby no means awesome dps my deimos can do the same though it doesnt reach the same speed its a lot more agilebut the nanophoon did about the same dps as 11UFFFD t1 cruisers so seriously id didnt do tonnes of dps my rokh does tonnes of dps but it doesnt go fastso the point is that the nanophoondomi did too manyt hings at once if you wanna fit your lows with nano fine you will just suck at everything else and that wasnt the case with them prenerf
well im not saying that they werent overpowered having flown with rysa and seen his nightmare it was just sickbut they could still be countered it just comes down to player skills everything does the nanobs stuff was just easier for people to learn to use properlybut the istab change that came with rev 1 was broken i still fail to understand why they made that change in the first placeand yes there was a rig which gave a mwd bonus it was eventually removed and replace with auxillary thrusters for those who had themi flew the nanophoon once or twice i didnt like it that much sure you can do some decent dpsby no means awesome dps my deimos can do the same though it doesnt reach the same speed its a lot more agilebut the nanophoon did about the same dps as 11UFFFD t1 cruisers so seriously id didnt do tonnes of dps my rokh does tonnes of dps but it doesnt go fastso the point is that the nanophoondomi did too manyt hings at once if you wanna fit your lows with nano fine you will just suck at everything else and that wasnt the case with them prenerfi concur for the most part but the problem is this nosneuts are damage and very powerful especially considering that nos wasnt nerfed yet virtually anything under bs size that got close to these ships was vanquished the only counter was a huginrapier with friends or bring lots of people considering this the nanophoon did do alot more damage then a cruiser quickly erroding your enemys cap is the same as if the enemy had to turn on reps to repair incoming damage nosneuts are damage just a different form but back on topicsorry for posting this in this forum just thought that it needed to be clarified as it was a topic at the time
how much dps did the phoon do my thorax does between 400 and 500 gankplate fitted that is pretty much how the phoon works too
funny you should mention that
how much dps did the phoon do my thorax does between 400 and 500 gankplate fitted that is pretty much how the phoon works toooff base calculations this is of course using eft an older version unfortunatly not the one pre nerf but close to it torps didnt get a boost yet so damage will not be accurate due to figureing out dps on eft is imo redundant also i will call this my frakaphoon as i have no idea how it works and am going off how i would throw it together if i were to nano one back in these days also not sure if my nosneut dps i calculate is correct so if someone would like to correct me please dodps using 2 arbalest torps with 5x heavy ogre iis comes out to 410 dps no not as much as your thorax but like i said nosneuts is dps not knowing this ship and how it was fitted on this part makes it difficult so i will guess on a fitting for nosneut in which it works and is fairly cap stable 4x heavy dim nos 1x heavy unstable  1080 cap drained every 24s or for easy comparison on a repper 540 cap every 12s a large and med repper take 560 energy every 12 secs i say roughly due to skillwhich really doesnt help that much now turning cap dps into dps this is tricky for this i added armor rep repaired of a large and med then divided by 12 representing 12 seconds comes out to 93 not perfect nosneut dps due to this combo not completely sinking with medlarge rep 560 doesnt equal 540 and seems like a pathetic number but there is a huge portion that is missed from this this is pure dps as cap doesnt have resistenceso you have 410dps unresisted damageeft is not a good source for gaining dps imo and 90ish worth of pure dpsnow looking at the thorax 400500 dps is unresisted so they are about the same unresisted dps but 90ish worth of pure dps is a nice amount when compared to unresisted dps for this i use a basic omni tank with base resist around 50 rax doesnt do em so well use other resist for such comparison raw dps of said thorax will be around 200250 raw dps of said frankenstein phoon i threw together around 295 dps roughly yes simular but id rather fly this phoon then the die mosts little brother chance of surviving and killing the target in the phoon 100 as long as you watch local chance to survive and kill in thorax going against what this phoon can take on odds may very but obviously not a good idea to pick a fight with a blasterthron which the phoon could do and win easily100 is derived from no one entering local this can kill anything bs and smaller recons will probably be the only thing that would give you a problemis my frakaphoon better then a rax for solo yes gang no
1 my inty crow goes 6393ms i doubt loosing 4 25572ms is going to get me killed i dont aggree with it because it is a nerf to blaster boats moving from target to target and simply nowing how much damage a blaster boat does when it gets into range will do obviously get them primaried for webification imo asside from gate campingstation camping this would be the end of blasterboats as a raven or a gankgeddon would be more viable to fly in bs zealot would obsolete diemos in hacs if this was implented thats just my view though not to say that it would happen but i still speculate on it2 aggreed3 aggreed amarr are fine save for the apoc that needs that opt range bonus reduced
im mostly just curious about thisa what do you think about the 10 less cap use  level bonus on amarr ships balanced waste of bonus and should be replaced with something different raise to 15 or 20 or decrease to 5 etcb do you think the omen is balanced with other cruisers of its teir  other t1 combat cruisersc you mentioned that you think there should be a role for everything do afterburners have a significant enough role especially with regards to pvpthanksps i actually liked your reworking of webs
i am sorry are you going to make an argument as to why that is or are you just going to post some of the things that i have posted out of context also no i would not make gang bonuses only distribute via the squad command position and no not make all afs gang bonus producing ships but you would have had to read those threads to understand what was going onand had you you read the introduction to the thread you quotedwhich was also before any of the amarr changes bar the khanid onesthere is nothing wrong with signature radius webs if you would like to provide a reason why i would love to hear it hell that thread is still open you can post in it
i didnt know it was possible to take an entire thread out of context but basically heres my point you dont know the first thing about this game or game balance and despite this you seem to think that anything that comes into your head is a golden idea worthy of immediate implementation youre the worst kind of idiot the one who thinks he knows thingsand the reason im posting here is so that everyone else knows exactly how awful you are
the 10 cap bonus is easily justified on the battleships where the range advantage really means somethingbecause the range advantage is high and ships are slow cruiser sized and below it is not very valuable but you can engineer around thatas can be seen in the case of the harbingers mysterious extra 1000 armor pointscurrently the omen is about balanced and possibly the best dps cruiser due to the nanocraze despite its low peak dps and terrible ehp its the only cruiser with the ability to really hit fast cruiser sized ships since its the only one that doesnt need a range bonus to be effective against them this makes it better by default when nothing else is hitting that far it would not be overpowered with a bit more powergridno i dont believe they do which is one of the reasons i proposed changing webs though abs may need a flat boost as well abs should be useful in avoiding damage and they currently arent this ought to be fixed
so you arent going to make any argumentyou didnt take an entire thread out of context you took snippets made it look like the entire thread and lied about them i do not think that anything that comes into my head is a golden idea but i do think the ones i post have merit your posting here isnt really hurting me as far as i can tell youve no argument and are just attacking me i think most of the people who play this game are smart enough to not fall for such cheap tricks
so your point is that the statements were approved of by the goons because they were false and a joke im sorry but if your alliance openly allows and encourages false public statements about their motives then you have to accept and live with whatever perceptions are brought about as a result of those statements once again if your alliance chooses not to control what information its members put out then it is responsible for that information just as much as if it had directly instructed the statement from this the goons have no one to blame but themselves for their public image if they allow anything to be said and encourage lies they should not be shocked or surprised to find that they are then judged by those lies the goons also have no right to later return and pick and choose which statements are true and which are false the time to stop the lies and put an end to rumor is when they first come to light not months or years later as by then the damage has been done when youve neglected your housekeeping you cant just sweep everything under the carpet once it become inconvenient if youve allowed the record to become what it is without protest then you have given approval and acceptance of the record as factalso why should anyone trust a representative from an organization that encourages and advocates lies why should anyone vote for a representative who does not care what others think this is where the central philosophy of the goons disqualifies them as viable representatives as the ideals directly contradict the duties of the positionin other words your answer is that the goons do in fact believe it a good thing when their opponents quit the game thank you for confirming my point frankly i find this view in direct contradiction with what is best for the future of the game i find it disturbing that those who hold such a view want to be on a council designed to improve the game when their goals for endgame dictate its destruction
you are mistaking understanding of how the game is played and won with a wish to hurt othersonly if you believe that we act as a monolithic entity and have no wish to play a fun game both of these things are not true we are not monolithic and do like to have fun if anything waterfowl should have convinced you that we are indeed not monolithic
a goonswarm member running for csm that has almost no pvp experience let alone experience flying t2 shipsmy vote will be going elsewhere
my argument is that you dont have a clue how to balance a game and my supporting evidence is everything youve ever posted all im hoping is that people are smart enough to decide that someone who writes their general treatise of eve online and then includes such gems as an explanation of game theory which is never referenced because its completely worthlessand as to whether i lied anyone can go to the links i posted and see for themselves exactly what i paraphrased if you feel that those posts dont show you as a complete idiot then clearly you wouldnt need to defend them the fact that you cannot seem to not respond to my posts indicates to me and to the reader that you are defensive about your past record on balance
no i simply give everyone their fair shake even youed but i will correct misunderstandings of them
goumindong doesnt get enough credit for his ideas probably because theyre not always easy to understand the webifier idea in particular is very goodpeople doubting is motives are also probably not aware that hes been posting since way before the csm thing was announced
i have no trouble believeing goumindongs motives it surprised me more after reading rather a lot of his posts on shc that he was a member of goonswarm
nah im not refering to you but rather to that guy who thinks goum is running for csm to ruin eve because hes a goon
no for me its about your idea of how the game is won being in direct conflict with what is best for the good of the game you as an individual or a group intend to win the game winning for you means that other players quit playing a reduced playerbase harms the game as a whole do you see the contradiction and can you understand why some would be concerned with someone who holds that view having anything to do with the future improvement of the gameas to the other idea you mention i dont think i actually believe that goons directly intend hurt or harm to other individuals i think they actually just dont care how what they do impacts others its complete lack of concern and total apathy in some ways i find this even more disturbing at the very least its not a healthy mindset for a communitybased gameyou are a group who associates under one banner anything said or done by a member displaying that banner has the potential to be taken as a statement representing the group this has nothing to do with how you are organized internally but rather its just how things work the fact that you as a group do nothing to discourage any of these statements indicates to the minds of outsiders that they are in fact approved and endorsed statements if there is no official word contradicting an individuals statements then the unofficial word will be taken as official welcome to life the fact that you as a group have not felt it necessary to control such statements because as you put it you do not care what others think means that you have no place to now disagree with or dispute the reputation you have allowed to be created for yourselves but that reputation should not matter since you dont care what others thinkexcept that now that you and others of your alliance need the favor and support of other players suddenly you do care what they think you want them to forget what was said and done before and believe that your reputation was falsely earned even though you never bothered to try to disprove it before do you see why there is a problem here the only time you care about anyone besides yourself is when you need them which means that the moment you dont youre off doing your own thing againif you dont care what others think than you wont be representing anyone besides yourself on the csm if you do care then you should have done something about your reputation before when you had nothing to gain from it but the respect of others as with so many politicians the goons careless past has come back to haunt them now that they have goals and aspirations requiring the respect and support of others its a little late in the game to be changing uniforms everyone already knows what side youre playing on
just like economics belief or disbelief in something doesnt matter it only matters whats true you might want someone who deludes themselves as to the nature of eve and how you play and win but i dont and i wont be the person to do thattrue when people dont understand the group if i cant convince you that your perceptions are wrong about the group then there isnt much i can do on the front and i guess you will just have to believe that we are both monolithic entity as well as one that isntgiven that these are both statements given by people who wear the banner
then as already asserted you and i are playing two very different games as what we have here is a fundamental difference on what the truth actually is what i see as true is that your idea of truth is not the heart of the game at all but in actuality the pursuit of your truth is a method of the games destructionconsider what the goals of your truth mean if pursued to their ultimate end one faction wins by forcing everyone else out of the game that faction then having no one else to fight turns on itself splintering into smaller factions who then fight against each other until there is only one left the process repeats itself through many iterations until you are left with only two players once one of those players quits the other has won this winning player is now left alone in an empty world and nothing else to do so he too quits tangential philosophical question has this player then won or has he actually lost as he has quit the game is no longer sustainable and is now overnow i dont believe for a moment that this outcome is truly possible but the fact remains that this is your end goal given your idea of what constitutes winning what you see as winning would lead to the inevitable destruction of the game how is that supposed to make you qualified to serve as part of an organization whose goals are the continuation and improvement of the game an organization whose goals are in direct contradiction to your own why should anyone believe that you would not abuse such a position to serve your own goals of winning
reposting my post from this threadim against any 3rd party program that gives a significant advantage to its users compared to those that do not use the program it basically forces people to use the program if they want to participate in the top levels of the gamei know what happens if noone s down on this stuff in ultima online it was compulsory to use programs that spammed movement requests to the server or make the client tick faster and thus send more movement commands so your character would always run faster than those without the program if you wished to participate in pvp you had to have one of these programs the staff never undertook action against those using the program so it got completely out of hand and now almost every pvper there is using this trash we dont want those situations to arise in eve thus for the good of all the bacon program and similar utilities must be blacklistedi understand that scrolling through the local channel isnt really a nice mechanic either but if you want changes to the interface and feedback then suggest them so they become available for everyone when they are officialy implemented
there was a thread on this topic to which i responded with my views in a sense there are no locks that cannot be picked with regard to encryption of data hacking tools can search for the encryption key and apply it thereby giving the user a workaround that would allow the use of bacon once again so there is no perfect solution but there at least is a solution that makes it harder for unwanted access to sensitive log filesthere are larger issues here but in my opinion overall this bacon issue is a primary example of democracy in action csm is going to rely heavily on players bringing important issues to our attention and articulating the justification for the alarm
i responded to this same question posed by an evetribune interviewer my answer belowone thing i should mention is that at the time i wrote this i was not aware that bacon makes a warning sound before a person even appears in local that makes the problem much more imminent since at that point bacon becomes a gameplay enhancing program not duplicable with the nonmaximized browser technique mentioned in the quote above
in principle i disagree with this statement wholeheartedly the term significant advantage is vague and unspecific eve players need to be free to use programs that enhance the enjoyment of the game and even provide a tactical advantagethe line should be drawn when 3rd psrty software manipulates the data stream accessing data that is not intended for the players use or interferes with the normal operations of the game
theres 2 kinds of programs1 things which automates certain things depending on in game events2 things which provide you information based on other meansbacon falls in under the first category and i agree it shouldnt be allowedbut the secondary kind of third party application isnt problematic you can easily argue that it can give a significant advantage to some people but you have to be smart in order to use the information properlyim sorry but the smartest person will always have an advantage and i think that eve should take darwins ideas about the survival of the fittest to an even higher degree
xeno at evetribune asked a similar question with responses from many candidatesmy position on bacon is pretty cleari do not support the specific implementation of the bacon functionality that gives individualgroups of players an advantage in use of the gameclient for playing eve another case in point beetrackeri fully support tool development initiatives that push ccp to address shortcomings in eves user interface ie sound notificationsa tool as powerful as bacon should be in the gameclient or not available all players or no players particularly considering 20 of players read the forums so would not be aware of its existencethe question of relevance of notification of people in local is up for debate and it the larger debate of showing people in local
i cant link to the post any more its gone bacon had 1 thing over the rest of the monitoring programs it was made available to everyone the private monitoring programs are a bigger problemwill any of you try to get ccp to admit how long they have known about the monitoring programs and why they only made the commitment to put a stop to them when the public was made aware that they existedme removes tin foil hat now
what are all the candidates opinions on these parts of the gamei believe all three in there current form are helping to kill eve in todays game we are starting to see fleets with more cap ships than any other type of ship and along with cyno jammers in the near future big alliances that can field 150 cap ships anytime of day how can any other alliance hope of being able to take down cyno jammed systemsand why is it that people who spam more poss get sov of that system why not introduce a new type of pos or structure which claims sov in the system it is anchored now only one of these poss can be put in any one system at a time so if alliance a holds sov in a system alliance b only has to kill one pos and replace it with there sov gaining pos to gain sov over the system this would decrease pos spam but there would be still roles for the old poss such as mining and forward bases for ships to base from when assaulting systemsalso with the introduction of jump bridges it makes moving around 00 nearly risk free 00 with all the above mechanics affecting it is become so easy to control for any competent alliance and only encourages the need to form the biggest blob possible to get results small scale pvp is dying and large scale pvp is just a giant lagfest with luck deciding thewinner most times isnt time for these issues to be looked at and changed before its to latewhat do the candidates think
i think jades take and ideas on the whole subject is completely right we need a more dynamic eve in terms of pvp cyno jammers isnt helping this
i havnt had time to read all of jades thoughts as of yet i do agree that cyno jammers are realy affecting pvp at this time so many people are uses masses of cap ships but only when hid behind the jammers being any noncap fleet that enters the system is at a massive disadvantage usualy resulting in no engagements due to the massive odds stacked against them and having limted resources to fight back
these issues are a central matter in my csm manifesto 5h4dy i agree with you the current issues in 00 warfare going wrong come down directly to sovereignty from poscyno jammersjump bridges and the impact they have on actual play 1 sovereignty does need to change from being generated from the pos structure we need a better mechanic that doesnt force all sides to assemble at a prearranged time where its all about the uber blob  we need these battles to have initiative and uncertainty and far my dynamism incorporated in the conflictccps prototype gate control for sovereignty proposal though rough and needful for more functional detail is 1000x better than the current possovereignty mechanic in my opinion2 i agree completely about jump bridges too they make 00 logistics much too easy for sovereignty 3 holders and since sovereignty 3 is way too easy to get in and of itself  and ludicrously difficult to contest after the event this is a real issue before jump bridges it was possible to interdict a 00 empire by hitting their logistics and transport assets now its just become a matter of watching invulnerable ships warping between pos shields other issue of course is the ubiquitous jump bridge hot drop wherein the defender gets to blob at a central location and near instantly appear at any other bridge in reaction to invasionraids again its a blobcreator it makes it too easy to focus too many ships in too few engagements and yes its hurting the game largescale nanouse in 00 is a direct consequence of this jump bridge spam will become less of an issue if we get a proper sovereignty mechanic though if it actually takes effort to generate and maintain sovereignty 3 as in you can keep it by patrolling and fighting in your core node systems then its less of a problem where its really abusive at the moment is in dozens of afk pos only systems in the full knowledge that attacks physically cannot threaten the status quo in a significantlyurgent timescale3 cynojammers are terrible way too easy to put up mindless in operation impossible to scale for balance might well be possible for 150 tech2 battleships to bring down but is that really what ccp want as the entry bar for territorial warfare in 00 they also make the destruction of capital ships much rarer than it should be promoting environments where only one side have cap ships in the initial engagements leads to more polarized we massively outblob or we dont fight gameplay decisions without the jammers people would be committed greater numbers of cap ships to more uncertain fights and incidence of capital ship loss would increase this would go some way to addressing the problem of steadily increasing capital arms race in 00  from a game health perspective we need to be advocating changes that actually get those uber empires to commit their cap ships to open space battles with a significant risk of loss to achieve objectives but yes lavistas right its pretty much my ideal campaign issue this and plays directly into my manifesto please do have a read and let me know what you thinkcsm manifesto 2008
in general killing a wellequipped cyno jammer pos is too difficult and i honestly have absolutely no taste for pos demoltion or most largescale fleet operations at all dont let the corp ticker fool you i posted some ideas for how to make attacking a little easier here some ideas i have pasted in this thread belowmost of my brainstorming has been related to keeping the current posbased sovereignty system but making it more palatable overall i like the idea of ditching pos entirely when it comes to sovereignty but im not feeling it 100 with the whole gate control system though itd be an improvementbut even if sovereignty was not determined by starbase counts cyno jammer pos would still be too difficult to attack
i should have run on a single issue campaign myself over this but too late now psince i already gave jade a hard time over it to be fair to everyone i have a solution to said problem of cyno jammers and pos which is detailed here and id be interested in knowing what other candidates felt about it
ive been thinking about a solution to the cynosural field generator problem one of thesolutions i thought of would be to add a fuel requirement for it something moderate not too large not too small as well as reducing its armor hitpoints to something more manageable such as 1million rather than 15million another idea would be to require sovereignty 4 before being able to anchor it yes this would wreck havoc in some systems but things need a little shaking up imo and that is just my opinion dont be hating
personally id like to see ideas more along the lines of what ccp has already suggested shifting the territory control mechanism to the stargatesin fact id go so far as to say forget the artificial mechanic of sovereignty through pos deployment instead let players capture stargates gaining more and more advantages as their stargate network within a constellationregion grows leading to a de facto sovereignty rather than one imposed by an arbitrary measure like pos deploymentindividual system sovereignty based on pos deployment will always inevitably lead to massive single battles to determine control but spreading that conflict across all the stargates in a region and granting benefits based on the sum of stargates that you control leads to a decentralized ongoing conflict more small fights all the time across a whole constellationregioncynojammers could still exist but they wouldnt be so overpowering because territory control wouldnt hinge on the ability to deploy capital ships although capital ships would still be powerful weapons and excellent mobile bases that aid in dominating a systemwith a stargate network of a certain size jump bridge technology could be shifted to the gates themselves  if you control enough stargates in a region you gain the ability to travel quickly from one controlled stargate to another  unless the destination system is cynojammedinformation warfare can also become part of the benefit of a stargate network  allowing controlling alliances to see who has been using their stargates or sounding alarms when enemies jump through themall thats left is to come up with the method for gaining control of stargates
i see a disturbing pvp meentality amongst the candidates so as a player who prefers what i find to be the more relaxing life of the solo mission runner do you consider pve a vaiable portion of the gmae or do you wish to see all players forced into pvp regardless of their preferences
i dont think that the people who draw their enjoyment from pvp and 00 politics necessarily believe that pve is worthless or would ever really wish to see players forced into 00style pvp i appreciate the current situation in fact for a number of reasons ive owned my own missioning characters in the past and ive appreciated the chance to do something different from time to time i also agree that its more relaxing than running a 150man fleet thats something nobody will deny  alliance logistics are founded on 00 freightering and i think itd take a very nuanced suggestion indeed to extend nonconsensual pvp to empire without putting that at risk while ive seen no such nuanced suggestion i think the more important point is that the sanctity of secure space is something that even 00 alliances rely upon and removing that would make logistics really horrible for groups like graypert to some limited extent every player that leaves the safety of a station is already forced into pvp in that its possible for them to die no matter where they go i think thats about as far as it needs to go
while goumindong is a truly horrible candidate from goonswarm daveydweeb is only a moderately bad one vote for daveydweeb i guess
hell yes
since the csm application process said that you can even create a brand new character in order to run for csm i seriously doubt ccp would ever do that expose any alts you might have and i doubt they would ever certify that all alt characters belong to the same real personon the flipside they will be publishing your real name picture and so on and so forthsounds weird  maybe it is but thats how things arefeel free to not vote for candidates that refuse to post all alts feel free to believe all alts a person has are the ones he listed feel free to do anything like that but never expect ccp to tell you character xxx is owned by abc and so are characters yyy zzz etc
lies i have met lilan khan before also you forgot dianabolic
i think its relavant it goes towards a candidates trustworthyness of a candidate i too have no wish to unknowingly vote for some well known scammers alt character if someone is willing to scam friends noobs or whoever out of thier assets even if it is a part of the game i would not trust them to do anything they promise to do in rl either this includes any platforms or issues they are promising to supportpush as part of thier job as csms that said i doubt ccp would do this especially for those who choose not tohowever i think an acceptable compromise might be for csm candidates to voluntarily divulge the information and ask ccp to confirm thier authenticity this way you can choose not to but if you do we know that youre not bsing the voters bsing and scamming may be part of the game but if this csm thing is really an out of game process then that argument is moot too
would you care to elaborate as to why theyre irrelevant
i too was wondering exactly about thisno offence to ss i know you are a good guy its exactly relevant with the rumors that you are a bobbit people wants to knowi would expect no less myself if i had a character in a large alliance
you either have an account that allows 4 characters or 2 accounts of which one doesnt have all slots usedhuh thats really cool  compared to you my alts have really clean recordsrespect for this outing mate all the best for your campaigni am a defender of private rights in rl a fighter for freedom and anticesonsorshipits hard for me to abadon my principleshowever anyone who wants to ensure non of my hauler or cynoalts has scammed themis asked to contact me directly in game to learn about my altsthis is imo a reasonable compromise which of course bears the risk that this person could go to forum next day and just publish that data wo my permission but at least by doing soi learn something of the character of a person honorps i hereby confess to be a hetero paganist with buddhistic influence
no ccp will not be releasing any further information about the candidates beyond what has been released to this date
i dont have any alts noobie 
edited for legibility and clarityok im going to try fit it into one post wish me luck  a bit simplified however imo the information is irrelevant becauseccp have performed due diligenceccp have already done due diligence in checking rl identity passport and location data and ensured candidates have a clean record to run as per jades statementit wont improve the csmreleasing alts will not improve any voters ability to a good choice as to any candidates ability to perform the duties as csm a good choice imo is one determined by a candidates ability to understand the mechanics of the eveonline universe understand the underlying vision for the eveonline universe understand the aspirations and concerns of the player base understand how the mechanics of the eve universe can be balancedexploited filter and identify important issues or developments from 1000s of ideas objectively describe the pros and cons of issues raised by the player base constructively debate the issues within the csm communicate ccps response to the player base identify from experience ways to improve the csm mechanisms for future candidatesthe information available to assess candidates under the current csm rules is reveal the persons rl name hi im shayne smart the name of the candidate character hi im serenity steele alt of shayne smartgiven the requests are now  show alternative character names  all alternative characters names of shayne smart show across all accounts  all accounts that are registered to the credit card address email address of shayne smart enable candidates to post their alts and have ccp verifythese requests can at best give voters a false sense of security since candidate accounts paid for by gtc accounts under a different name will not show since candidates are capable of changing their subscription details in a matter of minutes thereby making it effectively voluntary anyway optional posting and verification by ccp can be gamed in exactly the same way at worst cloud a voters ability to make a good choice by irrelevant entertainment council members who have been elected will need all their experience to so by showing their actions answers to these posts and first hand communication ingame to really show the best they can do there is already a social control in place revealign peoples rl names that means they have a rl impact on their jobslifefuture if they are deliberately malicious there is a committee control in place 9 csm members and ccps ultimate say to reduce influence of any deliberately malicious people that leaves potential of a lot of prejudice entertaintment and tin foil hattery the last 2 are fun for sure however irrelevant to getting eve a good csm
serenity i do not disagree with youbut you know just as well as i that people do care about ingame politics in regards to the electionsome people dont want to vote for goons some dont want to vote for bobso while i agree with what you are saying those things are not really what people are looking for people just have prejudice towards certain alliances
ben is my pvp main and amuenet is a support character of mine also in axemy other four characters are my mission runner and three market checkerst1 hauler altscyno alts their identities are known in select circles but id prefer not to reveal them publically at this stage if nothing else just so i can still have time to myself ingame once the campaign is overben
thanks i forgot to mention the word prejudice edited it in
leandro salazar and tinian singh are my main characters both combat pilots one for mainly battleships and pve the other for t2 frigs and cruisers and pvpgabriel salazar is also mine but hes only a ceo char keeping my old corp alivethe other three are market industry and research alts in n00bcorps and their names are none of anyones business

i wouldnt vote for anyone on the candidate list that hasnt even bothered to enter a proper motivation there and those that havent been on the forums for weeks if at alleven the candidates that some express doubts towards put some effort in their campaign and at least they have standpoints and participate in discussion that cant be said of over half the candidates in the list
personally i would not vote for any goon whatever their true motivations might be i am fairly sure they dont have anything to do with the good of eve quite the opposite if you ask me
if you have serious issues with play time then how on earth do you expect to commit the time neccesary in order to be a valid csm canidate
i would not vote forany goonsmembers of any large alliancepure pvp playersroleplayers not a definite no but unlikely unless they recognise not everyone wants to roleplayanyone with little or no campaign information
wow that is a bold statement kudos for actually posting thatbut i do wonder where does that leave you in terms of possible candidates i mean even i could be in a major allianceim not btw but that doesnt mean im a bad person nor represent my alliance
well small alliances are fine as are small corps npc corps etci just wouldnt vote for any bobragoonnorthern allianceany other large alliance as even if they say they wont they will have their own interests which is something that in my opinion people shouldnt have if they want to be on the csm
i wouldnt vote for someone whose names i cant spell and i wouldnt for for someone who thinks the tempest is fine as it is because it isnt
ditto actually i am looking forward to seeing the face of the real jade constantine whose alliance is kos to my corp seriousy though you can search for all comments posted by any of us any candidate who resorted to name calling and personal attacks on the forums has the potential to make our days together extremely long indeed
fixing the lofty scam is one of the core issues of my campaignwhy because this is an mmo and in an mmo you should be able to team up with others without such an extreme risk of them destroying your assets it bothers me a lot that i cannot go help noobs because most of the time the people asking for help just want to gank your shippossible fix would be a 30 second delay after a war target enters gang before neutrals become a viable war target unless they activate modules so they have time to leave the gang
it is a long time since i used this tactic against farmers and i do not believe that members of the gang gets a warning message if they are in the gang iirc only the person that does inviting not the self invite those to the gang gets the warning messagethough i think it is a step in the right direction when it comes to this tactic
its easy to fixif the wardeced member joins make a popup stating it and if you decline either cant join or you are dropped from the gang no agression takes place
simple solution however this would have to be limited to only work in highsec or it will be a pain in the butt for real pvp in 00 where you often have gangs where different players are in different wars etc 
simplest solution is to just allow unlimited pew pew between gang members no more false sense of security no more accidents with concord in gangs in empireand maybe a way to paste your location into chats so people can warp to it without being in your gang
wrongpeople in your gang that are not actively at war cannot shoot until key word until they have been shotso if your war targets are paying attention it does absolutely no good to you
easy solution if you dont trust them then you form the gang and invite them then they cant invite their wardecced friend
please no more popupsi know you are all aspiring beaurocrats but theres already too many popups in the game people turn them off because popups get you killed more than anything else and its really annoying after clearing cache to have to turn them all off againif you want to do anything to this feature then change the whole way that agression and wardecs work in highsec you all state you dont want to change anything but its hardly the only feature about agression and wardecs that doesnt work another one would be repping someone in a wardec which does not flag up as an act of agression in terms of concording but rather just gives the other side an oppurtunity to shoot you also the flagging of agression doesnt always show up clearlysimple solution would be shooting someone in a wardec does not cause gang aggressionplease all your applicants remove popups dont tell ccp we want more
wrong go read the step by step instructions again and you might see what you missed
this is an mmo and as such has a right to be different from other mmos are you also suggesting that corp members should not be able to shoot each other freely part of the wonder of eve is having to work out for yourself who you can trust and indeed always having the option of betraying this trust while the lofty scam is a questionable mechanic one that i have no problem with but would have no real issue with should it be removed it is your attitude in general that concerns me i am not sure you are even playing the right mmo and much less sure that you are in a position to represent it or have i misunderstood
okay the obvious fix is adding a little check box to the options screen that says automatically leave fleet if anyone is at war with it and having the client configured to auto leave fleet if anybody from a corporationalliance at war joinsmissionrunners and people just looking for company and cooperation running hisec missions wouldnt have to be paranoid about gang invites and joining up with others pvpers and warfighters could just leave it unchecked and not have their gameplay hinderedthats the fix the deeper issue is whether we actually want that fix because eve is supposed to be a brutal and dark game of betrayal and intrigue and trust and reputation its a trick that plays on credibility and scams people into doing something dangerous with people they dont really know maybe this is actually a lesson that eve should be teaching i mean eve markets itself on being a grim environment  and we all know enough in reality that we probably shouldnt be walking down dark alleys on the bad side of town with people we dont know who want to show us something special on balance though im persuaded that the nature of this scam  waiting until the mark is in warp before inviting a warflagged patsy into gang does deserve some countermeasure because there always should be an option of escape  eve is a social game as well and i think a scam like this can damage that if nobody can ever trust anybody to team up with and do missions i remember my own first few weeks in eve and meeting random people while out shooting serpentis in fountain region and ganging up with strangers to enjoy the game with it felt good felt social helped demonstrate that not everyone in eve is a murderous badguy out to get you so on balance and on the grounds that i wouldnt like to see all adhoc gang invites from friendly mission running contacts being viewed with cyncism and distrust id be infavour of the fix above and sorting out this problem if the scammers could talk the victim into unchecking the auto leave warflagged gang option  lol tbh in that case id have much less sympathy
hmm ok let me out that idea in the form of the op so that you understand itscammer asks for help completing a missioninvites mark to gang where the mark gets the warning if there is anyone currently in the gang that has an active war decmark in warp inbound scammer invites a war target to gangeveryone in the gang gets a warning visual or that annoying popupthe mark then has a choice ofstay in the gangleave the gang asapmark now a viable war target for nearby atwar gankersmarks pve fitted ship destroyed quicklyexpensive faction modules looted and soldand the question of the op isat the first question i say that i dont want to change it my own personal opinion and i desided to awnser the second one regardless of my personal view with an idea that may or may not worki am still wrong or is it you that is wrong that i am wrong
i have to agree with jade i also think that the fix proposed is a pretty damn good onethe lofty scam has been around a while now and must surely be a reason for some trial players or new players going there are possibly other ways to deal with it that may be less popular and alter the game more drastically the easiest route is sometimes the best and this is a good onethis also keeps the harsh mistress of eve happyvote for me herecandidate thread herewebsite here
fixes1a have a war flag on a gang so that it is either war flagged or not b if the first player invited or the initiator is at war then the gang is war flagged c only players not at war can be invited to a non war gang2 change the flagging rights so that gang members dont get flagged just for being in a gang  after all the corp at war does not get flagged to the gang member so its a bit one sided atm  gang members should only pick up war flags for aiding a warring party3 add a function to broadcast location to a non ganged member so they can warp to you multiplayer missions without gangs4 add a function to broadcast sos message all players in local can lock on and warp tothere you go 4 solutions to the lofty problemdiscuss
gidday my name is ben derindar and im inviting you to vote for me in the inaugural csm election of 2008a shortish introduction follows reproduced from my campaign websitewho am iben derindar is my pvp main i am a member of the axiom empire axe alliance a bunch of guys who roam around 00 operating on nbsi policy ive played eve for four years and pvped on and off for most of that time mostly in 00 but the odd empire war too i make my isk primarily by ratting if im in 00 or by missioning if im in empireirl my name is brendan reid i am a 29yearold web developer from christchurch new zealandwhy vote for meim running for csm because i like to help people both in eve and in rl and i see the csm as another opportunity to do my bit in an environment that i enjoy in eve i regularly help out newbies when im on my npc corp alts and over 10 of my entire eveo posting history is in the new citizens qa section in the past i have drawn eve maps for people and prior to the bookmark nerf i created my own bennehinstasets and gave them away to friends and alliesmeanwhile my rl employment history reveals 8 years in radio announcing and 3 in teaching so i have plenty of experience as a communicator within group environments i have also won ccps trust in this capacity in the past in 2006 i was offered a forum moderators position within isd but due to rl commitments that arose unexpectedly at the same time i had to turn the offer downwhat are my issuesessentially they will be your issues hence my slogan it doesnt matter what i think it matters what you think thats not to say that i dont have issues of my own  certainly i will pick up on discussion of those subjects more easily than others  but my aim is to be as openminded as i can i am as much of a carebear as i am a pvper and i certainly dont want to force things one way or the otherthe benifesto offers some more reading on this subject but in summary i am personally more interested in the issues of communication between ccp and the playerbase lag in general pvp mechanics lowsec mechanics and the rmt menacefeel free to ask any questions about my campaign here thanks in advance ben
are you actually allowed to say this
yes but only because i declined it i have also checked with ccp as to whether or not it would affect my csm campaign and i am assured it does not for the same reasonben
ben the problem i have with you is the same problem i have with a number of candidates there are those of you who seem to think that not having an opinion or perhaps more correctly not sharing your opinion is a good thingwhat would you say to those of us who believe that a candidates individual opinions give valuable and necessary insight into their thought process as a csm representative you will be required to make choices and decisions on various issues and then vote according to your decision the players deserve some indication on which way you will lean when faced with these situations which will be a regular part of your duties as a representative not stating an opinion makes it appear as though you either have something to hide or you are completely uninformed about the current issues in game or you are just plain indecisive none of these are very attractive characteristics for a representative
i have to agree wholeheartedly with this sentiment and i dont mean to come down too hard on ben specifically as this is something i see in many other candidates as well  but since it was raised in this thread maybe ben can respondthe problem with this i wont push an agenda tack is that not only that we do not truly know where those candidates stand because they are concealing it but theres also little reason being put forth why they could do the job better than any other reasonably intelligent personif a candidate is claiming to be an everyman with no agenda why do they deserve to be flown to iceland to weigh in on big decisions more so than any other eve player shouldnt our csm reps be people that rise above the pack
i do have opinions on a number of subjects and im quite happy to share them when prompted my campaign website has plenty of information particularly the benifesto page in recent daysweeks i have also posted my take on several issues such as baconlocal etc on these forums and will continue to do so where and when i cani just prefer not to be so proactive with them to the point where people become concerned that i would use my position to push my own opinions at the expense of theirs because i dont believe thats what the csm is for for example what happens when an issue is heavily discussed over a period of time and a school of thought emerges that is contrary to my ownthe job of the csm as a group is to represent the will of the people as a prospective part of that group i need to be flexible in my way of thinking to be open to other ideas and yes i am negotiable on most things my position should only last until i am convinced of a better oneben
general question to other voters out there  are you discussing your choice of csm candidate with other players and campaigning for them are discussions going on within your corp about who to vote for whats the vibe out there about this whole thingjust trying to get a feel for what the interest level in this is outside the forums and how people are discussing the candidatesi assume this kind of question is okay for this forum as it pertains to the csm election  please remove it if not
not yet but ill be sure to make my choices known on our site once ive gotten the full scope of the candidates down
i still have to find that one candidate that i really like above all the others
the more i read the more im losing faith in the csm not because of the candidates there are definitely good ones theres definitely bad ones too the ones that i havent seen really making much of an effort at all im losing faith because its the crappy ones who are going to get the support this game has become infested with little kids who are too lazy to understand that this isnt wow theres risk involved in this game and you have to actually invest time in itif the devs didnt mean for it to be why does everything in this game take so long to do put up a pos take sov of a system train properly to fly a ship i could keep going but we all know anyones whos played for a while that things take more time in this game than in others i know that if im not going to play for more than an hour im just gonna sit in the station and chat or do some simple thingsokay that was a bit of a derail back to my original point the people who are so active in responding and campaigning for themselves make a lot of good points and demonstrate that they gasp understand how the game works for the most part and how its meant to be played gee thats sure horrible i know i want mr threeweeksoldanddoesntunderstandthatifsomeoneisblinkingredyoucanshoothim to be on the csm at yet for all their great posts they make one bad one or say one thing you dont like and all of a sudden welp cant vote for him i like his 123 things he said i agree with but that one there i dont so screw em this has been more and more the mindset of people on these forums which is probably why the devs dont like to come round these parts too much anymore despite all theyve done fixing things and boosting and adding things they nerfed your one thing or your one ship and even if it was a bad nerf taken too far you ignore anything the devs have done in the last few months and you put their heads on a pike for that one single thingalso judging someone based off what they are rather than what they say biggest thing ive seen with that obviously people not voting for any of the goons im glad you people cant see beyond the ticker and actually read what they are typing just look at goums posting history hes always trying to improve things thru thought out well constructed posts with points of whats wrong why its wrong what to do to fix it and why that would be the right fix and if applicable what else it would effect yet people just say oh goonignore its pretty much being racist youre trying to say that theres 5000 goons and every last one of them is the same anyone who thinks that is an idiot not because youre not a goon but because your intelligence is on par with a monkey go fling poo elsewhere same thing goes with the carebear candidates dont we need a diverse bunch id rather have someone who does missions explaining why the mission runners are having a problem with x rather than commander 00 leading the capital fleets against poses trying to explain it and vise versa judge people on their knowledge of the game thats what they are going to do is to bring their expertise in the game and take the opinions of the masses and explain why or why not its broke and ways to fix itbut because of people being completely ignorant of the purpose of the csm ignorant of why each person would be good for the csm and ignorant of what the game is meant to be i see this project failing because people will vote against anyone they dont agree with and go with the people that havent done any campaigning maybe for fear of getting any of the cliques of this game to rise against them for ridiculously  poor reasonswell that turned into a bit of a rant but its just ing me off how stupid people are getting
no prob slick different viewpoints are good  im just trying to get a feel on how different voters are seeing this thanks for the input
like akita t i have still not found a candidate to get behind i have been both impressed and unimpressed i read the rant posted by slickdrac and tend to agree that it was initially wrong of me to start out by eliminating all goons but when we look at 60 candidates we need to winnow away some to start with just for the sheer numbers eliminating some due to their associations is a viable method of this so perhaps instead of eliminating goons because they are goons i should only eliminate the goons that seem to act like goonsi read another thread that asked about alts some freely admitted to their alts others bristled at this request my first impression was they had something to hide i have not really changed that opinion yet but in a game that prides itself on any excuse to take revenge on some unsuspecting player gets top marks keeping oneself safe to play may not be a bad idea but again this goes to association just because a candidate has no association with disreputable people does not mean candidate alt is not disreputable person 1i asked a few questions on threads the candidates started they dont get answered or replied to even if it was that idea sucks and here is why its better then nothingi started my own thread on this the csm forum and got 2 replies that amounted to 4 lines and little if any informationi look and see 19 csm candidate threads here perhaps this means the rest are not worthy of considerationperhaps i should do like talkuth rel and formulate a generic post stick it in each candidate thread just to see if i can get a reply that way but then i can not expect interplay between candidates beyond perhaps goumindong and jade constantine who have been doing a good number on each otheronce i have decided whom i will support then i will decide if i will or will not campaign for them i will make my choice known to my corp as i expect they will follow my choice
people are going to lump the candidate in with his alliance naturally goum has the deck stacked against him for that singular reason i agree with you in that line of thinking that it is unfortunate that is a line of thinking however it is one i can understand
while reading this thread on the lofty scam it started me wondering what the candidates are letting themselves in forhow useful the csm is or becomes remains to be seen but theres going to be precentage of the player base that now believe that they have a direct conduit to the devsso lets take the ever increasing typical eveo post where something bad has happened and theyre going to go to the forums and vent goddamit how are these people allowed to get away with this i pay money for this game why should i be penalised for not having the time to play eve you get the picturenow instead of the forums they have a csm to vent at  and theyll listen because we voted for them goddamit the cry goes up in local just you wait im writing to the csm about you and they hit send on a badly formated rant mlmp so csm member logs in notes flashing evemail icon sighs and starts going through all the mails in the hope that one of those mails is giving the coordinates to a recently scanned dysp moon or a multi billion isk merc contracttwo minuites into being online and a convo box pops up with someone else complaining about something they perceive you can influence your corp is wondering why you dont undock anymore and youre wondering why you actually logged in tonightok im painting a pretty crappy picture but you only need to look at eveo sometimes to see its not that far fetched and anyone whos run a large corp or alliance has experienced this to some degree already you may of course disagree with me but spending time reading what people have to say vote for the one i feel best represents where id like to see the game going and then finding 3 months later they left the csm or stopped playing eve altogether wouldnt put me in the best of moodsi actually admire the candidates for putting themselves up for this its not something i have the inclination to do and none of the above was meant as critism but while people are asking what they can expect from a csm member maybe each member should start asking themselves what theyre prepared to put up with from the playerbase it is a game after all
i actually admire the candidates for putting themselves up for thisthank you for your support i am fully aware of the commitment that being a csm member if voted in will entail i am happy for my ingame playing of eve to take a backseat for a few months as csm duties would take the highest priority on my time take carebruce hansen
i wonder that tooits like austrian and the euif the eu does something good austrian politicians claim it for themselfif itsnot that good the big bad eu byrocracy did it i hope the csm isnt something for ccp to hide behind it
the trick and the serious responsibility of the csm regardless of who gets elected is to make it an effective body that works with ccp to deliver results for the players this isnt to say the csm shouldnt stridently debate some ccp decisions or hold back from serious criticism of the status quo but as the first iteration of csms they we if im lucky will be responsible for carving out how the csm will work how it will relate to ccp and what it will mean to the players by going first you have a responsibility of setting a precedent and to my mind that makes it very importnant that those members elected to the csm get their execution of thier roles right
been there already and went through it all already so i know what to expectas forum admin and admin of an uo freeserver it doesnt matter what you do theres always going to be whining and complaining and people that believe youre the one thats supposed to magically solve all their personal problems with other users even though i was the one thats devoting loads of time to the community for no compensation at all every morning the inbox was bursting in both cases i kept going on for years until the community no longer needed my servicesdespite all the hate and slack i also recieved a lot of gratitude for my efforts and thats what its all aboutits a part of being in a position where others are dependant on you or because you have something thats in demand im in the same situation as programmer people contact me to help them with all kinds of problems and a multitude of project managers want me on their team but i have to make hard choices who to help and who to decline annoying for them but im no good to anyone if i take on too much work similarly i have to filter the issues presented to me and turn down people are making unrealistic demands of me its part of the job
you raise a valid point there is a risk for the csm to be drowned in communication im anticipating a level similar to running an alliance of 80 separate corps for the forum comms side of things  having a separate csm forum for focused discussion will help enormously id also like to see the introduction of a rating system on individual forum posts  so good ideas are clearly flagged and selected voted if you like for by the readersthat wont help convoevemail deluge but it will help identify the key points being made on each side of the issues
as for eve mail maybe im making a selfish suggestion but i really want a higher character limiti already get a lot of mails and its usually mail1a mail1b mail1c and reply1a reply1b reply1c etc and copypasting it all into notepad first and back into eve once the reply is finished
excluding moons manufacturing and trading most players i notice tend to make their isk from mining ratting or running missionsplayers either make their isk in high sec or 00 making isk in low sec is mostly avoided because 00 ratting is safer from hostile players than lvl45 missions in lowsec for example this is because its easy to warp outlogwhatever the second someone enters localmaking lvl4s in lowsec safer is a nerf to the pirates pirates have a hard enough time finding targets already so this cannot happen this leaves one option making 00 ratting more dangerous than lowsec i know csms are not in charge of game design issues but if you want to represent people then they need to have a view on the above when you sit in front of some dev who asks you what you would think are good ideaswhat is your views on improving the low sec00 risk vs reward balance do you beleive that it is correct that 00 npcing should be safer for isk making than lowsec lvl45s
you cannot safe the universe in one go one has to prioritizeit occurs to me this topic is not the worst pain in the players arsehowever it think low sec l4 missions are not as unpopular as you seem to thinki personally do it all the time and i do enjoy the catn mouse with the piratesbut then again just like yourself i am only one individual and other see it differentlyso should we ever come to the conclusion that it is desireable to make 00 ratting moredifficult then i would propose to make the rats harder to kill or include more of the webbing and scramming kind to a grouphowever i do not think that we should nerf something just because it is aparrantly an relatively easy way to earn cashif we make 00 unattractive if we nerf ratting in 00 it has consequencies exodus stalling less raeson to go to 00 great for the pure pvpers so they stay amongs themselfes wrong even them need a infrastructure support supply and rats pos and outposts built as hubs for ratters become obsolete refining outposts especially one reason to contest otherwise worthless space like providence falls away your own alliance financial concept seem to rely to a large deal on renting out spacewhat would happen to that concept if all those renters dont find it attractive anymorebecause the risk has increased  and it is not as porfitable anymore as it has been i do agree we should not make missions in low sec easier pirates also need to have a chance but mission runners who run those missions are simply different people or same people in a different mood that yesterday when they wanted to rat consider taht people who rat and people who run a low sec mission do it because it is what generates teh most fun or as in my case  what real life dictatesif i had as much time as i wanted i would do the missions all day because theyre more challengin than killing a sansha in a belt off from the travel routeshowever if i am same time on daddyshift then i have to be able to just interrupwhatever i do on a moments notice thats very bad for missions with a bonus deadlineor spawns coming back after dt and so on so i go and rati dont feel its a balancing issue its just different people or people who want to changeteh routinefrankly i dont see a urgent need to change anything here well unless of course a representative average of the playerbase prioritize this matter higher
you have to identify the actual problems firsthighsec is more or less fine the way it is maybe l4s in highsec are a tad bit too lucrativeas such i would simply propose skewing the isklp rewards way down for l4 highsec kill missions down to the magnitude of courier missions and skewing them way up for lowsec even one order of magnitude higher if it must bethis way l4s in highsec are still marginally profitable bounties salvage loot yet those in lowsec are very profitable even if you completely forego lootingsalvaging or heck better said youd be a lot better off skipping that altogether and just speedrunning missions in lowsec insteadanother issue with lowsec is that although you theoretically can engage in defence measures against player pirates unless those pirates are already under 50 and a lot arent you risk slowly becoming an outlaw yourselfas such the next proposal would be to disable security status loss and npc gunturret aggro too when you attack a negative even 001 security status target in lowsecthis way you encourage a more proactive defence against most wouldbe pirates in case you actually want to police the area at allthe lp gains scaling should also affect 00 missionrunner revenue for those located in npccontrolled 00 and since those areas are usually less secure everybody has rights to dock and use the facilities its not a big problemas for true deep 00 given the buffs to lowsec id say all comes slowly to some small kind of equilibrium wouldnt know how to make deep 00 ratting more dangerous for the life of me anywayok so we have missions and ratting somewhat covered that leaves miningsimply put the mining system needs a thorough and complete overhaulfor starters the ore distribution and the mineral composition of ores everything needs to be seriously revampedyou can either make it so that all ores contain some traces of all cheaper minerals in them alongside the better minerals so for instance if you mine arkonor you dont get just some megazyd and traces of other minerals but you actually get copious amounts of lowends too or you can make it so that each asteroid has a different yield multiplier lower in 10 highest in deep 00 and mining a highyieldmultiplier asteroid gets you a lot more m3cycle compared to mining a lowyieldmultiplier asteroideither way the overall mineral distribution needs to be a lot more balanced than it is right now but not quite balanced according to needs hisec should still have an overabundance of lowends deep 00 should still have an overabundance of highends but nowhere near the current discrepancyas for the drone regions they should start getting their version of hauler spawns and the drone alloys need to be rebalanced yet again a little bitwith these changes most of the riskvsreward ratios start resembling what they should look like
as you all know a huge number of criteria affect low sec and 00 lets list just some of them1 security rating2 aggro permissions and gang aggro permissions  piracy and antipiracy3 ore value and distribution4 sovereignty and pos warfaredont you think it crazy that to shoot a pirate or someone with negative sec rating that you affect your own or that you can get concorded its total madness and needs to be resolvedperhaps a total revamp of security status is the key here maybe link it to faction warfare that is coming up do bad things in amarr space and your sec rating faction rating is only affected there with the amarr cops on your tail and an all points bulletin issued for your head or pod with amarr aligned pilots being allowed to shoot first ask questions later in 00 maybe the sec rating is not affected at all so you can be ebil or leave as is an interesting discussion pointand what about the crazy ore distribution i like what akita t sayssovereignty and pos warfare seriously needs work but we are all missing a vital element here that could skew some suggestions made and may require a change of viewccp have stated that the pos warfare situation has several iterations to go through at fanfest 2007 oveur that means there are plans to revise this and to be able to discuss fully we do need to know what ideas are already on the tablehowever i do think that some of jades ideas are good i would like to allow smaller alliances and corps a slice of the action so mini pos sovereignty as mentioned by some bright soul forgive me i cant find your post right now  i will edit it in later could be a way forward for that if indeed there is demand that this is an issue serious enough to warrant action
would you intended as the whole category of people that campaign this kind of change not you in particular stop trying to balance this around the players that can and will run missions 12 hour day using 2 or 3 high quality agents and probably multiple accounts to do the mission in premium time for every 1 player that do that there are 100 more normal persons that do 23 in a day between other things or because of rl constraints if you nerf the income they get you simply will push them in a more marginal position and convince them that is time to stop the subscription
2100 is 2300 to me i have to skip that0500 is 0700 to me during that time i usually skip my breakfast cut my skin during shaving stumble over a cat that wants to be feeded with mamooth flesh and hope my car will remember the way to the office
same for me but if theres a demand for it ill push it 1 hour backwards
i guess ill cant show up too first of all the earlier times are the times my kids awake and its breakfast time kids are most important for me i hope you can agree with thatnext step is the long weekend here in ge 1st may i already planned out this wend on family joint adventures i will not skip that none the less ill do my very best to be there on short term
i fully understand sir take care of your kids its important
is it going to be recorded and put up for downloadif not then i wanna come just to listen to it  dont really have any questions though
im gonna try my best and get it recorded ill probably have 2 machines recording it for the sake for redundancy
i will be present at the friday evening andor saturday morning events i may also turn up thursday morning but if i do i will be late as work finishes for me at 0500 eve12 hereedit nvm it appears that the thursday meet has been cancelled i can walk home now instead of run ben
i dont think im available at any of those times especially not the us ones
why not use eve voice 
if you need teamspeak service for this evetool will host it for you at no cost please let me know in gamethe server will have a 1000 slots so more than enough room for even the largest meetings
due to low turnout today the second event15 0500 wont be taken place third and fourth event will still take placethanks to the guys who did turn up we had some interesting discussionsplease send some questions to me and let me know if you can turn up the more the better
this was a bit of a short notice
discussion was excellent some very good candidates showed although some of us had mic problems new microphone buying occuring tomorrow looking forward to fridaybruce hansen
i know and im sorry for it i was made aware by other parts of the community that there was plans for something bigger as such my initial plans for these events were haltedit wasnt until a few days ago that i realized it was never gonna happen so i sponsored that teamspeak server and just threw some dates up in order to get some discussion goingwe had like 5 people on just now it was an interesting discussion but it could be so awesome with more people
my personal hope is that more people turn up for the next ones and will try and be on for the us time as well as the eu time
yep times today were not good primarily because i am a liverpool fan and something important was happening this evening but will try and make one of these at some stagegood initiative
i host another one should anyone ever careown machines no security issue  but myself of course
chars allowed in 1 post d
roflno it seems like i missed a word but there is a limited amount of slots on the server
so your only platform as a candidate is to advocate a system of briberyfirst off thats just wrong limiting what issues are addressed by the csm according to ingame wealth is in direct conflict with the purpose of the csm in facilitating communication between all players and ccpsecondly i doubt that this will end up being something which ccp will endorse or even allow as it would undermine their efforts of improving relations with the customersthe position of csm representative is one of a volunteer you should not be expecting any kind of compensation for your time and efforts it should be done because you feel it is important and worthy of your time in and of itself publicly selling your vote just shows everyone that you will not be a fair representative you will not judge issues according to what is best for the game as you will be beholden to those who have paid you off to push their issues and agendasone positive thing from your post thanks for telling us of serenity steeles involvement thats two candidates off my list
the csm is about making the game better not about making money your campaign is supposed to be about what you know about this game how you play it and why you would be right to understand and represent the communities issues this is not a political thingif it was youd fit right in however
hey chris long time no seeim yet to experience a flame fest on these new csm forums
im not sure i get the point here either tech ii bpos have to go out completely or the should stay as they are why not look at the middle waylets take a bpo and compare it to the same invented bpcthe bpo starts life with me and pe at 0 and can then be researched so that its efficiency is improved for all time to come the same invented bpc starts out with me and pe at probably either 1 or 2 depending on the items used in inventing it if none is used me and pe will be 4 these numbers are to my knowledge impossible to changeso as things are today producing stuff through invention will probably cost at least 3040 more than producing it through bpos on top of this its more timeconsuming as the producer will need to gather the items needed for invention and some of the invention runs will be failuresso where does csm candidates stand on suggestions like improving the start me and pe on invented bpcs to be 0 just like bposwhere do you stand on making it possible to do me and pe research of invented bpcsdo you believe at all that its an issue that inventors spend more podtime and isk to get an item than bpo owners who simply got an bpo in a lottery once upon a timepersonally i think that a good csm candidate is one who can actually find a balanced solution to a problem rather than simply saying its fine as it is or it needs to go
again what are you trying to solveit just seems to me like you request a change just for the sake of changeas it is now invention can make much more isk than owning a t2 bpo t2 bpos are virtually worthless if you look at the returnratesif you actually make invention bpcs me0 pe0 the only difference between t2 bpos are the invention chance and datacore costit could be very interesting to be able to research bpcs to me0 though
i do not like the idea of eliminating tech ii bpos currently in existence people got those fair and square except for youknowwho and its not right in my view to take it away even though of course for selfish reasons id prefer they were not out there i think players should be able to bank on a certain level of stability trustworthiness with regard to what they are buyingsellingobtaining
i loved it when ccp introduced the idea of invention for the most part i like the blueprint system the way it is and the bpos in existence should remain in existence i would like to see invention extended to include the invention of a bpo with slightly more skillsmaterials needed to invent a bpo rather than simply a bpc tech ii bpos ought to be fewer and farther between than tech i but just make it harder to invent onemy other pet blueprint peeve is not showing decimal amounts of materials needed for production and for large quantity production every unit of ferrogel counts
t2 bpos used to be a large problem for making t2 production and wealth essentially a crap shoot this has been fixed via invention and now all you have to do is buy into the game via invention such there is no hump that cannot be overcome by an industrialist as there was previouslybecause there is no hump despite the original imbalance there isnt much of a reason to change the system after all it would be just as if the bpo producers had bought into the invention system earlierand invention allows much faster production that bpos do
luck is always a factor when deciding who gets rich be if rare drops or tech ii bpos what i want to see is a microscopical chance to get a bpo from a successful invention run that way the bpos wont be so rare in the distant future and itll all be a non issue and people can moan about how tech iii is killing them insteadnot less but more tech ii bpos any candidate behind that sentiment
how about instead of a microscopical chance with higher skill levels and perhaps more components one can choose to attempt to invent a bpo from the tech i bpo with a similar fractional chance of successif the invention fails you get the tech i bpo returned to you but you only get 5 attempts at invention from a bpo and you can no longer make copies of it just a few thoughts
how about instead of a microscopical chance with higher skill levels and perhaps more components one can choose to attempt to invent a t2bpo from the tech i bpo with a similar fractional chance of successisnt this just another form of a tech 2 lotteryfrom the posting and discussion so far i am not convinced there is any major issues with t2 bpo i am maybe swayed that some mepe changes eg letting invented bpc be researched to some degree could be beneficial invention is probably going to be the key to t3 so having good bpc could be advantagousa good time to even out the differences between bpo bpc and invented bpc of course some system might be implemented where all t2 bpc are treated the same and its the skillsdecryptors that are used that make the t3 bpc better or worse than each otherthese are all just musings howevertake carebruce hansen
yes it is i find intermittend reinforcement more interesting than certified grind i never said i was against the lottery and i dont think anyone would have a thing against more tech ii bpos entering the game now with invention taking the edge off of the holders to begin withfor tech ii to remain viable as a trading commodity at least in times of higher tech levels id like to see it incorporated as a needed part much like tech i is now for this to not be a horrible bottleneck situation there need to be more tech ii bpos seeded not taking this route and entering tech iii as a standalone with no prerequisites takes away from the possibly deeper market where manufacturingtradinghauling tech i  ii to supply tech iii is a possibility escpecially since no one character can cover all bases on more than a few items
nothing changed to existing bpostiny amounts of bpos entering the game again through invention and explorationwill elaborate later need sleep
hi there i had a few issues and other things i would like your views onfirst what do you think the current state of the market is and where do you see it goingnext invention where do you see this going as far as tech 3 and so on its goon in sound but will it be enoughnext what i call kiddie producers you know the ones the ones who sells things below cost because there to young or stupid to really know what there doing the ones to drive the prices down due to they dont really fully understand the meaning of profit my question about them is how can we fix the issue with them i fell with out them the market will be very stable what are your views on them and how will you or how can they be fixed if there needing to be fixed
the ingame market is an open market if some wish to sell below production costs then other producers just have to deal with that many rl companies use this tactic to drive out competitionthe market is very healthy and active and since invention has become much more stable in pricing afterall if a producer puts too high a price on items inventors will quickly produce this item and undercut competition drives down the prices to a sustainable level if it goes below a sustainable profit level inventors stop making items and prices climb again this causes a small yoyo effect in prices but over time this oscillates around a stable averageinvention will be the way to t3 maybe through t2 bpc invented or runs from bpos from all indications i have seen
no im not talking about the producers who sell under production cost to drive out competition i understand the logic of that im talking about the kiddie producers who do it because they really do not know what there doingafter all there really isnt a clear cut guide for this for them they produce an item then sell it at the lowest sell price on the market to move it fast good in some ways but bad in other ways then a week or two later there broke because they had no idea what there build cost wasi guess my real questions is what can be done to help them become better producers so they know the difference between build cost profit and so on atm i just see a lot of them no knowing lost and over all confused on the subject but yet they keep on because there isnt any clear cut guides for themif we let even 10 of the kiddie producers know how to really calc there build cost and profits and so on profits for everyone will go up as there no longer undercutting everyone due to they really dont know what there doing
i guess they learn pretty quick that production may not be for them or they learn how to start doing it and making a profit and become better producers for it i take your point regarding some might not know how to producesome clearer guides that are easily accessible may be the key here

i loved the idea of reparations if a war is loston the topic of the price why not make it relative the agressor prices escalate acording to its size versus the size of the defenderthis size measurement could be sum of assets of skill points or maybe even standing with the local sovereignsounds reasonable
this can limit the war system to the rich guys and size of members can be explited by adding trial alts that just sit there to push up the price of the war and make it to expensive for the waredithow does one define assets of a corpalliance by the items in the corp hangers or the assets of all members personal assets and how will the standings work into it corp or personal  since corp standings are lower than normal and some corps dont have standings how does that count into the war fee
the number can be refined however you could make it workyou could take trial accounts out of the skill points sum or lower than xmil points for instanceassets gets tricky as if either member or hangars isk net values could make mule accounts a viable escapefor standings the corp standings if the people that run the place like the one you wanna punch better or the other way around affecting the price of a wardec seems only fairsuch a wardec would be confined to a region or to said faction sovereign space perhaps for full empire fight use concord standingedit anyway not to steal the thunder here the thread is to find candidates opnions on the wardec system not mine
my honest opinion is that it will no work much due to the potential for both sides to push the fees up or down on both sides and make it more off a isk sink to use on a mechanic that as i see it is not working as intended now numbers on what a lets say a 50 person corp and all of them has around 1020 mil sp as for assets lets say 5060 bill total both in corp assets and personal assets how much would that cost aggressing corp is half of everything of the target corpwho wants to pay 250 mil or more for a war that does not happen when the target can disband within the first 24 after the after the dec mail is sent to them and recreate a new corp and start doing the same thing without any drawbacks
i am entitled to my view and i will try to explain a bit more 1 use of third party tools that use log server logs in a way that is not intended is in my view game breaking issue since it canwill affect some peoples play style and give a unfair advantage2 development and release of tools that interact with the log server logs can open up a can of potential border line exploitation let alone the ways it can be made into a automated system for intel or doing things that does things directly to the client auto ctrlq for instance if that isnt a major issue then what is3 farmers macros isk sellers and isk buyers are and will be an issue for a long time  go to systems like ingunn where you will find a boat load of macro haulers go to systems around aramachilaahsailaisenairosoichiyamotsu and you will find a lot of lag and mission farmers go look in ice belts in high sec and tell me that the people there with names that looks like they hit their face on the keyboardin short i will stand by that and that i view it as a issue
isk farmersthey are everywhere are impossible to kill and just ruin eve i report the ones i can but i never hear if a ban gets issued or anythingwould be nice to know if im making a differencered
this is already the case with certain alliances having dev and gm members at least with this thing theres a chance of getting people supported by the on irc and msn unrepresented masses near an ear of ccp
its time to say goodbye to trinity and go to the next installment of eve with careful thought and planning the next installment in the background story of eve can also resolve a lot of the pvp issues sovereignty struggles and a whole host of other ones if done well im ready for faction warfare and for factions to begin incursions into neighboring 00so to be more concise and to the point the storyline of eve is ready to progress to the next big step
for me the lead issue is transparency so much of what goes on in eve is secret for example if i file a petition and get a node reset you might be in that node and you will never know whats gone on unless you know either me or the gm another example is the fact that most pilots particularly those who end up in large fleet engagements complain about lag we suspect through the bob scandal another transparency issue that there is s3kr3t knowledge passed on to a select few i believe that this hurts eve even the appearance of it the suspicion of it drives a wedge between the players customers and ccp i want ccp to publish everything they know about lag  what exaccerbates it are there any clientside tweaks that help what systems are worse all of this plus potentially introducing a more localised traffic advisory system if you were to attmept to jump into a grossly overpopulated system thats another secret how many pilots can fit in a given system without crashing the nodeso improving transparency both of available knowledge and the impact of decisions are my number one concern
the thing that it is the most important for the csm to discuss is without a doubt what people call capital ships onlinethe developers and many notsovocal players have expressed distaste over the overabundance of capital ships in eve and many think that the game would be more fun if they werent as ubiquitous at the same time a very vocal portion of the eve playerbase has spent many billions of isk and several months of skill training to get capital ships of their own and dont like the idea of having to change since they have invested so much into it andor they genuinely enjoy the style of gameplaycapital ships online is an issue that simply should not be neglected the developers want to work with players to reconcile disagreements with what many consider a progression into alphaclassing and not discussing this topic would be a tremendous waste of a golden opportunity and is very likely exactly the kind of issue for which the csm was intended
this has never been a reason to not change the game for the betterthat being said we can very much so make changes that make capital ships less valuable while keeping them useful
removing local takes away the chance to communicate no ransom no begging for mercy no warning this is a warzone leave while you can no roleplay thats a major for me no friendly or unfriendly interaction with people in the same sector no cries for help or offers of companionship from random folks in local no insert more reasons here in random orderon the first thought i see a lot of nos there may those who favor it explain their reasoning hereone could argue if it should be allowed to display standing flags or no or if we all should go to a constellation wide channel and really remove localbut just removing it wo showing a good alternative to compensate the nolist aboveseems to be pretty pointless i am also not convinced of the fact that this would gain the player base support  each of the csms is supposed to represent all player base to his best effort
i totally agree with zoofor me the local chan is sth like the social basic principle and basis for everyone to startget association i guess there is really no need to work on this issue
i think you got it a bit wrong its not a question of completely removing local local should still be there for social interaction but not for intel gathering as such local should be delayed
my fault i should not read write on laptop and listen the statistic lecture
hehe i make that mistake too oftengood thing visual arts class is about to start then i force myself to turn off the laptop so that it doesnt get dirty
ok that reduces my nolist to some extendhowever may i dare to ask whom a csm should represent morethe pirate who can kill the ratter much easier or the pirate that wont find targets anymore because ratters now rat in hordes or in pvp ready vessels forced by such a change is this matter of major concern to other players who are not in the yarrdepartmentwhat is the miners  ratters opinion on this could you live with such a change what consequencies will it have on alliance holding space not able to tell who moves around in their turf intel channels becoming obsolete unless visual ro scanner contact can be madeon trespassing hordesit is an iteresting topic indeed i personally could life with whatever the outcome isbut is that what the majority wants
in shorti would like it if local chat wasnt as useful as an intel tool in the way it is now but i havent seen a replacement for it that i can really feel comfortable with id love to see it gone but it is hard to predict what effects a new system could have on small gang fleet and roaming pvp as well as blobbing its very touchy
yep  i said pretty much the same thing on my own csm page
i think that for empire space local should remain call it a concord service or whatever that said i think it should be removed in 00 cough no concord or at least be at the discretion of the entity who holds sovereignty what particularly interests me is the impact of having a local on lag in busy systems
eve is expanding in new and exciting ways for manufacturers the last great leap was the addition of outposts and their upgradeswhere do you see the future taking us from herewould planetary basescolonies be the next step forward
according to my knowledge ccp has speculated about going planetside and even claiming areas on the surface for ressource gathering and warring  already 2 years agois it the way forward it certainly adds to complexity long term experience realismbut also to amount of bugs decentralisation of developer ressourcesi personally would like to see some current issues fixed first started with the performance issues that eve never really got rid of due to the constantly growing number of simultaneusly connected clients and their interactionsthen we will have to await the effects of the walking on stations bit before going to surfaces can become a topic simple and precise answer perhaps but not yet today
very interesting input here i like many of the ideas i may add my comment after a bit of pondering on the question if rolplayeractions should have an impact on how empires react i wouldrespond with a clear yes of coursehowever i fear technical limitations may make this a difficult task to accomplishcertainly some kind of logical interaction between the storyframe and huge rp accomplishments happen only very sporadicnever or far too late news too often contain insignificant items with no practical effect on anyone within eveso peopel stop reading and caring about them
making scanner probes visible on the overview as it stands you can see them on your scanner  but you cannot add them to active overview settings meaning you have to sift through moons belts wrecks cans and whatever else is in system before seeing the probe on scan its kind of annoying really
sounds like just a simple bug to me try bugreporting it this does work
the goonie is right its probably a bug if it is not i would vote for making it visibleon overview i cant see any issues there
