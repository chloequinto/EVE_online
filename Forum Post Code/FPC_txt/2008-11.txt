and the results were unsurprisingly a big feck off from ccp who cant see any compelling reason to listen to the csm lolololololola rare commendation from me for the csm members who actualy shot down all of ccps points in flames however greyscale should have been pushed much harder after his risk point was crushed and hammers blanket and vague fear of a can of worms should have been leapt on from a great height until he retracted it or specified exactly what he meant so his points could be crushed in the same way as greyscales saying no to something because you know  it might mess something or other else up somewhere maybe is not acceptableand for ccp yes a standard whitewash and another of the most popular player threads is discussed and duely ignored by the know it all divsfurther evidence that ccp only tick the box of stuff they were doing anywayin one ear  out the otherskunk

events hell yeah
i got an email this morning it was from a mmo i play a bit and it was telling me about their exciting new live in game events structure about how the game benefits from something a bit out of the ordinary something to draw people together something to change the dynamic from the familiar to the new this game was war this email made me sad war has live ingame events eve doesnt it made me die a little inside so yes i support it although the no flashy uberpwnage loot thing gets extra marks from me
first off elohel roleplayerssecond i actually agree ccp seems to have lost their nerve when it comes to letting players be involved in storyline events and for those who choose to involve themselves in the backstory its a pity that theyre cut off from the opportunity to take part the lack of playerstory interaction is probably understandable given past events within ccp but if the prizes are kept to a sensible level ie no more giving away free motherships in an event taking place in a particular 00 alliances back yard internal affairs is involved and ccp can get a competent team to work on the events and that means people who amongst other things can react to unexpected outcomes and smoothly incorporate them into the storyline then i can only see this as being a positive suggestionso yes this is a goon supporting a jade post im probably going to be kicked now
ccp grow a pair and bring back ingame events anyone who has ever been part of one of these event will have a hard time forgetting themit is a shame that newer players are missing out
blessed off  this also ties into npc corporaiton layoffs not to shamelessly plug
strangethe official thread has more pages than this issue here has voteshow come
i have to travel a lot sometimes to remote places 4 more than 1ns i was coght b real wars going on wen i get the chance to get to a pc the server was down lol or my account so by the order of ideas of pipls that defend ccp during dt no training  during exteeeeeeeended dts no training  and wen serves frick out like last time few days ago no bloody training 4 anyone cmon get real
oh by the way wen we r not loged should we b skilling
if you support this idea it looks like your friendliest candidate is garion avarr
i have often wondered this myself apparently the highsecurity groups faction navies concord customs etc wont set foot there yet we still have to pay them using charters for nothing signed
pretty sure this has something to do with 04 usually being right next to hisec
and
you do realize all npc corps will forever be kos in my vision for the future rightbut back on track i really dont see any reason why 04 is any different than 03  proximity to highsec all that does is make it a battlefield over resources if it is ever fixed more pew pew  more fun
how do i get close enough to my target then to use my blasters and my slow as hell drone carrier nerfed by the way drones i need a mwd im already loosing tanking and cap to use it ill end up being blown to bits wile my caldari opponent sits relaxed spaming local selling crap making entire eve universe an imensse jita as im still out of range in my podi need as well my implant slots and rigs for other things like armore that collaterals speed nanos i only use in unfavorable zones to avoid fightsif a cadari wants to catch me he should be able to loose is tanking to fit webs as im not fitting tank coz im using nanos also he should use their drone bay once in a wile not only 4 mininglight scout drones r fast and thers also web drones most of caldari ships have drone bay use themdoing something with nanos should b something like using cpu and power greed if u use it less resources for guns or even removing tham from game would b bether than cutting of everything abt speedeven bether would b creating counter mesures like appends in natureif a species develops a determent advantage the other should countermeasure it u guys create the rouls now deal with itsincerely the fox become faster than the rabbitnatures replyups lets shop of its legsmeh if nerfing goes at least increase my drones engagement speed speed bonuses of some races speed specialized and the ability to shoot down missiles
the whole nanonerf is a massive overreaction to a small problem that ccp caused  that could easily be solved with a few gentle tweakssadly the people at ccp who have invested so much time in developing the game and working with its community seem to have moved onto ccps new project and the new team in control of game development do not appear to have any respect for the game its history or its player basei truly hope that ccp can pull something out of the bag to save this great game
i stands to reason that a larger ship is harder to cloak than a smaller one but the current non covops cloaks use a smallish fixed amount of cpuif there was also a percentage of total cpu used it would make them harder to fit with out disadvantaging smaller ships the balancing team would have to do the exact calculations but between 25 and 10 cpu reduction for having a cloak fitted is what i think is sensibleif local gets a nerf then so should non covops cloaks
i think it would be a cool feature to be able to change a charakters facial expresion like eyes smile position of the face lighting background for free it would be a cool game feature allowing to show some emotion in the char picture and in the game is this something that could be implemented i know you can change char faces for a fee but i just think it would be cool if it was a feature you could set up from the char selection page in game allowing people to express themselves visualy in time of war or peace or any other reason
ive often wondered about having the characters portraits become more dynamic how about allowing changes within a certain percentage each time a new clone or clone jump occurs the idea behind allowing only a minimal change would be to discourage people from completely changing their character pictures in one fell swoop
i agree with skunkthey also need to make the blockade runner have some effect that includes sparkles and hearts glittering off of it when it does the wormhole thing it should look like a big pink shining heart that as the br disappears turns into a blinding white light kinda like judgment so if your watching it you get that feeling like youve been shafted cause some1 pushed the iwin button
i think blockade runners should have 100 resists to all be able to jump to anywere within eveeven jove space with no fuel or cyno needed be able to carry 101010101030249024m3 of stuff tooflame offthe changes put forward in the blog are going to go a long way to fixing them they should be pretty untouchable if the changes go ahead
skunk troll mission success
the main problem with this idea is that people have to train for literally a couple of weeks and put upwards of 4550m isk for a blockade runner limiting such in indispensible service to the elite of eve with over 3m sp and 50m isk in hand will stop any new subscriptions ever and will cause 90 of the population of hisec to immediately quitplease rework your proposal to work with velators
its cheaper to grab a blockade runner with cloak then it is to grab a freighter ie fenrirnomadand definitely less time consuming than training jump freightersi think its worth the risk i also think this topic is a jokebut oh well
jesus im glad someone else agrees with me on this alright ccp you had a great idea when you made blockade runners able to jump to black ops cynos but why would you give them the cov ops cloakyou are giving them the exploit of the microwarpcloak and now youre giving them invulnerability in a giftbasket this is an incredibly stupid idea can you rationalize why a ship that when wellfitted can beat a heavy interdictor camp needs the cloak that lets every recon and cov ops get through
i see it was just as easy to forget the agility nerf they get decloak them scram them kill thembut the low sec pirates prefer to whine they cant catch unarmed industrials
good idea ill just decloak lock and scramble a br in the 3 seconds it takes a properly fitted one to warp postnerf
wow 74 units in attack of the drones 2101214 in infiltrated outpost 46 in rogue drone harassement 7 mission against 34 122 units an average of less than 4 units for mission another 2 drone mission and i will be capable of building a cerberus i am crashing the economy
people with too much isk and not enough fun stuff to do who else  there could be limitations like say you need sov 3 for that option to become available and you can have at most one donated outpost per constellation and at most 3 to 5 per region or even only one donated outpost per region the npc you donate to must be on friendly terms with the resident npcs except in the drone regions obviously where you could just donate to anybody and so on and so forth
aka griefers
wasnt eve all about griefing anyway 
thing is an outpost doesnt just require isk it also requires you to be a sovereigntyholding alliance with a serious logistical train backing you up i can see a player burning billions for a laugh but a whole corp or alliance itll only get used in cases of security breaches by an intruderspy looking to amputate one of their targets biggest assets much as i think the game should make room for griefers and spies you shouldnt hand them devastation on a silver platter
well the outpost retains as a npc station pretty much all the functionality it already had its just that everybody can use it afterwards not just the original owneri wouldnt exactly call it devastating more like somewhat annoyingand after it becomes a npc station everybody else in the game gets a place to have a pitstop in that constellationregion not just the powerblocs normally controlling that spacepersonally if i would be a defending alliance about to be overrun i would consider donating the outpost to the npcs just so i can have a fallbackstaging area for retaliation but at the same time realize its going to do the same if the tables are turned and theres no reversing of this processit probably wont get used that much but when it will be used you can bet player influx especially neutral player influx will be significantly increased in the future
actually if you got even a single halfdecent level iv agent it would be an outrageously profitable dealspend 35b or so to create an outpost in some remote easily defendable but otherwise worthless 017 sec system and then rake in the sweet tasty rewards from running pirate missions in relatively safetyan alliance would make back the cost of the outpost in a couple of days and have a totally secure base of operations to fall back to if invadedif this idea were implemented wed see outposts being created at a fantastic rate in lowtruesec space im almost tempted to support it as the cure for the lack of carrying capacity in 00 but for the fact its simply overpowered and inflationary
yeah my vote 4 italso rigs 4 other than sentry dronesand please dont u nerf them in the futurewen caldari starts whining again geeeeesh

so what youre saying is to force people who might have no interest at the time into pvp where they can get griefed by the veteran players or to create their own corp so they can wander the galaxy with nobody to talk to sorry i disagreeif you dont like players in npc corps show them that your corp is better by appealing to their interests not by forcing the rules of the game to change to suit your attitudes i cant say this is the first thread of this type in this forum nor the fifth but it depresses me to hear so many people mad that some players actually like helping newer players
npc corp shouldnt be a perfect way to avoid pvp consequences of your actions etcsupported
not sure if this is the right answer but npc corps is one of the biggest problems in eve and needs to change
how does it punish the legitimate players
forcing you in a war you dont want or to form a 1 man corp is not punishment for youant then there is is the usual false excuse it will flush out macrominers when it will do nothing like that as they will simply create some shell corp and switch when wardecced
what about when it becomes an exploit the other way it would be very easy to use this mechanic to just grief the extremely small character corporations out of eve just war dec small and one man corps you know cant afford it then they try to form a new corp with the time they are in an npc one but as soon as they do war dec them again rinse repeat several times and they eventually stop trying and our forced to go join another player corp that is established which comes with responsibilities and demands they most likely do not want or quiet eve because who wants to play a game where your forced to play another drone in the corporate bee hiveany mechanic you introduce to eve can be exploited in one way or the other and introducing one like this to merely satisfy the hard core pvp minded would be a grave error given the larger implications of how it could be abused to easily
there are a number of casual players who find the npccorps a perfect fit for how they play the game id have to disagree with forcing these players into a wardec situation when they have no interest in thatif you want someone to shootat get your butt to lowsec or 00 and start locking horns  griefing solo characters in npccorps with an organized gang of veteran players hardly seems like the type of fight worthy of your skills
npc corps arent one of the biggest problems in eve there are alot more bigger problems while it is somewhat of an issue it isnt as big of an issue as you proclaimthe idea proposed wouldnt help fix the macro miner problems they would just form their own corperations its easy enough these days and doesnt cost much at all
it is just flat freaking too easy to wardec peopleyou got a paradox here folkson one side you have the ability to wardec atwill with a fee and no more than 24 hours noticeafter which people can freely attack and exploit the weaknesss of said victim or vice versashould the ransom be paid and or terms met theres yet an another 24 hour period and its over or is itthere is absolutely no way to prevent the wardeccor from wardecing the corp once againtheres no penalty theres no cool down period longer than 24 hours which is nothing as during that period nothing stops them from attacking anywayso this drives home the fact that players jump to npc corps to avoid the wardecits not because they dont like it its because you force them to play a stupid game that they have no way of winning let alone resolving within reasoncontrary to popular opinion while some of you guys are honorable enough to honor ransoms there are corps out there that do nothing but wardec and greif 247 non stopadd to that the ability to stack wardecs multiple oddsthe wardec fee is easy to pay off no matter the cost other than obvious limitations and rational thereon the other side you have people who hide and intentionally avoid in acts of cowardice jumping back and forththe idea is flawedand aimed at the wrong target the problem is not the system its the people who abuse itme thumbs downcome up with a better solution and youll get more supporthonestly the trouble starts at the root cause of what makes people do this the wardec system is flawed and needs to be fixedthen you can worry about the npc exploit of jumping shipeven then petitioning ccp for such actions typically resolves in a favorable solution im tolddont torture the legitimate npc players who solo it for the fun of being able to abuse the freedom of wardecim not against wardecing im against the exploitable nature of it
as i said the optional part is allowing player corporations to grief the nonplayer corporations eve online is a community with personal interactions if you want to play solitare thats fine but i fail to see how logging into a multiplayer game to sit by yourself can bring about any enjoyment also the very idea of npc corporations not going to war seems counter to the eve back stories and how the game is progressing while i have no wish to punish people in npc corporations who want to work by themselves i also want to encourage people to join player corporations and help progress eve as a whole instead of ideally sitting in jita faction warfare has helped a little in this allowing normally peaceful carebears the opportunity to jump into a ship and start warring on another faction this would be an extension of the faction warfare but would bring the safety and general nervousness of eve back in eves glorious past it was a terribly crushing blow to lose a battleship with numerous people working toward the creation of one now titans fall from the sky example bob and their fleet of titans theres no more risk to eve and makes it very boring this idea is to bring back that which eve has lost if your minmatarr and want to mine mine near rens caldari near jita however if you want to mine on someone else ore minmatar going to amarr for example there should be some risk of an attack from the rival empire as a side note this would require plag being removed from amarrcaldari states as well as pyro if any systems exsist being removed from minmatar and gallentemacromining coupled with lvl 5 missions in high sec and the mineral resources being poured our of the drone systems has cause the prices of minerals to drop heavily add to this the amount of isk in circulation and the fact that most people hide in empire eve has lost the risk that it once had and which made the game great in my opinion the bob titan loss is the most blatent example of the excess that has become eve the fact anyone can lose two titans in two days should be a wake up call that eve has gone too far into excessive and needs to be rung back in editted to include the effects of the macrominers
except your forcing people into either a permanant war dec or a 1 man corp with noone to talk to and the risk of war decs forcing people to make 1 man corps to get out of fw is forcing people to fly solo especially if they are traders with no combat skills so your removing player interaction yes by forcing them to either pvp or move into 1 man corps for traders pvp isnt an option yes because we want to pvp not because we are forced to well you are going to make eve less safe for traders so they will be uneffected because they are already in player corps and this idea only forces people to move into themor just make a 1 man corp and go wherever you feel likemacro miners will not be effected in any significant way from this as all they need to do if form a corp so stop talking about them as if they justify itremember when we had npc produced shuttles they were removed because people were buying them to reprocess for trit thus providing an upper limit to trit prices so stop making claims without providing evidenceso despite the only change in empire being an increase in suicide ganks you claim that it has gotten safer so go propose something that will actually effect themi see that you arent reading the posts that are opposed to you
also forcing people to make 1man corps means an increase in the number of corps meaning more corp names get taken
again theres no fun in a one man corporation and eve has always been a safety in numbers gameand while yes there is the risk of always being in a war decd state thats always been the enjoyment of eve whats the point in working on something if theres no risk involved i think youre obsessing on people making one man corporations lets take for example one npc corporation they have 1000 members these 1000 members are all haulersminerscarebears for a lack of a better word they have two options stay in minmattar space where minmattar authroities will help protect them or risk going to jita concord has been historically the all reaching and over powered protection force from outside invasion and pirates however there are police forces for every race if a gallente ship flies into caldari space the caldari navy should react this still allows for the safety of home world systems while still putting a risk factor on trading especially near the border towns 0506 that run the risk of being invaded the navy forces of the other races obviously shouldnt be over powering like concord but should allow some npc assistance to the citizens of their realmfor exampleim mining in hek which is relatively close to caldari space a caldari fast attack team with a handful of frigates and a few cruisers attacks hek in an attempt to disrupt minmatar trading while transports try to scurry as fast as they can back to docking range the minmatar navy reacts by sending out a few npc ships to counter the attack in this example will use 1 republic typhoon and 3 republic stabbers if the attacking team can survive the first wave then theyre given 5 minutes or whatever to continue their attack each successive wave of attack is met with a larger and larger force until the threat is destroyed or they leave the system concord reacts the same way with pirates ive seen pirates successfully fly through 5 systems in a ship as big as a cruiser with concord chasing them from point to pointas far as your other arguing points macromining does cause an increase in mineral availabilty macrominers at least from the understanding that these forums have shown and which ccp has reacted to based on that are not wanted in player corporations macrominers may adapt to making their own one man corporation but if they do then theyre able to be killed even in the relative safety of high sec space one mines one hauls the melties from a level 5 increase the mineral availability as well as lp pay outs in one lvl 5 mission you can get 60k lp two missions and you almost have enough for a cnr which runs about 200mil plus the bounties on the rats you killed and anything named that might have dropped suicide ganking has actually not been allowed its been removed if anything by concords reaction time and anyone dealing with incident is also targetted by concord also everyone has a freighter nowadays because the availability of isk is so rampant youd be silly to fly in a suicide filled world with anything less and finally eve is unsafe it always should be and there should always be a risk to everything suicide ganking is silly but a possibility through your arguements we should have golden elevators that go from the far reaches of space to jita how is that any fun with the introduction of jump freighters were almost to that point here would be the benefits to thistrading would become alot more profitable due to the higher riskraces would still have a home base in their races home systems where they would be securerens primbeka and whichever gallente hub is still used would come back into vogue with traders who wish to remain safe would start to trade back into their home system instead of exporting to jita a lucrative market would take place with interracial trading and the adoption of protection corporations
and i dont want to change player corporations or bob i want to remove the flooding of low cost minerals that are allowing player corporations with an excessive amount of money to become overly powerful while also making eve a more interactive game with risks and enjoyment and not people just trying to make money
and just as a side note about the opim not a warrior i fly haulers transports and fly hulks i can also occasionally find myself in a bs but without shields i enjoy the trade aspect of eve and would like to see it get better but npc trading is useless and mining is about as useless due to macrominers able to drain a belt in a day or lvl 5 mission runners melting down items for more trit then can be found in a pile of veld this idea was put forth with the intention to make eve more intune with the idea of faction warfare and allowing it to go back to its roots of hostile corporation market wars and in space fleet battles 00 is nice for that but the vast majority of the people in eve are within empire and dont take any risks and just get big fat and lazy i didnt expect there would be a lot of support for this idea as most people dont play eve anymore for enjoyment just the ability to trade out isk for gtc for 
short and sweethave the option to have the pos shields activate based on a standings check box make the password mechanism optional
or you could just try doing a better job of keeping the password secret so that spies cant get hold of it
whats wrong with clicking on your speed bar to set your speed whilst aligned
if you dont have a very precise mouse your not going to get the exact same speed every timespecially if your in a hurryits better to have a default speed specially when dealing with fleet opsthis way the fleet will move at the exact same speeds well as much as they can as some arent as fast as othersi get what your saying but theres a logical reason for it
noseriously nostill noeve is an mmorpg not an rts for the fc
heres an idea why not start with halfbaked ideas in the right forum for them
you will always only ever get back the ship and modules that were destroyed it is imposible for them to give you back the modules that was droped due to them haveing no way to tell if they were or were not lootedthey have to assume it was looted while you may not have been able to get your wreck back to server issues you did have other ways to go about it if you had bms the wreckyou can warp in with ur pod and not get agro and cancle the mission you can still warp to it and grab the wreck and loot basicly their hands are tied
i recently was congratulated in my corp forum for having reached a level 5 militia rank so soon after joining fw it felt good to have worked fairly hard to achieve that rank so quickly and to have been recognized for it but the feeling of pride that i had soon evaporated i began to question what good it did to have worked for that rank i had for a while checked the ranks of all the known figures in my militia and been impressed with a few of them but soon noticed that such feats were never taken into regard during the formation and operation of militia fleetsthe questions that eventually formed in my mind were what rewards await those who achieve the highest ranks in their militia and more importantly how does a militia benefit from having high ranking officersreally the last question is what i want to deal with most what good is it having ranks when they are not taken into consideration during militia activities i feel that fleet game play should reflect the idea that high ranking officers should somehow inspire those in active fleets when going into battle but i feel the role that fleetwingsquad commanders play in fw fleets undermines such a systemso how do we make faction rank fulfill this role without undermining the fleet command system already in place i have a suggestiondoes anyone remember the old ps1 rts game warzone 2100 one of the best rts games ever in my opinion because of the very original focus the game had on unit customization and squad organizationanyway one of the more useful ideas in that game was the ability of specific units to gain rank as they did more killing which gave them individual bonuses and squad bonuses thus keeping high ranking units alive no easy feat became a useful stategyi feel that such a system could work for fw characters that gain rank by performing service for their militia will in turn actually benefit their militia by adding bonuses to all militia members they fly in an active fleet withi have no suggestions as to what such bonuses should be but higher ranks should obviously grant better bonuses and the bonuses should not be stackable ie only the one highest ranking officer in any fleet should grant their bonuses except with fleetwingsquad command bonuses also an officers bonuses should only apply to his fleetmilitia members on grid with him thus if the officer leaves the field the fleet loses his bonuses though the next highest ranking officers bonuses would apply this places incentive upon keeping officers alive and upon making them primary targets such as in real warfarereally ive only been playing the game in depth for a few months so i have no real suggestions as to how such a system should work in great detail really what i want the cosm to think about is making faction rank more important to the entire fw system i feel that this kind of model would simultaneously give ranks a place in fw and provide a model for inspiration that officers should show their militia
is luminaire general and divine commodore myself for the recordanyway ive already put the lack of factional warfare goals and focus on the agenda and i think fleet bonusses for ranks are an excellent idea so ill include this in the discussion if possible however according to ccp fleet bonusses are a major cause of lag in large battles so i dont see this happeninghowever i will try to push for more meaningful factional warfare mechanics as well as rewards for undertaking militia personnel
you sound like a dissatisfied customer and should quitwhen you use words like strongarm over a user liscense agreement well i just think you have some serious issuesit seems that people in this forum dont agree with you check your vote columnthe more you try to justify your point the more you seem to have lost your mind really its sickening
eula
seems straightforward
you know i really need to start paying attention to people who can sum up what i think in smaller statementskaptain kruncer ftw
its the internet things go wonky at times they only way you should ever get reimbersed is if you can prove that you are loged on 237 which isnt going to happenif you go by this same thinking you should only pay for the time you log on while this is subscription option on some mmos in asia it hasnt been popular in western places it can also be restricting to who can play as you often need a credit cardwhile people will always want more than they are given companies will not want to give more than they have to
serious issues eh thats quite a weighty suggestion  do you mean like some sort of grave mental illness or perhaps some kind of history of abuse im just wondering where you go from reading a view that you disagree with that your read about in a few posts from a stranger on a forum to speculating about grave deep problems that the person himself might have it seems quite a dramatic leap the other option is of course that you lack the skills and civility to engage in respectful discussion among adults over issues where viewpoints may differ sitting in front of an mmmorp for hours on end pewpewing can definitely help ones brain atrophy in this regard and do you really find it sickening really let me get this straight you read a post suggesting that consumers should get the full time of what the pay for and it made you ill at the thought of it i mean i get sickened too but its usually from something like thinking about darfur or getting food poisoning i dont get physically ill when i encounter people seeking redress for something i mean you must just collapse in convulsions when standing in line and overhearing other customers at the store or at the dmv no wonder you furtively play mmos and post instead  you poor fragile soulshakari  fair points and i didnt realize that in asia they already have some kind of system like this it is true that the nature of the consumer is to want more and for the company to always want to provide as little as they can get away with im just wondering if perhaps given outages for which we dont get time credit compounded with the recent hike in gtc price along with the baitandswitch of power of two followed by ghosttrain nerf shortly afterwards ccp is recently making moves towards trying to get away with quite a lot they make such strides pretty successfully in part because they have enough fans who scream eula and try to ridiucule any dissent on the forums
dj you are the most eloquent moron ive seen in a long timeyour throwing a fit over nickles and dimesseriously take a break from this game before it consumes your life without restraintits going to cost you your healthand your sannever mindive already lost my sanity by even responding
dj the flaw with your request is that eve rarely suffers unscheduled downtimes your example that games such as wow offer reimbursement fail to mention that those same games suffer more unscheduled downtimes so eve goes down for a hour you want a free hour youve seen the numbers that hour of your time is worth so little on a individual basis its not worth the time to try and get it back on the other hand if ccp were to issue a free hour to every subscriber that amount then adds up this is lost profit for them and if it is great enough it will result in less money going back into the game yepless money going in more problems less people to fix iti agree that lost time should be reimbursed in an ideal world however i dont feel that every extra minute of downtime or the random server crash once every other month is really worth getting worked up over just remind yourself that ccp has staff on hand at all times to take care of the server just in case it does go down and they get it back online as quickly as they possibly canthink of it this way i have satellite tv so when a bad snow storm comes around and knocks out my signal for the night do i call up directv and tell them i want 1 back for the lost time
now this i like can we get the csm to do this for every thread that they take on
not too sure about this one but a search feature would be nice signed
why not look at the ships page say  would you prefer the order of capital industrial ships battlecruisers destroyers heavy assault ships etc or the order of assault ship battlecruiser battleship black ops etc i know which one i find easier to navigate and yes this page needs a better search function
personally in some ways i dont care i like killing anyway i can get it but for the sake of faction i do agree that something has to be done to better the mechanics of it i think it is a great learning experience for players for pvp and have seen it dwindle to nothing in the last few months i hate to see the game go to just missioning mining and pirate kills i think that will bore new players and eventually give me less to kill
x the ninja salvager should not be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvagedthough i have lost many a wreck to the ninja salvager i just chock it up to the cost of business have i ever ninja salvaged someone else nope that all said i would rather not see it changed for the following reason it is salvage not loot one of the oldest international laws in the world is the law of salvage per the cornell university law departmentsalvage is the reward given to persons who voluntarily assist a ship or recover its cargo from impending or actual peril or loss to make a valid claim of salvage a claimant must prove the event involved a ship and its cargo or things committed to and lost at sea or other public navigable waterways the ship or its cargo have been found or rescued the service performed by claimant must have been of benefit to the property involved in the rescuea salvor one who salvages must have the intent and capacity of committing a salvage but need not have the intention of keeping the property the salvor need not have even given physical assistance to the rescue of the ship or property in a recent new york case a ships captains decision to keep his ship nearby in case a distressed ship needed help was considered sufficient to support a claim of salvageyes there is a risk that someone will come in and salvage a wreck you have killed this is eve it is a pvp game and nothing is 100 safe
actually i take this a bit further one of my ideas was to have anybody entering the mission area if its a deadspace mission to be aggroed immediately to the mission runner and his fleet this sets up an opportunity to counter the damage before its done with the subsequent risk of the pvesetup ship being taken out by a pvperfor story purposes the agent has taken control of that task eliminating the pirate scum from concord and passes that right onto the missionrunner if invaded the mission runner does not have to fire but can do so if he wishes without concord intervention
i quite agree which is why i feel that the ninja salvager should be aggrod to the mission runner  otherwise ninja salvaging in 100 safe
x ninja salvager should not be aggoed who finds things in space owns them while there is a name on a can there is nothing on a wreck the beachcombers have been living of wrecks in the times before spaceflight and the same are living on the salvage materials that are coming from wrecks are an important part of the economy to make that illegal will harm the economy for many missionrunners let rot their wrecks unused its a simple question of tradition to make it illegal makes no sense for me and to work as a ninja salvager might be not require as much skill as running level four missions in battleships but is a fair income for the poorest of the poor for this kind of salvage needs a lot of patience and its working class style and a bit dirty dont make them criminals
thats not true according to zulupark let me quote his huge answer postso ccp is already aware about the problemsalso are battleships really supposed to be able to hit smaller ships battleships arent supposed to be solo pwn mobies
let me remind everyone what the rules arewhy then am i seeing eight issues listed on the thread and only one my live events doc submitted to the mailing list by the deadlinebecause having a meeting with only one issue on it is going to be a bit absurd  im going to extend the deadline for documentation until 1800 hours today saturday 1st novemberafter which any issue that does not come with appropriately filled out documentation submitted to the csm mailing list is getting kicked off the agenda
i cant tell since i can only see 7well all my issues submission templates were mailed to the mailing list they are even right here in this thread i was delayed 3 hours due to danish trains being late all the time but they are there
anks issue in the post above yours makes 8well all my issues submission templates were mailed to the mailing list they are even right here in this thread i was delayed 3 hours due to danish trains being late all the time but they are therei have no documents from you and no links to threads in the assembly hall do not count as completed issue templates as required inputs for csm discussion
your post just says templated form it doesnt say in file format what is the difference if its a link or clear text its just a get request difference so im sorrynot really that im not following the rules which obviously werent in place around last meeting last time all my issues were submitted on the forum but you seem to have changed thiseventually people should read the submission template in context ie the forum thread
they were past the deadline you didnt put them in an attached doc to the mailing list you didnt tell me you intended to put the text straight into assembly hall threadsnow im having a busy month charlie i guess we all are but im still taking my csm duties seriously until completion when i finish up the agenda i want to look down this mailing list and see an issue doc for each raised issue so i can check them over and be prepped for voting i dont want to be navigating through links and multiple threads and having people submitting this stuff in a dozen different places and formatsif you want to propose that we all switch issue submission formats and all use a uniform system of pasting the text straight into threads then feel free to raise it at a meeting and lets get everyone onto the same page at leastuntil then please do what i asked and respect the system weve had in place thus far that makes organizing these things possible in a timely fashion
yes by 3 hours can we move on from that already  happens and there have been worse cases of lateness during this termthere was a link attached to my mail to the mailing list though i assumed you understood that because 1 i already several times just posted the submission template in a thread 2 you didnt tell me it wasnt acceptableif i had known that it was required that you posted the submission template on the mailing list in a document dont you think i would have done that if this wasnt a case of you wanting to make members of the council look bad you would simply have mailed me and told me i should post the issues in a doc format but you didntunacceptable imoi did however send the documents straight to the mailing list now happy
ah nice to see someone of interest standing other than the expected
i dont know much about 00 politics but i am quite active in faction warfare at the moment the ideas of scagga are quite a good start but there should be more at the moment we have a lot of fun with it but besides the fun there is no use neither for republic nor for us besides some victory points for plexing so i have some ideas that might be not be new i dont know what is said before but maybe there is something usable among them first there must be consequences for the sovereign of a system that might be a docking prohibition for pilots of the enemy militia but this is to discuss in a war everything is about money so losing a system means for that faction that certain production is taken away and more important the taxes cant be collected i think to balance the taxrates of the two involved factions around the status of systems the more systems are under control the lower the taxrate for all players of that faction while doing bizz inside the empire or the republic amarrminmatar and vice versa contesting a system should take away the income from the owner slowly for bizz is not going well under siege to reconquer a system from the enemy could give reward to those who fight for there should be a motivation to do this beyond victory points i have no idea about that at the moment but will think that over maybe the victory points can give more than standing dont know at the moment this might not be the best way to do it but it will work and is a more subtile way to balance the faction war to deny docking of faction war pilots brings some problems like the loss of material in warzone this might be interesting for the supply chain breaks but is of cause a drastic measure and can have sideeffects that scare too many pilots away from faction war an other thing is contraband i tried it a bit to smuggle small arms to amarr and am not quite shure about if it is working at all with systems contesting there could be a quite funny way to open these markets for people who like to deal with forbidden fruit contested systems might be also a good way to take away all taxes and make them interesting this as some first ideas but ill think about it i was very astonished when scagga contacted me and asked me about my two cents about faction war i think there is much to do going away from stationhugging and gatecamping and moving to a more dynamic scenario with plexing is very good it leads to smaller encounters with much more fun and dynamic but its also a good way to include other interest in this war than just the idealistic ones that i follow if this war is beginning to hurt wallets then it will be of a much higher interest for all but there is of cause a balancing problem in this the losing party will lose more and more systems and more and more money weakening more and more so what is needed is something to compensate the success so the loser should have an easier part to contest systems than the winner this might be done by thinning out the amount of defending vessels this is quite logical inworld cause the more systems have to be defended by the npc vessels the thinner the fleet is stretched like in a normal war the bigger the territory the weaker and thinner the defending fleetsi dont know if this works but the mechanism is quite straight forward
i vote vuk
your proposed changes to 00 warfare would seem to favour very static engagements and by protracting them you make engaging in offensive action harder by virtue of longer supplyreinforcement lines mattering more in a protracted engagement where pilots have time to go and reship this is a potential problem for a large alliance vs large alliance situation but it is as i see it crippling for smaller guerilla style groups who want to harass and disrupt rather than conquer how can you address this potential issuewhat are your thoughts on black ops battleships the impending nanonerf and asymmetric combat in general
very good questions in ideal conditions defensive side should have advantage ofcourse massive timeresources investements in defence must pay off naturaly to defending side from the others side when it comes to guerilla warfare there is still viable ways to hurt your enemies without bringing superblob big role in this should have black ops who needs urgent attention tbh when they were introduced i was expecting above everything for them to be able warping cloaked there is also place to tweak a bit force recon ships adding pilgrim range bonus fe but from the other side its unrealistic to expect that fe 20 men guerilla force should inflict huge damage to lets say 1k member alliance perfect example are nano gangs harassing core systems and whining about blobs where is natural for even small alliances to gather blob in notime to counter them while only few jumps away they can hit farmersminerstravelers when it comes to nanonerf i will quote one of my friends who summed it perfectlyi am totaly ok with nanoing but as mentioned it shouldnt be religionwhen it comes to asymetric combat there is no win button i heard lotoff good ideas some which could be implemented and some not but if i get elected i will focus on that particular issue simply because we need to ease new pilots entering 00 without being afraid that only thing they will encounter is blob one of the simplest things which comes to my mind is adding more 00 entry points few even directly from highsec to 00 like torrinos to ecp8r atm its really hard to enter 00 cause most of the entry points are heavily camped 237we can discuss this further ofc and i would love more inputs from all of you esp people who wants to feel touch of 00sry on rather brief answer and typos but i am in the middle of fight alttabing while i am waiting to load the grid d
also i would like to greet all csm candidates i met earlier tonight during everadio interview sadly i didnt heard candidates who were after me but judging by the ones i heard csm has bright futuregood luck and all the best to everyone
what changes to the game do you want to try and effect if you get reelected
it was nice to discuss with you on eve radio this evening i hope to talk to you tomorrow at the eveuni discussion
see you there
simple question to all candidates if youre elected with the most votes and become chair will you step down from the position and allow it to be filled by a vote of the whole csm youd of course be able to run for the position again ive committed to stepping down as chair before the first meeting is out and allowing a vote to fill the position and i was wondering if other candidates would be willing to publicly state that they would do the same it seems best to get this all down before the election rather than waiting until after and debating about it when somebody has already won
yes i would step down and let a vote be taken by the csm i also believe that we should have a clear understanding of what rules of order are being used and what duties the chair is expected to perform under them and if the chair is allowed to take part in debate before any election of a chair
it was pretty much the basis of my platform for election in the first csm  nothing has changed
depends if there are 5 or more goons in the council or not i dont really want to be chairman but ill do it if i think its in the best interest of eve and the csm as a whole
assuming the goons dont conquer the universeshudder is that a yes or a no if you place first will you step aside and call a vote or will you continue as chair without a csm vote
i have stated i would elsewhereit makes sense to do so however it might make more sense for the elected chairperson to remain until the first meeting and act as coordinator etci would step down and rerun though regardless of who was elected onto the council i trust those that run are running for the right reasons for the betterment of eve for playersarithron
i definitely would as i have no intention of ever being chair also thats a bit of a silly thing to say ankh as youre pretty much my favorite councilperson and would most likely have my vote 3
the goon part was a bit of a joke of course been talking to avalloc this night and he doesnt seem match the stereotypes floating around at all even though i disagree with his opinion on the eve cemetery but hey thats evei havent actually given this much thought and havent decided either way yet but i think that democracy is important so im very likely to put it up for voting after all the other positions including the vice chair are voted on as well so it would be logical to have all of them open and it would likely result in a chair that everyone is reasonably happy with if it cuts down on internal bickering and powergames im all for it so note that down as leaning heavily towards yesand as i said im not very eager to have this sort of job as i dont like telling people when they should shut up who knows what positive input i might cut off that way if i would somehow be assigned this role id certainly do my best and put all my effort into it to ensure unbiassed and professional conduct from my end
resign a chair position if it is given to me if there was a good reason to id consider it i dont see any point in spending time to elect a new chairperson and all the potential things that can go wrong with that kind of activity if the nominal chair is fine with edit and at the job
new video
what are your views on the nanonerf specifically with its impact on small roaming gang pvp how will you try to enable not facilitate more guerilla action in 00 and how will you try to address the current mentality of more ships ongrid is betterwhat are your views on sovereignty and pos warfaredo you envision any changes to npc ai such that missions for example have fewer ships that behave more like competent players and as such facilitate entry into a pvp environment by making pve and pvp more similar and require more similar approaches rather than the very different approaches currently seen how would you address getting the same however many missions over and over again with no change effected on the game world so no sense of something greaterfew questions to get you started
having heard your views on the impending nanonerf what are your views on promoting other forms of guerilla warfare such as more cloak orientated than speed orientated combat that which black ops are meant to represent the epitome ofa would you push for this being advanced as a middling guerilla groups tool rather than the current solovery smallb what do you think about black ops bs do they need a boost a rethinka related but seperate question what are your thoughts on how to change the current mentality that more is always better through either change to existing mechanics or introduction of new ones
got my vote matey
op your posts are governed by emotional not logical reasoning you are very young in the game and from what you have said clearly do not understand the reason that these methods of manipulation and what you could term as abuseof powerintelligencefriendshiptrust we exist in eveeither start using logical reasoning or come back in a few years time imo
macros could disappear entirely and the shortfall in minerals while painful would be taken up by enterprising individuals that want to make a legal iskoh yeah im still waiting for the unnerfing of blackops bss
i am a fan of eve but i think macrominers give all miners a bad name and i am a miner i was listening to hyjink on eve radio now i maybe crazy for saying this but to reward long term player that are at a disadvantage both by skill point starts and in my case attribute points by what i have heard the story i had heard from a rl friend who also plays eve is that the start up attribute points jumped from 15 to 20 attribute points to spread around so my thought would be to allow for a reward would be a 1 or 2 point attributes points per player to put into any attribute they would like as well as let the older players who are at a kill point disadvantage the additional attribute points to helpthem out
npc or player should b the same thing for reality sakeand should get flagged to their corps alsofurther morein missionsif someone steps in with out being in ure gang corp or alliance after looting or salvaging ure wrecks should not only b flaged but also get kill rights full supporting this
they said no read the 2nd csm mins they call this the funky pos thing or something like that  still myself and prob jinx and quite a few others will be lobbying the dead horse for the next few years to come
ccp said no to a lot of stuff that would require any real work they should have expected some of the ideas brought forth by the players to require code and graphics rewrites maybe someone should start a petition about ccp unwilling to fix issues requiring more than 10 min of codingps i have messed with software code before and i do know that for this to be implemented it would take months of writing checking rewriting etc
that might be true if they didnt allready have a way to connect the poss allready i understand the modular would take time and they should do it because that is how it should have been done in the first place go do a mission or visit a complex they have control towers hooked up to all kinds of stuff they need to have poss connect one way or another
i tend to specialize in mission running so yes i have seen structures set up like this however they are not connected in the sense that they work together to accomplish a purpose no matter what the coding would take time to do as each array would need to be reworked with connection points shieldarmorstructure hp would need adjusting as obviously the shield is no more etc   
you are missing the point the connections dont have to do anything  nothing about the structure needs to change other than connecting the parts together part of the big problem is the fact that poss look terrible they magically transport things across from one thing to another they need to be connected together these connections dont need shieldarmorstructure they dont need anything but a connection from one piece to anotheri would like them to make a modular pos but if they cantwont then just make a way to connect the parts together
getting a look at the latest minutes and hey a brief mention of the problems with precision missiles but no definate stance concerning ammunition as a whole one little tag line hardly any sort of constructive examination of the massive problems with the stuffapparently the csms just dont use the stuff wonder why it sucks so they simply dont give a damn
so did they say when the cap ships are up for review then
this issue was just voted through the csm with a resounding 90 in favor of escalating the issue to ccp developer attention id like to express my thanks to the many players who have taken the time to support this issue thread and to my fellow csm delegates who have been prepared to vote yes to the proposal to bring back live events to the eve online universelets get this done
why is this  not up  go up baby

sounds good especially for those who want to take a break or have to go away for certain reasons
really if this cosm thing is about democracy at all this will happen
bump for all phoenixnag pilots everywhere ccp please fix with a cherry on top even
firstly these are logistics ships and are not meant to be wtfsolopwned machines just like recons covops stealth bombers remember one of the main purposes of titans the ability to jump bridge ships across distances well this is black ops on a much bigger scale titans are not solowtfpwned machines yeah they can dd but catch one with his pants down mainly after dding and thats pretty much minus 1 titan without any support but i digressthe same points  ideas keep coming in over and over again so i thought i would post every point that i could find about how they could be changed so here they are1 these are logistic ships mainly hence slow targetting low resists jump bridge capability etc2 there was an idea of stardrives the ability for black ops battleships being able to jump to any system to a random distance from the star without a cyno needed the advantages mean you can play solo and the disadvantages mean that you could jump randomly into a hostile gang maybe a hostile moon who knows its random to stop this being abused it would require 95 cap to use and would mean the ship couldnt move but could active modules for x amount of minutes meaning that you could be scanned out but could cloak  defend yourself3 slow targetting times but remember this is really a logistic ship4 no tank its a t2 ship but has less than t1 resists if this is fixed it could make it playable5 how about the ability to fit gang mods instead of turrets  launchers6 the ability to fit a cocd  on a covops shipmakes sense eh7 dedicated fuel bays but if we get them wont carriers etc want them too8 increased jump range this needs addressing it takes alot of fuel to jump through ships and its a shame its only a little range9 the black ops battleships need their bonuses based on their recon bonuses like the redeemer needing a nos  neut bonus10 jumping into cynojammed systems even if this is the one and only boost it would give the black op a role and i think would shut up alot of moans this would mean the covert cyno gen would need to operate in the cyno jammed system to get around the wtfpwn look maybe make covert cynos visible in cyon jammed systems11 introducing the dst as being able to use covert cynoers  can use cocd not sure if this will solve the problems just create more imho12 removing black ops pilots from local well local looks to be getting discussed in another thread so read there for more info13 more pgcpu for black op ships allowing more flexibility in fitting making this maybe a stepping stone towards a carrierfrontline it logistics it etc14 people are worried inluding ccp that they will replace cap ships this wont happen as their survivability will never be as high as a capital ship and their flexibility will never be as high as a carrier ship15 larger cargobaydrone bay instead of a seperate fuel bay would mean having to balance what you take with you and wouldnt make them wtfsolopwnswell these arent my ideas but yours i have also reposted something i found interestingbo is one of the most expensive sub capital ship in game marauder and same faction bs can compete in price but in general they are cheaperbo requires more skill points then any sub capital ship in gamebo is the most isk sink if get popped insurance payoutcovercyno needs cynosural field theory  lvl5 rank 5 and no other benefit for this skill not many ppl train this skill up to lvl5we know ccp is looking at black ops in depth but i for one would love to here about their plans anyone else
old post but still relevantblack ops need to be boosted for targeting range they basically lost 20km or so from their t1 counterpart which is unusual compared to all other t2 ships who either kept same targeting range or got betterbeing allowed to covert cyno in highsec shouldnt be a bad idea tbh
well thisnot to be a bugger but some kind of respond from a dev at some point would be nice know that it isnt always nice to have to stick your head out where it might be flamed but in the end its your jobso it would be kind of nice to hear from you on this way long overdue subjectps personally i dont think i would ever remove my subscription if there was a good queue system so it didnt cut into my rl to manage the right skills when i am not in the mood for playing
anyone notice the lack of a ccp comment anywhere in there
i agree that the lack of ccp involvement in this thread is dissapointing about the skill queue i think we defintely need a skill queie but limit it to 2 or 3 skills in the queue and require that the skills placed in the queue are ones that are already known this way you still require people to log in if they want to add a new skill to their skill sheet this way the player can string together those annoying 16 hour skills so you can go and do real life stuff while the tedious minor skill managing is handled also all training will be stopped if the account subscription is cancelled and the account goes inactive
its on their list but that can mean anything of course p
i have heard that this is being addressed in the next patch but i see no difference on sisi or am i looking in the wrong place is it a hidden setting somewhere
cloak is nerffed as it is enough over pvp issuesif u say durability for cloaking after a few hrs activity then ok
can ships with cloaks cloak other ships 
this is true skills to br costs to much in time and isk to b preferable to common industrials thats for surei think br r the only tec2 that have less slots than its tec1 originalsand also no even with cloak it arder but possible to cashthats the beauty of eve nothing here its invulnerable and should remain like that
hell give them an agility bonus a speed bonus and covert ops cloak bonusif were going to make them blatantly overpowered lets really do so and just be done with it
very funny op but much funnier is the one guy who fell for it710
nah no agents or if there are any agents a couple of measly l3s at most preferably just a l1l2
great idea def needs to be looked into at least could help out some of the pirate npc story lines etc as well as mabey involve npc pirates more with the alliances
00 that isnt npc have ratsso why would you spend 30billion to lose sovereignty and docking rights and such
soon as the station gets built people would be around to see it d as stations show up on map
would be nice to claim 00 for npc factions in my alliances case the amarr empire if that means outposts in said 00 systems being turned into npc stations thats probably a price wed be willing to pay
because you could get a guristas sov system and guristas rats in systems normally populated by sanshabloods for instanceoh and you dont lose docking rights quite the contrary you keep them and everybody else gains them too forever from that moment on no matter how the wars in the region unfoldas to why would you spend 30 bil for this hmm i dont know last time i checked there were people that bought ships for two three times that sum just because they were rare and people lost ships worth much more than that in pvphey maybe youre a budding alliance in a region without npc stations and youre afraid or maybe even almost certain the outpost you built will be overrun and you wont have the power to bring it back or youre the 235th alliance that conquered the ecp8r outpost this year and had enough of the constant toandfro so you dub it neutral land just because you can or any other number of reasons why you could should or at least would want to do it
kitsune is pronounced kit soo naythis is important
loved watching the tourney evetv coverage and partipating
where did the tornament go
the csm just voted on this issue as the largest popular outstanding public issue for meeting 12 we recorded a vote of 90 in favor of advocating the return of the tournament in the greater interests of eve online and player enjoyment its a resounding note of support from the player base and the delegates and fingers crossed we get the result we want all the best
im affraid this just got voted down 27 with just me and inanna zuni in favorthe csm believes that ccps balancing department will catch this issue before it goes live and that it is not constructive to nag them when balance changes are still being made
supported blasters shouldnt become as horribly useless for pvp as missile were for a long time
i admire the csms sunny optimism
i suppose i could relay the concerns unofficially while im at the fanfest at least that would be something
i would find kaylee to be a shiny solution and welcome replacement for scotty i know when walking in stations is introduced i am going to find scotty and shoot him
so where do you think the traders will go   a player corp where there is no mutual interest risking a griefer joining to kill them all  a fw corp meaning their trade routes are limited to one area of space while hoping that the other militia dont track them with a spy then jump in to gank them at a border systemor  a 1 man corp where they are safe until they get war decedid say the 1 man corp is much safer because they enjoy itcall me when you start using traders as an example the caldari npcs werent strong enough to protect the caldari militia in jita from gal militia shortly after fw started what makes you think they will protect traders any better a fleet which will be too small to fight off the pirates otherwise the pirates wouldnt of come and they only need to kill the miners they can have an alt on that side loot for themso lets make things easier for the pirates though a minute should be long enough for them to kill mining bargesand this wont just be the border systems they just move a few battleships over there in alts then fly the pilots there in pods then they dock up trade the bss then attack wherever they want toand how will this idea stop the macro miners from forming their own 1 man corps and then being completely unaffected unless they form the corp themselvesonly if someone war decs each corp involved and they dont jump ship before the dec goes live i note that your not providing price histories of the minerals just your personal theories which dont account for why npcs no longer produce shuttlesgo make some screen shots of the price history function
so ask for it to be brought back not some badly thought out plan pity a freighter will not hold up against someone who doesnt fear the npcs up until this idea removes the suicide aspect so we just get gankingi dont know why the traders enjoy trading all i know is that they doexcept that player corps would be out of the war dec meaning the same risk as normalplayers already form home bases oursleart is already well stocked enough to make jita only worth it for some contractonly itemswe already have interracial trading and how would a protection corp work 
yes and you do it from a player corp not a militia i suggest you move yourself into faction warfare for a month or so and see how it restricts you this idea wont stop that because macro miners will form their own corps level 5s are already in low sec meaning they are already targets for pirates meaning no change here one of which was a way for people to start pvp when they wanted to not when they were forced into it pity your ignoring that oneand that we would find willing targets not unwilling pity you are also missing that onebut what can we expect from someone that has never been in fw how would it do this because that is the play style they like in fact what pvp have you done battleclinic doesnt list any killmails involving youso your accusing a large portion of the eve player base of selling gtcs for cash without any proof even when gtcs are automatically applied to an account when purchased with isk 
yes those are the key point of your postsyou fail to see how people could like to do something different from what you like and want to force them to play as you like oh sure it is for the good of the people you are forcing as they for sure will appreciate your play stile a little information for you there is a lot of people that dont like what you like and like even less to be forced to play how you like to play and not how they like to play
changeing the way npc corps arent going to effect this at all people who want to run missions will people who want to mine will ill say it again what you are proposing to fix this issue will not fix it at all you are trying to force a way of playing on people who do not want to play that way
in all honesty i would love that to be the case but the metagaming aspect of eve makes that damn near impossible
change your passwords every day  other day  week  month like a good cooperation that is at war
it only takes one epeen emoraged 13 year old kid to reveal your entire alliances password and triple doomsday your battleship fleetthe password should not necessarily guarantee entry simple as thatif you think it is actually possible in a 2000 man alliance to keep such passwords secret you have never been in a 00 alliance
i usually took advantage of the macro miners when i was in highsec since most of them mine to jet cans and then another macro comes to pick up the ore from the can i would usually find the macro teams and flip their cans and take their ore macros dont usually respond if you take some of the ore not all of it cause if the can pops the macro may know and warp off i have also noticed that most macros have 3 things in common1 they are in a starter corp 2 i have never seen a macro mine in a t2 barge only the large t1 barge forgot the name 3 their name is usually something completely random that makes no sense ie kuygdjad i could turn quite a profit hunting macros but if i did it to an actually player and they could verify they were not a macro by holding a conversation with me i would gladly give there ore back since i didnt want to punishhurt the people who worked hard for their ore i think we should just get creative since i dont think ccp will ever do anything major to limit macros being usejust my 2 cents
as i say every time we dont need to implement new mechanicswe need to kick the farmers out of npc corps  remove their invulnerabilityintroduce a perpilot war flag that persists on that individual alone no matter how many times he jumps corp his new corp can help if he gets aggressed but not until the attacker takes the first shotin newplayer schools put a cap on skills that can be trained at tier 3 not rank 3 as the school simply cannot afford the instruction services beyond that skill tier level 3 zeroquality agents at best no freighters no mining barges of any type no agent qualties can exceed zeroin npc corps all tier skills can be trained but no freighters mining barges or pos structures can be used agent qualities capped at zero no other limitationsif the player is in a wardeclarable corp then the door is wide open for what ever operations they want to conduct theyre just exposed to the same war possibilities as anyone else jumping corp however will no longer be a free escape clause transferring to another corp does not transfer the warflag to that corporation but aiding the new pilot just might such are the risks of accepting new pilots into the corpthis will not stop macros and farmers it will only make them vulnerable to the war declaration process like everyone else
how about a system that provides a 15 minute agro flag between mining players when multiple miners are mining from the same roid the actual chance of an agroflag could be calculated by differences in standings between the players and the quantityvalue of the roid being mined and calculated when a roid is depletedthoughts
can we have the option to turn off dxgrab or we minimizes eve when we move to another program this would stop a ot of the dual monitor clamor
best i have done is used evemon to move the game to fill up the entire second screen so it looks like it is full screen just without the issues of using other programs at the same time it does run slower than when in full screen though but that is a sacrifice i am more than willing to make
i was searching the forum for an option to do just thisi guess this thread means its not possible yet 
there is a slider which effects the opacity of the windows but overview apparently doesnt get changedits in esc menugeneral settingsrighthand side
thats what everybody kept telling him but hes adamant about the policy being wrong and needing a change so he advocates either tracking who looted the items and removing them as theye given back to him or giving him duplicates of those items instead
you were lucky to get your ship reimbursed  many dont even under the circs you describeso after getting your ship back you now want the loot from your wreck dont you think its a slap in the face to those that never get their losses reimbursed to have the front to post on here about the missing mods that wasnt reimbursed
theres a few people who keep posting well i never got my ship back blah blah was this caused by a ccp error or was it your fault if its a ccp error then the policy in my opinion should be changed to accomodate losses caused through that im not going to get my items back but at least this change will help others not just myself in future if someones loots a wreck and then looses out they know the risks of stealingive made a suggestion it may get ignored it may not who knows im free to suggest something i once made a suggestion about jumpcloning and losing implants as many did i didnt get the implants back but theyve now altered the way jumpcloning and implants works making a suggestion sometimes works you just have to have balls to deal with forum trolls and those who want ccp to love them
dont get me wrong on one hand i too believe that reimbursements are a bit too rare and that for instance the lag is not reimbursable policy is just daft and that the canned logs show nothing in your favor response is mildly insulting on the other hand i would be perfectly fine with a no reimbursements ever policy toobut this is not about approveddenied reimbursements its about what exactly gets reimbursed namely just stuff that gets listed as destroyed in the killmailthe policy itself seems more than reasonable for reasons outlined above and not just thathowever in your particular case and it was a somewhat unusual case i might be inclined to agree that an exception to the policy could have been made with a few caveats for instance the most vital part the ability of the gm to verify that all other items that dropped in the can were actually in the can at the moment the can expiredstill as i have said before you werent really arguing about getting an exception to the policy but a change in the policy itself and if you werent you certainly are nowit all comes down to one thing then  when a reimbursement is granted you also wish that the items that dropped in the can be returned to younow this creates two types of problems depending on how exactly you handle the dropped loot recovery especially in cases where the can was looted instead of just having expiredproblem type one the exploiters all youd need to do was to manage to get yourself killed with a lot of valuable modules in a situation where it would be reimburseable then have somebody else neutral scoop up the dropped loot while you receive back everything including the dropped items while somebody else has them in their posession too creating effectively an item duplication machine in order to combat that youd need to actually track who picked up the items and remove them from their posessionproblem type two unfairness to whoever did pick up the modules assuming they were not exploiting or helping you exploit they have every right to keep the items in question even if your ships destruction was caused by a reimburseable mistake having the items taken away from their posession later on would be unwise worse still the items might have been already and legally sold to somebody else and isk already used up what will you do reverse the sale and leave them with a negative isk balance  or would you punish the buyer who bought the goods in good faith  it simply doesnt computecombine problem one with problem two and you have absolutely no reasonable way out than have the exact policy we do have right now  to not reimburse dropped lootthe only change in policy i could possibly agree with would be that items dropped in the wreck whould only also be reimbursed if they were still in the wreckcan the moment the wreckcan vanishesif that is at all possible to track with reasonable effort that is
youre lucky you got the ship back at all but dropped items are still alive in the database and once the can pops they are no longer associated with the ship they were mounted to they die and cannot be recovered just as if someone looted themimo there should be some manner of recovering items looted but that hampers other players in pvp situations when the server is at fault which in 80 of issues it very clearly is regardless of their faultless logsimo if the can is not looted and the items die after it expires they should be classified as destroyed with the ship and returned if any traffic activity is associated with the items db then it is locked in as still alive and cannot be returned
as stated in this thread there is an issue with the balance of sniping battleships with anormal fitting and max skills etc you can get a range of 300km in a rokh which is bonussed for range after all but it is capped at 250km for technical reasonswith every other bs you can reach the range of 250 too hybrid using spike for example as the use of the spike ammunition is the normal use for snipers and the next ammo doing more dmg then spike actually has a lot less range you cannot trade rangedamage equally that means a rokh fitted for 250km range still has to use spike for best damage like every other bs would have tobut every other bs has a damage bonus for their turrets leading to following problemthe range bonus for the rokh is of no use to it as 250km is reachable for every other battleship too using the same ammunition and additionally every other bs deals more damage at that range rokh is a sniper but has no more range than any other battleship in sniping setup but deals less damage i dont think that is intended i ask the csm to bring this issue up to to ccp
falsealso falseactually your whole post is wrong thanks for playing
while it seems your attitude is wrong but thank you for not contributing anything to the topicthe battleships talked about where of course batleships designed for turret use and i dont know what your problem is for example with a sniper fitting and spike ammo it is no problem to get a 250km range in a hyperion for example which makes the rokhs range bonus in that case useless as the hyperion still deals more damage
with a rokh you can still get more range with higherdps ammo even though the range would then be lower than spike ammo you dont always get or have to engage at max range
wtf theyre all in a tizzy over crap that doesnt have any bearing on the entire game at alland they dont make a single mention concerning the skill system that people are far more interested in or any of a dozen topics that were not touched on even remotely that do have a relevant and powerful affecteffect on the gamesuch an utter waste of time even ten seconds considering anything at all associated with ambulation
any other feedback on this
cloak shield boosters armour reps and other tank mods  noafterburner  micro warp drive  yes
all available for this function or none at allit sounds like a good idea for those items that turn off in warp gang modules which imo should not deactivate in warp bearing in mind the long slowdown time out of warp a cloaked ship is not going to be very overpowered but damnably annoying ofc a cloaker in gang warp is hosed on the arriving end
im not sure that giving fleet bonuses would be easy to implement but since you brought the subject up consider a couple of alternative bonuses that higher rank could giveive previously mentioned ideas including having rank optionally show up in the overview  a useful tool to kill the officers in a fleet first however for appreciable uses i was thinking that they would play a role in revising militia agents sending people off to cherrypick enemy officers bringing back their corpses to receive the reward  this would also lower the enemy pilots rank as a consequence this is one exampleanother ideas ive had included gaining access to a wider variety of equipment at the militia loyalty point store
x the ninja salvager should be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because the mission runner owns the wrecks and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamici have always found it odd that the contents of a wreck are considered reason to allow combat to retain but salvage which is often as valuable is considered fair game so id support changing the mechanic id also like to see a way for me to mark something as free to take with no reprecussions a lot of times i dont want the loot or salvage and id like to make it clear and safe for others to enjoy  the ninja salvager should not be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because i support ccps current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecksissler

pretty much sums up the csm and your desire for a second term becuase you are annoying
thats simply unfair being a jerk in small things does not imply being a jerk in large things
im not sure i saw any ideas to this effect in his platform or csm work please elaborate
expand on how you would facilitate playercsmccp discussion and transparency please
you have my vote eva keep up the good work
endorsement from 1st csm vicechairmanin terms of csm participation i think evas ankhesentapemkahank consistent effort to improve the communication to players and cooperation within the csm stood out amongst 1st csm members ank did a great job as secretary and in preparing and raising issues to the councilwhile i personally totally disagree with anks platform for a carebear future of dueluniverse eve i find anks increasingly mature attitude and consistently analytical input to non carebear related issues delivers value for eve players beyond her particular views on eveserenity steelevicechairman 1st csm
ankhesentapemkah is a csm candidate that represents the ideals of my corporation cooperation progress and efficiency ill vote for her and hope youll do the same
as per the mailing list i cant make it at 1500 2nd november i dont see any critical issues on this list that i find particularly contentious or universe changing so if you fail to have sufficient reps my votes are1 stop ghost training removal  darius  nay2 bring back live events  jade  nay3 courier contract limit  lavista  ja4  11 nay12 unmerge events forum  lavista  nay13 contracts api  lavista  ja14 items database needs updating  lavista  ja15 warnings and marks on accounts player viewable  darius  ja
whats your rationale behind these two votes
i dont think 2 warrants ccps efforts relative to other issues and would far prefer tools to support players in creation of their own events if eve is to be a sandbox which i firmly believe in then keep it as such and support sandbox tools ime and the history of eve shows that player organised eventsstorylines can effect significantly more players with richer and longer lasting memory the crucial issue here is encouraging players to do events by providing tools although there is already a wealth of opportunitythe merging events  gatherings ie not 12 provides more support for player events through greater visibility to both player events and player gatherings so hopefully increasing turn out for both  making that forum section more worthy of visiting its easy to get a sticky in this forum once a date and time are marked so that isnt a counter argument

by the way about money for militia thats really a problem while all people in eve get more or less rich by doing more or less useful things the militia gets nothing in return there should be some reward for the fw is nothing than a hole for money at this time of cause you can be a battlefield jackal and steal the things from those who lost everything but thats low to be true and i think its not a good thing to force the warriors into thisi only fly frigs and to pay my losses stops me from doing or gaining anything but somehow i survive those with bigger ships bear great losses billions of isk for nothing and there is no way to gain money i suggest this contesting and decontesting systems should get a reward in pay militia pilots that do nothing should get nothing killing off enemy ships should get pay not as much as rats of cause but i dont think downing an militia ships should give reward loot is enough where shall the money come from simple make taxes like i suggested in my last posting and give the income of those taxes to the militia who is really doing the job so dont insert isk into the factionwar that was not there before control it over a dynamic tax while the winning faction warriors get less and less the losing will get more and more money for their work another quite logical step i think which represents the normal dynamic in society
just registering my support for the evil ammatar scaggapretty much all you have gone over so far is what i would like to see including the small scale pvp prospects and the possibilities for more tactical 00 environmentswhat are your thoughts on alliances and consolidaion of 00 space like the further from a core hub the weaker the defences might become i have felt for a while this would encourage some more tactical aspects and a different approach to taking over someones spacealso the idea of the pillage of an outpost sounds good but maybe it could be applied to a smaller scale like inflicting actual cost damage to outposts and pos external structures i personally would like to be able to conduct raids into the fringes of an alliances space if weaker through range from the core as stated above and disrupt pos operations while inflicting a cost on repairs to external structures without needing to bring a 150 blob to do so light damage but over time an annoyance to the space owners or their tennantsgood for those like me that have long lost interest in the resource and time drain of claiming space but have no means of doing meaningful damage to such an entity without having to resort to sov warfare mechanics thoughts
firstly  touch my pilgrim and i cut you ingame i agree about more entry points into 00 but think this will only lessen the symptoms and not tackle the problemi think developing mechanics that encourage smaller fleets orchestrated at a tier above current fcing including a major revamp of the tactical overviewsolar system map perhaps making them integrated would be if possible a good way to go a soft solution to the blobbing problemit is not unreasonable to expect that a 20man gang could go in run through say 5 systems or so kill a load of ratting ships and then retreat the current gatebubble mechanics and after the nerf even more so discourage bringing in ships that do sufficient dps to effect this fast razing of the belts and moving on here a covops cloaking blackops with a larger cargobay together with the new covops cloaking blockade runners would work brilliantly still requiring recons to lock down and find targetsi like your vision for larger scale combat assuming that a large group of poorly organized poorly fit imbeciles cannot just wear down a raiding group by sheer numbers and isk or if they can it will take a lot of reships and isk lost it sucks to be killed by a load of terribly fit pve ships because they just have so many you can do aught but die how do you propose to generatefacilitate these fights along supply lines and sub battles the easiest way for a fleet to operate is all in one place shooting one or two targets and you would have to provide quite a significant imo reason to introduce so much complexity on the command side of the fight and not make it mindnumbingly complicated as it could bewhat changes would you like to see made to motherships and titans what are your views on the sovereignty grind is this an issue you would raise in the csmwhat would you do if elected for the small roaming 00 pvp corp and the pirates and lowsec denizens your original post addresses large scale 00 warfare so what about the little guy
i still dont think that reworking of tactical overview or ui will significantly changepromote smaller fleets one of the things coming to my mind is limiting fleet size on 51 people 5 wings  wing commander making a bit harder to organize the blobs also as i mention above boosting black ops recons and bombers with blockade runner change will give people ships for guerilla warfare but then again its not perfect solution cause black ops are very skill demanding and i dont see possibility for lowering their requirements another thing which can help is nerfing high end moons which will partialy decrease wish of big powerblocks for space domination because holding lotoff space will provide them more logistic work then income also maybe opening a new regions like drone space but connected directly to empire will give more space for new people as i said before there is not easy solution for this but what needs to be perfectly clear to everyone is that eve is very tough and demanding hardcore game not casual mmorpg ofcourse casual gamers can enjoy eve but they will never ever taste the uniqueness of eve as war simulationwhen it comes to sov mechanics there is maybe some slight modifications that could be implemented but more as cosmetics generaly they reward entity holding the space for current period of time which is perfectly natural for me motherships need urgent boosting i am nyx pilot for long time and tbh i dont remember when is the last time i flew it in combat brag mode on partialy because i am flying titan and 2 dreads aswell brag mode off motherships for their price compared to carriers does not provide enough reasons to fly them for me personaly their only major advantage comparing to regular carriers is possibility to fit remote ecm burst and boosting this module range rof possibility of fitting not just one module per ship is just one of the thingswhen it comes to titans they need reworking for sure i bet that ccp never thought that there will be 50 titans ingame it is matter of months when one power block will be able to field 30 titans which can totaly anihilate capital fleet this is issue that needs to be discussed with community especialy titan pilots and alliance leaders cause vast resources are invested into them so ccp needs to be carefull
well beside of whining for the bigblobs ruining 00 i am witness of lot of small corps sucessfully living there not just as petsrenters but independant entities venal region alone has dozens of poses even industrial ones without any defenses owned by small corps also i witnessed rising of a lot of small entities from 20 man corps to 500 man alliances in last year so its far from impossible to be sucessfull 00 dweller you need dedication you need time but as i said this is not hello kitty online this is cruel world where only the toughest can survivewhen it comes to lowsec i agree that rewardrisk ratio is to low i remember my 1st entering lowsec resulting in instaactivation of my clone  generaly what could be implemented are bit higher missions rewards but not much higher cause it will be more profitable then 00 farming redistrubtion of lowsec agents there are many lowsec regions almost nonpopulated concord chasing outlaws with low enough sec status not concord wtfpwnbbq blobs but frigate patrols who will harass outlaws around the gates by jamming them scramblingwebing or inflicting some moderate damage billboard on gates leading to lowsec could be broadcasting warning messages etcbut again i am pointing that eve is not casual easy wheniamdeadiwillrespawnwithnothinglost game which you can enjoy by soloing it find friends join or even create your own corporation and prepare yourself to be killedmany many times
good answers so far so more questions what is your view if any on empire war decswhat is your opinion of suicide gankingwhat reasons would an industrialist have to vote for you what issues would you push for that are in their interests
1 for vuk
tip of the day 7tonight we had a very productive csm meetingsome interesting issues were discussed i raised following issue contracts api and the future of contracts unmerge the 2 event forums update the items database courier contract limits to be changedevery issue issue was passed unanimously with a 90 vote im very happy about thisthat marks the possibly last issues meeting for this csm term its a bit up in the air if we will have another meeting before the last issue package is sent to ccphowever it doesnt matter more issues are always good but it means that this last round of submission discussions went out with a big amount of excellent issues raised by the community im very happy that i have been able to raise so many of these issues without problemstheres still plenty of groundwork to be done will i continue next year if i get elected hell yeah the race only just started
the contracts system leaves a lot to be desired especially with storefronts coming up that is a major thingsmallgang warfare is of course important to me i will keep voting for issues that has a positive effect on thatindustrial aspects of the game have been largely ignored i will keep making sure ccp is on the ball and improves these forgotten areas of the gameexploration and other pve mechanics have been left behind by ccp and they are not very exciting ccp will announce something at fanfest i dont know what i will make sure it turns out to be some great changes for the benefit of all of eve im very excited about itlowsec and 00 isnt very used its extremely thinly laid out with resources ccp has something in its sleeves im looking forward to hearing more about it and i will make sure that 00 and lowsec becomes worthwhile so we can move people out of safe empire
endorsement from 1st csm vicechairmanlavista vista showed excellent service during his first term both in raising issues and carefully thinking out impact of issues raised by other csm members in the 1st csm lavista vista was cooperative did not get drawn into the personal grandstanding and consistently stood up against bullying by other membersactively participating in the forums with constructive questions and a health suspicion for motives of other csm raising issues it is with no hesitation that i recommend that a vote for charlie lavista vista is a vote for evefurthermore i believe that charlies experience of the is key in providing continuity into the 2nd csm and the ability to pursue the longerterm issues raised in improving and changing the economy crucial as eve moves into quantum risingserenity steelevicechairman 1st csm
dont try to talk authoritatively about something you dont know stuff about and there isnt a problem you say you will consult with the playerbase on issues where you dont have personal knowledge by doing this you risk being fed drivel as a lot of the forum posts are how will you filter out the good advice from the bad if your answer is to trust people who you know ingame then you will you prevent yourself acquiring a biased view that is not good for the game as a wholecan we have a bulletpointed tldr for your initial posts it is a formidable mass of words and though you may have good points and do from what i have skimread they will be lost in the mire give us a summary that we can then use to refer back to the main text please
id like to think i learned at least a bit about that from the thread bane linked yes youre right that is a concern part of the solution is people i trust of course i have friends strewn across most of the careers in this game so theres usually at least one i can use as a sanitychecker on any given topic part of the solution is finding out the qualifications of the person im talking to im going to take an avatar pilot more seriously than a kestrel pilot when it comes to doomsday changes for example and part of the solution is more consultation while there may be drivel coming from the uninformed if you talk to enough people the uninformed will generally cancel each other out id like to think i have a decent amount of common sense and that i can separate fact from fiction most of the time garbage posing as advice is a problem and i wont pretend that im immune to it but the plan is to not get taken in by it very often and i think i can manage that that was the intention with the boldedunderlined bits  it gives you the ability to scan it quickly and have any followup information immediately at hand if one topic seems more interesting if you want a single short list however here are the high pointscsm internal introduce real rules of ordertry to move csm meetings to a forumbased formatprovide better reference materials for playersuser interfacework to establish a usermodifiable uisubmit lists of desired ui upgrades to ccp with all three submissionsgameplaymake lowsec significantly more profitablelook into a method for allowing people to defend their lowsec space without sec lossadd new charismabased skillswork for other changes if they seem to be wellconsidered ideas that will be good for the game
thanks for the kind wordsi saw in another thread which three changes the candidates are pushing for most so i figured id post my listbetter pvp balancing some issues making bounty hunting a reality and encouraging small fleet warfare over blob warfarebetter pve making mining and missions more fun allowing small deployable stations and giving ships more personalitybetter ccp pr ccps public relations have been very lacking thus id push for more transparency and more notice before major changes to the game are implemented
issler dainze  csm candiadate  let me be your voice when you scream in spacefirst thanks to eve radio for the opportunity to talk to those that are interested about my ideas for things the csm should think aboutone topic that was not discussed during my segment was one i would have liked to have addressed the customization of ships i think this is an idea that has been long overdue let me explain why and then address some of the comments ive heard against the ideafirst eve should be all about being unique we have no fixed career paths have huge freedoms in our choices and actions yet when it comes to the look of things everything is mostly the same systems look the same pilots look very similar and ships are identical not my idea of ideal i think we should have the option to make our ships unique this would be not only enjoyable but useful when trying to quickly see who is who in spaceso some of the reasons ive heard not to allow this are1 we would end up with hello kitty kestrels  that is definitely not what im proposing skinning to that degree would have technical as well as taste issues i think we should think about personalizations that stay in the character intended by the artists that have developed these wonderful assets2 it would cause lag  you could certainly implement customizations in a way that would but lets look at what the realities are of a smart set of things i could do to stand out from the other ships stripes and marking colors we already have a minimum requirement of a shader capable gpu these sorts of simple effects make my stripes blue for example can be done almost for free a few bytes of metadata from the server to the client and you have easy changes in base colors of markings corporate logos  the information to render this to ships is already loaded and available this could be done with very little perfomance impact alliance logos  again this data is already loaded into the client and available to apply to the ships  ship names  again this information is already available to the client and could easily be applied to the ship when it is renderedmore challenging but still possibiliy interesting and worth talking about manufacturing corporation  imagine if when i looked at the info for a ship it included who the corporation was that built it this is a mod i definitely would conceed would introduce new database metadata requirements still seems like it would be worth dicussing kill history  how about marks on the side of the ship that indicate the kills the ship has participated in this again would require some additional data tracking but would add an interesting element to the experiencebottom line i support the idea of letting pilots ships in eve become unique i hope i get a chance to help drive that change into evewell thats it for now until next time remember stuffs getting better stuffs getting better every day issler dainzecsm candidateceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord
issler dainze  csm candiadate  let me be your voice when you scream in spaceconcord  the worst police in the verseso one of the things i believe makes low sec so underutilized is the standing gate camps that seem to exist at key transit points in and out parts of low sec id like to talk about some of the changes id propose to make low sec more popular1 gate camps  rancer is a system that comes to mind there has been a near permanent camp into this system ever since i started in eve i would like to see something that would produce an gradually escalating concord response for the first set period wed see things as they exist now but after some period of time we see the arrival of new concord assets to drive the campers off the gate id expect something similar at the stations2 bypass gates  id be interested in looking at options that would create temporary bridge gates to allow pilots have a gate that would jump a system that has a certain level of for a set period of time again wouldnt a police force create bypasses to allow safe passage around areas with ongoing gun battles3 automatic bounties  if a pilot has lowered their security status via pvp in low sec it would seem to me that concord would eventually offer a reward for capture i think this is another mechanic that would be interesting to explore4 corpalliance wide kill rights  if i am killed anywhere but the badlands and one of my corpalliance members runs across the villian that did the deed they should have the same right to seek some payback as i have5 local deputies  if i have a corporation or alliance that chhoses to operate in a low sec system i should have some manner to build concord faction in any system once i gain a certain level of concord faction i have the ability to guard gates myself as a deputy i can engage anyone that comes into my system that has a significant criminal history of acts in low sec the deputies would recieve a bounty from concord for catching a know criminalthese are just quick thoughts on some of the things i think could improve low sec in summary i think that currently low sec should not be just 00 with gate guns there surely needs to be more concord presense there than is currently possible well thats it for now until next time remember stuffs getting better stuffs getting better every day issler dainzecsm candidateceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord
enough folks have talkied about who they are in rl here is a link to let you know a little about memicheles rl issler
miss dainze will make a great addition to the csm she represents a large group of players whos voice hasnt been heard by ccp
the ford focus does not approve of your candidacy
what will you push for with relation to small gangs low and nullsecwhat do you think about black ops bswhat do you think about current 00 blob mentality and mechanics that generate it and about possovereignty warfare
this begs for another question if the player base elects you to be chairperson are you following the will of the pilots who elected you our your ownyou see in my opinion this is what the last council forgot they were elected to do the will of the pilots  player base who elected them unfortunately the last counsel started and ended in personal fighting and bickering and really did not listen to anyone except themselves lets get it right this time lets not forget that every change we pass along to ccp affects 100 of the players to one degree or the other so we need to be sure that it is the majority who want the change not just the few who are loudest because as it is right now ccp is nerfing things to fix the nerfs that should have fixed the nerfs lol the same principle is valid for who is elected chairpersonand therefore my answer must be no if the player base elects me and i become chairperson then i will not step down without a very good reason or a conflict of interest  personal issues because there is no possible way that i could know better then the player base themselvesrorin
this raises the question of what players are voting for when they cast a ballot with your name on it i would argue that theyre trying to put you on the council not that theyre trying to make you the chair its obviously impossible to tell what the numbers are but my guess is that the person with the most votes is the person that the most people want to see on the council but not necessarily the person that the most people want to see as chair also the chair is a fundamentally internal position  most voters dont care how you make your decisions they care whether they get made and what they are now if it came down to a race between two people who wanted the top slot explicitly and the vote was based on who would be better running the council with the assumption that both would make it on then i could see you standing behind the voters put me here similarly if darius wanted the spoti mention him by name because hes about the only one who could pull it off and got the most votes by explicitly getting his alliance to vote for him in the top spot a similar argument would apply but neither of us are running with the goal or expectation of getting the most votes if it happens that i do win the most votes im pretty sure it will be because a lot of people liked my vision and not because a lot of people wanted me running the show per se as such i feel that i would not have a mandate to lead based purely on the votes cast by pilots and that i would need to seek approval from the rest of the csm in order to hold the spot legitimately if you feel differently thats fine my goal here is to get the positions of as many candidates as possible down explicitly not to attack them for holding one position or the other if a vote for you is a vote for you holding the chair if elected to it voters can know that now and can vote accordingly but thats where im coming from here
being qualified to be a delegate on the csm and being qualified to be a chairperson are two seperate things and it is a grave mistake to have them decided upon by the same votejust because ccp has set something up in a certain way does not mean that it is perfect  isnt that part of the idea of having the csm in the first place it applies not only to the game but to how the csm is elected and run
i vote for rockpaperscissors among the csm members after the election actually i would prefer the chair is determined by the csm as part of the initial face to face meeting of the csm the chair will need a particular set of interpersonal skills that cannot be determined by popular vote and having the csm get a sense of each others personal dynamics would likely produce the best choiceissler
got my vote as well
what changes to industry would you push for and why
who am i good question well first and foremost this is an alt i play alot  i have been playing eve for about 3 years give or take a few months i have lived in empire low sec and 00 i do have several characterss dotted about eve and they live their own lives and are not all interconnected like most altseg hauler alt ect most of my alts are more like main characters because i like to try different aspects of evewhy do you want to be a csm candidate well lately there are a few things that i am not happy about and its mainly the views like this tbfh its these kind of people that want to nerf mine and your play style just because they dont like it i fell for scams and i learnt from my mistakes i think we need to go to ccp and say stop nerfing war decks  lets have a review of the insurance system and  lets talk about macroers in 00 and low sec  and honestly a host of other things1 lets take a look at the insurance system instead of just nerfing empire suicide gankers to oblivion the easy option why not alter the insurance system so it makes it less profitable but not need a tera amount of ships to gank a freighter why should people be allowed to transport billions worth of stuff right across empire afk with little or no risk this need changing2 nowhere near enough war in empire at the moment the war dec system need denerfing to how it was the less preferable choice or ccp need to come up with a better system for war decs3 internal affairs need to be more vocal on what they are doing what they are investigating at the moment how many leads have they had from players ect basically just talk to us more4 macroers more information including how many banned and how many reported i know its hard for ccp but there are systems in low sec that are just a joke 00 also 5 another big one is the secondary market needs some love see market discussions forum for more info about the secondary market with trading shares improvements this would be awesome on this note ill include miners as this profession is also neglected some new ninja mining ships for use in low sec maybe not just bigger shiny ships danger mining with suitable profits ftw6 i thought i would just add this in here i did actually agree with ccps ghost training nerf as there where to many people abusing it to train characters then sell on the forums it was a no brainer reallythere are more issues im sure which will be discussed but i would also like to take this chance to say what i like about eve so you can garner a better idea about me i like the fact that there are lots of professions in eve thats when i hear of someone nerfing a profession i have to take a stand i like the fact that eve is unlike any of the other mmo wow clones out there and doesnt hold your hand all the way through the game and if youre stupid or lazy then you get owned i like the fact there is no such thing as safe space i like the fact we have probably the best market system than any other mmo but lets make it better anyway i like the fact that this game rewards team work i like the fact that the politics in this game are so in depth compared to other mmos i like the fact that eve is such a harsh place that people can actually make a very decent eve living by scamming people whether it is on contracts or corp thefts choose your friends wiselydid i mention the fact that i like eve because its so harsh well i do but more and more lately eve is becoming more generic like i dont want eve to be dumbed down do you if anyone wants to evemail me i will get back to them or you can convo me and if you have any issues that you think will coincide with my own way of thinking and should be aired if i am available i will chat to you
this guy seems legit what could go wrong
nothing
given that youre actually starting to look like you want to run legitimately i should probably tell you that the period of when you could apply closed on october 17th youre not a candidate this time so you have to wait until april to run
thats fine april is a only a few months away and theres lots to be done i need to advertise get my message out there and get good team of people behind me i think ill need a number 2 also
while i disagree with completely outlawing scamming dont you think it would be nice if the scammers would manage to get a little higher than how pathetic they are now when i read about a mothership scam i think the scammers are still pathetic but i can at least agree that they did something to get their isk in the time you used to read this post probably 20 scam chats have been added in jita local dont you think it would be nice if the local channel in trade hubs would contain more than scammers dragging their contracts into local chat or at least give people the possibility to do something about those alts but right now they will never leave the station and you cant find their main
jita scam central scam heaven why is this  beacuse its busy very busy there are two reasons to go into jita for me to scam someone or to gank someone if i need to trade legit i go elsewhere infact i usually give all the major hubs the cold shoulder it is the fact that it is the way it is that is probably the main issue the jita hub is too bigbusy people go to jita for the reasonable prices and convienence everything in one place and sometimes there in a rush they want it all now in one place the problem is so do hundreds of other people so the scammer see an opportunity to cash in on that haste and quite often does well so lots of people try it on if the trade in jita could be spread out to existing hubs andor new hubs then there would be less spam but scamming would be more lucrative as people would be less aware as it would be less in thier face like jitai do see it from your point of view though the spam is annoying and maybe ccp should introduce more tools better filters maybe having the ability to block more people or block corp contracts block people in npc corps or block trial players im all for giving people the tools to defend themselves from scamming or spam i just dont want ccp to hit with a big stick and break it disposable alts are another problem that they could look at fixing somehow as this would help aswell i hope i have answered your question in a suitable manner
hmmm  my intention was to put the brakes on ccp skillattribute point inflation on new charactera  i hadnt really thought about increasing existing players attributes or skill points this would need some more thought though it is an idea worth discussinganother approach might be to allow the trading of skillsets that a person has trained but is no longer using  for example being able to trade something like lvl5 mining for a skill which needs a similar number of skill points
first of all they did a great job for the wage they recieved  i appreciate that they stood up and tried to make a differencethat said i think the one place that the csm has failed in a significant way is that they still have not made it clear the the pilots of eve what they believe their mission is i think clarifying what they believe their role to be is key i dont believe the majority of the pilots in eve have a solid idea of what the csm was striving to achievethe next csm should make their view of their roles and the scope of their activities clear and readily available for all to seelet me be your voice in space when you screamissler
honestly i cant summarize it better than darius did so 1 to that
darius provided a pretty good summary here i think there was a lot of unnecessary chaos and drama but most of that was growing pains and personality conflicts i dont expect to see as much of going forward aside from the improvements that will happen on their own id like to see a lot of the internal procedures get cleaned up and formalized and made at least semipublic so that we can avoid nonsense like this id like to see a lot more planning go into longterm methods as well the csm should sit down once in a while talk about the bigger longerterm issues00 sov fw issues things of that nature and figure out where wed like to go and what wed like to do with them we saw some last term where this process was done well by a csm  deirdra and arithrons thread on bounty hunting and mercenaries is the most obvious  but we also saw times it was done very badly like banes threads on the roles of capital ships that could desperately have used some more consultation and thought so that they werent just statements of general dissatisfaction the meeting format needs a lot of work too the current one has severe timezone issues terrible problems with getting ever longer and discussing ever less and a real lack of proper communication between members part of that is on the heads of the members themselves  why do they wait to get into the meeting before they discuss an issue they should be doing the bulk of the arguing in the forum thread for the topic before the meeting starts  as soon as the agenda is finalized go through and comment on all of them assuming you havent done so previously as i almost inevitably will have done thatd save a lot of time on its own ultimately id like to see a publicly readable closed forum as the location for meetings and the expectation that members will actually show up and debatevote unlike what happened with the last forum debate itd take some work but its the goal i think we should set aside from that id like to see better methods of passive communication with players  threads of whats been done and how posting of minutes things like that csms are generally good about actively talking to players but a lot of players would prefer to look something up rather than pester people they dont know and right now there arent many good ways of doing that
give us your 3 target areas of concern that you will try to effect change in if you are elected as csm and a few of the changes in those areas that you will push for
short and sweet30day gtc  bring them backskill training queue needed changemore and better missionscontent for everyoneover the last few weeks i have come out of 00 and tried to do missions in highsec for iskits like watching reruns on television the poor mission runners need a buff on mission content and the amount of missions that are in the game less is more from my roaming in eve i get the distinct feeling that pilots want a working game first then eye candy and new structures the csm needs to start thinking about what they are doing and suggesting to ccpif the second csm gives 12 well thought out suggestions to ccp in the next 6 months it will be better then 100s of changes that were not well thought outrorin
a mailing lisis the wrong tool for the problem i think a combination of public and private forums is the minimum solution while i personally am fine with anyone reading my comments on a particular csm topic i know that some people will not participate in a candid manor in full public view i think a wiki to use to track issues formally identified by the csm for action would be bonuslet me be your voice when you scream in spaceissler
guess whos already setting that up
UFFFDnot ccp
youre rightthis is that document i sent to them by the waydownloadfrom what i understood yesterday either they didnt read it or it didnt stick we got our csm forum though but that came too late to be of much use certainly something we should make good agreements on for next term
and you dont pick up loot from 15 k like everyone else as the current system works their is either a small shuttle  drone running back and fourth or the modules have an improved beaming system to be able to transfer items further not the point of the arguement here though i sugest you read through the original forum post on this issue and you would see that the idea is alot more than simply connecting the modules together
i loved this idea from the moment it was first suggested way back when only hurdle to this is the existing poses out there but the leave it alone and let it change over time thing could work i guessthe biggest hurdle here is redoing all of the models which is why ccp might balk at this change but id like to see them fix some of these types of long standing issues rather than the continuous stream of new contentthe problem with this sort of thing is that its a low return aesthetic issue that works well enough but not prettily putting it at the bottom of every development queue known to man hopefully the csm can really push this because a lot of people would love to see it

actually this csm alt makes the stuff it was discussed in the last csmccp meeting and the csm was told that t2 ammo was being reexamined soon hence ccp already are looking at ittake carearithron

really bad change heres 3 accounts that wont ever be activated again
give fukin skill queue
give us queue
i agreeunlockable by skill each lvl gives 1x queue able skillskills are max queue that are lesser then 30 daysor something like it por no skill but max 2 queue able skill1skill training  1 waiting
i support the skill queue idea for purely gameplay reasons i do not want to be naive however and assume i know what that would mean for the backend development of the game and databases should all check out i thoroughly support this suggestion and hope it is released with quantum rise
just keep the thread up  no matter what  until we get the featureout of all features improvements ship tweaks etc  this one is crucial  
uhhhh i belive they said they are in fact going to fix this citaldel torps are getting a huge hp bufflinkageno more bumps needed let the thread die

at the very least this could be used to get your skills up to date with what your character has on tranquility so you can properly test out some setups

earlier on in this thread someone went a bit emo about how long it takes ccp to fix prenerfed ship classes im feeling a little less rage on the subject but i do think the guy had a pointi totally agree with ccps prenerfing approach having originally came from daoc where we regularly saw that the new classes were overbalanced i prefer ccps approachhowever when you know that youre introducing something new and that its function is intentionally limited why not have a number of optional plans ready to go based on some guess work the whole 6 month waiting period before people can really use new ships and mods is quite a painful wait at timesback on topic the fuel bay is going to be nice and the additional ability of jumping blockade runners through covert fields should help a lot on the logistics side of things i still dont think that this addresses the usability of the ship in actual combat though if black ops are the dpstanking members of the marauding guerrilla gang then some kind of bonuses towards that role would be nice they dont have to be solo death machines but a bit more in terms of resists and dps would encourage people to actively engage with these vessels right now i see this as more of an alt ship rather than something my main would be flying
hehe yer the queue has as i recall it been there the last 4 years so dont hold your breath xd
if ccp think we log in change skill then play the must be stupid i myself log in change skill log back out i only play when i feel like playing not because a skill finnished havin to log in just to change a skill is a chore and when the skill finnishes when we carnt get on well you have to go through the whole which skill will finnish when i log on or i cba to change skill or go on eve at all so im going to just leave it and miss around 36 hours of eve training which is a bit of wasted money you moan we take advantage of ghost training your taking advantage of1having us pay for 3 account slots and only been able to use the one slot to train 1 char at a time2 missing out or waisting our time on login in and changing just 1 skill

tbh i think the blockade runner is underpoweredwhy do they even need to undock they should be able to blockade jump similar to a clone jump but once every minute to any station in the universei mean undocking in a blockade runner means taking a risk  we wouldnt want that would we now ccp what were u thinkingps skunk owns 
with the approach you mention why even bother having shipsthe feature you describe is called interbus and has not been implemented transporting goods for a fee through npc transport not requiring playersits generally a bad idea
his postyour head
i think prowler also need a little pg bostgive him and crane just enought to fit a 10mn mwd and a little bit moreremind  all lvl 5 skills prowler  1625 pg a crane have 150mwd 10 ii requier  165 pg
sreegs
10mn mwd i requires 150 you have 1625  if you want the speed boost from 525 to 550 for the next few weeks you can put on a fitting mod but you have the fundamental functionality asis so theres no clear need for a change and bane next time valium after posting  less likely to faceplant the keyboard that way
blasters still need their tracking looked into come on
i believed the position of the majority of the csm was that ccp statements esp in light of zuluparks epic replies combined with the thread of concerns by players being actively read by devs in addition to the live dev blog statements meant that this issue was already being actively dealt with by ccp additionally these changes are not yet live in game but being changed on sisi with some regularityfor further details please see the last meeting chatlog
sup supdawg i got a problem i dunno what day it is in the innernet so i think a dawg need a eve day time thing what tell u what day itslike dawg when its like 600pm in space its like 2258 eve space time zone or what i dunno so when its 100 a dawg dunno if yesterday from today dig need to make it all simple for a dawg dig eve happen in da future so maybe its tomorro or some thingwhat a dawg thingmaybe make a thing what a dawg can put on they ship n it tell them what day maybe also put calandar so a dawg can be all tax due dawg when 24 hour pass maybe make recycl profession better by dis
hmmmm though while incompetently vomited onto the keyboard this concept has been of my interest quickly after joining my first multinational corporation in eve while here in lithuania it may be sunday it may still be saturday in the united states of america this leads to much confusion during multinational teams in ops as to wwhat day and at what time one should arrive if ccp could just put a 123456or7 in the left hand corner next to the timer i would be much obliged
isnt there a rule that posts on this forum have to be in english
exactly
solution is simple  a low sec system near high sec 1 jumpa stationpos in this systemcyno a stationjf jumps if agressed  dock if not under attack  jump 0km to star gate high sec cyno are useless and it will open a can of worms as ccp love to say
good idea  start a thread and ill support itskunk

hi if you have some time please read this ideas for a complete bounty hunter profession sytemyou can also read this one from spike hellthrodhope this help ccp as a basis for future improvement
i participated and showed great interest in the early work of this idea on another forum and im still fully supporting ithope those little immersive things can help
you are aware that this issue was submitted to the csm by deirdra and myself voted for escalation to ccp and discussed and given high priority at the last csmccp meetingspecific improvements and finer detail are not in the scope of the csm ccp devs decide such things your ideas should go via the features forum where devs interested in specific ideas for bh etc will read relevant threadstake carearithron
i think there is pretty wide support for not automating a warptozero for autopilot but one suggestion was to have the autoon setting for the fittings in your ship after exitting warp unless you are cloaked in which case they stay offin addition to being useful imho when in autopilot mode this would also be useful when warping around within a system for example ratting the beltsthoughts
only if i can have a button which auto tackles and ganks the enemyskunk
this  warp to 0 is not ideal it would be better if it could be removed and a solution found for bringing back bookmarks to do this with warp to 0 there is significantly less strategic advantage of reconnaissance of space and the geography of eve made more homogeneous
if the windowidea was for whatever reason not technically possible how about the ability to launch a camera drone the character would control the drone perhaps in the same technical fashion as a regular launch but if the pod was shot no clone would need to be destroyed  only the drone would be destroyed the camera drone would not have warpabilitythis would provide the mechanism i would like to see if anyone is camping the stationthoughts
fair enough after all the only reason for a short undock timer is so that if someone launches into a camp they would be screwed if they cant redockand only the people undocking need to see outside so maybe make the window only viewable during the undocking step maybe have the window load you the outside grid so that if you hit launch you dont have to load anything and if you stay looking out the window for too long your moved back into the station to save server resources
would it help if stations worked in a similar method as gates where you are placed outside cloakedthen again what if there were a 10 sec or so period after using a stargate or exiting a station where one could neither target nor be targetedjust random thoughts that struck meone thing about jumping to another gate or undocking from a station is that you appear to the world you are loading into before it loads on your pc with my other account i have tested the ability to target my other account as it undocks with the other account not fully appearing to be undocked for several secondslets face it the campee is more often than not at a disadvantage to the campers whether its a gate a station in eve or pvp corpse camping in some random rpg
ok so i am rather new here but hopefully this hasnt been posted too many timesbasically if you are training a skill once it completes training you manually have to switch it so if you arent at your computer at that time you have to log on since you cant manage skills offline  which would be very nicemy suggestion would be to have skills continue to train the next level of that skill so you complete electronics level 3 and then you begin training level 4 automaticallymaybe there is a learning skill that could be incorporated with this function maybe each rank gives you a 20 chance to rollover to the next level of the skill so at level 5 you would always rollover to the next level which would be helpful for people who cant log on and waste several hours before they can get to a computer having a skill associated would make ingame sense since it could be incorporated into the lore etc and be a timesink of its own just a thought
i would like to support this maybe this skill could replace the need for a skill queue granted you wouldnt be able to queue different skills but if a skill roles onto training the next lvl automatically it would mean we wouldnt have to log on at odd hours just to make sure we dont waste training time
this idea and ones like it have been posted at least half a dozen times and have already been taken to ccp i like the idea and i dont fault you for raising it but it doesnt need to be passed again
acceptable though i would prefer an actual queue since there are plenty of times where i dont want to train the next level right away for instance why should i train jury rigging 5 
maybe there could be a new set of ships but the catch would be crosstraining between factions like a ship that would combine features of 2 races in order to use these ships you would need to have like level 5 skills of that ship type for each racemaybe have a ship that you need skills from all 4 races i dunno just thinking out loud here
you want pirate faction ships in game look up the rattlesnake and vindicator i think those are two of them at least
eccm works fine they dont need a bost for instance like 1 week ago we engage and i was flying a domi with 2x magnetometric eccm tech ii and i had sensor strenght something like 79 we had 2 falcons but larger numbers of gang members enemy had 6 falcons we won and i never been jammed even 1 falcon tried hardly for like 710 minutes the only problem with eccm is that is not suitable for ships that have limited mid slots or have shield tank
i vote that ccp no longer reimburse players for any reason its obviously causing too many problems in the well he got his stuff and i didnt category as well as the i lost mah stuff giv it bak naough categorystop reimbursements everybody gets equal treatment no more argueing about whos fault what the logs show or the nitty gritty details of the surrounding circumstances
i agree come on ccp acknowledge this local must go not everywhere just in 00 space 01 to 10 should still sustain a live state as this is semigoverned space
tempest at 250km  nope not even with tremorapoc at 250km  nope not even with auroraraven at 250km  oh yeah easily and no loss of dps you just have to wait half an hour to hit the targetassuming these ships are not using remote assistancethe rokh is the only bs designed to engage at such extreme ranges despite its moderate dps while sniping the apoc is a strong second unfortunately the apocs lack of mids limits its ability to lock at  engage at such ranges requiring remote assistance the tempest is straining to beat 200km unless it dedicates all of its mids to tracking comps  sensor boosters making it pretty useless for hitting anything even at 250km with any transversal at all while using nerfed to crap t2 ammo spike also has pointless stacknig nerfs that gimps its effectiveness at any rangeonly the raven can effectively both lock from and shoot from 250km or more without any loss of dps using t1 ammo the balance there is the time to targetthus even with rof and damage bonuses the other bs able to engage at the rokhs range class dont do any greater damage due to poor tracking timetotarget ect
thats right the rokh is a terrible horrible sniper and it needs to be brought up to the glorious level of sniping excellence that is the tempest and the maelstrom and the like hear heari dont even know why i bother reading these boards
theres plenty of risk in salvaging ultimately were the ones taking uninsurable untanked t2 frigates into level 4 deadspaces often with faction fittings sisters scan probe launchers for example if one of those goes pop and it happens more often than youd think recon 3 anyone its a bigger hit than losing a fullyinsured t2fit battleship of course the immense amusement offered by the ninja lifestyle more than offsets the hazardsimilarly if ccp didnt want us to invade other peoples deadspaces theyd give us a way to scan out wrecks at present the only way to find them is to scan for a mission runners battleship or salvage vessel
i support being able to scan out wrecks
well thats just mean spirited
firstly i think a lot of the blame for this can be planted squarely at the feet of the players themselves i think that asking for programmatic solutions for every problem has started to lead us down a very dangerous path where the sandbox is no longer as without form as it used to be i think a lot of the problem ive had with some of the solutions presented in the name of fostering small gang engagements is that theyd only serve to further minimize what i loved in this game when i found it which is the high degree of freedomso when i think about the question of whats wrong today i try to avoid specific mechanics that would force smaller engagements small gang work exists today we have units who engage in small gang work all the time the fact is that essentially only two alternatives have been presented one alternative route seeks to create mechanics which would force gangs to be of a smaller composition limiting fleet sizes or the number of people that can be involved the other seeks to force people to be in multiple places at the same time both can have the same root problem of introducing limiters in what should be an open universe with the promise of small gang warfare in situations where small gangs were never intended to have an impactso at the end of the day id say that small gangs have their place and that people need to be more creative in their application lamenting the fact that your small gangs arent making a dent on a large alliances holdings tends to be myopic because in reality if youre applying yourself properly you will be effective the devs cant login and play eve for you at some point youre going to have to take some of that responsibility for finding the fun on yourself in any social gameregarding capitals well i think thats a contentious issue as well capitals require a lot of work and big investments it used to be that if you wanted to siege a pos you absolutely had to have capitals i think that part of the disparity that were experiencing today is a product of trying to please everyone in this regard people dont want to have to use capitals to take down poss and poss are tied to sov and integral to the game at this pointfrankly i dont have the answer to this today which is part of why i proposed the 00 roundtables well be having in iceland i think that the problem is big enough and complex enough that it will take multiples heads and a lot of brainstorming to work towards a solutionone thing i do know is that for a lot of players eve is less fun today and i think that rather than focusing on individual mechanics wrapped around niche issues id like to concentrate on that a bit more why is it not fun what can be done to spice things up i think that when people get bored is when they focus on the negative when im having fun i dont care as much about capital ships or small gangs or what im doing at the moment im having fun and living in the moment and i think that when we turn the corner and start working back in that direction well find a lot of these solutions along the way
one of the problems with the current situation is that it takes a long time before the players know what has happened with their issues often they do not know which issues have been advocated or even dealt with by ccp already threads get buried and reposted and as weve all seen the forum quickly becomes a horrible mess where it is hard to find information to that end i am currently working on a wiki which will be made public this week so players can see what the csm is currently working on and what the status of their important issues areanother problem is that most eve players do not frequent the forums or willing to post here at all for these people i want more csmwide public discussions as right now all these initiatives were organized by individual csm members i have ingame focus groups to remain in touch with the players but i have no idea what the other csm members did to this endlast right now i have the feeling that our issues end up in a black box and we often do not have insight in what happens with it currently a csm member is responsible for each individual issue and i would like ccp to mirror this and assign someone to be responsible for each issue as well if promises were made and we do not hear of it for a while id like this csm member to get in touch with the ccp employee that was assigned this issue and ask for a status update this prevents the resubmission of important issues as well just to get more information 30d gtc skill queue small freighter etc
yup a major annoyance for a lot of players i support any effort to clear up communication on those matters
a list of issues submitted voted upon escalated and voted down including links to relevant issue threads should have happened from the start if the csm term it was clear that ccp was leaving the administration up to the csm from the startultimately such a recording system needs to be linked at the start of the assembly hall forum as this is where issues need to be posted makes sense that indexes to past issues etc are here also for reference before postingits really too little too late for this csm session i agree there is a lot of room for improvement i realise that the fragmentation of sorts of the csm early on didnt help or inspire members to go the extra mile on indexes etc csm  player communication should have a very high priority for the next sessiontake carearithron
thanks for the kind wordsre furb killer alica wildfire darius shakors questions ill get down to writing answers to your pertinent questions as soon as i can

could i please take a moment to clarify what you claim i have said i have not said that life is becoming harder for pirates rather that a pirates life is becoming harder to enjoy i ask you to ponder upon this as there is a clear distinction in the meaningto address your question about my opinions on gatecamps im sure wed both accept that gatecamps are definitely not a new practice i accept that they are an established tactic that some enjoy and others find boring however i think it is important to appreciate that it is an oversimplification to say that gatecamping is becoming easier or more difficult over a period of time  without considering that many changes have affected it in different ways i do not profess to be a leading expert on the topic of gatecamping but ill do my best to analyse the problemlets look at the problem longitudinallyexamples of factors that might have made gatecamps easier superior tanking ability  heavy interdictors 00 only interdictors and warp disruption fields gallente recons  overheating  an increased eve population examples of factors that might have made gatecamps less rewarding warp to 0 carriers jump bridges and jump freighters  low sec factional warfare  jump clones  invention the list is by no means exhaustive but it gives me an impression that the problem is not an issue of single aetiology however id rather not write a thesis on the topic here and now dnow lets bring ourselves to the crux of the issue i will for our purposes make an assumption that the current system is problematic and that both pirates and their prey are unhappy with the status quo i repeat this is an assumption  i would rather gather more information to allow for a more factsubstantiated opinion ok so how would i deal with itlet me explain my principles in dealing with this issue if it were proven to be a problem i dont want to support handing out whimsical nerfs i would rather support creating new and improving existing things for people to doif you refer to my earlier posts in this thread you will notice that i have supported discussing the following notions increasing the number of stargate connections where these would be sited is a discussion in itself the principle behind this is that the eve population has grown considerably since the last introduction of new connections to bypass chokepoints and that they should stay proportional support an improvement in the variety and appeal of other options available for pirates if you refer to my main post about improving piracy as well as to the answers i gave mr slarti on the previous page you will get the main gist of what i my ideas are in this area
indeed i remember that thread in fact i replied to it  yet it may have been hard for you to locate it given how long that thread turned out to be i shall repost the answer i gave there in the following replyedit and yes i appreciate i gave a bit of a long answer but i still think it doesnt hit anywhere near all facets of where lowsec could be improved i dont think that solving problems in eve is a simple matter  i would think to question anyone who tells me otherwise
greetings scaggai do not know if you remember me but im really surprised and glad to see you campaigning for the 2nd csm election i have read all your ideas and well im really impressed by your creative potential ideas and concepts you simply add here are just answering to questions  issues in a really universerealistic feeling way flatlining outpost pillaging and many other ones for exampleas you seem to be interested by the pirate scalegameplayside im wondering if you are thinking of new ideas as well for the bounty hunter system  it is right you actually need some nrds 00 alliance to tolerate neutrals and empirelike activities in those remote areas but well scagga will correct me if im wrong but from what i understood in his program i saw big new opportunities to see alliances  if they want to become empires  to consider their territories for inhabitants and population followers market side effects settlementscolonization etc etc and not only for ressources and iskbasic rewards only farming farming farming cf alliance treaties alliances like empires

i need to go through devblogs to check bit more about wardecs cause i am not so much familiar with current mechanics but they for sure need some attention i remember some things were changed but before checking some current facts i cant tell much more when it comes to suicide ganking i see that as valid option for gameplay because current mechanics are allowing it ccp nerfed it recently so i am ok with iti am personaly heavily involved in all aspects of industry as i am leading one of the strongest industrial entities ingame from mining trade invention t2 cap and supercap production to pos chains etc i am handling those on daily level eve economy model is close to perfect as it can be in one spaceship internet game and ccp is regularly adressing industrial issues tho ofcourse there is always room for future improvementi will adress all issues regardless if they are affecting carebears pvpers mission runners miners inventors of just guys who likes to login and chat in noobcorp channel my priorities are the issues mentioned in my program but with same passion i will pursue all other problems my intention was not to flirt with whole new eden population so i could get cheap votes from empire carebears thats the only reason i set only 3 main problems i see atm in eve but i could easily wrote 40 of them if i wanted
good answer no further questions at the present time
will you use less emboss effects in your new csm signature thats the real issue at hand
i am saddened by this recent stance anounced by the ford focus i hope that someday i am given the opportunity to change the mind of this practical and popular platformissler
i read the part about concord attacking pirates in low sec and then i made a post about how crap i think that is
what will you push for with relation to small gangs low and nullsec1 having loot quantity dropped inversely proportional to the number of people on the kill mail2 making solar systems in 00 and low sec denser more resource opportunities so that a single system can sustain a number of corporations3 reviewing war declarations and expanding them via vendetas in which player ships would drop tags which would be refundible via concord4 increasing the variables during pvp introducing more tactics such as subsystem warfare guiding the implementation of t3 based heat5 fieldmine type ships that shut down cyno generators and jump bridgeswhat do you think about black ops bsthe changes to transport ships will be a significant boost to them as they are now new covert op capable haulersalthough i would love the range of these black op ships to be increased to 4ly basewhat do you think about current 00 blob mentality and mechanics that generate it and about possovereignty warfarethe clusterfuking is a problem that cant really be resolved directly although changing the nature of sovereignty via dividing star systems into environment based zones and generally increasing the variation in which sov generating structures can be attackedthe details of this will be resolved in the next few weeks
ofc
so no chair for a month or so after the election
assuming the csm is diverse in its composition ie no more than a third of the members of one alliance get elected then most definately yes
i would have been more satisfied with them increasing the effectiveness of missiles rather than slowing the ships down something needed to be done though grid overcrowding is a big issue and i dont think titans were the answer the doomsday made things worse in some aspects along with ruining the fun of the pilots who were caught in the blast the titan also has the jumpbridge which can help gridchoking lag by bypassing gatecamps but people have used it to bring ships directly unto a crowded grid already too i dont really see a solution here because everyone will want to project as much power as possible in a fight to win correction there are no fair solutions which dont give one side an advantage over the other ccp needs to be more innovative about the sov system and pos warfare there should be more advantages to having a capital sov 4 system whether it is defense guns on gates and outpost or something added in the asteroid belts to aid the alliance who holds the area pos warfare adjustments should be made too and a good solution would be to decrease the whole grid overload combat that often happens theremissions need to have more variables to them rather than a set script of what youll find and how many the ai being improved would be great but im not sure how that could be done one thing id like to see though is roaming npc gangs that are capable of going through gates or chasing fleeing targets random variables create missions that have npc blockading a station from being docked at or having taken over said station and the defense guns too ive got plenty of ideas here and ill be talking to the devs at fanfest about themill be at fanfest this week and i welcome anyone to approach me and ask questions about my campaign stances look for the guy in the blackred manual wheelchair among the goons thats me
hes lying thats me
hmm who is whoplease visit your user settings to reenable images
as a candidate for the csm what is the most important issue your campaign would be aboutonly one issue you have to prioritizedigital
the most important issue to me at the moment is the stagnation of the 00 endgame the act of conquering space is simply not rewarding enough for the amount of effort required i think an immense amount of time has been spent on things like factional warfare industry concord etc while we really havent seen any love in the 00 space in a long timewe really need to push to find some balance there while theres still players left
work on improving playercsmccp communicationthe ingame issues i care about are far to diverse to pick a personal favorite from but i think that getting the csm more involved with the players especially those that do not visit the forums as well as assuring that ccp contacts us more frequently if they have questions they want player opinions about and last getting everything were doing documented and organized although thats probably going to by my task because ccp is horribly slow in providing us with tools this is going to pay off more in the long run than any inidivual issue i think
like the last election im not going to campaign for a specific item  so i guess the most important issue for me is representing the players wishes all of them not a niche group to ccp yep im a socialist hippie
ok lets make it more specificwhat would be one thing you would like to change or not to change about evedigital
im sure that most candidates would be able to mention very important issues that they would give priority to but this question doesnt really do the candidates justice because eve is not a oneissue game a similarly structured question is like asking someone which finger theyd be most willing to have cut off my answer would be the index finger of my nondominant hand the answer might be interesting but useless for election purposes due to its limited scopea more practical answer to your question is answering it in the conditional sense my priority issue depends on what other people propose  the principle being that if elected i would make sure that the csm brings up the most important issues in every field therefore i will make sure that the ideas i bring forward compliment those brought up by other csm members so that as a result the csm pays appropriate attention to all of eves different facets
i believe the question to be nonsensical if only because several issues are going to get talked with ccp and worked on by them at once just like they have several teams of people working on different aspects of the gamethe major thing to focus on would be to improve the relationship between ccp and the rest of the playerbase and the csm in order to guarantee that the issues that matter most to us no matter what they are actually get actionned visibly progress reports and so on with that in place debating the issues can be donemeissa
taking off my csm candidate hat and addressing the rephrased questionid love to see more opportunities for exploring the darker side of a character supported by game mechanics ideally such a route should be available in the relatively unlawful badlands of lowsec which are in need of lovethatd be a start i also have to agree with darius regarding 00 stagnation etc it also is in need of attentiontake carearithron
of course theres a lot of topics i care about but if i had to place one above the others itd be the user interface the current one sucks and it provides both a worse play experience for everybody and a major barrier to the entry of new players i want to see a ui that lets the player interact with the game in as simple effective and seamless a way as possible  it should be slick effortminimizing and heavily modifiable i know ccp has done some work on this in the past and theyre planning to do more in the future but i feel theres still a major role for the csm to direct these efforts
slow down the new stuff make the current game work better stagnation on artificial mechanic heavy usage or exploitation shouldnt existedit  in 2 words  game on
issler dainze  csm candiadate  let me be your voice when you scream in spaceif i was given one thing i could fix it would be low sec i wont go into details as i have posted quite a bit about my ideas in my threads and on my campaign statement but in a nut shell low secissler dainze
i went and looked for your ideas on low sec as this is one area i have discussed on my blog and stated needs improvement can you confirm that your idea just involves concord responses to pirating in low sectake carearithron
my ideas are more involved than that here is my latest post with some of my ideas and again these need to be discussed refined perhaps expanded before they would represent what i would want the csm to propose to ccpsome low sec ideasissler
for me the item that needs the most attention is missions the abundance of t1 loot means that manufacturers cant really compete with rat droppings from missions salvage thieves are on the rise and missions are far too static if elected as csm i plan to look at each of these some preliminary ideas are already available on my webpage

i think to make these useful you need 3 things1 a covert ops cloak2 modify stealth bombers to give them a specialist role in taking down cyno jammers take down does not have to mean destroy just render inoperative make it a special module requiring an extra skill or two3 a short range detector for that module for posthis would give bops a niche roll and would make them a ship to be guarded against the idea is to give it a roll similar to the target marking that spec ops soldiers sometimes do these days namely removing strategicly chosen defenses to create an opening for the actual combat units the bos sneak in might need multiple to provide enough fuel for a longer jump pop a covert cyno a force recon and a dozen specially fitted stealth bombers come in and drop the cyno jammer pop a normal cyno and the rest drop inthe detector should provide some counter when a covert cyno opens too close to the detector it should unmask it so there is a beacon for everyone in system if you own the system and see one appear it means there is a good chance that if you do not stop the cyno jammer being taken down then bad thingstm are coming soonas a secondary effect this might open up a bit more of 00 space to newer alliances since to be safe from a drop you would need to be able to monitor gates
its not emo its frustration on the point it takes soo long and why ccp does not give more reaction on multiple treads about this black ops needed fixing  this count in general also ccp should react more in treads now the coming fuel cargo change is a step in the right direction but we need a littler bit more then this small step to make this ship what it should be
not enough people with the patience isk skills and forum whining ability to boost the whine threads to a level where ccp will listen
was suggested before was told we will look into it we got a new forum did we get this no ofc not ima support this was a gd idea then and still is a gd idea

ive stumbled over the fact which i believe many pilots in their career has the fact that people more or less often alter the content of kill mails prior to posting themthe tampering maybe be done to remove unwanted pilots or to change the statistics in one way or another as a techie i believe that this could be fixed in a very simple waysay for example that the kill mails sent are signed by gpg which is a freeware and may be downloaded from
the thing is if you want to assure accuracy in the system you should be ensuring it all the way through not only when it comes to ensuring that individual mails are accurate but also when it comes to ensuring that theyre representative and complete if people not on the kill have a right to know how it went then they also have a right to know about the kill if youd rather keep it quiet right ccp has said thats not going to happen and i agree with their rationale killmails exist to inform the players involved of what happened any use outside the dead guy and the guy who scored the final blow is incidental
moved to assembly hall
ok what if all killmails were stored in a ccps killmail serverif you die or kill someone you get a killmail linkyou copy and paste the killmail link to your local killmail serverthe killmail is retrieved once from ccps killmail server to the local killmail servers databaseto avoid abuse of ccps killmail server usage some kind of bandwidth limitation or download amount limit per period would be probably enough
sorry to necro a thread but thought people might be interested the missile effect from the late beta movie on the videos page particularly the caracal firing at about 112 or so linky to videos page wouldnt have to be too flashy but even something like this would be great for the times you just wanna see something scifiy involving guns and missiles

what does transport ships skill book accomplish other than being a requisite of something else at level vhow about a buff per transport ship level
what skill needs transport v
i seem to recall somethingbut its slipping my mindif theres nothing there then there should be an incentive to train it upotherwise its a dead end skillkinda like how its utterly stupid to train up astrogeology to v and mining barge to v to drive a bloody freaking covotor when its just a couple of hours or so to a exhumer well a short timeanyway back on topic transport ships skill book could be used to employ these buffslike a plus 1 to war stab bonus at level 3 and 5 consecutivelyor additional cargo space as well as power grid kick up or better yet less power grid restrictions
dock wars  lamebumping a larger ship to stop them jumping through the gate  just as lameif it looks like they are going to jump through then part of the group needs to be willing to maybe miss out of the kill mail and be waiting to tackle on the other side
bumping should be based on each ships mass
actualy i was thinking about this i mean on the trailer of this patch it shows a thanatos flying and crashing into the station and blowing up everyone has bumped a station nothin happens but then again you think of the large fleet battles and all he asteriod belts you will be pretty much loosin more ships to veldspar or to bumping each other than to an actual fight there for im not supporting this
fix undock games first then talk about this issuenot supportedskunk
realistic would be that a overheated mwd interceptor hitting at 8kms kills any bs in game while killing and podding itself that would be realistictheres nothing wrong with bumping
i think this can be very easily correctedoh and a good prerequisite for all ccp developers should be the understanding of basic physicsif you need some help i suggest the reading of these basic concepts

i agree where is the risk how are jfs going to explode they must have a weak point and this weak point is when they return from lowsec00 to highseci do not support the idea of cynos in highsec soon someone will ask why a rorqual cannot use the highsec cyno since it is not a war ship like the jfsedit just for typos
i have to slightly agree with this post in one regard and thats is the hi sec griefers that hide in npc corps i know this has been largely reduced since the suicide nerf but still happens the issue is you cannot war dec them and only the griefed can attack them which for most pvetradersminers is near impossible a solution is that once you go negative statis you are booted to a war decable corp whether it be npc or player it doesnt really matter
how about thisa negative concordsecurity status means your no longer protected by concordso if someone with a higher security status wants to attack you they can and willexcept poddingtack on a bounty for killing the ship and you got yourself an incentive to be on the right side of the lawsince these guys like living in lowsec and being pirates why not make it low sec for the entirety of the gamethis allows people who get greifed to have the ability to form lynch mobs to attack greiferscan tippers and the bulkgranted my idea is rough at best but maybe someone can polish it off
doesnt that already happen when your sec status hits 5 except you can also pod the pirates i think npcs also attack their shipsunless they get a friend to pod them for the isk the bounty system needs a massive overhaul
im not sure about the 5 bit as i was warned by concord for attacking them without dong a pvp can tip maneuvercourse they had a 1 or somethingas for the bounty system you can make it difficult to acquire a bounty ifa its someones alt on the same account easy ifthenelse clauseb its someone who has a negative security status rating ie criminal of there ownin other words the only way to raise your security status is to rat your brains out
yes if one character on the account is online then the other cant be onlinewhat about alts with a positive sec status sitting on another account plenty of people run multiple accounts or it could be a friends accountthen just bring the criminal and bounty collector to the same safe spot in low sec criminal in a pod collector in a noob ship
the only way to fix macro mining is to put some basic macro controls in the game so that everyone can take advantage of it with the latest server updates which expands the number of people each system can support there is no reason not to besides 90 of the people would just use these with multiaccounts to help stream line their 35 ship operation that they are currently having to micro manageif you want to keep the numbers of afk miners down make them only work in low sec00 that way someone can go looking for them and have a little pirate funthe only other solution is ccp needs to get off their butt and add the ability to prospect in the game exploration is weak at this so that you can hunt down ultra valuable ore types that can only be mined with small ships and specialized lasers and leave the big rocks to the strip mining operationsthere are only two kinds of people that whine about it macro miners miners who find stripped belts in high sec and assume anyone that can mine faster than them or that is part of a mining op must be a botand high sec wannab pirates that are too scared to go to low sec or 00 and get mad when no one pays attention to their griefing or is using a hulk that doesnt need to drop a can to profitably mine and there fore invulnerable as far as they are concernedneither has much of a legitament gripemy bad  this stupid alt keeps defaulting on my posts  ackuula
macro mining and afk mining are two different things lets face it mining can be boring at times some of the time limit solutions will jut not work point blank most of you have not taken ice mining into consideration and how long laser cycles arei cannot tell you how many times i manually target rocks of various sizes that i know my laser can get several cycles from then i run to kitchen to start dinner eat dinner help my kids with their homework play some online poker in the background remote into the job to fix something that i was paged for run to the corner store etc many times i come back and the targeted rock has been gone for a long time and i just floating there afk i am not however macro mining just because i do not respond to local or to someones private message
he is absolutely right
the moon creates a visible supernova in the system thus creating a nice sight for all to behold and is respawned at the next downtime as a new moonwhen a moon collapses the moon simply turns into a rock until the next downtime at which point it disappears and the following downtime it is respawned as a new moon wtf is thatsorry man but this is the worst idea i have ever seen

hithanks for taking this point further with ccp as it was also point out a larger limit would allow us to use the courier contract to haul assembled ships rigged ones esp with regards to the envisaged cons i do think that this can easily be minimised through a warning system a specific warning would pop up to players who are about to accept a contract which requires the delivery of a package which does not fit in the cargohold of their current ship this warning could clearly highlight the volume of the package and asks the player to reconfirm if at that stage the player still fails to notice that the courier contract is bigger than any of the ships they can fly freighter pilots may still accept courier contracts while in a shuttle than i guess it the loss of collateral would be well dserved thanks once againrt
how about the removal of the mandatory ownership declaration i believe there should be discrete courier services too where who put the mission up for whom should only ever be disclosed upon completion or if it fails if at all
why discussing the courier system can you not make it cancel insurance to do a courier contract after this obviously repackaging voids insurance but while i am not in the ship i dont get anything anyway so once i hop back in it insurance should resumeunless you let us put bombs in other peoples cargo hold which isnt really on topic

sounds interesting  really how about adding an hacking usage that can be used on a gate what could you do with this control redirect incoming ships to a specificed location automatically decloaked turn off a gate such that people that warp to zero cant auto warp out  other ideas how long could you keep control a concord response after a specified time should be based on the security of the system and minimal in 00 but nonetheless should be sufficient enough to deter the frequent use of this tactic  other thoughts

a vast majority of ninja salvagers are newish players cleaning up rat corpses after older players went belt to belt popping if you want to avoid this simply mission in an active system and you are very unlikely to be scanned down before you can complete your mission remember herd mentality works
x the ninja salvager should not be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because i support ccps current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecksits like that for a reason too bad for the missionrunners that seem themselves as a victim i guess

well bounty hunting system is imho nonexistent all you can do is to add bounty to pilot with negative security status on a quick note i would add a bit of roleplaying to it  fe concord agents could give you a mission to pursuit people with highest bounties by providing you their current locations and ship they are flying or something like that but frankly i need bit more time to brainstorm itwith so much broken stuff atm i really think ambulation is totally unnecessary and personaly i am not looking forward to it from the other side i assume ccp will get a bunch of newold customers with ambulation and thats proly their main reason for introducing it nah i would spoil her tho i bought her new pink notebook so she can finally stop harrasing my computer for fekin facebookthanx for questionsand compliments
lavistas got my votei think hes done about the best job of any of the csm members although there are a couple of others who have also earned my respectthats saying something about a lad whos less than half my age but hey he earned it
tusko for president well maybe not for president but he would make a fine csm candidate nonethelessmy opinion of him as a corpmate and rl friend is hardly unbiased  so i simply urge you to look up what he has done in the past what he did on the council this term and ask him any questions you might have im fairly sure he will be happy to answer
i see is that your post or did you elaborate somewhere else i think basically lo sec is not no sec right now lo sec might as well be no sec remember i dont claim that these ideas are baked they are the sorts of things id propose as part of the csm discussions if these topics were ever selected by the council for research or actionissler dainze
honestly no and i dont believe anyone else should eitherthe general players of eve pick and choose ideally at any rate the person they believe will mediate in a fashion representing their preferred method and values the person that the player base choose to be their spokesperson should accept that responsibility having elected officials appoint themselves into positions of power in this case the power to control direction and subjects of discussion cheapens the entire electoral processyes it may mean we get someone who is less than qualified in the chairmans position but i would argue that the csm is small enough in size so that anybody can learn quickly enough to perform adequately in the position while the csm would benefit from some limitations on discussion no reintroducing failed votes without new content as herschel pointed out in his thread is one i personally very much agree with i believe a more free form discussion environment would benefit the csm morewhile this is my opinion should the elected leader step down and submit to a vote for the chairmanship or indeed decide not to step down as long as he announced this to be his intention before becoming elected this too is fine as long as the chairperson acts in accordance with his election promises then they will have my support
introducing that was one of the first actions of this first council

indeed
think of the new players all those 9 minute30 minute2 h6h skills that we have to train to catch up its really hard to fit them all in and this is as a uni student god forbid someone with a job wants to try to start playing this gameskill queue
this should be a priority
i cant be logged on more than 2 hours a day  some skills take just too much switching to be able to get completedme want a skill queue even one skill will do thanks a lotghost training removed i dont complain but it was stated before that it was one of the things that disallowed you the joy of implementing a skill queue no excuses anymore
even being able to queue up 12 skills would help a lot
they shouldnt let it be any different than the main server the whole point is to test how changes would affect current game dynamics if everyone could speed train or have access to all skills no one would be using what they would be regularly using in game so nothing would get properly testedall they need to do is mirror more often for things to match up
at the very least give us the ability to mirror our character from tranquility on command instead of once in a blue moon
great ideaafter all a test server is intended to test different options before investing time and thus money on tq  having to wait as much as on tq to train for skills doesnt help at all especially since different options might need different skills some skills could be really long too just think about wanting to try 2  3 carriers before going for one on tqfacilitating testing will also benefit ccp as players are more likley to identify bugs quicklyso full support to any option which would significantly decrease the time needed to acquire skill levels on test serversrtedit some typos and further clarifications
nuking an entire area of the game to solve 1 problem is not a viable tactic   i support this thread  find a better answer to this problem 
a mess of horrible changes nerfing everything in game and breaking balance horribly in a number of places i expected them to improve the changes after the first sisi iteration which was problematic  instead they just pushed the same stuff sans mwd reactivation delay and went on wantonly nerfing stuff along the waydown with the crap
you knowafter 2000 replys against this nerf70 pages on this thread ccp still bringing this crap onto tq shows they dont care about their subscribers at all they dont care about this csm crap  guess its a joke  and just continue nerfing things they dont even know how to use
UFFFDrhhh come on devs almost a month and not a single dev reply what are you guys doing 
i log in and let it sit idle for hours so i can go back and change the skill without having to log back in when it finishes
theres no reason this should still be broken
i dig the idea
methinks the response will be fanfest 08 and ambulationif you check the interviewambulation presentation  nycc 2008it looks like we will go through character design all over and be given updated portraits utilizing the new graphics engine with infinite variables or something along those lines
most definitely supported
this would seriously screw up camps that are trying to bump ships away from the undock point on the stations if ccp does this they need to change undocking in general or pvp at a station goes completely down the drain
5 decrease in power grid required per leveland people use covetors because 20m80 is a lot for the hull
ahaha elastic collision with a 40m hunk of metal hits a some 10m of metal plating top estimate of bs armour based on ingame values at 8kms yeah of course
whatever it is you come up with better make sure you dont run into a problem where suddenly you have a pile up in jita 4there are so many frakking ships piled into places in this game where such mechanics would cause mass destruction of shipsheck just having someone park there big fat ship in front of the exit would be enough to be a problemso dont forget to take that into accounti do agree ramming should be employed as a tactic in this game it would make things more interesting
if bumping is removed and it should be the nano nerf needs to keep people from getting to the gates in under 2 seconds and station undocking needs to be revamped even more first nano nerf next station undock then kill bumping collisions will be a huge problem in jita though just going to point that one out
i disagree last time i bumped a station with my carrier through a cyno i rebounded at thousands of meters per second as far as fleet battles this would end blobs
bumping doesnt make any sense from a realistic perspective and breaks immersiona small bumblebee of a frigate should not be able to bump a battleship it should shatter when hitting the ship at such high speeds that are used for bumping causing some damage small damage to the battleship while doing sobut for gaming purposes i suppose the frigate need not disintegrate into a little mangled speck of broken metal on the side of the battleship but could instead take some damagein short bumping should be tweaked heavily into a more realistic system ships that do or recieve the bumping should take damage in correlation to speeds and sizes of the ships involved
marauders have suffered from the fact that those willing to drop enough isk on a hull for one are generally better served by spending that isk outfitting a faction battleship due to the fact that while tanking has diminishing returns you can always benefit from higher dpsso give marauders a bonus to scan probe launcher times 10 per level of marauder skill the same as covops but applying only to scan probeand not recon probe launchersmarauders are designed as deep space pve vessels this change would make marauders far more attractive to explorers as it would eliminate the need to use a scanning covops
as long as it doesnt apply to recon probes as you mentioned this seems reasonable
makes sense to me
you know what this is actually a good idea no matter what time you use some nubbin always gets confused if you said op is at 2330 on chribba day in the year of the ganker then everyone would know when the op isalso kuzim is now my favorite poster
never fear year of the mining laser crystal is upon us
im giving this a thumbs up solely to see what ccp says when they read the op
yes i want to see if anyone in iceland can decipher what the op said with that said it could be a good idea as new players have been known to be confused
horrible idea youd take all risk out of 00 logistics 00 could use a buff but not something like this
i wouldnt say yes if one character on the account is online then other cant be online you kill the multisession featureim saying that the so called would block the bounty and or give a negative standing rating for exploiting the systemas for the second part thats not something you can avoid but it does point out one thing you have to pay an additional 15 bucks a month to have that privilegeconsidering the fact that the bulk of the community just threw a  fit and fell in it over ghost training not likely to be a problemedit honestly theres no real easy solution on the second part
i can see where this is coming from and i agree that missions are horribly broken in terms of mineral impact i have an idea that has been bounced around the forums for a long time and think it has the best possibility remove basic t1 loot from missionrat droppingsmeta items will still be dropped at the same rate as well as ammodrones however you wont have to haul home 50 small energy transfer arrays from your mission npc bounties to compensate should be increased by about 10 drones will be unchanged in the alloys they give out
i always thought drones should offer bountiesas well as bounties should be given for empire vs empire type of roleslike being minmatar killing amarians should give you a bountystuff like thatbut im inclined to agree with a increase in alloy percentages
sigh check the data before speaking especially as you want to run for the csm 1 mineral value of the mission loot is about 20 of the total mission payout with a way higher percentage for drone missions 2 bounties are another 25 for most missions but there arent bounties in all the missions against some empire units or against drones3 compensating for the removal of 20 of the reward mineral value of the loot increasing the bounties will require at least a 40 increase in the bounties in reality it would require a 75 increase but as you spend less time looting it can be less to keep the total reward on the same level4 removing the minerals and increasing the bounties even by 10 will cause an immediate spike in inflation as more isk will enter the game and less material5 removing rat dropping in 00 will have a even worse effect as they are the source of a large percentage of the low end minerals used for the production of ammunition and modules the only positive thing is that it will lessen the effect of the insurance on the value of the minerals if and it is even possible prices dont shot upwards and the mineral basket will keep dictating the mineral prices the effect would be even worse low end will shot upward most expendable especially ammunitions use minerals found in high sec wile high ends used in more permanent items will tank even further at the same time every rare items will see more competition from people with fatter wallets so faction items and gtc prices will rise too sure the lootbountymission reward system would benefit from an overhaul but it must be very carefully balanced a broad change with little thought on balancing as the one you are depicting would almost certainly have huge negative after effectsedit seeing that you are agreeing with jenna about too cheap minerals argument it is possible that the inflation is what you want but it will be in the wrong direction increasing the price of low end not the value as they will simply keep up with inflation and lowering the price of high end2UFFFD edit corrected the  after checking my mission database results
this has to be the worlds most pointless warning message ever why would someone not want to join a channel with people inside it if you need a warning that people maybe inside a channel and could talk to you perhaps its time to close the game clientif anything the warning should saythe channel xxx does not exist do you wish to create itthis would help people joining channels but misspelling the name and not noticing
i disagree and believe pointless error messages are actually a good ideaalso first post kablammo
yeah that is one of the annoying pointless warning messages
i have some ideas in the works to spice up mining including making it far more profitable by removing t1 loot from missions and by mixing up the asteroid types in all securities of space i dont think any one area of the game should be able to be done afk except skill training of course mining could be done afk for short times but so long as you check back about every cycle youll be finei want to make mining far more interesting than it is right now without punishing miners or other things one of the ideas ive seen which have potential is making you have to target a vein to get a better yield on the asteroidanybody who says macroers arent a big deal obviously has never been to an ice belt or a roid belt in 9 or 10 space there are less of them now then there used to be but they still need to be dealt with im not saying that my idea is perfect or even good but its an idea to get rid of them and should be considered carefully with other ideas on that merit alone
i have to agree there are many afk miners there that are inadvertently leaving there ships behind but i also say that being afk in that situation is begging for trouble as wellits not macro mining by any means but still a bit of an issue to someas for the macro miners there are corps out there who do hunt them even in high secsome funny videos to watch too
i initially thought this would be a nice addition but upon reflection i think it would in effect make jumping into ether lowsec or contestedpirate null sec a bit to securesafethe cyno going off in local esp low sec is like a billboard for a capital gank its the risk you take when jumping into these systems and shouldnt be removed
no first of all why would those factions allow a hostile empire to throw down cyno gens in their territory would you mind it if bob were allowed to throw down cyno gens in your station systems even when you have sovsecond of all cyno gens and other logistical structures are meant as a bonus when you have defended space for awhile your proposal just gives you cyno gens immediately for no effort npc and low sec is specifically designed to make it less focused on capital ships and capital blobslastly you are in an alliance of over 2 thousand members in a coalition of god knows how many and you cannot find a single one to light a cyno maybe you should get better alliance mates or better friendssince when do you get something after ccp changes something what is next can i petition ccp for my polycarbons that are now worthless your logic fails on every level
i dont like your opinion and youre not agreeing with me so i dont want to see you post
in all honesty your just a whiner looking for a free hand out who doesnt give a damn about balance or game mechanicslook take a step back and think about this lets say you allow such a thing1 it doesnt change the fact that people are going to use alts and what not do handle things2 the balance of power gets completely thrown out of wack at that point now you get an increase in jump traffic our friendly yet hated pirate gate camps become pointless so they shift to cyno areas thereby increasing the traffic around known cyno fields thus making your life a living hell3 people start throwing a fit and request cyno jammers to be deployed there by not only canceling your fun little respite out but making it nigh impossible to jump period4 now people are forced to do things the old fashioned way and that means flying through space and risking gnaking5 more blobs show up to escort said ships thereby increasing the lagnow understanding the above you just got what you wanted and also got your worst nightmarewelcome to pandoras boxso is it really worth the trouble with all due respect if you cant figure it out by now you shouldnt be herebalance game mechanics requires a great deal of care and consideration it means you think of others not your bloody selfim sorry your time zone doesnt permit ease of use eve is supposed to be not fair thats the whole point it takes workhard work so forgive me if i cant help but shine a spotlight in your face to point out the flaws in your logic
absolutly not
hi im not very familiar with pos behaviour as well however it might be useful to look whether the option attack if aggression is ticked this option is as i understand it pretty much useless in terms of additional safety but can be very dangerous to corp members as the tower will consider anyone even corp members as enemies if they get flagged for some reason or another if by attacking the can the corp member got flaggedfor ex attacking someone elses can he will get flagged yellow timer and the tower will attack him if that option is tickedi cannot think of another legit reason if that option is not ticked in any case always keep that option off rt
did you have an aggression timer showing in the upper left corner
can you imagine the nightmare of managing moons in say even 5 systems where an alliance might have 1020 pos anchored with the system proposed it would be a living hell i thinkenemies can also sabotage moon production by shattering cores with just a couple of probes  this is sort of good in my opinion because  a war comes everyone suffers that is how it is in rl and its not such a bad system where due to wars production and markets changeso i dont and do support the idea at the same time
well this may seem like a stupid question but eft didnt let me activate more than one ecm at a timewhat am i missing is it for certain ships only or skill basededit i figured it out
only ecm burst are oneatatime
this look at your signal strength compare with ecm strength so a frigate will get blocked repeatedly by a solid ecm pilot or cruiser almost always a battleship will be about 5050 a carrier 16there is no stacking additional modules simply improve the statistical probability

didnt know it was this specific one presented to ccpglad to know it nowthx
are there any good proposals on how to deal with a cooperative outlaw from being killed by a friend and then splitting the bounty between them
here is a weakness with your ideaperson a has a slightly negative sec status 1 but is not an outlaw no bounty he believes himself reasonably safe travelling in highsecpeople b c and d are gankbears looking to bad their killboard they lock up a and have their fingers poised over the function keys player a ignores them figuring concord will keep them at bayperson b calls up his friend person e who is in a station person e quickly puts a 1 isk bounty on person a seconds later people b c and d mash f1f8 obliterating person a then kill his pod while person a is trying to figure out what happenedunless im missing something the above will become routine under your mechanincsi would actually be happy with a much simpler system just allow pilots with a positive secstatus or more than a 20 perhaps to buy a bountyhunters license that allows them to attack pilots with negative sec status in low sec without losing sec status  and without crimal flagging  for doing so simple test this system for a while then revisit the reward part of bountyhunting which is currently brokenleave highsec alone theres too much potential for exploiting in my opinionsupport for the concept of revamping bounty hunting and im glad that ccp is already looking into options
eva has my vote and my support
he misstated my position the promise was no resubmission without a new supporter not new content its not a major thing  i mostly stuck it on because i was in a mood to keep writing  but it is different enough from whats already been passed to not be crazy
no if i would get the most votes i would stay chairman seems reasonable enough to methe person with most votes represents the largest amount of playersvoters so seems ok to have that person hold the chair stepping down makes no sense to me really
more sint always better but in the challenge to attract new customers and keep the old it is often the easy fallback introducting new mechanics and improving existing ones should be stressed but until you can show that there is a reward in doing so for ccp your going to have trouble selling it
best possible fixing of laggg buggs and glitches that are still around for example a pilot still in your overwiew wile you are allready 3 systems away from himher large fleets lagging like crazy and ur dead before u notice ur targeted a plain simple easy topic maybe but still important enough to mention it again i think offcourse ccp is allways working on progression for these type of problems on the server but u know sometimes u wonder if theres really enough attention to the trouble out there
click here for an exciting announcement
with movable ui already integrated into the next expansion all we really need is the ability to offcenter the screen focus to be able to move the ship to the center of 1 monitornext to that it would be nice to have in game support to span across multiple monitorsfull support
please
hell yea this would be nice
here is a relatively simple onedisconnects and drone control
bump ive made a lot of revisions to this so if you havent read it in awhile i could suggest you do that
signed  want aurora back  want interactive events back
as a relative newb i find the current situation particularly confusing when ccp announces news i never know if it is real news or fake news eg if there is a lost convoy should we actually go looking for it is there something i should be doing for the trapped miners etc
absolutely
you make it sound like ghost training was used by ccp as a bribe to keep subscribers im all for the removal of ghost training you pay to play simple ghost training was a way to progress through the game without paying which i think is stupid
why is this still going onisnt just a bit too obvious that this isnt going to change in the near future
as it helps having multiple accounts im all for it
skill training queuei can actually go on holiday to somewhere without internetssigned
yeah whatever just make me able to train skills from 1 to 5 when im paying my account you disabled ghosttrain now give goodies to honest paying customers
yup yup
i want it right now
yesssssssss
now most definitely a needed feature you took away ghost training  fair enough but now give us some lovedont care if its a skill queue or training the same one from 15 just give us something pretty pleasebecause unfortunately i dont have access to eve from work
signed
definitely supported
oh yes
so the issue behind this is when for example one is running a mission disconnects then warps back in to find ones drones unresponsive and 70 km away and you get to go fetch them in a armor rigged dominix  would it be feasible to make it so during a disconnect warp out  warp in drone control is maintained
ive run many missions where in the middle of them my internet decides to cut off or my computer glitches or something this would make a lot of sense and allow us to salvage some of the dronesi think the drones should still be attacked by the npcs however they would immediately head back to the beacon or something allowing for easy pickup
maybe give them a return to dronebay command when the ship starts to emergency warp that does not save them 100 of the times but better than nothing
if it was possible to implement something to save drones im all for it
i would also like to see this i myself have lost connection many times most of the time its because my cable company decided that they needed to do work right then and there and never informed me but in any case i warp out and proceed back to find my drones about 30k from where i currently am and given that my ships max speed is right around 130 i can enjoy the long trip over to pick up these stupid things often times i end up saying screw it and just leaving them behind as i tend to make my own and have a few thousand back at home base
yeah i think its fair to say that if you disconn and your ship makes to warp an emergency recall would be goodand the number that get back to you would depend entirely on your alignment time of courseme signed
hot key to regain control of drones within range of ship would be nice
my isp had a hickup and i my myrmidon warped away during ratting i immediately logged back in to see my self in warp then back then while approaching watch 2 of my drones getting slaughtered by the rats before i could scoop themi not only want a emergency return to drone bay protocol i also want to be able to turn offon the emergency warp protocoledit forgot the thumb
i support pretty much all of the ideas in this thread
why would you want to turn off the emergency warp thats like asking you to get ganked for logging off and not being able to log on or something
i only half support thisa over half the people here no offense of course dont bother to read or think before they frakking postsorry but thats a fact sometimes of which im guilty of will by not searching for older topicsmost of them are hate threadstrollsdeconstructiverepeatb csm cant have the full rights to this board while we can only repy would make things toughcompromise we only grant those who have proven to be effective and trustworthy with the job while only allowing everyone else to replythe csm can grant rights to those who obviously arent here for s and giggles let alone to cause trouble
coming from the people suggesting small guns on battleships well erm whats the point
against nano nerf
supporting opalthough skill rank should be at 4 and it should be something like reduces jump clone turnaround time by 4 hours that way by the time you get to level 5 you are now down to it being only 4 hours wait time to get back to your other body i would be more then willing to put up with the training required to get that

watching the third i think alliance tournament match between iac and bob is very possibly why i am still in this gameup to that point i had no idea who any 00 entities were nor did i know the depths of pvp which this game provides seeing that tournament motivated me and others in my corp of the time to venture out into other aspects of the gamesince that first tournament i have watched all subsequent ones even though i have never been part of a competing alliance it is nevertheless always a pleasure to watch them competethe alliance tournaments have given the major alliances an opportunity to put their epeens on the line but i think the greatest thing about the tournaments is the fact that it widens the eve experience to players who may not have seen much of eve beyond their local chat
ok lets look at this from physics momentum is equal to mass  velocity so a claw interceptor mass of 1125000 kg moving at 8 kms has a total momentum of 800011250009000000000 kgms if all of its momentum was transferred into say a dominix mass of 105000000 kg then you have 90000000001050000008571ms change in velocity from what i have seen with bumping that seems pretty close but it is not perfect so mabye if they just implemented more realistic collision mechanics things would be better
like punching through the bs armour then producing a heated fireball of 1000 tons of molten metal moving at several times the speed of sound through the battleship yeah something like that roughly
ok talk about realismi fail to see why it aint realistic guys we have to remember its space here and there is nothing preventing a huge object from accelerating heavily when an object of whatever size and mass is colliding into itif we do want realism so badly then how come i have to keep my ab running in order to maintain speed as there is nothing slowing me down in space i should just be going forever until i decide to slow it down but slowing down should require power just as much as accelerating wouldthere is no sound in space so please remove all explosion soundsthere is no reason why a large object would be slower and less agile then a smaller ship again its spacenow i agree we dont need the above to change and yes we might do something about the annoying bumping problem but please dont demand such a change to make it more realistic as that simply aint the casecheersdigaph
to be honest there is nothing wrong with bumping and it is needed for a lot of purposesi agree that realism should be out because the realistic thing would be enabling interceptorsfrigates to do suicide ramming rather then bumping and i dont think people would be particularly happy with being oneshotted by a suiciding interceptor which is realistic really
very much in agreement
makes sence to meh
yes
this applies to alliances that have alts or coalitions like the northern and sothern 00 poses also thinking that your alliance pos will not be used by your allies at one time or another is ignorance
even fully expanded a hulk will fill its cargo hold in 3 to 4 cycles 12 minutes it takes less than 20 to fill a can which is easily twice the maximum expanded cargo capacity of a hulkby your above statement you admit to using macros since you can walk away for 24 minutes and not suffer cargo shutdown ergo you should be banned forthwith
hmmcant implement this or any similiar idea without hurting us real minersand could someone please show me what statistics your using to show the eve economy is deflated seriously since this arguement has been used quite a bit regarding macros etcid like to see your info i was actualy somewhat leaning on this one till the predictable but inevitable mention of essentialy converting all npc corp players to trial accountsthen i realized where this was all goinguh uh nope cant support
is bumping allowed
would be cool
uh there a reason your posting a duplicate threadbecause theres already one started on the same page
minmatar have to skill miisile and guns to be viable minamatar have to skill shield tank and armor tank to be viable minmatar have already the worst battleships  poor tank poor damage deal in close poor tank poor range in snipe minmatar have already the worst dreads poor tank and double guns type and now with the incomming nerf minmatar will have the worst has and recons ccp do something for the minmatar please
we dont need better hardware we need better pilots to compensate that
better piltos will change race to another one and pown with megascursessacrisfalcons p

my corpmate worked with ccp and they replaced his ship after all so presumably there is a bug of some sortthanks
where do you stand on detachment of people who work for ccp from the game are in favour of allowing ccp employees to play or should they be professionaly detached so theur gameplay does not conflict with their tasks for example gms and developers being part of major alliances should this still be allowed by ccp

i havent heard anything good about t2 ammo changes with this upcoming content patch thats for sureshipaffecting changes remain notably speed and still stack on a perweapon basis turrentaffecting nerfs remain but they still lack the devastating affects of shipwide nerfsthus t2 ammo only gets worse under the current mechanic especially missiles even with their changes taken into affect under the new mechanicoh well
ive seen setups like this before and have always dreamt that it could be targeted as a checkable option so that my ship stayed in the center of one screen instead of between two i cant afford 3 monitors like this fellow player xdedit forgot to give support d
i like this idea very much and it would be very handyi support this idea
so guys i have a negative 200 with minmitar and a negative 207 with gallante not that this was done on purpose but was done all the same does this mean i am never gonna de able to get those faction standings back up  in which case if i only work caldari and amarr means that these 2 nagative standings i have will lower even more till eventually i cant enter their space 
you have to chose what pirate faction you can run mission for based on what empire you worked for for every empire faction there are neutral pirate factions that dont lose standing when you do empire storylinesfor example guristas as the main enemies of caldari are neutral to gallente for obvious reasons the enemy of my enemy is my friendangel cartel and serpentis are neutral to caldari there is no level 4 missions that requires you to kill serpentis in wc you can chose to run against guristas cargo delivery doesnt require to kill ships angel cartel ships only appear at angel extravaganza if you reject that mission you can work up your way to caldari faction standing 10 without losing any standings with serpentisangel cartel and later do missions for that pirates without ruining your caldari standing they dont give missions against caldaris either no derived standing lossfind a pirate faction that is neutral to the empire faction which you run missions forif you got your faction standing below 2 by doing that rare missions which are given to you against a neutral pirate faction you can still get the faction standing up by running missions to small side faction pirates that are liked by the pirate faction which you want to run missions for check the standing tab of that side pirate faction for example thukkers or the syndicate for angelsserpentis in case thukkers have storyline agents didnt check that
its not that easyif you have 2 standings modified  you could perhaps still adjust it above 2 by training diplomacy to v if you havent done so alreadybesides with gallente and minmatar  they have quite a number of factions which they like so if you are still able to run missions for those factions doing important storyline ones for those will give you a derived faction standings gain with minmatargallente eg soewell again its not that easy a you dont only get negative standings by completing important storyline missions for enemy factions but by killing structures  ships too and this negative impact is not related to any gain you havebasically you could manage to have only negative standings with every faction in game by just killing their shipsstructures and not running missions at allb there are certain factions especially bloodshanshaguristas that are only positive towards each other so if you run missions in amarr space  or just rat a lot against these factions its quite easy to get them all to a value that makes it impossible to ever recover again  and run missions for themc if you happen to run pirate faction missions you will notice that you will be sent against concord from time to time thus killing those see a will have an impact on your concord standings which are not recoverable at all because concord likes no other faction nor do they give out important storyline missions
this is a large obstacle to me leaving highsec space so i go to 00 and then what i cant run any missions
to a  b of course you will lose access to all pirates if you rat accross all 4 empires if you stay in caldari space rats will be guristas never angels or serpentis all you have to do as level 4 missionrunner is to reject the angel extravaganza mission this way you never kill their ships or structure a little inconvenience for the option to later run missions for them regarding sanshasbloodsguristas they are all neutral to gallenteminmatar so if you dont rat them i assume in minnigallente space you wont find this rats anyways and avoid the few missions that have them as target you keep the chance to run missions for all 3 of them or if you keep at least one of them above 2 you can repair the standing of the other two quite easily to c it is true there is a standing loss towards the concord faction but if i remember well theres only the mission the blockade for level 4s that is against concord maybe few more with level 23 agents that mission isnt very profitable anyways simply reject it the good thing with pirates is that they have that hubs with multiple agents so you can pick only the best missions in my system there are 10 level 4 q 20 agents for example so you only do always the best missions enough room for a lot of rejectingbesides that your security standing is tied to concord corporation standing not the faction and when you do pirate storylines the concord corporation is affected the faction only is affected by shipstructure kills which can be avoided and the concord corporation  your sec status loss throug pirate storylines is made up by sec gain when killing nonempire faction mission npcs eg i kill lots of sanshasbloodraidersmercenariesmordus when running missions for angel cartel so to sum up the long post all you need is to get your infos avoid certain missions and you keep your cances to run missions for a particular faction ofc you wont do missions for guristas if your a caldari missionrunner or for serpentis if your gallente
i could have not said it better myself this sums up my feelings on ghost training completly
o7
i think i would rather see a compromise on this issue rather than a flatline aye or nay to the end of ghost training i would assume there would be a 3 month time limit on canceled accounts to be completely removed from the game in consideration of those whom actually have real life issues and therefore have to go for a long period of time off of the game

i support this after seeing it put into effect on sisiusing a pack of nails where a staple would have done the job
i just wish nerfs would halt complelty its making my cry i dont feel one way or the other about this particular nerf but i feel strongly for those who are losing a lot of training becuase of another silly nerfi also am against the carrier nerf and theyre not overpowerd becuase spending 11b on a ship and repairers with crap loads of training time should be able to instantly redeploy theyve earned itbut yeah any nerfing is bad i just feel bad for these players is all
againstwake up needed a few small minor changes not for you to wade in with a sledgehammer
completely against this nerf theres no reason at all to nerf nano ships theyre just as vulnerable as any other ship most arent cap stable most have paperthin shieldsarmor when compared to similarly priced ships most require a great deal of skill to fly properly there are also plenty of ways to defend against a nano ship the fact that people choose not to setup their shipfleet to defend against a nano ship then whinge like 3 year olds when they lose ships doesnt justify wiping out a legitimate tacticccp have taken some of the diversity out of the game and have pushed us closer towards blob warfare completely bonkers
been on sisi and dont like what i see  this expansion is not a nanonerf  its a fundamental reorientation of the game away from fluid fastpaced engagements that rely on position to a slower paced one where numbers are kingit hurts solo and small gang roamingit rewards static gate campingit nerfs almost every ship in the game except assault frigs and murders the most fun ships in the game  hacs and reconsit creates ridiculous imbalances where expensive ships and highly skilled characters are now much less effective against small and cheap ships flown by low skill point charactersthe weapons stacking thing is good as are the server improvements  thats a big price to pay for all the rest of the crap
fully support the petition against the nano nerfeither way i got plans for new ship fittings if the nano nerf goes through but would be nice if i didnt have to bother
i think a simple queue of next skill to train or even train current skill to level x will solve 90 of the problems while avoiding 90 of the problems
supported  i hardly use my jump clone simply because of the wait time if i could reduce it with a skill it would be great
agreed that there should be a skill to reduce jump clone turnaround but it should be as difficult as is reasonable to benefit significantly from say rank 8 or higher with infomorph psychology and science both at level vand keep it to 2 hours off with each level trained simpler to deal with in general i imagine

why not allow people to report the location of people with bounties by right clicking on their ship in space on on the listing in the overview and choosing an option report locationand then when people go to look at the list of people with bounties it will also say their last known location  and the name of the person that did the reporting  even if you kept a delay it could helptralala
this actually is an interesting addition to the great ideas already postedwhat this would enable is for bounty hunters to work together in groups  player interaction here is how it would work 2 or more bounty hunters work together 1 of the bh gets to a station to accept the bounty contract while his buddy is in pursuit of the target updating its last known location on the fly when the contract is accepted hell race back to his buddy to start the assault when the kill was successful the contract can be turned in and like it works with missions at the moment you should be able to share it with your fleet making bounty hunting a group thing and reward payouts been shared among the participantseither way i really like the ideas youve posted and this entire plan although im especially interested in the bh aspect of it gets my full supporti really hope ccp is going to integrate a system like this making eve and empire space a more lively environment without hurting the new players or the carebears at allcheersdigaph

not sure if this is the place to start probably restart this discussioni have been scammed by a contract scammeri accept this as it has only cost me 27m unless someone outbids me lolbut i do feel there should be some way of removing your bid from a contract as atm once you have bid then you are stuck unless outbid
of course theres a way to remove your bid  spam jita local with lies until somebody outbids you its like regifting but for scams i see no real reason for this feature to be added  it wont prevent scams just move the auctions into item exchanges if anything itd lead to more abuse as people bid on their own contracts to pump up the price and then do a lastsecond bid withdrawal once theyve hit the other persons cap
this is why i do not get involved with contractual bids with total strangers
this is just win

smoke less stoned it damage your brain not all people has exumers 5 and use t2 mining crystals 
i have to say the idea is noble but i can see this if implemented being used as a griefing toollooking for easy targets rather than its intended use especially in high sec
afk mining is okay and does not equal macro mining
trust me theres plenty of excitment in 00 mining when hostiles are running all over the place and im not worried about macros in this case becuase of those same hostiles will shoot macros reguardless theres enough pirate and enemy allaince activity in all parts of space near stations where its safe enough to say that no one with the money to afford the hulk and its gear is going to afk macro in 00and can we please stay focused we should also tack on this is not the kind of responses im pushing for im not asking ccp to do anything hard at all i want to be a quick fix not a feature so adding things like oh there should be gallente navy in serpintis space ecti feel like im losing steam with people although i feel very strongly about this subject any help playerbase
hey ive got a great idea lets make absolutely certain that the gms and developers do not have the slightest clue about what the game is like from a players perspective or in 00 this couldnt possibly backfire
how do you plan to increase small gang pvp with the nano nerf and titans
the question was for the candidate and not yourself and stating that gms need to play the game activly to be able to do their job is not true in fact it is silly moving people to different system using system tools when they are stuck does not require in depth knowledge on 1vs1 nano warfare so does censoring forums posts or implementing new graphic models or solving network issues developers and gms do not need to play the game to be able to do they job a game designer should know his game but gm does not haveon the other hand if they do they have the unique opportunity to misuse their powers to gain benefit for their faction unlike rest of the players before you say that all ccp needs is honest gms and developers i will quote verified human wisdom power corrupts you dont trust me name an honest politician for each one named i will name 20 corrupt ones i rest my case im not saying that all of gms and developers will act as politicians thank god they are not into politics and i am sure that many are honest and hard working but what shall we do with those that are not honest and will misuse their power to gain advantage of other players this is why lottery companies do not allow their workers to take part in their lottery games or some other gaming companies do not allow their employees to play their games and this is in the hands of ccp if ccp will listen to csm then i want this question answered by candidates and not others so please keep the discussion somewhere elsenow if a candidate could answer my question please
what are you talking about i am agreeing with you this is an absolutely fantastic idea making sure the gms only see the players as complaining customers of an obscure service they know nothing about that they have to talk to developing a bunker mentality because they themselves dont know the experience of putting up with bugs and problems in the game is a fantastic idea im sure the decrease in empathy and knowledge of what the problems actually are will lead to terrific customer service
red side gm  what can i do for you sirblue side player  i want my ship back lost it in lag and stuffred side gm  sorry sir but our logs dont show any lag in fact we didnt log anything strange we hope you recover soon from your lossred side gm  yo my manred side player  hey we need some ships respawned now we got killed in some campred side gm  sure you want faction fittings as wellred side player  hell yes and make those battleships faction ones we need some edge if you know what i meanred side gm  yup done ill be in for the op my shift ends in 10 minutes and make sure our fcs now about the ability to target people inside pos shields it still has not been fixed and we are still not marking it as an exploit also blues have been asking to reinforce node in xyz system expect an attack tonight unless they plan a mining op in our capitalbunker its called professional service which i can request as a customer it is enough to have to deal with metagamers alone without having to combat developers and gms i prefer decreased empathy to outright hostility
we get your point who doesnt but you cant have the other extreme where gms and devs dont play at all accountability is the best compromise stop fighting
my concern with is that you completely dropped the ball on the capital ship issue when it came before the csm largely because you are a dilettante with regards to pvp especially unrestricted pvpin your candidacy post here you try to take credit for things that csm voters should have good reason to believe that ccp was doing anyway like boosting black ops and nerfing suicide gankers
hello i sure hope that ccp takes the time to listen to your ideas scagga leabetrovo looking a the history of csm atm they been ignored and some foolish statements on the forums between them and ccp without going into to detail or pointing fingers  i hope your not just waisting your time your the guy for the job you have our vote judge ment
sorry for the delay in replying to these questions this week ive been spending longer hours attached to obs  gynae as part of my studies indeed i agree that occupancy should have tangible consequences  and as you have indicated their exact nature is a matter for discussion factional warfare can require a prohibitive amount of time investment to achieve goals that seem to only exist on paper at present from information that i have gathered the current status quo regarding consequences is reported to be a suboptimal as a motivating factor for many of those involvedi particularly like this idea giving noncombat means of supporting the war perhaps this smuggling could be introduced as a prelude to spreading the scope of factional warfare  ie making new zones contestable this may also beg the question  is it time for less common professions such as smuggling to receive de novo attention and possibly find them a role in factional warfare yes with regards to stationhugging and gatecamping while they are for usually tactics borne of battlefield conditions rather than truly cowardly pilots i support finding better alternative activities  rather than supporting nerfing these combat stylesre what you mentioned about tax and how it should be paid out etc  this is a novel idea to me while i currently dont understand it  id be interested in getting a better understanding of this in a more formal discussion setting

oh yeah our little war with necn that was a fun one you guys were one of the best fights we had some of my first pvp ever too  lordy did i do some stupid things word of advice to all the newbies  when you see a flashy red ship check the ship type before you lock and engage thorax vs prenerf myrmidon ends badly and thanks for the support
do you intend to agitate for boosting 00 profitability with as much vigor as you will lowsec profitability
i make lowsec a focus for two reasons firstly its at the bottom of the ladder right now  its got next to nobody using it for anything other than fw and it really does suffer from being more dangerous than highsec without being more profitable secondly i know it better ive never played the 00 game but i have played the lowsec game and thus i feel safer making policy prescriptions regarding lowsec besides looking at who will be on the next csm you have the heads of two of the biggest alliances in the game who will almost assuredly make it on  i dont need to be the one championing 00 reform however i do consider it important and i will support issues of that naturewithin reason if they come up ive previously expressed support in principle for such ideas as allowing agents to be hired into 00 and i had a good discussion after one of the debates last weekend on the problems with 00 and what can be done to fix them 00 should have the highest rewards in this game and at present it isnt quite there the ore is spectacular the complexes and moons are fantastic and officer rats are the npcrun lottery in this game but ratting is just missioning with slightly different mechanics and no better payout i dont feel confident making precise suggestions on how to fix this but from all ive heard it is somewhat of a problem and id certainly be interested in helping to find a solution
cant believe im voting for a goonits interesting that you bring up the issue of new players competing with old ones on a more even playing field eve is one of those games where the new guys have an influence unlike that game that shall remain nameless where a level 10 guy cant even make a dent in a lvl 30 guy i get what youre saying and i agree but i dont see it as that critical an issue in eve not when applied to skill training and t2 weapons i do see it as an issue when it comes to wealth assets and entrenched alliances the sov map has looked stagnant to me for a while now i know how you feel about pos warfare thats more importantwhat is your opinion on the current status of missions i know its pve content but its important to the eve economy how about the loot tables from them would you bring that up as an issue
how do you propose to reconcile the dichotomy of entrenched power structures versus a game structure that primarily rewards those who have been around the longest there are far fewer opportunities for newer players now versus newer players five years ago territorial amibitions are curbed by power blocs profitableyetunknown missionscomplexes have been removed or monopolized and the t2 lottery ending are all good examples of options that players no longer have but that older players have profited fromthe game structure itself conspires to keep new players on their back foot versus older players but if ccp attempts to address this imbalance they are attacking their most loyal customer base your thoughts
lets go with last in first outthere is one thing i want to say before i get into how i ideally see pos warfare working the skill training wait time is likely a significant issue with regards to the amount of change that can happen in 00 space without a ready supply of competent pilots no alliance can hope to gain space the isk is easy enough to get with some work but once the players have gotten to the point where they might be a threat they have become attached to whatever other playstyle they have taken part of that is not to say that people cannot change but its less likely than them not such i think that this gap is a contributing factor to some of the 00 stagnancywith regards to pos warfare i think that the primary mechanic is a good one it is just implemented poorly the primary mechanic is essentially put up object to claim space shoot other peoples objects to remove their claim the problem with the implementation is that there are too many pos floating around maintaining pos is not an issue of combat readiness but rather an issue of drudgery and pos are too hard to disablei will ignore the first two for a moment because i feel that they are more or less self explanatory there is a heathly medium between a lot of control points and few control points and we are currently erring on the too many side as well fueling towers is just not fun it is currently a mechanic that only serves as an argument for making towers stronger or keeping them that way when you get rid of that you can start to look at logistics as a means of getting ships and ammo to the front rather than making sure that you have a dedicated logistics man who can take a second jobrequiring dreads to take down a serious deathstar i dont feel is a major problem i think the problem is more that pos can serve strategic functions cyno gen jump bridge cyno jam moon mine refine etc and still be deathstars this means that there is no training for a pos fight that small alliances and groups can do they will say lets go incap that jump bridge that will really be a pain for the goons and when they get there the pos has 50 hojillion ecm modules fitted and permajams their entire gang i mean say youre a small alliances getting ready to jump into 00 you do some raiding and camp some gates but then the next step after that is full on battleship supported capfleet pos fightsif we can make these strategic pos modules easier to disable then not only do we start a more natural progression between starting out in 00 to being a serious contender but we also alter the strategic choices that are made during a siege both of these are positive stepsi think a capture point type system would be terrible i havent messed around with fr but i dont think it will work when dealing with large organized alliancesmissions in the next post
i havent missioned in quite a while just getting back into it in stain but i am certainly open to looking at how its organized i think missions need to branch out into conquerablebuildable 00 stations in order to increase player density in 00 as well there some specific changes to the way that mission rewards are calculated that ought to go through these changes are pretty simple missions need to start out at their highest pay point rather than lowest pay point this is because players are unlikely to want to do a mission that has a low payment combined with the next thing that needs changing this means that it takes a very long time for a mission to reach its equilibrium payment this is why very few people ran level 5s when they were first released they would go find an agent look at the reward and say why dont i just run level 4sthe second is that a refused mission needs to count as a max time mission completion currently a refused mission is discarded in the pricing scheme this means that missions that are difficult are unlikely to see their price rise with that difficulty instead people just skip the mission and do something worth their timeregarding loot drops i am not sure about loot drops i dont loot in missions i know that i would love it if t1 items were removed from the loot tables entirelysize issues but i dont know of any major issues with loot
this is only true within the context of trade and as you have admitted successful entities will enact policy that keeps them on top and everyone else below this is how it is in any such unregulated system as well the majority of interactions cannot be reasonably considered trade because one party will not be consenting to the outcome the amassing of wealth concentrates this power this is the system by which states and empires have been formed since before the modern age denying it is foolish as not only can we see its effects across the pages of history but on smaller scales we can see it play out todayneither entrenched interests are not operating in a market regulation is then irrelevant which is just as well because eve has always been a place where regulation was at a minimum or nonexistent what eve needs is balance tweaking the individual incentives to produce a result that we are happy with there is no need to regulate any transactions when ccp has the power to change the fundamental assumptionsbesides what i said regarding pos and sov warfare above i would really like to see something done about gang mods remote sensor boosters log off and scanning mechanicsyou may have to scroll down to posts 40 and 41 and think there are some exciting things we can do with industrynote not all of those are recent so things might have changed regarding the specifics but they should all convey the correct idea
at least your proposition is in line with what theyve suggested and isnt some wild change that will never happenconfirmed that this is what a lot of missioners say the only reason to do 5s is for fun but profit wise it makes little sense personally i dont really care though the problem which i think ccp has mentioned once but i dont remember who acknowledged it is that missions flood the market with t1 loot in general including loads and loads of unnamed generic t1 modules if there even could be a market for manufacturing unnamed t1 modules i suppose some people insist there is if you find the right places which ive never found this market is crippled by the constant streaming in of this loot the markets in empire have a lot of focus on reprocessing junk not making and selling it cause nobody is making most of that stuff id like to see the majority of unnamed modules removed from loot tables they serve no function other than to go into reprocessing which hurts miners and hurts anyone trying to enter into the manufacturing game who doesnt yet have the ability to invent
ok fellas time to get out the voteill be writing a few major blogs soon
the council chair is an administrative duty not an authoritative duty without an administrator that the council itself elects the liklihood that it functions well is diminishedsuch i would definitely step down and let the council decide
fanfest is going really well so far there has been plenty of good dialogue with devs and fellow players and the second day hasnt even started yetthe squeaky bees ive been handing out went really fast too my supply didnt last very long at all ill have to bring a few hundred along next year to meet this demand
the csm election voting has begun i hope everyone will take the time to cast their vote for one of the many fine candidates that have chosen to run for the councileve is only what your choose to make it everyone can make it better by supporting the csmso stop reading and voteissler
well said issler vote here
voting started one week before the results come out good luck to all and we will see who makes it in to the 2nd csm
liked everything minus the character interaction on a planet colony i think it takes too much from the past conceptions of eve as a space mmo but the proposed additions to a sov 4 system in the manner in which you described does seem desirable
well i read it and i like it but you dont say a lot of what actually it would give back other than some mins and fuel that are already in game that will make current mining system obsolete or at least flatten down profit for new player base in hisec so i am not trying to pinch your idea but put it a bit further i hope you dont mind  so here it is how i see it1 ccp currently has some plansideas to put t3 tech and some sort of patentscustomized stuff at as i belive corp level to be produced so lets go on lets put in the whole idea with colonies and hubs but make colonies a places where you can build and upgrade your corp laboratory where you can try to achive certain patent to be able to produce customized items this will obviously need a lot of input from players so lets make laboratory be upgradeable and also possible to fit with special stuff obtained via planetary missions missions similar to courier ie gaining contacts and interacting with other scientists on other planets  delivering them some required special items or supplying them with various mins will make your corp not you personally gain a scientific points or reputation points for which you can buy mentioned above upgradesfittings  the more fittings corp has in its laboratory or the higher it is upgraded the better chance of getting his hands on patent that is the beginningafter you will get said patent you can then even further develop your colony  build planetary factory in which you can makeproduce customized items note that items not necessarily must be an end product it may be only a partscomponents for t3 manufacture chain to actually build tese items in your factory you also need new mins  yes you guessed  a planetray mines which then will yield new mins here variations of palnets comes in hand  whether it is volcanicjungledesert or whatever it will yield different mins to run all this on your planet you obviously need power plants just to name one and a people workersscientists to run it you can also add planetary defences so they will be more resistable for sieges after all if you invest something you wouldnt like to see it destroyed in just 1 hour or so so this is how i see it and mind you that planetary missions can put a whole new interaction level and give a full boost to ambulation giving it more sense just that the one to walk in stations this will also give a point for fights and waging wars to get certain corps out of competition  for producing patented components etc so i am finishing here
one unique point of eve is jmo that you can change your activities at any time  using the same character the sole possibility that you can lock yourself out forever to run missions for certain factions contradicts that principlejust take someone that lived in amarr space if he didnt follow your guidelines quite from the start its very likely that he will have no chance to run missions for the mentioned trio because he will not only have got derived faction standings loss thanks to important storyline missions which at least give standings gain for other factions  but loss due to kills against all those three factions amarr missions doesnt matter which region you are in will force you to kill shipsstructures of all those 3 pirate factionsnow take the possibility that this person joins a corp that operates in 00 blood space  even if he wants he wont be able to ever run missions for them besides the fact that rats there if he wants to rat will be blood tooif you do pirate faction important storylines your concord faction will be affected obviously because concord faction dislikes all pure pirate factions on the other hand concord does not like any faction at all and gives no important storyline missions most likely because they are liked by all empire factionsso to sum it up  i dont think its enough to be able to not lock your possibilities if you follow certain rules from the start there should be always a way to recover from your past actions  even if it would be a tendous task but it should be possibleps i am not suggesting  looking for a cheap solution  but imo there should be a solution if u care take a look at the ideas from the locked thread that i linked earlier
this cant be true my friend sabahl has a standing of 010neutral to concord assembly and 356decent to concord he has done a lot of important storylines for angel and serpentis pirates check his standings in game he has 817 with angels and 800 with serpentis if you were right hed have a horrible standing to concord assembly but he doesnt have it search in game for sabahl and have a look on his standings
i have to admit that i seem to be wrong in that case however my experience with running pirate faction missions is dated some time ago approx a year and iirc i had a derived faction standing loss listed under concord faction which would only be possible if you could gainloose standings by doing important storyline missionshowever as i said its long ago and thus i am not able to proof it because the transactions contain no entries anymore  and perhaps it was changed thukker relations to minmatar have changed too  iirc  after factional warefare was introduced
i was around though not in the group defending him during the death of muritor and for several visits by the defiants to 9uy and for the protests in pator when filmir resigned i dont know much about any loot involved but i do remember how much activity the events generated and how much fun it was i was sad to see aurora cancelled worried about corruption dont generate any special loot people will participate just to be involved much better to have people read about a news event and say i was there than to read a fictional news event written about something that never happened in game lets bring events back
events like this sounds amazing although lag would definately be an issue wiht much more players now then there used to be

mcvote
i approve
im in agreement down with the nerf
i support the anti speed balance movementthese changes effect far too many fundamental aspects of gameplay to be viable and i feel they will be damaging to the game overall
againstthis patch hasnt been tested enough most people who are blindly supporting it havent even been on sisi to see how messed up things are over there

i dont like nanos but the way theyve gone about this is absolutely insane now all ships are nerfed and its almost miserable trying to playedit to add followingbottom line is after testing it on sisi its just not fun this is where you should be focusing
this thead has my full support

give me my raven back ccpthis account is paid for and i dont want your blob encouraging nerfsmy time skillingmy time playingmy corps time creating tacticsyou ing it up with a way to go blob patchundo all your nerfs and start boosting things instead of pulling the carebear card again and again
this is not an update to game playthis is a freakin nerf feastso many people have spoken out against these changes and it all appears to be falling on deaf errorsthis is really beyond belief
really bad timing ccp with all the other great games coming out on the same day as your fail cascade looks like ill be droppin eve for a whilethis is no expansion this is slapping your players in the face
first you should probably explain why you think altering killmails is a bad thing exactly killboards arent part of eve itself theyre an external tool for corps and alliances run by people with no affiliation to ccp sometimes by people who dont even play eve the information held within a killmail can be an important source of battlefield intelligence and players should be free to post alter or withhold them if they wish
mercs get hired for offensive actions as well any change should enhance and expand the profession or at least formalize it not limit itedit to clarify i like the bounty ideas more or less better than what we have but still need a little refining the merc thing is my issue and as the only merc ceo i see in this thread imma stick by it an ingame merc interface is desireable but simply providing that access to war dec defenders is not any csm that wants to talk to me about the way this could go is free to convo or mail me
youve introduced a new problem with kill rights derived and unlimited kill rights mean that anyone can take any number of bounty contracts this means that anyone who lands a kill right on someone is likely to be swamped with hundreds of hostile players after himyouve also introduced an isk sink with no reason for said sinkyouve failed to solve one aspect of the second party bounty hunter problemie where the bountied target takes the contract and kills himself which will occur if you fix the first people where bountied targets are at a severe disadvantage in that someone can take the contract and simply hold it until the kill right expires thus protecting himself from retaliationa better system is thisreverse auctions with collateral when a player posts a bounty contract he posts it with a start valuehigh and buyout valuelow bounty hunters then bid down the price of the contract and when its finally accepted pay some percentage of the price as collateral if they fail to dispatch the hunted targetenough times to cover the bounty then they lose the collateral to the contract issuerthis solves the problem of people taking contracts to hold onto them solves the problem of hundreds of bounty hunters going after the same target and makes competition an integral part of the processfor added slaking of vengeance you could automatically send killmails generated to a bounty hunter to the person who set the bounty
actually if you had read carefully you would have noticed that no one person can hold the killrights derived from a bounty its open to many players hence a bountied player cant use an alt or themselves to effectively stop the bounty being collectedadditionally we envisaged bounty hunting being a profession thus there will be players looking to hunt players for isk this means that players that get killed by a players can set bounties on their killers other players can then attempt to earn this bounty for themselves by accessing the bounty office and accepting the bounty contract many players can do so thats the whole point access to bounties could be on an experience scale but certainly the number of bounty contracts able to be accepted at any one time would be linked to standing or some other mechanism with the bh branch of concord your idea frankly will lead to players making money out of selling killrights which is what taking collateral and keeping if contract not fulfilled is this isnt our intention for a bounty hunter system we think that players should be able to make money by hunting bountiesof course a mail would be sent from the bounty office regarding fulfillment of a bounty contract to the issuer bounty hunting is hardly a large isk sink whats your pointyou should note that this issue has already been through the csmccp meeting and given high priority for development by the csm finer details are up to the developers if bounty hunting as a profession is introduced eve will get just a little bit more interesting pvp is good take carearithron

agreed we need them back i loved sitting on edge of my seet thinking who will win its so close omg its unbuliveble dbring it backskiskiskiskiremember the owrd ski it will rule the world
another tournament would be nice
rokh should be able to fit a mwd and tech 2 rails it is expensive enough no need to make it more expensive by adding a 20 million mandatory powergrid implant for the poor caldari 
fit a rcu its not like every other sniper can fit a mwd and t2 guns without fitting mods
no it shouldnt and no its not expensiveconsidering it is the best fleet boat in the game at the moment narrowly outshining the apoc i dont think making it even easier to fit is reasonable plenty of other ships need rcu in fleet fit you have five low slots
i agree it has more turret slots than a mega but less power grid this shouldnt be more grid for the rokh
rokh is fine tbh
rokhs are awesome as they are

this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
lets get right in to ithow many of you out there have got home from work or school or even woken up in the morning thinking oh my skill will have finished by now so you power up eve to see that your account expired about four hours ago no worries ill just resub and change my skill but wait the last skill still has four hours left of training time youre a paying customer youre resubbing the account anyway but ccp are denying you your few hours of hiatusso the idea ghost training carries on for 24 hours after your account expires we all know the real issue is with people that set skills like bs 5 carrier 5 or advanced weapons upgrades 5 training just before their subscription runs dry but the other 90 of us suffer without this leewaygive us 24 hours where our skills continue to train so that we have the chance to resub and not lose and training time for the good of the game
and yes i do support my own idea
iirc i have heard somewhere that they give you a 3 day period where you still train if not i dont think 24 hours is an unreasonable period to let it train
maybe you just forgot to pay the bloody bill and it went by 3 days before you realized it was too late and now your just trying to troll up the ghost training crap againoh im sorry touched a nerve thereepic fail  opps and before you open fire realize this dont you think its just a tad bit stupid for ccp to not think of that i mean come on killing your account access for being 24 hours late yeah right
so you want the three days grace period we already get shortened to one day 
there ought to be a little popup before you post which says wait have you actually done your research
ive strongly supported the evolution of contracts and support for moneylending in my manifesto this is a good idea and very much in tune with my ideas

how exactly were you scammed were you stupid enough bid on the contract without seeing if the items listed were the items in the description 
voted for eva  as she is smart and brings fresh ideas to eve
you just got my vote and i would advise anyone who has voted for me in the last election to do the same 
well i was in delictum also to bad at that time i was a noob and couldnt do to much in this game yet scagga helped me and proved to be a good ceo he knows what hes doing so personally you got my vote 
a lot of good ideas their scagga u got my backing think ur ideas are whats needed to try and change the frame of the game on the 00 stuff i would like to see some kind of sov holding cap for the bigger aliances introduced somthing like a max amout of regions that they would be able to hold at 1 time to alow the smaller alliances to stake a claim and even out the game power block play where would u stand on that idea as to the rest of ur post it is spot on m8 and i suport thatim throwing open the door on the sov grab and many will say its not a feisible optian but their has to be some limate to what goons and bob can takegive me some veiws on that and u got my vote their yarrrrr
got my vote 1 for vuk

in my opinion ccp staff should be allowed to play our game i think it is very important that ccp experiences the problems of the game first hand if they were just sitting behind their monitoring tools they would never know what it is like not to be able to activate a gun their actions need to be monitored tho but as far as i know the internal affairs department got this completely covered it is an entire ccp department dedicated for monitoring and ensuring that no ccp employee influences the game in a way that would not be possible without being a ccp employee as i was not a csm representative back in june i did not have a chance to talk to the heads of ia but the other reps did and ensured me that the ia procedures in place were quite alright

i dont think removing tech 1 items from missions would help tech 1 producers any since instead of a flood of tech 1 items you would get a flood of named items which would be just as cheap as the tech 1 items wereif not cheaper due to transfer value in tech 1 items by refining and betterif we are going to get mission runners and ratters out of the hair of tech 1 producers we would have to replace tech 1 loot drops with something else entirely like deadspace effects or npc produced refinable items or simply bump the value of the missions
good point
my point is  if on joining a corp this was clearly stated ingame tools would be a lot safer than using 3rd party software for this
avalloc is probably the best candidate when it comes to the ccps csm program many of the others have a exclusive view of how this game works theyve either lived in empire space their whole life or theyve lived in 00 space their whole life a number of the other candidates were practically born into their positions so they never obtained a real perspective on what was going on avallocs 15 years of experience put him at the ground floor of mmo development csm delegates arent game designers theyre game dreamersfar from a onetrick kind of guy he has experienced many different styles of play ignoring his accomplishments in other games and just focusing on eve avalloc began as a barebones sp pilot with a dream and rose his way to a position in the directorate of a major alliance mining production pos warefare blueprints the market whatever he has experience in a wide range of areas and doesnt fall into the stereotype of what you would expect of a player like himthe ideas he brings to the table are important core features to the game that need to be improved upon not to mention that for all the time ive worked with him he has always been available to discuss new ideas and has a strong love for the gameyou may have seen him at fanfest he was the one handing out squeaky bees and making sure everyone had a good time avalloc has a strong understanding of what basic game concepts need to be brought to the attention of ccp and this is the main reason why i think he deserves your vote for csm delegate
my ideas is this during mission in scanned deadzone space if you find building or ships if you have the skill to fly the ship or unachor buildings or equipment why cant we salvage it we have killed all owners or guards therefore it is ours and no owners will come back to claim iti know myself that alot of the time lately the buildings in deadzone space 99 of the the time have no drops therefore they are only there for the boom factor so rather than waste them salvage and use or sell them

i disagree with op
if they are going to spend the time to code for two monitors wouldnt it make sense to make it scalable to many monitors while they are in there fiddling
dual screen make it so
i can now confirm that naglfars look really pretty even while blowing upalso spilt weapons in a cap fight sucks
do this thing
alliance hangers good

i wish you the best of luck in your endeavor here jade i miss the old days of eve terribly and this is a shining example of why
erm i thinkyes
skill queue is not neededtrain skills with short time left while you are onlinetrain long skills while youre offlineno planning necessaryhowever it is necessary to log in oh noesbetter things to do than queuing skills eh
yes we had that drivel before  think before posting have a good day
come back and tell me that once you have over 20 partially trained skills with several hours left
how about im not online 24 hours every day and i have several l5 skills i dont absolutely need but a lot of partially trained lowerlevel skills that i would need my shortest skill right now is at around 6 hours and plenty more between 6 and 12 hours skills i want trained at a higher levelso yeah a skill queue is needed both for very young and very old playersthe only players that dont really feel the need for one are the half a year to a year players give or take a couple of months
yup didnt feel the need for it as stronlgy as a very young player though but that was because there was so much to train for that there was always something usefull to train now i find myself training skills to lvl 5 i dont need at lvl 5 just because my skill points wont go to waste
while i dont consider it as urgent as some other things it would certainly be a welcome feature
pathetic troll is pathetic
yes
resurrecting this well supported idea as it is on my agenda
hell yessigned
agree with op
just read the patch noteswho wants my stuffyou guys took a sandblaster to a soup cracker
heh true stuff oh wait and we have been testing it on sisi but ccp is from iceland apparently they dont teach reading comprehension or customer service or both therein other news the link to warhammer online is here great new content coming their way it looks like if you read that heavy metal articleand ofc the obligatory wrath of the lich king and wow community site is here
against
this patch affects way to many aspects of the game to be well thought through i try and cut ccp alot of slack and go on faith most of the time but the release date of this expansion combined with the current sisi revision does not make me feel like this expansion is going to do much of anything good for the eve universei vote no
signed
i like my vaga
im against the nerf because its so far reachingi agree with it in principle  some ships shouldnt go as fast as they can currently gohowever i disagree with how this readjustment is being handled speed is related to everything and therefore adjusting it completely like is being done means adjusting almost everything elsemore time needs to be spent to find a correct or even an agreeable answer
and ccp still ignores this
against the blob encouraging nerf sigh eve was fun once
yeeha ofc i wanna trash my deimps respectively with the upcoming changes even zuluparks 645deimos with rep bonus wouldve made more sense ccp stop this madness speedpatch really has not just to be postponed but to be revised
ccp give me back my game
ahem1500 vs 230000yeah can i haz all ur stuffzhello nano nerf goodbye lamers

skill queue is not neededtrain skills with short time left while you are onlinetrain long skills while youre offlineno planning necessaryhowever it is necessary to log in oh noesbetter things to do than queuing skills eh
i didnt support this before the ghost training nerf but now i dont see any reason beyond deliberately making the game less attractive to play to not put in a skill queue somewhere between 24 hours and 8 days
im a very sad panda to see that a skill queue is not part of the quantum rise expansionyou gonna make us wait at least another 6 months ccp shakes head
10
good ideai would love if this were implemented orchange the standard period of wait to 72 hours instead of 24 and then make it so that the new skill allows you to jump 1 times per 72 hour period per level and make it a rank 14 skill so that at level 5 you can jump 6 times any time you like per 72 hour periodtralala
the problem with increasing the number of times you can jump within a certain period of time is how you decide when that period of time begins and ends is it it set like measured from midnight et to midnight et a day or so later or is it based on when you last jumped like it is now only with even more jumps added on to complicate itno much simpler is to keep it to one jump every 24 hours but with a skill that reduces that time with each level trained

and if youve read carefully you would know that that means that the instant anyone puts up a bounty contract pretty much everyone in the universe can have kill rights on that target they just go and accept the contractat which point bounty hunting is not a way to get revenge on someone who wronged you in high sec or low sec but a unreasonable restriction on player activityi dont think you understand how a reverse auction works you see if you have the kill right and are setting out the bounty you agree to pay some amount the hunters then bid the price down this means that when the contract is accepted and completed the person putting out the bounty pays the money out the competition comes from hunters each looking to do the job for cheaper collateral is necessary so that there is incentive for the hunter to complete the contract otherwise players can take a contract and ignore itwhat is my point about what youre making no sense who read these things and often make decisions based on it
skill queue is not neededtrain skills with short time left while you are onlinetrain long skills while youre offlineno planning necessaryhowever it is necessary to log in oh noesbetter things to do than queuing skills eh
yes we had that drivel before  think before postinghave a good day
hell the lack of a skill queue is one of the things that just might make me stop playing eve no nobody can has my stuff i might need it if the queue ever gets implemented
i am not that far yet but i must admit this constant beating around the bush on ccps side about this issue is seriously starting to  me off
i wouldnt quit just because of the lack of a skill queue but combined with other things it might just do the trick having a skill queue on the other hand would strongly encourage me to keep playing eve though   so ccp having no queue is an incentive to stop playing having a queue is an incentive to keep playing now what would you as a company do with that information
i log in when i feel like it or when its convenient no other time i set skills mostly based on when i think i might feel like logging in next of course when im training up for something specific i just suck it up and train whatever skills are neededyup i lose a little bit of training time here and there i dont really care too much about that though tbh not having a queue does not make me log in more thats for damned sure
aye morphite is too abundant atm
hmm so we need to remove morphite because it makes t2 cheaper and drives down the price of t2 goods given that this impacts t2 producers but not the majority of pilots who benefit from such things i cant see how this is a bad thingi produce t2 goods but by far the biggest price dropper is invention personally i see this as a good thing for the pilots 0 space already makes good isk per hr via other activities thats a poor argument imoarithron
zydrine and megacyte should be removed too from alloys
to an extent i would agree that while not removed completely it would be good to reduce some what the amount of morphite generated through drone alloysi strongly believe that module drops should be greatly reduced in npc wreaks which a minor increase in the ratio of meta gear and a small increase in salvage to offset the reduction of modules
yesso when is it
if you cut training times in half are you going to double my 80m skillpoints and let me allocate them wherever i please i doubt it so no suck it up and train like the rest of us have
very welcome
outstanding idea
support the concept want to discuss details
the general concept is interesting but theres a few thingsis there a way for the defending corp of detecting and stopping one of these from going up within a reasonable time frame if you can just pop one up without recourse that could prove to be over the lineid also like to see if there is a set limit on how long the cloak can last being able to refuel it for as long as you please would create some problems theres enough complaints about lone afk cloakers sitting in a system to scare people away whats going to happen when they know theres a base somewhere in the system that can have a bunch of black opsrecon ships just jump into at any time if you add a limit say once per week the cloak dies for 12hrs or perhaps a system wide notification once per 1 hour about when it will go down and only go down for 12hrs so it could be defended reasonably and not have people sitting around for 12hrs with their fingers up their butts during that time it becomes probable and destructible this would allow people to counter them but give at least 1 week for harassmentyou mention metagame espionage as a way of countering this which i very much disagree with especially considering your target for people that will use this are smaller corps that usually operate in very tight nit groups that never recruit also making these same people who likely do not have the logistics capability to possibly make daily trips to maintain is simply weird it seems made for the elite of huge corps to use not really for small corps at all i think you need to flesh out the whole vision more and what its for if its for small corps then you need to make it simple to maintain but short lived so you only do general greifing ops and not staging a prolonged offensivewhich i think you could with the current iteration that would be likely from most merc corps if its for big corps then fuel costs should be extremely high to drain resources at a high rate so that it forces you to commit a nonnegligible amount of resources to kicking people in the shins
outstanding idea
nay boo  there should be risk in eve
1 for kayleeand yes scotty needs to go
i dont support thisas i said in a thread on a similar topic trying to get people out of npc corps where they are safe doesnt result in them somehow getting involved in fw or pvp in general it will simply push them into 1 man corps where they will continue mission running in safety complete waste of time to do this
to be truthful i have found it useful when trying to create channels that have already been created i had no desire to join the stupid channel that already had people in it rather i wanted to create a new one for other people to be invited to join

she seems to get quite some recomendations  well ank you just recieved my 2 votes too 
i think scagga is a pretty cool guy he runs for csm and doesnt afraid of anything you have my vote old friend
thanks darius re consolidation of 00 spacethis is a concept i am interested to explore at present the degree of control over allianceheld 00 space can vary with some systems behaving like the hubs you describe and others being mostly barren save for a sovereignty pos and a few npcersin response to this question you may have read the earlier posts in this thread about supporting infiltration of soft forces into poorly protectedpatrolled enemy space while i havent at present proposed a gamemechanic difference between the heavily populated vs sparsely populated claimed space i do support the idea of infiltrating poorly defended enemy space so if a territorial entity is unable to keep eyes on farflung possessions i think that hostile settlement by guerrilla forces is a logical sequela  using the aforementioned proposed mobile basesinfrastructure this does not necessarily compromise sovereignty i would also like to hear more about what you would suggest the practical changes would be as influence diminishes and approaching the idea in the future would require wider discussionre inflicting tangible damage on a smaller scalethis is also a good question ive said before that 00 warfare needs to be spread over a wider area  thus giving smaller scale objectives may be an important part of encouraging this of course one must not promote an idea to which there is no counter  ideas that i would want to discuss in the future would include station sabotage placing mines or moving moonmining apparatus outside of pos shields suicide ships and assessing the feasibility of mobile siege weaponry of course this not exhaustive  and as said at the panel yesterday  most good ideas start as bad ideas so i wont stop brainstorming on that one p
what csm members need to do is help guide ccp to commit to a clear vision of what eve should be like the vision of eve scagga is presenting i can agree with the most so he is receiving my vote im sure he will encourage a productive dialog rather than waste the csms and ccps time on minor details which the devs ought to sort out themselves without csm interference but in the spirit of ccps and the csms eve visionsupport a man with a clear vision people

lyn  it was a while ago but do i remember good memories of fighting alongside you in the fights against the murientor tribe in northern derelik thanks for your kind wordsas you have understood different styles of alliance government need to be supported if sovereignty holding alliances are to be regarded as emerging nations in their own right eve ought to support their decisions instead of limiting them to flimsy wordofmouth agreements now for your questionre the bounty hunter systemas a standalone issue im open to hear about ways bountyhunting per se can be supported i have previously suggested roles for level 5 agents in advanced disclosure of a targets position  including commercial transactions tracing for find alts its also matter that ive thought of having a role in different game facets1 factional warfare perspectiveive mentioned that it would be interesting to see a bridging of pvp and pve through agent missions  issuing missions akin to bounty hunting ie go kill high ranking enemy militiamen and collect your reward while lowering the enemys rank in summaryyour rank in factional warfare needs to mean something more than just complex running let pvp ability factor more2 00 perspectivei have spoken as of late with 00 alliance members on the concept of agents migrating to 00 floating the idea of 00 agents being the alliance members themselves hypothetically this could lead to player agents creating unique missions for their fellow alliance members or residents this could take the form of bountyhunterlike hits industrial jobs or difficult logistics strikes it could also be a boon to mercenaryalliance relations supporting smaller scale jobs for determined specialists

well starbud its a problem worth discussing to deal with this particular problem i would say that a cap on sovereignty per se is an artificial way of dealing it rather i would support other approaches such as mobile infrastructure and ways for small groups to infest the larger 00 alliances space basically ways that could allow smaller groups to thrive in 00 akin to nomads without needing to fight the sovereignty war see my answers to dariuss questions for further elaboration the end result i think would mean that if a powerful alliance creates a huge empire that cannot be defeated by a conventional war they might have to face an unconventional war with many small groups threatening the security of their space in multiple loci
since you mention phoenixs i would like to hear your view on what specifficly you think should be done to rebalance them and that aspect of the naglfar as wellon any given pos kill phoenixs are mediocre dmg dealers and in capital on capital fights they most of the time end up dealing 0 dmg for either of two reasons torps not reacing targets in time and the fact that torps get destroyed by smartbombs do you think citadels should get an increase in speed and hps wich would make them useable in cap on cap fights should they get a flat dmg increase so theyll become truly devastating in the unlikely event they reach their targets and become kings of pos shoots or do you think they should be left the way they are 
citadel torpedoes are getting boosted by increasing hp from 650hp to 1920hp which should prevent them dying from smartbombs also ccp is finaly introducing faction citadel torpedoes so they will get onpar with other race ammunition delayed damage is trait of missile launchers and there is not much to be done when it comes to comparing all dreadnaughts lets check their base dammage using eft and all lvl5 skills to simplify things moros 3 x dual 1000mm railgun am ammo 1998 dps with 5 garde ii 3048 dps naglfar 2 x citadel torpedoes 2 x quad 3500mm arties emp xl ammo 2497 dps with 5 garde ii 2797 dps phoenix 3 x citadel torpedoes 1955 dps with 5 garde ii 2255 dps revelation 3 x dual giga pulses multi xl 2823 dps with 5 garde ii 3123 dpsi used long range guns with short range ammo as most common setup and no damage mods we can see that without drones nalgfar is not bad damage wise mostly due to having 4 weapon hardpoints and phoenix having weakest damage and delayed on top of that moros damage is almost the same as pheonix but with drones 50 bonus to drone damage he is coming close to revelationnow biggest naglfar problem is divided weapon groups most common dreadnought setups atm are using 2 damage mods except naglfar which is in most cases using only one gyrostabilizer ii lets check the numbers now moros 3 x dual 1000mm railgun am ammo 2 x magnetic field stabilizer ii 2937 dps with 5 garde ii 3987 dps naglfar 2 x citadel torpedoes 2 x quad 3500mm arties emp xl ammo 1 x gyrostabilizer ii 2770 dps with 5 garde ii 3070 dps phoenix 3 x citadel torpedoes 2 x ballistic control system ii 2873 dps with 5 garde ii 3173 dps revelation 3 x dual giga pulses 2 x multi xl 2 x heat sink ii 4150 dps with 5 garde ii 4450 dpsrevelation is clearly the best damage dealer plus it has no problems with reloading ammo moros is following him and naglfar has even lower damage then phoenix but has two guns inflicting instant damage and 2 launchers with delayedconclusion with boosting citadel torpedoes by increasing their hp and introducing faction version of them phoenix and naglfar are getting a slightly boost but they are still behind moros and especialy revelation which is far the best dreadnought atm as naglfar and moros pilot i am not completely happy with current situation but as i said nonbalanced races are on of the eve best perks sometimes your race rocks and sometimes sucks you just need to learn to live with itor simple  crosstrain d

yup my mistake thanx for correcting me but more or less conclusion is the same
the actual question i wanted answered is in wich way if any you thought citadels should be changed do you think the currnetly planned boost is the right way to go or would you like to see it happen in some other waysry for burying it in additional text

sorry guyswhen i see 6 goonswarm canidates i think something just is not right about itif on the off chance 23 or more pull down enough votes to all be elected do you think they are going to be unbiased and not support each other this has a potential to be a power bloc that shouldnt be allowed alliances should be limited to one 1 canidate only of course that would mean any goon bob iron canidate automaticly gets electedof course if csm is a joke as many think this wouldnt matteror would it
dont stop posting
actually darius was a good csm member this round dont go linking ingame politics and alliances with the players ability outofgame to work hard at making the game better for othersthats partly to blame for the last csm being as it wasarithron
soits bad that one of the biggest alliances in eve has 6 members attempting to gain a seat out of a total of 42 run everyone fourteen percent of the candidates are goonssee you shoulda used a percentage sounds like a much bigger number
i guess the one most important thing i would look at if i make it to the csm is the new player experience i would probably be safe in saying that a large part of the people the try eve via the 14 day trial macro miners isk sellers excluded will have their eyes glaze over and run screaming from the room within a hour of starting eve the first time though ccp did announce they are planning on working on making the new player experience more comfortable i want to make sure that what they do is enough to keep new players in the game without giving up after 12 hours say what you will about new players eve needs then to grow besides new players make for easy targets to boost the egos of some of our more ability challenged players
environments because really thats millions of ways in which eve can be improved just right there
how many votes are there i noticed there are many candidates and since i didnt vote in the original csm election i kind of missed out on how the voting works i searched around for a thread that would help me out with this but didnt find anything on the voting mechanics at all thanks in advance
each account more than 30 days old gets one vote the candidate who finishes first is the chair 29 are members and 1014 are alternates it was outlined in the original csm documentpage 14 but youre right that it should be outlined in a way that players can find it more easily not just in a yearold document a lot of players wont know about
a few players have been asking me about my opinions on certain things ingame i have views on things like 00 space low sec pvp in empire etc just like any other player has ill condense my personal opinions into a few brief bullets as a summarypvp opportunites in empire have been getting fewer with all the recent changes empire has become safer personally i dont think this is a good thing in the lower end sec systems of empire 05 and 06 esp players that wish to play the bad guy get very little opportunity in empire from starting as a new character elsewhere areas such as low sec arent conducive to being a new player and surviving more experienced players also have little opportunity to be evil swines low sec frankly sucks and is in need of much lovei want to see a system like the reverse of empire in terms of sec status effects in lower sec systems if you travel to 01 system with high sec status bad things may happenthis is linked to my ideas for npc pirate corpsalliances that players could join in low secthere should be opportunities for roving gangs to pay off officials in the lower end of empire 05 and 06 systems to ignore their sec status perhaps allow for a set period of relative immunity from concord intervention away from stations and gatesninja salvaging wrecklooting etc we have all read the posts from players whining about these activities im personally all for them id go a step furthermake npc rats nonplayer owned after destruction but a chance that if you didnt kill them youll be flagged red to player id make cans likewise for mission sites lower the chance of finding via exploration a little to compensate for the new professional looting gangsim also leaning for letting capitals into empire space allowing them to only target wardecced corpsalliances and their assets of course a cap shouldnt be able to jump out again or use the gatesask any other stanceposition questions belowtake carearithron

despite flames sent towards patri his points are valid and have summed up my negative on this position fairly well this game mechanic is working as intended no differently than are current salvaging rules ccp has every reason to limit hisec profitability and get people to branch out into lownull sec the riskreward limitations are embedded into the philosophy if not the code of the eve environment and to rewrite the code itself to further imbalance the game towards greater hisec profitability is not really in anyones interest the established workaround to looting your kills first is to have a dedicated looter no differently than for a mission runner that wants to defend their own salvage i say this as someone that has lived in null sec while supporting my gameplay as well as my gtcs running missions not to be confused with either the empire hugging camps nor the vultures that profit from the works of others sure it may not be the sexiest role to play but does give the corp newb something to do besides suicide tackler move somewhere that you can shoot the offender just like ccp has silently instructed the dedicated mission runner unhappy that the safety insured by concord seems to cover the ninja salvagers that interrupt their bottomless bottom lines worried about sec hits move to 00 and fix that too let us not forget that there have been plenty of corps dedicated to hisec wardec piracy and cant imagine that ccp will ever make a move to make that any more profitableeve is harsh eve is unexpected eve just might make you think and if thats not working out you can join my 5yr old he really enjoys his gnome warlock on wow

ccp wake up
official response
yes please i never used the ghost training bug but i feel this has been needed for a long time
signed
signedthe reason why i support this idea is because it can have various positive effectscurrently a lot of people probably log in just to change a skill and they idle for some time so they can activate the next skill trainingif there is a queue those people could queue their short training skills and just log in set skills and log outccp says they want people to play the game but the people that login just to change a skill arent playing anywayanother thing about this is that it will decrease the load on the servers a lot because people dont have to stay logged in if they are doing some short training skills also the amount of players logged in will be more accuratelyyou get the ideai support this thread  although i would be satisfied with just having 2 or 3 queue slots unlimited is really not needed
theres have been countless ideas for this and while i support the idea in general it has to be worked out in specifics to work welli think the best solution ive seen is where you set a long skill as a secondary and a short one as a primary and while the primary skill is training it takes up 34 of your training speed and the the long skill 14 once the primary skill finishes the secondary one trains at maximum speed until you select a new primary skillfirst downside to using it is that neither skill trains as fast as it would alone but on the upside if you dc or there is an unscheduled dt your long skill will kick in at full speed once the short skill finished also it makes training up the ridiculously long skills palatable by making them be out of sight out of mind as it were carrier v anyoneif its implemented like this i would so use it and my skill training would cease to be interrupted by dts or connection issues or even just plain forgetting
lets say you have everything nice and planned you have a 5 minute gap in your schedule where you can change skills and a skill set to end in that timejust before you login the server goes down unexpectedly you now have to wait at least 10 minutes before you can log back in assuming an instant reboot but in 5 minutes you have to leaveif you have a queue of sufficient length this problem wont happen

this fundamental change to combat is wrong in so many ways i hate the direction that eve is going these combat changes are horrible does ccp actually think that these changes are going to do anything other than promote blobs ccps history is not good they always overnerf something then are forced to buff it 1 to 2 years later the question is do you feel like waiting 2 years for ccp to correct this mistakethe whole premise that small ships can fight large ships is flawed of course a battleship wont be able to solo an af so what will it do  join up with 10 of his buddies sorry but this change works against small gang and solo pvp  so much for our sandbox welcome to swg ii
againstall they had to do was increase the mass of cruisers so that they can no longer be made to go faster than interceptors and it would have solved the nano problem instead they completely change the missile damage formula where a specialized cruise missile fired from a stealth bomber a ship designed to alpha strike and destroy small ships in one volley will no longer be able to alpha strike a frigate going 150 msec or faster despite the cruise missiles going 7500 msec towards iti will be forced to quit the game for good as i feel like my years of training in missiles will be useless in pvp and solo stealth bomber pilots will become obsolete

had a chat to some people who went to fanfest and they made a comment about walking in stations and the facility to be able to play cards and gamble is ccp aware that doinghaving this will make eve an r 18 rated game in most western countries 
yes because there are absolutely no players under 13 playing evein other words it doesnt matter
while i would agree with your concerns if real money was changing hands as a result of ingame gambling the fact remains that any gambling done as a result of ambulation would be for isk  ingame items onlyas a result it shouldnt fall under any gambling laws that im aware of and so eve would retain its current age rating
i think youll find that in most western countries anything that promotes gambling to minors is not tollerated and it doesnt matter whether its iskitems or rl money playing of cards for isk promotes gambling subsequently most countries will see it this way and rate eve 18
untrue if that was the case then the likes of this gameworld series of poker tournament champions wiiwould be rated as 18 not 12
yea but in world series poker your not playing other people and you dont lose anything
neither do you in eve
in a lot of places you convert you money to game credits and use that to play if gambling was allowed in eve it may fall into that catagory due to isk sellersand that would be a bad thing
since isk selling is against the eula i doubt it
did a little bit of digging most downloadable poker software does indeed have an age restriction of 18 however this is due to the real money aspect of that softwarein most cases however the point at which age verification is required is when you sign up to a real money account before then you can happily play on the play money tables without requiring to prove your ageso as long as the buyins and prizes are all ingame items then there is no further need for age verification in evebesides you already gamble every day in game as soon as you click undock you place your isk and assets at risk from other players and hope that your skill and luck is more than theirs in order to make a profit
if player names like cty fps and blowing people up have not already made eve an 18 game where you live i sincerely doubt that placing bets for ingame money will eitherthere are countless games out there for under 18s where you can take part in gambling type activities via minigames
im not too much of a gambler but if that is what it takes to sift away a bimbominkia aka whiny kid then so be it casino and nude gallenteans when i dock
this argument is a waste of time i can think of numerous games that have a form of gambling of some such or sortif if involved real currency it would be a factor but it doesntso again waste of time
of course there are those games where rw money is converted to ingame currency miningkilling things generates randomly ingame currency which can then be withdrawn in the rw at a decent exchange rate sound like gambling to you i think it qualifiesoh my point its restricted to 13 with parent permission of coursetake carearithron
yes because it would fall afoul of us anti gambling laws and all credit card payments from us consumers pending could be frozen
ambulation will need some spicing up to make it more than just walking around and gambling should do the trick nicely i seriously doubt that any us law enforcement agency would give it so much as a second glance especially since ingame currency is not legally considered to be the same as actual rl currency if you read the eulas of most mmos the developer owns all virtual property and money generatedand besides ccp is a company thus they have lawyers to tell them if what theyre doing is legal i dont think the legality of something is a valid issue for csm were gamers not attorneys for the most partcase in point second life second life encourages exchanging rl money for ingame currency and has playerrun and designed gambling centers to my knowledge they have yet to be sued for this
online gambling as in that which is generally banned or restricted is where you must deposit monies into a game expressly for the purpose of gambling and where you can withdraw those same monies from the game to yourself by some means such as mailed check bank deposit and so ongambling in eve station does not cross any of those lines as you do not pay a subscription to gamble nor can you withdraw your isk in a means as outlined above to your local currencyyou can purchase gtcs to sell for isk but this is not directly related to the gambling and still lacks a means to convert isk back into real world currencies that is sanctioned by ccpin short if you cant put real cash into the game and take real cash out of it for the express purpose of playing games of chance restrictions and bans do not apply
its not gambling when no assets change ownership
hate to break it to you ugly but whatever ccp says goes they dont make excuses they make the rules and as such theyre always validshould it not make any sense or be gamebreaking thats another issue the skillqueue gravytrain to bumville just isnt that important in any aspect so you missed to train something for a few hours
agreed for me i currently set up my skills to complete at one of two times betweeen 6pm and midnight which is my usual playing time so if im logging in at this point im logging in to play anyway not just to change skills around 730 am just after i get up but before i go to work if im changing a skill at this point then theres no way in hell that im pulling a sickie in order to stick around to do stuff in an internet spaceship game ill just change the skill and go to worktherefore in both circumstances outlined above not having a skill queue does not encourage me to play the game more as id be playing anyway in the first example and dont count the second one as playing the game at all as all im doing is changing a skill and logging out

i dont think skill training time should be reduced at least not like what you are suggestingto encourage players to be try more things in eve like pvp maybe ccp could take away the learning implants and introduce a new learning skill that would take the place of the implants eg training advance skill progression to lvl 5 would give you 5 on all your attributes or keep the implants and introduce a skill that decreases training time by 1 per levelor something to that effect at any rate i dont think 50 is fair to both the new and old players lvl 5 skills should be an accomplishmentnot something easily gained i feel your pain i just trained caldari bs to 5 and it took almost a month but it was worth itand the benefits of lvl 5 skills need to be earned also giving players sp as compensation for the reduction in skill time would cheapen the sense of accomplishment that training those long desired skills give players
both thumbs down this is eve where you do the time not the grind
thanks for all the feed back but i do hope with the way the world is going in rl things dont tripple in price and you all keep your jobs and gtcs dont cost over a billion for a 60day etc um well if it does theres hope for me yet to catch up
bitter much
what you are proposing would as someone already said destroy the game within six months these players that you suggest quite eve because of training boredom in my opinion dont really get the game if it is all about having a fully skilled command ship how many days do you think they will stick around after they and pretty much every other eve player has one then following on the isk price of gtcs will collapse due to all the relative newbs selling gtcs as it is their only way to fund their command ships etc and all the vets having left by this time then the training boredom quitters will quit because all the best ships are too expensive etc etc command ships etc were introduced after what 3 4 years because the vets had nowhere else to go but you just want to jump strait to the top disregarding many years worth of great content and infinite other possibilities because if you really must have something special early buy yourself a pimped faction battleship many other relative newbs with a similar outlook on the game have taken that route and quite a couple of days later when they get killed by a couple of cruisers or somesuch
ill only agree to this if 50 of my skillpoint total is given to me to allocate to whatever i want seeing as i would have used 50 more time getting to where i am than newer players would p
one of the best features is the long skill training time  its the things you learn getting there that will save your ass in this game  skill points dont mean  without personal experience to back them up
there should be a way to increase training speed booster of some kind 50 reduction is overkill though
seriously everything i see on this forum is nerf this buff that whine whine whine us newbies dont care we want fun and engaging content not running the exact same mission over and over for weeks to raise our standingwe want meaningful and easily accessible pvp not having to rely on gate camping can flipping faction lolfare and can baiting to see any pvp at allwe want to jump right in and play the damn game instead of having to wait a month or two on required skillsplease pass on the message to ccp that the entrance bar to eve online needs to be drastically lowered not to the level of wow of course but enough for us to ease into the game with a reasonable learning curve dont make me pull out that learning curve chart weve all seenand if you havent seen the zero punctuation video review of eve yet its in my sig the video has been making its rounds and is an accurate depiction of the game
to start with i suggest joining a corporation eve is fundamentally a game based on corporations you will find it a lot easier to get into the game if you join a corporationalso you can find more info on my priorities which include reducing that entrance bar here
who says you speak for all other noobs o but yes go join a corp youll get what you want sooner or later
speak for yourself not for the new players all you want is to get into the game get the biggest beat stick possible the second day in and then go around hitting people with it well good luck with that i enjoy the time that is spent making my character the way it is if you really want to go get into a fight go get into a corp or how about this pick the darkest corner of 00 and fly to it they will shoot you up real good
hehfor pvp you could always just fly down through syndicate spacelots of cough friendly people will help you down there  on a serious note though i undertstand your frustration i was the same way when i was a noob and in most respects i am still a newer player the thing that will make a large difference is finding a corp that will help you learn the ins and outs of eveor at least a corp to have some fun with as far as pvp goes you might try the faction warfare i havent been part of it yet but it might be something to look into
what are you highlighting as the bars to entry for newer players pvp doesnt just take a bunch of skills it takes practice isk to buy equipment and a degree of luckthere are two issues right thereisk and skills do you suggest lowering skill reqs or speeding up skill training how about a nice fat starting wallet both have serious issues associated with them it might be better to have an area of space set aside as training groundsoh waitthats faction warfareseriously the best way to gain experience is to join a corp or team up with a few more experienced players eve is an excellent way to make new friends and everyone needs a buddy when those ships start flashing redtake carearithron
we currently have a situation where several corporations that now constitute the redoverlord alliance where ejected from red alliance the reason given for this was failure to turn over to goonswarm systems that the overlord corporations wanted to retain to farm for purposes of rmtnow ill give that coad is not generally noted for reliable reporting to say the least if true however and goons and ra seem to generally be supporting this claim then1 it shows evidence of farming for purposes of rmt by member corporations of red alliance in the past2 if true this would imply that currently paid professional players are engaged in a sov war in 00 for purposes of securing space to be farmed for rmt3 third party transfers of isk for value can be used to front for criminal activity money laundering among others which could leave member players not participating in the rmt open to legal action in their home jurisdictionsi would like to see ccp instiute a formal system and policy for dealing with rmt issues on the alliance level this system would include a formal procedure for handling allegations of alliances or their renters engaging in rmt and referral to a board of gms not affiliated with any 00 alliance for investigationif these allegations are found to be substantiated the alliance executor and the ceos of the involved corporations would then be notified if after a two week period the situation remained unresolved or a second substantiated claim of rmt where logged within a 6 month period the alliance in question would be dissolved by ccp all poses deleted all assets of the executor corp and those corps involved with the rmt frozen and any stations owned by said alliance set to a npc corporation for a period of one week to allow for removal of assets all corps in the alliance would be banned for joining another alliance with each other under penalty of enforced dissolution for a period of six monthsa similar fate would befall a sov holding alliance with multiple instances of renters engaging in rmt
no i am not in favour of collective punishment having corp members who earn isk is not dissolutionworthy even if those members break the eula as individuals
pretty heavy accusations there if you have evidence of this rather than hearsay youd probably be advised to put it in the form of a petition with associated evidence etc if you dont have evidence its essentially slanderccp has robust ways of dealing with rmt such as account bans and such there is no justification in dissolving an alliance for the actions of a few individuals that flout the eula ccp will deal with such individuals when it is satisfied that rmt etc is occurring if it happens that those higher up in alliances are banned for such activities the fallout within the alliance will probably result in dissolution of the alliance anywayno need to punish the masses for the actions of a fewarithron
i feel that if rmt is a large part of a corp or alliance then that corp or alliance should be dissolved however for this to be true a large number of core players will need to be involved especially leadership and i cant see how an alliance can survive if its leadership simply stop logging in which is what the members will seeso i dont see any extra steps as being necessary beyond individual bans
note that dissolution only happens after the alliance executor and ceos of the offending corps have been informed and on a second offense im not talking about one guy selling isk here im talking about records showing a corporation to be hip deep in it examples of this in game are1 tyraxx rather amusingly and openly renting his enemies space to isk farmers this in itself would be a lol except tyraxx also let them into iac which they then used to make them impervious to empire wardecs we therefor have a document and admitted instance of a 00 alliance openly harboring a rmt corp for profit 500mweek i think and whatever thork was getting as a kickback2 xelas alliance openly sponsored the doomsday alliance consisting of rmt corps operating in the fountain area in return to payments of isk the justification being that cloaked ravens might as well be giving intel xelas alliance officials openly admitted to sponsoring isk farmers in return for payments and were ejected from the gbc as a result3 knights of the southcross harbored a corp for over a year in which their where multiple forum posts showing the contract logs of the isk being laundered4 members of tortuga have openly admitted that their space was well vacant except for a rmt corp that was paying tortuga several bill a month to live in pband these are the instances we know about im sure a number of 00 alliances have reached arrangements that we dont hear ofand now we have the evechina scenario playing out on tq with isk sellers openly contesting content when alliances become involved in rmt with little mercy shown its a matter of rl security for the members of the alliance not engaging in rmt if an alliance is involved in rmt and that rmt is being used to fund criminal acts then under the laws of some countries each member of the alliance could be individually responsible for the criminal acts with various degrees of knowledge requirements disbanding an alliance in such a situation is a service to its members whether they want to admit it or not
while i did not say the accusations have been proven i believe that this thread
ill avoid all the caod stuff since i make a point of avoiding caod like the plague but this last bit just seems bizarre to me trading game currency for real currency is legal in virtually all nations it violates the eula but the eula does not have the force of law in any sort of general sense the penalty for violating the eula is an account ban at worst not rl fines or jail time and theres no such thing as a eula violation by proxy association or conspiracy  you have to break it in your own right to be doing anything wrong renting space to people for use is legit even if those people engage in rmt afterwards remember eve doesnt exactly have an 800year history of case law and jurisprudence we have the eula and the tos and thats about it  the only thing that could really qualify as case law is the kugu ban the relevant section of the eula reads as follows from my reading of that even knowingly renting space to isk sellers would be legitimate of course thats hardly necessary given the presence of the ignorance defence but it does put a real limit on how far they can legally take your philosophy without serious eula amendments ive got nothing against naming and shaming but as said above i have quite a lot of opposition to collective punishment and thats exactly what you propose if an alliance leader is breaking the rules ban him but dont punish the members

you can always use it as a salvager
use drones for frigates nobody uses torps or cruise missiles on frigates if possible
if ccp dont want the main weapons to be used on frigs at all then why not completely remove the web bonus and replace it with something more useful also a bigger drone bay

mmm i checked your page out oz but nothing specifically made me feel you going to make the whiners shut up and let the pvpers enjoy it more 
i certainly think there is a reasonable stance that can be taken against whiners shut up whiners are one of the only ways imbalance can be detected and fixed fixing imbalance makes the game better all of us are here because there is something about the game we wish was better even you as such an antiwhiner platform cannot really be internally consistent that being said there are a number of candidates myself included who are dedicated to ensuring that more aspects of the game involve pvp and that creating conflict is the central purpose of design decisions whether that is market pvp research pvp mission pvp or good old fashioned boat violence pvpeglink to campaign thread
well as anti whiner i mean im tired of people trying to petition me every time i try to declare war on them i specifically play this game for pvp as in player vs player combat in space i dont do market i dont do production i leave that to the carebears and select a few to extort every once in a while so i can make income very hard earned from pvp so i can finance more interesting pvp for one thing i dont like the war system as it is 3 slots are not enough should be at least five or seveni would like the eula to specify that anyone can kill you yes more than once and nothing will be done if that someone isnt being rude or racist or whatever the harrassment smack on the hands should kick in over time not just for me telling them im coming to get you otherwise youre not tackling the problem if i feel restricted in my possibility to pursue someone ill just hire someone else to do it simple asim not calling for an open fragfest where the shooting never stops this is why we have empire im not saying that all people should pvp im just saying that everyone is free to do missions free to do trade free to do whatever they want except for the purist pvpers as in ships vs ships and if someone in the csm isnt there to protect this dying race then im gonna call wwf animal protection jokingno really think about it sandbox and balance if ive benn in the game 3 years and paid my monies every month i want the ccp given right to wardeck who i want for as much as i want and possibly if i can afford it how many as i want and all my targets can do about it is learn the game and kill me or pay upanother thing id like to be tackled by csm is the insane misproportion between t2 ship efficency and cost things are already unfair for us long timers we skilled months if not years for them nice t2 ships saved up loads to buy a nice versatile combination of shipsmodules and lo here comes along the speed nerf what you going to do nerf jammers now that every gang will have falcons whereas all that should have been done is give the players some more time to learn how to pvp or skill rapierhyenas now any noob in a frigate can come along and turn an mwd off great a couple rifter noobalts and a blackbird total cost 15 mil can pwn any t2 recon or hac i call this unbalance but on the other side of the coin i also call a machariel 14k msec unbalance i dont have the answers i just want to keep enjoying this gamer
pvp is the past the present and the futureill be looking for issues that address the safer feel of eve lately i want to see low sec become more of a pvp zone for the players that wish to explore their darker side actually have meaningful content there for them to participate in id like to see a reverse sec status system operating in low sec also the higher your sec status in low sec systems the worse off youll be ninja salvaging loot stealing etc all good professions that should be encouraged maybe a few tweaks to the system to make it chance based that doing such activities will result in aggroarithron
i have never experienced this type of problem and ive done my fair share of pvp the worst unwarranted thing that ive seen have been local muting anything worse requires some serious abuse there is a lot of concern about the speed nerf but youre an elite pvper right youll adapti think for the moment we are just going to have to accept that smart tactics will have a larger advantage than they did before over the expensive shipsi personally think that is a good thing even if the changes might be a little bit severe it means more people will be fighting more pvp is good right more challenge new challenges
id like to think that im something like what youre looking for im not quite as much of a pvp purist as you are but i think the war system needs work and im a strong believer in pvp being legitimate and in fact the cornerstone of this game as for people petitioning you over a war i dont think that ever happened with me but given that i know exactly what the answer will be i dont see why youd care anyone who does that is choosing to hide behind false hope instead of doing military preparation during the opening stages and is thus an even easier target than they would otherwise be when a gm rejects their petition as for t2 ships youre trading cost for capability a hac is simply better than a cruiser and mostly better than a battlecruiser if youre good enough that the added capability is worth the added money pay up  a veteran pvper should have a good enough kill ratio to justify the added costs otherwise stick to pimping out your t1 ship skills its not like cruiser 5 is wasted even if you never set foot in a hac after all i wont address the balance issues  i havent been able to get on singularity for a good round of testing recently  but i trust that itll all moreorless balance out at the end of the day even if it does take a few months and if you think falcons are going to be that common fit a longrange battleship with eccm already  you should utterly demolish one if you plan ahead dont whine play the metagame
nice tryimho there is nothing more meaningful that the feeling of the pvp itself when you do your first podkill aaah some players actually thanked me wardecking and killing them saying they had their best time in the game surely the adrenalin rush of an engagement in my eyes cant compete with a slowly growing wallet on lv4 farminglow sec looks to me already full of dark sidersi dont understand what you mean by reverse sec standing hits but me thinks that the sound of it aint goodlooting already makes you flashy but i think that who loots should be flashy to the corp that owns the wreck but also to the person who killed him
ok it looks like pattern is the man to vote for
i do like the idea a calender that tells the player the daymonthyear in the eve universe which they could plan activities or schedule things for themselves maybe provide a corp planning calender which adjust datetime automatically to compensate for the players timezone maybe through client settingsedit kuzim please update the name of this post to something simpler eg idea ingame calender so people will have a better idea of what the post is about and may be more inclined to read iteg exempli gratia which is latin that roughly translates into for example

does anyone have any information on the next tournament has ccp given up on this fun event too if so we need to kick someone to get it up and running with the new patch it will be interesting to see people adapt to the new mechanincs and flying styles lets get this party startedwildcat
iirc in the most recent live dev blog someone asked a question about why there has been no alliance tourny in so long the ccp people there started talking about how the tourny costed 5 digits and the significant number being very large so instead of doing that again they decided to create a small team to work on some way for there to be tournaments without direct ccp involvements arenas or something like that
the turny is boring as hell who cares what stradigy or tactics you can come up with when 10x carcal missile spam will win or 10x thorax or 10x ruppies or 10x vexors or 10x insert other random gank ship here
 yeah i agree but i still find it fun to watch the good parts of the fights and the commentary and some of the funny banter i may ff through 75 of it but i enjoy the alliance tourney and am very disappointed to see it disappear if that is the case
it was never the 10 ships of the same class winning yeah they did win some fights but it was never the ultimate strategy in the end it is simply not versatile enough it does not have a strategic reserve so cannot adapt when already in the arena i think that being professionally organized was a very important factor in the success of the tournament i hope that even if they change it so that more teams can enter there are a lot more qualification rounds that are not being broadcasted at least the matches of the final 32 are done in the way of the previous tournaments if you wanna push it do not forget to vote in the relevant csm thread
did anyone catch a glimpse of planetary flight update at fanfest i think they spliced it into the quantum rise trailer toothe claw frig getting gunned down in an atmosphere of some typei sorta need to see the presentation on that it was when they were discussing war on planetsthanks o7
let people cyno into high sec but only if they are in nonnpc corporations
sure but first freighters and jump freighters have to be limited to people within player corps
sorry for the delayed responses guys im in iceland and the internet at this hotel is a pile of poo im for what i think any reasonable person would be for i have no problem with responsible and mature developers who can exercise proper judgment and not interfere with the game and cheat having access i think weve had a series of unfortunate circumstances which have allowed the actions of a small niche of people with no self control to have a very negative impact on the game i believe that the institution of ia is a great start and that if we can be assured that these things arent happening or at least if they are the people are actually punished then the playerbase will be significantly more comfortable with the idea of developers playing eve again i think for a majority of people the poor judgment wasnt as much of a problem as the complete lack of accountability
voted comedy darius allcaps option
you get my vote because i like faction warfare please continue to ask for a content injection for faction warfare
you seem like the best candidate to me particularly since you seem to be troubled by all aspects of eves problems not just the ones that directly affect you a very good value to have as a candidategot my vote

you have my vote for promoting piracy
one of ideas i had is to increase their damage and cut their range off and to introduce citadel cruises and citadel cruise launcher phoenix is only dreadnought with only one set of weapons citadel cruises would have same damage as curent torpedoes but much higher velocity current boost is not perfect solution as i said but its better then nothing
gogogo vuk u have my support

edit reworked last alineaupdateat fanfest2008 i noticed realised somethingthe number of players of eve online has grown alot and will grow even faster in the futurethere were so many new players at fanfestwhich is a good thing but i noticed they dont know anything about the history of eve the players communities chronicleslet me give an example say for instance cyvok would had been at fanfest many of the visitors would now say and you are what i will focus on being csm is that our efforts shall not be forgotteni will try to find ways with ccp to work out how to get this done and what canwill be possiblesigned extremecsm candidateceo of eye of god eog since 2003high commander of intrepid crossing alliance irc
is there any that dare say theyre not interested in a gooned out councili think its a fair question because i for sure will base my decision and cast my vote on someone antigoon
i for one am running on an antistellar solutions platform
i guess it is a fair question but also potential suicide for a campaign but alas i will bitei am not specifically antigoon i respect them what they have done in our game how big they have become and will admit that hearing tales of the goonswarm is part of what got me back into playing eve love them or hate them they are a force to be reckoned withthat said i am not specifically progoon rather i would prefer to put alliances aside and try and find out what is best for eve and act from there if a proposal is also in the goonUFFFDs best interest great else their influence will not sway mein real life i am always thrust into a leadership position due to my outgoing personality and work ethic i have been at the helm of student governments sports teams clubs and random political activists groups for as long as i can remembereven as a child i always ended up leading team b in gym with all of this experience i know what it takes to be firm yet not to the point of being hard headed my will is strong and if elected you do not have to worry about me being gooned or what have you finally do not base your vote on a totally antigoon platform what if they actually were all the best candidates and could have done great things for eve
what does antigoon mean does it mean that they are against the interests of goons does it mean they are against the interest of large 00 alliancesbecause goons are players like anyone else we like to have fun and we do it within the context of 00 sovereignty warfare this means that we want 00 sovereignty warfare to be fun and all aspects of the game that we partake in to be funi suppose if you are against having fun in 00 and against having fun in other aspects of the game voting against a goon makes sense it also makes sense if you are looking for someone who is going to focus more on lowsec or highsec issues otherwise you should look at specific ideals that each candidate has and make a decision based on thatdarius for example has a pretty strong record for arguing for things that would weaken the position of the goonswarm alliance as a 00 power he does this because the power of goonswarm doesnt mean anything if goons arent having fun at least that is how i see it maybe he is just griefing us
i admit i would gnash my teeth a bit if we would get 5 goons in the csm i assume thats what the op meant with getting gooned out of council but i dont think that being antigoon in the csm would get anyone anywhere we already had enough conflicts during the first csm and it was very counterproductive the csm needs to work together and represent the players goons and nongoons alikein the end it is not up to me who has the right to be on the csm it is the players decission if a large amount of players vote for goons then we have to respect their decission as well as respect the council members they advocatedif you dont like goons that is fine and you can use your influence to vote or lobby for someone else but starting a conflict especially after elections is disastrous and should be one of the things i and i hope you as well learned from the first csm
antigoon you mean will i let the ingame politicsevents carry over to a player body that meets in real life to discuss whole game issuesi wont ingame remains firmly there i am working on the principles that all those that have stood for the csm have stood for the right reasons and wish to make the game that we all enjoy all players enjoy it otherwise they wouldnt play better darius has shown himself to be a good intelligent and useful member of the csm last round it was just a shame that many csm members couldnt put ingame alliances and politics asideeve allows for many different playstyles which is why its such a rich and entertaining place to reside away from the real world i dont think it follows that a players style reflects in any meaningful way their rl ability to be part of a council there is the possibility this round of 7 members of goonsquad getting onto the csm so long as they are there for the right reasons and are prepared to listen and represent players does that really matter is it any worse than csm members being on the council and running for the council with the stated aim of catching ccps eye for internship i find it interesting how there is always one large alliance that everyone loves to hatea few years ago it was bob now its goonshopefully in a couple of years its the gallente trade alliancetake carearithron
anti no i think eve is about freedom the goons certainly push that envelope i am however worried that too many goons in the council could defeat its purposei would also like to see the goon candidates officially renounce the once proclaimed goal of the goons to destroy eveissler
destroy eve they are doing a pretty good job so far just a goodlysized chunk of 00 to go plus empirepvp for the worldarithron
dont kid yourself its still bob when was the last time goons did something putting them on the news radarwith this many goons running there should be a good size portion of votes open for candidates not in the goon pocket
you mean that goon goal that wasnt ever actually said by the goons that onedbp
i think she means the goon goal that was renounced multiple times last election cycle by all the goons running
are you implying that i am in the goons pockets i might have misunderstood its really irrelevant which alliancecorp you play in within eve given that players often have multiple accounts they can be members of opposing alliances if they wish whats important is the player they are the ones that front up to meetings discuss issues and vote its up to voters to decide which candidates they think will do a good job on the csm its interesting that 7 of the candidates are from one alliance but there is no way of knowing how many of the other candidates have a bobgoonred alliance etc alt for all we know 20 of the candidates could have a character that is a member of one alliancei can look past ingame politics and work with others on behalf of players it doesnt mean i am in anyones pocket just openminded take carearithron
ive said before in other threads that i regard the possibility of a goonowned council as fantastically unlikely and thus not really something to be afraid of for a similar reason itd be almost impossible to block them  youd have to find candidates organize a campaign around the principle and coordinate vote splitting well enough to get five of yours on the council without any of the organizational basis the goons have and used to hardly worldshattering effect last time but even if it were possible i wouldnt be particularly worried  if that much of the eve player base is behind them they deserve to be spoken for and i trust ccp to filter out any ideas that are particularly stupid now im hardly progoon and i dont think a goonedout council would be a proper representative for the player base as it exists today but if youre basing your vote on blind prejudice i dont want it
the whole destroy eve schtick was mittanis attempt to instill xenophobia within goonswarm as a means of raising morale during a period of intense turbulence within the alliance he believed that using propaganda to intensify the us versus them mentality within goonswarm would galvanize members though if it did it was only temporary and in any case it was never official alliance policy
whatever the spin is i wouldnt want 7 gbc cronies on there either or russians for that matter just give me one candidate thats not favorable to the goon mob scene
edit added quoteswhat do you think that 7 gbc cronies would implement we have to remember that this is a game and we all play to have fun there isnt some piece of the pie that we can cut off and keep for ourselves by playing politics i would not be afraid of 7 gbc cronies on the council unless they were 7 completely foolish people there isnt any damage they could do in a political sense that is not damage that anyone else could do by being foolish the council is not set up in a manner that would allow it

ok it looks like pattern is the man to vote for
as a lowsec mission runner with an interest in industry and trading who enjoys eves lore and frequents the chronicles section of the site i must say you have my support
no slight to darius intendedhave read logs and he does seem to be a solid personhowever if one alliance has a controlling block of votes it is not so much as they use it incorrectly as people seeing it as such the csm is a great idea and i applaud ccp for setting it up it cannot afford the impression that it is pandering to one group or another it loses credability and that is all it has to go on i am not impying that goon csm members would be dishonest or push a hidden agenda that benefits only them if one could even exist but more that alliance x for lack of better name complains that every suggestion made by its members is falling on deaf ears because of in game politicswhich as was said before plagued the previous csm councilhey its a game and its the internetopinions and impressions are a dime a dozen
multiple candidates from the same alliance split the alliance vote its about strategy and tactics if an alliance wants to win the chair position on number of votes they need to concentrate on one candidate if they want multiple votes for power bloc advantage on issues they need to split their votes its a fine line though and splitting too many ways might actually cost them any delegate positions if the split was too equal and below the entry level reqs of the council realistically as long as this csm has the same number of votes cast as last time or preferably more then i cant see goons or any other single interest group managing more than 2 candidates from the nine but ultimately thats something the eve public need to get involved in preventing by simply getting out and voting if we ever got the situation where people were too lazy and cyncical to actually vote in volume and an organization like goonswarm did manage to foist six delegates of nine on the council then the blame would not fall on ccp or the csm organizers or even on the goons themselves the fault for this would fall entirely on the player base itself for not caring enough to prevent it
the goons are the biggest alliance in the game and part of the biggest alliance bloc in the game with virtually no nongoons running from that bloc and a coherent voting strategy with this they could have gotten the chair two members or possibly as many as three if they had split the vote with razorsharp precision and had known exactly how many they needed in order to get the 5 seats they would need for control they would have needed to have a minimum of 966 votes each or fully 2026 more votes than they actually got  if they knew in advance how many votes they needed and if they managed to split them perfectly with nobody forgetting to vote there is no conceivable way for one bloc to have the influence you describe also candidates run as individuals not as alliance members how do you decide who is the alliance rep  let the leader decide random chance get everybody else to jump into a oneman corp for a month or run under an alts name what do you do if someone joins an alliance during the middle of their term of office  do they have to resign no that way lies madness leave ingame politics for the game the csm isnt about that and we shouldnt create rules that make it be about that
on one hand i agree with you and being out of any huge alliance really made me question running anyways on the other california gets 55 congressmen because it is the biggest state with the highest population
null
i would leave the average 00 income as it is i think it is quite okay right now it is not the lack of rewards that prevent people from going to 00 on the other hand income distribution in 00 is not okay as there are far more isk to be made for the average player in npc 00 than in playercontrolled 00 that somehow contradicts the fact that holding playercontrolled 00 requires quite a lot of effort there should be something changed so that these areas get at least as lucrative as the npc counterparts operating an estabilished empire in 00 became too easy starting a new empire in 00 became awfully difficult barrier of entry into the 00 game should be severely lowered while the operation of uninhabtant but claimed regions of 00 should be more difficult for the alliancesalso with the new jump technology roaming gangs have pretty much lost their targets which is a very bad thing ganking some random noobs in belts who do not pay attention is not the same as the roaming gangs ability in the past to properly cripple logistics inside 00 so roaming gangs actually lost their tactical value in 00 interalliance warfare more simcity in space they should be able to transform the space they have claimed and are defending in the way they would like to transform it with waste amounts of investment they should be able to defend it better or increase the rewards available in the systems pardonwe definitely need some kind of role separation for the pos system sovenerity and industry should be decoupled by making sovenerity holding posses special and more limited in number than the currently possible number of posses in system would make 00 sov wars more fun and the battles being fought around these posses more decisive titans need to be changed doomsday needs to go it is ruining large parts of the game i think the role of the titan needs to be rethinked i would also like to see 00 logistics become more difficult because right now it is bloody easy with all the jump drive capable ships there is no risk transporting stuff between 00 and empire and even the average people have access to these secure methods of transportation by using jump bridges and jump clones i would like to see more people doing the classic style of convoys that involve player movement through regular gates i think ccp is on making it cooler anyways with walking in stations new graphics and stuff like that it would be cool to have options to decorate your space within the design guidelines of course noone wants another second life random unexpected events would also help a lot like random rogue drone attacks on space i am also missing interactive big scale interactive ingame storyline events organized by ccp for 00 like the serpentis stealing that gallentaen titan
something needs to be done with the discrepancy between highsec and 00 incomes unless you have a good system its pretty much easier just to mine in empire and not worry about bringing your stuff through gatecamps etc put more of a dependance on 00 in the game and maybe it will all balance out i am afraid i do not understand what you mean by this question please clairify or drop me an eve mail to discuss i do not see 00 as an endgame anyone and everyone can be productive out there from the 60mil sp super vet to the 6 day old newb in a cyno frigate there is a role for everybody once you get past that initial shock of getting killed life becomes much easier i think the ideal way to get more people into 00 is to educate most people who start in evemyself included think nullsec  instadeath which couldnt be further from the truth a better tutorial would do wonders augmented with missions that get the people out there and show them what it is like 00 is kind of a big deal already with the growth of the mega alliances we essentially have several new empires in eve a cool segue from the last question would be to allow alliances that grow to a certain size the ability to put their own npc agents in any place with an hq then lower level players could do little missions which help the alliance in question and reward the new players with money from the alliance coffer loyalty points and standing there are many kinks to work out but this would be a neat direction to take eve in again this question is sort of weird i think that role bridge ships are a good idea but only if the ship in question cannot outperform a ship specialized in a task it should be about utility and not win mode i really do not have experience with capitals so this is only opinion i think the amount of caps is getting pretty high nowheard somewhere that alliances have at least 10 each or something which is unimaginable to me i see no problem with weapons buildups so long as there are enough incentives to risk them being destroyed basically more epic battlesrainbows cupcakes seriously i do not know you tell me what your ideas are 00 is already my favorite place to go in the game and i think it pretty awesome the only thing that would make it cooler is more variety in systems or different resources to capture something to make combat happen more often and away from posgates
in what ways would you like to see 00 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvementplanet cracker class starshipshow do you see the ability to operate in 00 evolving to improve and keep up with the gameperhaps some sort of npc faction reavers if you will that attempt to distroy improperly defended systems just to give people something to do see city of heroes riktizombie invasions or wars live events as an examplewhat improvements would you like to see in 00 as an endgame things to reward players for having made ita welcome pack with fruit hats and a dvd the thing im told about 00 is getting there is the first step how do you know you have made it nah i think you should set your own goals and rewardshow would you raise the status of 00 in a productive way to enrich the gamewalk on pleasure hubs nuff saidare you in favor of any role separation or gapfilling with regard to the infrastructure of 00 in the way that the orca will fill a gap and most t2 ships occupy clearly defined rolespersonally i would like to see a deployable public station or as close as possible at any ratechanges to any capitals or subcaps in context of healthier 00titans should have an exposed exaust port that leads directly to the main reactor it should be about the size of a whomp ratany other comments in areas not covered by the questionswitch spacefinally im a breakdancer in the real world elements of style and expressions of soul are indispensable to anything i do and will greatly affect my selection of csm candidates how would you make 00 coolerability to overheat your engines maybe leading to self destruct causing damage in a wide area
keeping eve as a hardcore competitive game and ensuring that the way it is being played in becomes more fun these are my priorities i know i know it is very general but this is the best oneissue answer i could come up with it covers all the areas i would like to support roaming lowsec 00 sov fighting in order
the most important imperative for ccp and the csm is to make sure that all aspects of the game have a strong tie in to pvp activity in some way to make sure that the incentives for conflict are high and the penalties passivity in the face of competition high
my biggest priority would be putting my money where my mouth is and investigating what issues are biggest to eve my forum campaign has been low but i have spent much time in the past month flying around to speak with pilots all over the universe to get their perspective on the status of evei would make this a priority and only after gathering a good amount of datafrom the forums players etc would i be prepared to answer this question again the csm is about service to the denizens of the galaxy and i would really like to do just thattoo much of a cop out uhhh i would like to put a mwd on my freighter is that a good enough answer
well arrived back from fanfest and i hereby cast my first vote for ankhesentapemkah shes enthusiastic committed and extremely passionate about the game of eve online im heavily leaning towards pattern for my 2nd vote and the 3rd ones still up for grabs  get voting everyone
yeah i have been in game just telling people to take a minute and vote yeah i campaign but i would rather somebody not vote for me than have them not vote at all csm is a really unique aspect of eve we should all be proud to participate in
bit late but showing my agreement anyway

agreed
it probably has less pg compared to a mega so that it doesnt fit an armor tank which the mega does the rokh just has a shieldtank and those mods use less grid even if you only fit extenders plates extenders also use less grid from skills too
exactlyand i would support the introduction of an additional set of learning skills lets call them premium learning skills id say you should be able to train them with lvl4 of the respective advanced learning skill as it is now implemented for the advanced skills themselves requiring lvl4 of the base skill i do propose that even though i spent quite some time training my learning skills to lvl5 and would lose out on quite some days of training because of the added attribute points that you could put to use on the lvl5 when you have trained the premium skills to 4it still is a huge timesink though
money laundering is anything designed to hide where money comes from ill let you work out how this can be done by selling isk it doesnt matter if youre playing a game when you get involved in money laundering you will go to a very rl jail

like i said in another thread on this topic a paladinkronos web is even better than it was before when compared to t2 webs its gone from 2 normal webs to 251 normal webs ignoring the stacking nerf and its not like 90 webs are bad after all  they mostly stop pretty much anything especially when you put a pair onand really why else would you bring one of those ships into pvp even before the nerf a nano hac with a t2 web on it was slower than a battleship with an afterburner and if your preference is shooting npc frigates its still stupid easy so thats hardly a concern
how about make it only appear on scans both directional and probe and uncloack to refuel for like 5 minutes at varying intevals maximum four times minimum once a day at random that way some jerk cant just see it on scan and have some on come and probe it then next day or when convenient that day as for the problem with things being cloaked inside it simple give it like 750010000 m3 corp hangar have it have a 600000 ship maint bay and make it take like 75m worth of strontium clathrates per day ships that warped to it could use their cloaks in its special like say 12km bubble so they could maintain covertness if they werent idiotsalso i like these namesdark blood covert fleet support substructureinstead of superstructure because its relatively smallofcourse you would also have the different pirate names there and maybe you would only be able to get them through faction rat drops or loyalty points for 00 npcs
im loving the concept but not the details no ships should be cloaked while using it only the base itself giving a group of ships an autocloaked safespot is too muchthe fueling requirement should not be materially based what about giving the black ops and the blockade runner new roles that enable them to interface their capacitors to the bases and reload them the bases should be capable of allowing a ship to refit as long as the base is exposed during the ships refitting no defensesno reinforcement period if it gets found it diesthe technology that allows that thing to sit there cloaked should be expensive
i think he means that you should gain standing for killing players that have a low security status this would be an incentive to attack low security status players and increase the amount of pvp and division between people of various sec statusits a fairly commonly proposed idea but it probably wont fix the problem that it intends to fixthat its hard for player to aggressively defend space against pirates without becoming a target themselvespattern is a good choice but he is more for implementing environmentswhich would be more variation in the space we fight in
actually from what i understand of arithrons proposal hes proposing that there be space where being at a high sec status is bad and where being at a low sec status is good im not sure of the specifics but think of something like piratefaction gate guns that shoot at anyone with positive sec status
that doesnt make sense unless you start restricting docking rights based on sec status
i support the ops issue it is clearly a critical concern that should be looked into by ccp immediatelyor put another way consider posting in a more appropriate place next time
as detailed in this thread hereto sum upthis thread details a needed change in pos layout accessibility modularity ease of use ease of access ease of change etcusing the changes proposed in that thread pos owners would be able to customize exactly what they want in their pos without having to deal with the hassle of the layout with structures lying around everywhere inside the shieldthis is something a pretty big portion of the readersresponders of the thread have wanted for over 2 years its only got 2 dev responses in that time and the general consensus is yarr that sounds cool well consider it but dont expect anythingwith csm bringing this into the spotlight these changes could be fasttracked into development to the benefit of all
the thread you link was raised as an assembly hall issue back in may or june and its already been brought to ccp and discussed see the very last post of the sticky on the last csm resultswhile i doubt you like their decision reraising the issue wont change it
ackthanks for the reply i didnt read that
got my vote once more expect you to chase ccp with a big stick to finally add the dratted skill queue and improve fw

much as i love me some data mining im not going to look up 40 different corporations for standings visavis goonswarm im not a great follower of 00 politics but id say very few will be actively red since about the only people who have goons set to red that i know of are the gbc folks and i dont see any of them youve got maybe 10 who are blueincluding the 7 goons themselves and 30 who either avoid them or just dont care

youre worried about hidden agendas if someone had something to say in the war thats been the primary concern of tens of thousands of players for multiple years now youd think they might have an entry or two on their killboard but instead of looking at the available evidence and thinking youre going to ask for empty words from people running for office and thats even before you consider offalliance alts  what do you say to someone with a character in goon a character in bob and a character in a caldari militia corp the only people who would be willing to express a heartfelt antigoon bias will be goons themselves and thats just because theyd find it funny whatever this is pointless im not going to feed your paranoia any further

1 i would like to make 00 production more dense currently space cannot support very many players while this seems like it would give alliances a reason to expand it really just reduces conflict as player density and contact with enemies is reduced this means moving missions to player built stations and adding other methods of dense production this will naturally draw later alliances closer together opening space for conquest2 i see it getting harder to actually do stuff but easier to maintain the system when youre not being attacked ideally you want to make attacking things very profitable and reduce the burden to maintain space to offset the increased risk3 there need be no reward but the space you have taken if you think there needs to be i would ask you what is best in life4 make the space valuable and people will fight over it this game always needs more things to fight over5 this question is not complete enough to anwer though in general infrastructure needs a trimming in terms of durability and reduction in upkeep6 doomsdays become a single target attack that does an immense amount of damage possible capital remote repair units only work while in triage mode this reduces the effect that titans have of removing an entire class of ships from the fight while the second chain removes the ridiculousness of invulnerable carrier blobsbonus question jazzhands
ahh at least they havent completely lost their senses at ccp glad to see crap like this issue shot down by the man
signed but with this terrible patch i wouldnt get to see it still a great idea
i am start a formal petition to eliminate the missile nerf that has been put into effect with the release of the queantum rise expansion according to these new changes missiles of all sizes are relatively ineffective against ships every class size that the missiles are designed to target can move faster than the missiles explosion velocity therefore the only way to get your base damage back is to target something bigger than your missiles were made to shoot even then the speed of the vehicle is still faster than your missile explosion velocity and decreases the damage so i ask you to sign your name and or comments to this petition to return missiles to thier old already weak state or to at least change the specs to make missile use viable againupdate this thread is for those of us who think that the changes to missiles are unfair and hurt our game play compared to the other races this is not a thread to argue or curse at eachother i wrote this thread because i think that cruise missile should hit a battleship for full damage not because i think a cruise missile should hit a frigate for double missiles were underpowered for pvp compared to all other races thats why in previous patches they increased the torpedo launcher rate of fire while making its range shorter they made that change to give caldari a fair fight why would they now make missiles ineffective in anything but shooting a stationary target i agree that they had a good idea but there numbers are too extreme youre not going to get better damage against a larger target than the ship you fly youre going to get your old damage back but against a ship the same class as yours you will be underpowered consider hacs for a second a cerberus with hams had about 23s the dps of a ishtar and half the tank now you wont even stand a chanceplease make sure that if you support this topic that you select it from the menu under the text area of your reply located above where you click to post your replyarikanaiz
signedfor my experience mission runners are fed lol they will make about 80 less isk per hour well done ccp you definatly killed that isk farmers
my raven is useless respecing to amarr
missile issue is a very negative change please reverse
yeah i dont get why they keep nerfing caldari too bad we all trained so long to have usable missile skills only to have ccp take away the whole reason we trained missiles to begin with not once but twice now signed
signednot that they will listen best way to make them listen is for people that are fed up with all this nerfing to just quit eve until they correct the mistakes
no other weapon system is limited to doing its full damage to ships in a higher class i understand limiting the ability to do full damage to a lower class but heavy missiles including t2 should do full damage to cruisers just like cruiser sized beams rails and arty cruise missiles including t2 should do full damage to bs just like bs sized beams rails and arty and so onin other wordssignedpatri
signedomg i have 10954849 skill points in missle launchers alone and now its all for nothing i cant even play anymore i only have 1 million sp in gunnery this is horrible
im not running missions at all with missiles but im signing because my sacrilege got nerfed
i am opposed to the missile nerf and the dang speed nerf on the battle ship cnr
ccp went to far with this one
ive ran a few lvl 4 missions and not really noticed a difference in missions with missiles i guess its when you get down to pvp that i guess you may really notice it and if your in a frigate you dont want to die easily i guess they are lvling the game out a lil im not saying this is a bad thing
no impact to running missions in a nhdrake on l4s how are the cnrravens performing if you add painters andor flare rigs
now now if we give them a few years they will probably realize that speed tanking shouldnt mean going faster than 52ms
signedunless 1 mid to all missile boats for purposes of a painter
just signing because a hyperion was speed tanking my raven that was a bit ridiculous
signedthank you ccp for making my raven need 2 webbers and 2 painters to hit for full with rage torps against bs
signedaccount cancelled 1 month until i leave and never look back
missiles are just fine iUFFFDll change my skill plans to amarr then i do not have to whine about missiles
ladies and gentlemen this new change to missiles allows any ship at any time to speed tank any missile boat at any time webbers lower the effective tank that out ships can have thus unbalancing the pvp aspect of any missile player further when a hyperion with a massive tank already throws on an afterburner all the faction fittings in the universe wont help a raven even a hyperion with no speed mods cant be beaten by a fully factionofficer fit raven due to the simple fact that even at its base speed they hyperson is faster than the explosion velocity of even a heavy assult missile a ham has an explosion velocity of 101ms now and even the basest of battleships has a faster base speed than 101ms if a ham cant hit a battleship for full damage what the point in all my skillpoints in missiles skills what the point in the countless wasted hours of training missile skills
signed also how does ccp even justify the logic in a cruise missile having an explosion velocity of 69msi was about to blow up a sin on sisi when he realised he was being owned so he started to run away from me it was bloody annoying to see my explosive torps go from doing 780 damage per missile to 130 damage cos he had an afterburner fit ffs
signed these missile changes suck really bad i trained those skills for nothing
signedwe have tested missiles now and they are totally worthless bs can speed tank part of torpedeos damage only by moving without mwd ot ab missiles are totally busted now im really hapy i have cross trained gallente and minnie ships and gunnerymissiles werent that good before why did they had to totally broke themps caldari militia will have some problems ahead
like any good socialist country where the morally superieur elite plays to the whining weak to get their vote ccp has decided to cash in the amarr minmatar and gallente vote by nerfing missile skillsagain maybe all caldari ship players should start petition ccp to get their money back for all those months spent on missile skill training since that has now been a waste of time and your moneythe upside is that ravens will go over the counter for like 20mil in 1 month signed
signed a 1000x along with the changes to the speed faction mods and everything else you did in this patch you can take it back and give us a game we like again how many accounts are being canceled thats all i want to knowoh yeah i forgot to mention during the livedev blog that the zulu stated that our opinion doesnt matter to the developers besides being priceless jackassery that made me feel special i doubt anything will change the declining state of eve
you mean they work exactly like all the other types of guns mind blown it is my opinion that this is exactly how missles should work but everyone is just used to them being broken
signed there should be no such thing as explosion velocity for missiles isnt the signature radius enough that alone should prevent usif done correctly from wrecking smaller vessels while allowing us to keep the dps up against ships of our own sizeas for the previous posters argument that missiles work the same way as turrets no not really the thing screwing over turrets is tracking and that becomes less of an issue with increased range and ships at close range will almost undoubtedly fit webs instead which btw you cant do with cruise and long range missiles so the tracking issue isnt as big for them as the explosion velocity thing is for usalso let us not forget that missiles also have the minor issue of not being able to hit an opponent whatsoever if that oponent is heading away from the missile at a velocity greater than the missile itself i dont know to what extent the speed nerf might have effected this but considering base velocity for a missile is about 35kms i dont think its difficult for a well fit ship to zoom away from one or at least move fast enough to get out of range of the missile before it hits them
signedfix this problem
only after they fix webs and make damn scramblers nonmandatory modules and less overpowered then now instant full stop is silly and even sillier after agility changes since now you deaccelerate much fastermissile nerf is just as balanced as the 400 tracking nerf in webrange and the inferiority of even dual webs compared to scramblers for holding people downreap what you sow
did you not notice that webs have been nerfed as well did you not notice that the battleships that need to get into web range have had their speed nerfed sorry but believe it or not its not only missile ships that have been nerfed get used to the changes
webs have been nerfed by 400 at that
helpful eve tip races other than caldari can and consistently do use missiles
no they dont work like all types of guns the damage penalty they suffer from a moving target is great than that of a hybrid turret and thier rof is no where near the same if you remember a raven couldnt rival the dps of a megathrone moving target or not now if the target is moving we can have up to a 50 drop in dps is that still balanced and fair
but your guaranteed to hit every time
what use is that always hit mechanic if a t1 torpedo only deals 40 damage to an unfitted phoon
fix itya i can hit everytime but i cant kill  all thanks ccp  really balanced
signed
signed my torp raven and widow got corn holed thanks ccp with max missile skills and rigs my regular torpedos only go about 22 to 25 km javs still hit 71 i want my 5months worth of ravenwidowtorp training back ccp
signed what mik said
signed
this is not the problem in fact consider yourself lucky a short range weapon travels that farthe problem is due to the fact that missiles do 10 damage to classes larger than the missile and instead damage me when i aim at smaller vessels
signedgotta laugh at the idiots at ccp who say that missiles in 26000ad underperform missiles right now in real life i think someone in the development section screwed up their math and left out 2 zeros somewhere along the line and were too ashamed to admit the mistake so they said oh yeah thatthats what its supposed to be
oh noez now a raven earns the same amount of isk as all the other ships while spamming missions oh please ccp fix this now i am crying real life tears now that missiles work like every other weapon in the entire game i know i cried and whined for the nano nerf but i changed my mind i swear please fix my cnr my children are running out of food due to my lost isk sales
i find this quite hilarious many of the people who are against the missile fix are the very same people that cried nerf speed and were very smug when they knew they had got their way now the tables have turned and now you also have to adapt like everyone else whats good for the goose is good for the ganderive been in eve for over 5 years now i know and expect i have to adapt from time to time you are not going to get this changed so just get over it
stfu you ignorant fool my former corpmate used to solo the blockade in his tempest i think in 40 minutes with my 7 mil sps in missiles i could hardly break an hour now im not even going to bother trying because i know itll take twice as long
if you arent gonna sign the petition then stfu we couldnt care less about what you think
so heres a novel thought quit spamming missions like an isk farmer go to low sec and play the damn game you kids were sooo happy when you thought this nerf meant drakes online and now the streets are running high with a river of carebear tears heres another thought fit light drones buy a tissue dry tears problem solvedand hold on it took you 1020 minutes longer oh noez this is an out rage you should petition to get your life back
signed
i wonder if you even decided to look at the missile specs now wrath cruise missile  explosion velocity  69mswowa car can go faster than that get a brain before you decide to spew your crap here and its not up to you to dictate where we play or how we run missions
im not even going to justify this garbage with a respondamn
its not a physics arguement this was done to keep missiles from overpowering the game ccp wont roll it back go play wow please i hear the pve is wonderful
yes i was angry when i posted the above and forgot to factor in the speed mitigation and no i have a reason to be a bit irritated with the shorter range 36km before no rigs in widowraven 20km post with the ability to speed tank the dpsto the carebear comment sorry  but i am more ed my training for a torpcruise support widow is gone that covered the last 5 months 58 mil down the drain for that skill book
might wanna check how many people here think you know what youre talking about its easy to tell someone is stupid when they pull out the go have a cry get a tissue go play wowlack of valid arguments ftwand btw youre just trying to shove this nerf in the face of people who use missiles for pvp and pve cos you love your turrets thats great but keep it to yourself
signedability of speedtank the equal size missiles in the bsclass is a bit funny specially in the speednerf patch 
signed
i have just finished cm lvl5  p yay gues i will never use em p
dude you know that 69ms is 250kmh right
for all of you who think that missiles are now balanced and inline with the other types of weapons consider this before the patch a torp fitted raven with full missile skills and drones with full skills still couldnt match the dps of a megathron now with this new patch the torpedo damage is yet further reduced if the target is moving a megathron could solo kill a raven just about any day of the weak now a mega can possibly take on 2 or 3 ravens you say our weapons are now balanced and inline with the other races i tell you if you look at the math and actually take a second youll see that all missiles are now ineffective against thier given targets as far as use webs well that kinda kills out tank since caldari missile boats are shield tankers and need midslots to be able to do so so now we have a ship with reduced damage and reduced tank so there goes fleet opperations for caldari now to bring up the faction warfare issue i think ccp is telling us that the gallente are going to win the war considering that the gallente race has ships specifically made to use microwarp drives kinda kills any chance the caldari have picture a gallente ship with a microwarp drive outside of scram range spamming you with railgun fire while another with a tank afterburner and scram hold you down so you cant go anywhere well you cant kill either of them now can you
signedspeed rebalancing  now everyone can speedtank 50 missile damage not only few nanogots can tank 100 like before wtf longrange missile dps was already far from stellar and delayed now its nerfed even further against any ship of same classmissiles dont even have modules similar to tracking computerenhancer and even more missileboat tank is supposed to be sacrificed now to fit a target painter
snip  mitnalwhy do think missiles even exist in todays world  to overpower the enemy thats exactly what missiles arewere designed for  shear destruction of any type of target from range i mean i know this is a game but it is designed around real life dynamicsthe futurecommunity prosperity  millitary  the list goes on lets put some real life perspective on this as seen the makers want eve to seem so realare you telling me for example an apaches helfire missile should barley damage an enemies ty run down truck just because hes going 50 mph and because the enemies ak47 cant do much damage to the chopper becuase of its range  missiles are meant to over power guns also would todays millitary forces nerf there missiles because they own tha fck out of the enemies forces  hell no again  missile are designed for thatat the end of the day real life and game life you have choices  either be a terrorist with a ty ak47 and get owned by millitary missiles or be gallente with your rails blasters or projectiles and again get owned by the caldari might of missile massacrewe all hadhave the choice at the start of the game to be  gallentegunboatdrones or caldarimissilespwnage err whats the 3rd  can think of anything else that caldari havehad going for them lol  etc etcthe problem is weve all had that choice taken away from us in eve now the missiles testers have all come back with disasterous results which is truely bad not just for the missile users but the whole caldari race aswell and all those months of training missiles skills to the max just for them to be made worse than guns which will take alot of members far to long to rectify by training gunnery skillswhat a fn farce this is expansion my ass more like demotion of the caldari racesigned by the way 
if you cant refrain from using vulgar language in this thread then i guess you voice your own ignorance if you feel you must curse at those of us who use missiles and are trying to voice a change for ourselves then by all means continue however when they decide to make your rof slower or make your tracking speeds slower dont complain to us about it because it will fall on deaf ears you think were just a bunch of carebears who whine fine think what you will but i feel truely and honestly cheated that now my pvp experience is tarnished by any ship that can travel at 100ms or faster how would you like to have you damage halved against everyship from cruise up unless youre using light weapons i wonder how strong your battships would be with small nuetron blaster iis or small beam laser iis i dont think youd stand much of a chance at pvp either now would you
tbh the missles were as out of line as nano ships so ccp fixed both there is no way that a long range bs weapon should be able to hit a cruiser at under 1km from you its completely out of line and no other long range bs weapon can hit a orbiting cruiser sized ship that close bears got nano killed and missles inlined that just the way ccp works
jesus tap dancing christ is reading comprehension really this bad on these forums do you even know why people are complaining at all the least you can do is read the damn thread before opening your mouth and spouting a bunch of inaccurate assumptions
ok now theve killed caldari missile monstrosities its time to make smart bombs caldari onlyput them under the missile skill tree pimp the dmg power extend the range of the bombs and allow them in empire then i might forgive ccp for this
if anyone would even look at the numbers a light missile designed to shoot frigates has an explsion velocity of 170ms the only things that cant out run that going its base speed are battleships industrials and mining barges woot woot now theres some pvp fun
i cant say anything its just wrong to lower the damage capabilities of a weapon in this wayturret weapons arent effective on short range if u use long range weapons or in short range if u use short range weapons but they all can do allways max damage under the correct configurationlets describe the correct configuration for doing max damage on missiles your missile explosion velocity has to be higher than target velocity after nerf its like if every ships is flying ten times faster than it was before so a crap bs flying 130 ms is like a 1300 ms bs the speed comparison between any missile explosion velocity and their same size ships objective is totally a joke on normal combat they have like a 40 speed of the ship and in most cases in pvp its down to 10 even a npcrat can speed tank u the drawbacks from missiles keep the same fly time to deal damage posible destruction by smartbombsdefenders u can keep outrunning they missile weapons  shield tanking is a total pain so being missile ship focused has a huge lack of posibilities in fittingits totally out of range u have lowered speed for all people but u have destroyed the way of playing using missilessigned
adapt empire n00bs
actually a cruise raven had a greater dps than a rail mega and the raven does not need to change ammo every 1520km nor does it miss virtually 100 under 30km or so

i like the new missiles no more escaping their effects simply by going fast meaning that the range advantage of longrange ships becomes meaningful meanwhile closerange missiles are pretty much unaffectedthe old situation was far too binary with missiles doing either full or no damage it was stupid the new formula is much more sophisticated cruise could do with another look however
lol if people think devs cant make bigger stupid nerfs than they making a new patch full them dwhat a noob of balancing team even a stupid half bake chicken would make better changes
lol regardless of how sophisticated the math is the outcome is still the same and no more escaping their effects simply by going fast every ship in the game can now speed tank missiles depending on thier size some without even using mods and missiles didnt either hit for full or no damage damages were reduced by sig radius and explosion they just booted the ratio for some reason rage rocket assault missiles and torpedoes and fury light heavy and cruise missiles will do less damage to their own ship class but will do more damage to a larger ship class they will also have a 10 range reduction  so if i fit a rage torpedo and engage a battleship because im in a battleship itll do less damage the folks at ccp didnt think this through and didnt listen to anyone that told em itd be a bad idea they simply said hey this sounds complicated lets do this itll be great theyll all be glad were here to come up with such complicated and shopisticated ideasthe simplest answers are usually the correct onesput it back to normal and leave em alone they sucked before dont make em suck worse
dude did you know that every ship in the games speed is in meterssecond not kmh
do you know how the metric system works kmh is the same as ms
oh dearif a ship larger than a frigate or certain hacs is fitting a ab the chances are that your damage output to it is quite inconsequential because said ship is lol fit also an abing ship is trivial to web and if you dont have your target tackled and webbed why are you shooting at it damage mitigation via abs looks nice on paper but doesnt actually work very well in practicerage hams and torps still require the target to be tackled but now do more damage thats a boost in my book as is the massively increased damage of any missile to any fast mwding target
binary at least there was a way to use missiles  100cruise raven for pvp deadstealth bomber deadwidow it was pre nerfed before now its even worstusing caldari ship for pvp with missiles todaytorp ravengolem only if your fleet is rdy to support yougood dmg vs any bs without ab bs with ab or any other ship can speed tank ur torpscerberus you can deal dmg to every ship but you cant break any tank alone and also you dont have tackler capability but if your mates are smart you can see your name into the killmail
hyperion a massive tank srsly hype got one of the worst tanks due its 6 lowslots not to mention active armor tanking in general sucks srsly missiles are fine now and ships like the golem arent straight overpowered anymore look man shield boats got best tanks available i demand crystals for armor reps so they should live with dealing less dmg than armor tanking boats and yes u need to sacrifice a mid and sacrifice tank in order to do more dmg armor tankers had to do that for aaaages get used to it
are we not getting something here where is the massively increased damage of any missile to any fast mwding target the faster the target the less damage the missile does also an abing ship is trivial to web so now those of us who shield tank instead of armor tank must sacrafice a mid slot to equip a web even though the web has had the its effectiveness reduced from 90 on a t2 to 60 on a t2 which even on cruisers 1 t2 webifier still leaves the ship traveling over its base speed which inturn lowers damage done by missiles so that negates the purpose of the webpeople may argue that turrets dont always hit yes thats true people will argue that missiles always hit no matter the range yes thats true too but whats a turrets rate of fire whats a launchers a large t2 nuetron blasters rate of fire 788 seconds the rate of fire on a standard light missile launcher t2 is 1200 so a missile made to hit frigates and destroyers which any noob starts out with has over a 4 second delay in rof than a turret designed for engagin battleships now if that battleship is flying away from it the missile does less damageturrets have negative effects for speed as well arik only if that target is orbiting and even then you have mods to increase tracking speed oh and our explosion velocity vs ship velocity penalty it doesnt matter which direction thier going as long as thier going turrets can strike for perfect damage if a target is flying straight towards them ive seen people 1 volley an interceptor going over 9kms a megathron with railguns taking out a ship going 9kms with one volley now my missiles wouldnt even do 02 damagethank you ccp
there was also a very easy way for people to avoid missiles 100cruise has problems i agreetorp raven is unchanged it always needed support so nothing has changed here in fact its a stealth boost because some of its competitors  blaster and acboats  are being nerfed by the greater difficulty in getting to optimalham drake has been boosted it still gets full damage against a webbed bc target with rage ham drakes always fit webs and rage damage has been boosted loss of jav range is inconsequential and again some of its competitors have been nerfed by their greater difficulty in getting to optimalcerberus has been massively boosted it isnt a solo ship so the only ships that youll be firing at alone are things like falcons which dont tank now its range tank is far stronger and it can defend that range because anything capable of closing on it will be 500 painting itself apart from interceptors but you can still damage them with hms where they were previously immune and the aml cerb is death to all interceptorsbtw stop mention lolafterburner fits abs are not sensible on anything other than frigates certain hacs and logistics and even when you do need a web you do not need to fit a web your gang does but it did anyway to stop targets simply mwding off and laughing at your cluelessness
rage torps damage got boosted from 540 to 576 thats only an increase of about 667 do you think that boost is in scale with giving rage torps over 15 more explosion radiuspoint is whatever standard rage torp boat fitting you have you will do less damage now because of the decreased damage per sig radius ratio of rage torps  not to mention this is disregarding the ridiculousness of targets being able to speedtank torps with only an abso now you need your bssized target double webbed and double painted  the only way to do full damage with rage torps now to bs targetsyes this isnt a solo game but look at it now a megathron up against other battleship targets doesnt need as muchmany supportsupport modules to hit for full damage with t2 close range ammo than a raven with t2 rage torps does
not signed everyone brought this on there selves with moaning about nanos but then the nanos moaned about the misiles uber dps and ability to hit them and that got nerfed gallenete moaned that we couldnt get in range we got a speed buff for us all so whats this tell u dnt whine about stuff that means nerfing it will just nerf everyone
lets do the same to turrets that u have done to missilesif u try to hit a ship that is smaller than the ammunition that its supposed to be required to kill it u should reduce the damage in the same way than missiles are suffering nowusing a large turret vs a ceptor should mean doing 25400  116 of damageusing a medium turret vs a ceptor should mean 25125  15 of damageusing a small turret vs a ceptor 2540  58 of damagelets see what happends thenthis is totally ridiculous to think that this nerf means balance this means de destruction of missiles
what you forget is that sig radius and exp velocity are multiplied together to get a factor to apply to your damage here is an example for you my vagabond takes more damage mwding in orbit what you used to do to reduceeliminate damage than it does just flying at base speed even though going 3kms it is a lot faster than the exp velocity its signature radius is so greatly increased that it takes more damagealso bring a friend in a vigil or bellicose or their t2 variants there is a nice 40km range dual web dual painter for you or maybe an interceptor with a point and painter or an ab with web and painter that can sigtracking tank while you put point on small gang turret bs are going to need tacklers too now why should you be any different as for torps not outdamaging a megathron you are wrong they could on a raven with equivalent implants and skills do more damage at 6x the optimal range so dont know what you are complaining about you should compare with lasers with scorch ammo loaded in for your dps bracket not blasters with high damage ammo
have you not noticed all the complaints about gallente blaster boats in web range now that webs are nerfed the damage reduction against a smaller vessel with a savvy target is 100 from main weapons i ignore drones as both missile and turret bs can field themi can tracking tank a deimos in web range with an interceptor he cannot kill me period against a cerberus or even a caracal i would likely have to disengageedit and blasters are the best tracking guns so whatever problems they have are amplified inside webrange for the others you trade off potentially reduced damage at all ranges with missiles for potentially full damage at all ranges
instead of just complaining i offer a fix to ccp increase launcher rof 30 and decrease the size of the missiles to allow launchers to carry more ammocurrently torpedo launchers carry around 18 rounds while blasters carry 120 about 7 times as many roundswith the current changes to missiles in regards to velocity penalties with missiles increasing the rate of fire and ammo capacity will balance the pvp aspect for missile based characters considering pvp makes up the core of player interaction within eve yes everything eventually goes back to player versus player dont argue that point
ur nowlegde on hybirds failthe blasters llready miss 910 times on smaller oponents due to tracking failness on the turrets even with ship bonus it isnt enough but we dint whine about it as much and ask for them to nerf everyone else so we can win
saying you brought this on yourselves sounds more like an argument of spite rather than logicdid you ever think that this missile nerf to bring it in line with the nano nerf went just a tad overboard
this is because misiles have range and allways it unless the target is moving fast yet blasters miss 910 times and have very very reduced range compared to missiles
i do on some level yes but wasnt the nano nerf allso tad overboard as the nanoers said 
signedon a nighthawkexplo rad  80100mexplo velocity 1000  136msare cccp gone madand 1 more thingwe talking about explosion from 2000msunder that  just fast burning  irl physics 
lets ask ccp what is the formula
somewhat signedim ready to adapt to the current changes but cruise missiles are definitely screwed i found it weird while missioning in a battleship that npc cruise missiles were dealing less damage than npc heavy missiles by a significant amount even though they were of the same damage type makes no sense for pve and neither does it in pvp
looks like some isk farmers got unhappy and forgot to adapt
agreedand the wiered fact is caladari are trying to blame it on gallente saying there overpowered by missing nearly all targets with fail tracking and they have loads of charges in there ammou 
dps was balanced over the years anywaythat is not the case on this moment all the other types of turrets have higher dpsin most alliances they advise everyone not to use ravens for fleet combat anyway with this change its even less worthwhile
this only works if the speed nerf is removed if the speed nerf is implemented and the missiles left the same all that will happen is you will have 15 drakes on a gate and missiles would become the new nano while both nerfs were over the top the reducing of the ludicrous speeds was needed and with the over insane speed nerf missiles needed to be nerfed
this patch cough i mean expansion is farcical heres what ive seen up to now just testing my hawk on a ty high sec drone exploration plexprenurf with out the mathshawk  top speed wo gistii b type ab  325 ms with ab 525 ms4 light launchers with cal navy blood claw light missiles kills all drone types with 1 or 2 volleys stationary or moving postnerf hawk  top speed wo gistii b ab  325 ms  with ab 774 ms nice speed nerf p when stationary it took me about 5  8 volleys to kill the same type of ty drone when moving some of the drones took 3 volleys and other drones still took up to 8 volleys even with speed tanking or we its called lolso the nerf has actually increased my ab speed by roughly an extra 50 on top of what it was before the patch and also easy 1310 drone plexs in my hawk are now as difficult as a prepatch raven in a lvl 4 missionive also noticed the hawk has the same paint job as the harpy now  what ive also noticed maybe im wrong is that im sure the hawk had shield resist bonuses before the patch and now its says my hawk has shield boost bonus on the discrip page am i wrong also my minnie alts probe frig ship had a top speed of 375 ms and now its over 400 ms
you caldari guys always cry for somethingyou want the speed nerf and now starting cry when come outcan i have your stuffs  d
yes but which would hit more often therefor doing more dmg in a 1v1 if raven has set his range right u could take mega o half armor maybe before mega got there and then you could just keep on missile spam whille ur shield is pretty much safe
what with tracking and all that for every other weapon type im fine with the missile nerf not too terribly ok with the nano nerf but ill adapt and overcome
agreed iv adapted by flying amarr i suggest caldari adapt the same u guys arnt the only ones affected everyone is so adapt or leave
changes have been made to all variations of afterburners a standard tech i afterburner will now have a speed boost of 1125 while a meta 14 variant will have a 162 speed boost adjustments have been made to the cap requirement for meta 11 and above there are clear advantages and drawbacks to the two types of modules within the same meta level some afterburners will have a smaller cap and power grid need while others will have more speed bonus and less cpu need and this is a missile nerf topic
signedworst change everhow many times have ccp changed missiles now
id say the blasterboats took a harder blowweb got nerfedmwd stats make the vindicator bonus uselessand guns got nerfed a bit
fineexplo radius 125215  72 explo velocity  75080ms  90 is it good
i agree but you no at least we dont blame other races for it and at least we can adapt to it 
ok you show me fraps of a mega missing 910 against a battleship and ill resign from eve completely show me a raven that can 1v1 against a megathron and win web or not damage is still reduced from a raven while the mega can use 5 ogre iis and 7 blasters last i checked raven only had 6 torpsand as far as this whole speed nerf what did they really do to your speed made it so afterburners are faster made it so mwds are stoppable and just so you guys get the picture the only real way to stop an ecm boat was with fof missiles now all that ecm ship has to do is fit an afterburner and its about invincible p you want us to adapt be prepared to see alot more ecm wait then youll complain about caldari being better than you
whatever you do it will not work ccp dont change changes so just drop iti actually like the idea of the change although we need some expl vel mods and it is a little or a lot overkilled and the dmg need increasement to compensate
ive noticed the only ones who really seem to be say we should stop complaining arent caldari eliminator2 i wonder what yendaj would say seeing as how she primarily flies caldari ships im sure shell give you an ear full
ever flown a turret ship
raven is a much better gang boat doing the same dps at much longer range therefore it is not unreasonable to expect mega to be better solo boatfof didnt work didnt have enough range to take down a jamming boat and they would always go after a closer target anyway
yes stalina this isnt my only character i have a gallente one as well she is alot younger than this one but now could easily whoop me in a bs vs bs fightturrets dont miss 910 tracking doesnt effect damage against another battleship even if the thing is using an ab they have more turrets and a higher rof my raven even with a web still cant beat herand for those who say armor tanking is weak ever tried to make a cap stable active tank for shields i can do it for armor but i cant make it work with the same effectiveness for shields hmm wait a majority of the engineering mods are mid slots ohh shield tanking takes midslots my hyperion massive tank 6 lows or not 75 armor boost amount per lvl makes for a nice tank like everyones been saying why dont you adapt
what is going to happendwell all missile bs gonna be dropped to unwanted stuff not usable in pve and nothing to say about pvp so just scrappvp gonna be restricted to turret weapons even more that its allreadythe only worth ship with missiles will keep on nighthawk but its price is a problem for pvp so any 1 trying to do missions with missiles will switch to ittime will show what i am saying herehave fun
i am truly worried about a lot of you please adapt your ship fittingstarget painters are your new best friend stop firing at frigates with missiles that are too oversized if you want to kill frigates in a cerberusnighthawk then fit assault launchers it just isnt rocket science lol get it if for some reason your innate ability to troll yourself rotten is only derived upon the forums maybe you could have friends in gameconsider forming a balanced gang able to take on a number of targets maybe i am just speculating however medium and large turrets now also are totally ineffective against a ship they were not designed to hit too its not just a missile nerf lols
sorry was playing a diff gamemaybe not 910 but it was a estemate and i was taking range into perspective allso plus ogre t2 can be deatroyed by a ravens t2 drones which then gives raven a uper handedand a properly at ranged raven can beat a mega at 1v1 as on sisi i have been beaten by a raven ask my older corp mates as it was one of themand yes a mega has more high points but a raven doesnt miss any shot at range or not the mega does loose dps and may mis at diffrent range over 5kmand as for speed they reduced our align time our top speed our quickness to top speed which wa sboosted because we gave facts not omg these guys are better than us boost me which infact all thoughs points make it harder for the mega to get in range and towards things and we have to thin k now do i fit a mwd and have it stopped in a battle or have a ab which is even worse and web doesnt help us at alland the ecm ships are caldaris frav pvp ship so u just gave a good point and fit for a falconscorp and ecm r really really hard to stop since 910 that was a estimate for u omg hes sayin its exact 910 pple they perma jam uand we carnt see any more ecm that we do now because they are really good ships even eccm dont stop it but that will just bring more and more ships to kill you all so there u go can i haves ur stuff now
i do believe they need a boost in dps but to try and bring gallenete down with u guys saying were better in every way just enoys me and yendja can say wat shehe likes i dont really care its my point of view im stayin buy it and no1 will change it
maybe ur raven is wrong then because my mate who hadstill does have a caldari char actually made a raven cap stable that can kill megas and im sure he cn make one with the changes and once i gain im sayin 910 as a in estamite u morons 
signed 1000i the beginner and i cannot do now anything to receive money
maybe you caldari players should just stop ing to quote
my precious missions
thank you a caldari pilot with brains hard to come by these days it seems or maybe they just have adapted to this change and dnt really care
definitely the brains part
the only real plus of cruise missile was agaisnt smaller target now they are useless big nerf
youre right im just gonna bring my scorpion out and have your mega for ransom name calling isnt nice btw
in 00 missionsand this subject not for discussion and for reference maintenanceand i was not rude to you
the 249km range on them say on a raven without sacrificing all of your midslows is certainly not a plus of the weapon thenyou have in the cruise missileraven a real niche weapon platform that can ewartank as well as snipe in a gang just because you can no longer mercy kill a frigate from x km away it is not a nerf battleship beamsrailsartillery simply are not wroth firing at anything smaller than a cruiser and even then they need to be afk this of course without the help of a hyenahuginnrapierbellicose painting oneit just amuses me that because people are now given the beautiful chance to reinvent tactics and ships within eve the first thing most do is reach for the pitchforks
my precious rattingand how nice of you to tell me im not allowed to post my opinion stop ingedit its refreshing to see carebears ing about being unable to do lvl 4s in less than 30 minutes oedit2 omg i might even like this patch edited unnecessary comment about patch away
i will be willing to purchase everyones ravens for 5mil isk a piece as they are useless i will be selling scorpions with a full set of cruise luanchers ecm and an ab for 130mil a piece delievered anywhere within empire space 05 or higher thank you
i the fighter instead of the getterand so will be alwaysand again  if i the beginner it is not necessary to me to be rude
then we both get ganked by rest of people that want a go lolbtw nice thinking thats what is called adapting using the stuff that is usfull instead of finding stuff that isnt and moaning about it the moaning about it part isnt aimed at you btw
hey man just gimme a rof bonus but i still say in general missile boats are screwed im still gonna ransom your ship though p
all means do  and i agree and have allways through this that missiles have gotten a bit screwed from this it just ed me of that caldari are blaming gallenete for this d
its not that im blaming gallente for anything i have a gallente character just stating for fw purposes and the fact that amarr and minimatar have been screwed over since the game started pto all caldari ecm ftw btw 2mil isk to any caldari pilot that can bring me eliminator2s frozen corpse btw im in the middile of goonswarm space univited becareful getting to me p
true but the issue is the fact that a cruise missile can and will hit for less than a heavy missile on an enemy battleship this is as weird as if a thorax was hitting a dominix harder than a megathron would assuming same skillsedited for generally lousy typing
and for those gallente pilots who want me dead add to my bounty ingame im sure if it gets high enough someone will hunt me down
signed 1000000as a caldari char i just wanna say give us a chance damit
meh ill just nano to th o wait i carnt damnit lol dand yea i no ur not but others are and then others think omg hes got a wall of text lets belive him d and yea gd luck with that and goons but they do fail d
you had a chance devery race has been nerfed like this in at least one expansion but iv never seen any race go this dramatic over something like this d i find it funny now and ill just laugh at most caldari pilot that doesnt have a point behind what there saying d
linktake a look and see for yourself why so many people are complaining about this missile nerfmissiles were never the king of dps to begin with and now theyre even more useless
make it into a link i cba to copy and paste dand yes i no thre never been the high dps but they were wen it came to nanoers and missiles thats why they got nerfbatted because this expansion is about speed and that is what they consentrted on most and wen they found out missiles can pretty much hit nanoers easy as anything they had to nerf the missiles to ballance it
tell me the last time you used a missile boat to snipe nanoers instead of a rokh or something similarsuch hypocracy
do you know how long does it take for a cruise to travel 250km sniper ravens are just an epic fail if you arent a noob you should know it
never because i carnt use caldari thank u plz come again
signedwas there a demand for that or is it just fun to establish such useless changesmaybe we just have to wait for t3 items before we can use our missiles againso eveuniverse is the only place that we know from now where inventions are going backwardsit would be a good idea to fix all that crap with the corporation hangar arrays where you can not put bookmarks into fix tis stuff before you bring new problems into the game
if people stopped whining about things that dont really need a fix maybe ccp can consentrate more on things that do instead of having the entire team split up completly there all ready split up enough with the whole ambulation and t3 stuff just give them time and a chance its not as easy as it looks running a game like this
not read all the whining but as i understand it  its not speed alone that determines how well your missiles hit its the ratio between speed and your signature radiusnow ive not tested yet and i do have 6mil skillpoints in missiles so i could easily be upset  but lets not forget a torpedo raven did an obscene dps in pvp with only 6 launchers with a pretty respectable range for gate camps etcso was unbalanced every other ship had to think about relative velocity  getting into range for blaster boats etc  webbing targets  a raven just locked and fired witha target painter yes the figures for explosion velocities are low but they are just a balancing system they dont actually reflect the real world  if was real world any ship could reach pretty much any speed  except lightspeed of course  jsut a question of how long you leave it with the engines burning awayperhaps ccp should rename km to some weird named thing then people would be so upset at the explosion velociuty of the missilesnow somewhere in the posts i read somewhere that a bs can speed tank a missile frigate  if that is true then yeah that has gone to far but im pretty sure the speed to sig radius ratio will mean any loss in damage is very small indeed to the point of effectively nothingbut since my precious vagabond was whooped with the nerf stick rather hard too this means that anyone flying any sort of missile boat cant insta kill it like i had thought was going to be the caseso yeah caldari have been hit hard by this but  think about minmatar  pretty much half guns half missiles so they got this nerf to think about then they got nano nerf please remember that anything smaller than and sometimes including bs and bcs speed tank pretty much exclusively  so now they have no speed tank to rely onnow think of the minmatar recon pilots ohhhhhhh yeah they got useless webs that couldnt slow a sleepiung tortoise down and yep they used speed tanking too  so minmatar ships been hit harder than caldari if you ask meand gallente been hit speed nerfweb nerf as they need to get into blaster range then hold there targets there  but now be lucky to catch up to there targets and a single web probally wont hold them there either  so gallente nerf tooammar do seem to have come out rather well since they never really relyined on speedwebs or missiles but you can bet in the next expansion or patch they will get hit by the big ol nerf stick too
then you would have no idea about missiles in the first place so i guess that makes you a pretty huge liar for talking like you know everything
actualy ur brain seems not to big because someone doesnt use them doesnt mean they dnt no nothing about them i have seem plenty of caldari ships hunting down nanoers and killing them its not hard to do really and i suggest reading the persons post above urs for the simple fact he speaks more reason than all of us so remeber because someone doesnt use them doent mean they dont no anything about them i havent played the game for 2 years and 5 months to no nothing about missiles i have mates that use them and tell em ratio and show me what there like and explain stuff to me wen i dnt understand it
i guarantee my brain is larger than yours and it doesnt matter how many mates you hear about it from if you havent used them yourself then you cant speak on its behalf
so the fact that so many caldari pilots say that gallente are so more overpwered than caldari wich they should be because gallente are the ones that are drivin by power and weapons and have never flown or used blasters means that they no about gallente in that case half of the posts on here are ireelevant and i forgot to mention i did use missiles at one bit but i wa bored with them and wanted to use the mega which got nerfed a few times and so what if mates told me about it i no what there like and no what they need they need abit more dmg back but not to be able to hit smaller ships than them like blaster ships can most people in here dont have any evidense or facts to show this stuff is true that they claim
roflmao learn to use full stops and grammar once in a while i never said that gallenete were overpowered and i actually can speak on behalf of the gallente because i use both caldari and gallente shipsstop trying to implicate me in things i never said stupid
it wasnt actually based on just you nothing is based on just one person i was meaning it on the ones that said all that and i no my grammer isnt that good and i appologieze for that but still just because someone doesnt use the items doesnt mean they carnt have a say and if it was true that if you dont use the item you dont have a say this expansion would never be made because it was made for people that dont use nano and was whining about them beening to fast for them to hit yet you can hit them if you use your brain once in a whille and i actually did and have skills for caldari so i can actually have a say in this thank you very much forgot i trained missile skills when i was gunna use sb o and another thing sb for gallente are hurt by the missile change but we arnt moaning even though they are used alot and as the person said minmatar got hurt the most in this expansion but they have changed and adapted use ecm boats if you dont like missiles or do what iv done and train for a diffrent race
so give them a bigger sig penalty instead of a velocity penalty as well problem solved were all happy id still like a rof boost please and an order of friesgallente are all drone luvers anyways who cares what they think
crikey batman its the great wall of text
actually not true im not a drone luver id rather use blasters over drones any day and i could say this about caldaricaldari are all missile luvers anyway who cares what they think even though they have the best inty crow and have the falcon and scorp for ecm and have the rohk for railsblasters even thought there missile race

enough is enough reverse the nerf
eliminator2to expect that someones brain is smaller than your own is extremly unpolitebut maybe not where you are coming fromyour atitude is clear so you need this kind of advantage and helpwell i could live with that but for those who like to make
missiles are finally fixed leave them as they currently are
signed with the nerf i dont need to fight in pvpnow a 800ms frig can kill my raven  and i didnt damage itthis is very badmissiles are realy low and now they make less dps
ive played eve for years and now am just a light player the odd mission or two before work or on my day of but this nerf just blew all that out of the window well im sure what ever we say ccp will not change it or they will just nerf something elsenerf and counter nerf blah blah blah
thx for the fuing missl nerf now caldari is the biggest fu rasse in game thx ccp you can not predict what you think makes
they can kill any bs now though part from domi but naa they carnt kill ur raven cause u would use ur medliught drones on em d
is it that all of you who dont use missiles think that theyre finally fixed because now you are able to kill the majority of players in eve who are in fact caldari missile users missiles arent fixed theyre severly ed last time im going to say thisyes they should be redirected to do less damage to smaller targets give them a bigger sig penalty not a velocity penalty as well low will be the day when any player minmatar gallente or amarr have ever had a problem hitting a battleship going its base speed if your tracking is that bad why dont you do what youre saying and adapt train your skills up or just leave eve quit giving the caldari players crap because we dont like something if you have a valid argument and facts to back them up why this nerf should stay state them if youre just going to patronize because your life sucks stfu and leave the threadas far as ccp goes great idea poor math and implimentation no my cruise missile should not hit a frig for full damage except maybe on a stealth bomber but my torpedos shouldnt hit for half damage because the enemy battleship has an afterburner thier tracking can compensate they have mods to boost that we dont a bcs increase damage and rate of fire doesnt do me any good if i cant break the tank on a cruiser rat with cruise missiles
signed please reconsider this crap
oh cool my cruises got less explo velocity then my torps that makes sense i didnt test in pvp but i saw a angel bs speed tanking me with his mwd damage got down by 75 every gun would have hit them as they came up to mewhy shouldnt i hit a bc with my cruises when i am doing nearly as much damage with a drake with same amount of damage mods what are cruises for now theyre useless for sniping as they were before as aspeed tank against missis work on every rangeits all written a little crappy but i just want to say that they nerfed nano that would be cool as before you put on youre mwd and dont get damage from missiles now nano is nerfed but explo velocity is so low that its actually muuch easier to speed tank anything
signed btw
bump i add my favour here it seems that it is no longer worth flying caldari with the recent and previous nerfs i am also in favour of a change to nerfing policy see my other topic linkage
ccp please give me back the years ive trained missilessigned
signed its ridiculous that my cruise raven missile explosion travels 81 times slower than the missile itself a little physics lesson is in order at ccp target navigation prediction just became a near worthless skill 69msec explosion velocity increased to around 100msec at level 5 is pathetic i played around a little last night with my navy raven and a taranis my taranis with no abmwd could easily permatank the raven at base speed i agree that missiles should be much less effective against smaller targets but a cruise hitting a taranis for 3 damage while it is orbitting at base speed is way out of line all the gunnery pilots can keep cheering that a missile nerf was a long time coming but the arguement doesnt fly when most pure pvpers still chose guns over missiles due to their effectiveness even prior to this expansion
signed you just totally killed caldari as pvp and managed to fup pve also ccp
no u will cant give back i trained my gunnery skills 3x times long like you and i cant got back tooi think this topic will be my favor topic d
you wanted this nefr fing caldari idiots now you have to swallow the consequence and stop crying 
we wanted a nano nerf so that our missiles would actually do some damage instead of 010 per missile against nanos and not a fing nano  complete missile nerf you fking idiot

time to learn noob 
i dnt like caldari i think this was a bad idea as well for all bs only amarr fit trackin mods and do you really think im going to give a slot up on me mega just to fit one trackin mod incase i run into a frig or ab bs i dnt think so the diffrence is all other reaces are hit hard with this as well but only caldari are making a big deal out of it indtead of sayin it needs boosting tell them which part come up with a solution for them im sure they would appreiciate it they have enough on atm let alone fixing one race or all of the races i mean if caldari get buffed i want minmatar and gallente to ve vuffed because we wont be able to hit you ravens when you can do full dps on us so its not fair if just you guys get boosted plus if you do get boosted nano will whant to be boosted
ghost training nerfand now missile nerfman the idea of a cruise missile not hitting a frigate now is just redonkolous especially if the frigate is just using an afterburner i could understand the speed nerf and the ghost training nerf although ill play less nowbut the missile nerf is just dumb along with those certificates this expansion sucks ballzz
why the f do we pay for this c can we reverse this rubbish patch frankly it sucks
well try use guns to kill a cruiser what orbiting you you never will hit that frig i want to 100 hits for guns like missiles while the missiles hits everytime snip  mitnal
i have marauders 5my golem hits a stationary megathron for 1637 per volley on its highest resistancean afterburner on the megathron  250ms the same volley hits for 10702 solutions1  increase explosion velocity decrease magnitude of nerf2  allow guided missile precison skill to apply to torpedos aswell as other missilescurrently anything exceeding 137ms on a max skilled golem pilot will cause hisher damage to be penalized 140ms speed tanking wtfwithout doing the math thats about 40 damage reduction yes speed has been nerfed but nano is still as bad as it was before but everything is slower 45kmsec nano ishtar unhittable same ishtar now  1900ms still unhittable and you cant even stop it with webs nowsignedrockthis nerf needed to happen but they overnerfed it
quotewell try use guns to kill a cruiser what orbiting you you never will hit that frig i want to 100 hits for guns like missiles while the missiles hits everytime so stfubut dont guns have wrecking damage also which ups there damage missiles dont have this sure they hit everytime but one wreck can match it i just think the nerf was overkill
stop whining rocket my abaddon has top speed of 90 ms with ab i think it can go up to 200 maybe
you put alot of thought into that one it was an experiment 2008 boy you may want to do your research before you throw around your noob tags no web no painter no drones just a base speed ship against 7 caldari navy cruise launchers speed tanking shouldnt be an option with zero speed mods on a ship would a gun ship be able to hit the taranis no not at close range but your chances increase greatly as range does and you quite possibly instapop that taranis at your optimal i had my other main in a geddon there also and i one vollied that taranis at optimal with ease my missiles hit the taranis the same at 200k as they did at 5k
vidin your abaddon is plated and trimarked the mega i tested had 3 plate 3 trimark and got 260ms and why are you putting speed mods on an abaddon anyway lolbesides im pretty much gonna butthump the guy the only time this applies is if hes trying to run which happens alot
because otherwise it would take more than a minute to reapproach the gate after a jump lol
use a scout warp off gate and then warp back its what everyone else does lol
yaya but sometime there is no time to warp away and back you know that anyway long live missile nerf
its not like im complaining about not hitting frigs lol my damage is nuked against a battleship which any gunboat would hit as normal let alone anything smallerlets get rid of speed tankingoh lets have speed tanking at 200ms11what the fckeven increasing the base to 200250 would make me happy but cmon 113 my fart atm the smell of drunken ccp staff travels quicker than missile exp velocitywud also like to point out that heavy assault missiles have same base exp velocity as torps
so now just falcon left for caldarilol i shouldt say this tommorow ccp will nurf jammers
signed game is about done for me just spent to much time finding a setup to run mission with and the ccp screws it up thanks ccp for nothing
i have played this game for over 3 years now this is the most pathetic patch not expansion i have ever seen i just payed for my 6 months of playing a month ago and it was an obvious waste of moneyi have never seen such a pathetic disregard for players and the obvious miss of making a simple fix to the speed problem of not just implementing speed caps on ships battleships were already slow as  and now you want me to waste more time flying one are fraking insane ccpi am canceling my subscriptions at this point and i will not renew them until you set the missiles and speed back to the way they were you have royalling screwed this game up for everyone and now your going to pay the price with people quitingi guess you forgot about something called youtube i cant wait for all the negative advertising youre going to get at this point i sign the ops requestps cruise missiles were designed for bc and higher hence the name cruise missleoh even funnier is that my cnr now goes 117ms when it used to do 143ms base the sad part my cruise missiles in the cn launchers only have an explosion velocity of 1085ms which means i cant even shoot myself wtf ccp you have gone way to far this game is pathetic
signedthis is way extreme i have a manti stealth bomber and i was hitting npc frigs before this patch for 650 dammissle with cn missles i now hit 180 dam on the same frigs with the same missles my stealth bomber is no more now than a kestrel with a 18 mil isk paint job and long range rockets my drake is more effective than my raven and my caracal is alot more effective than my drake ccp wanted to give up more viable options but they have taken away an entire weapon group and a role ship stealth bomber as viable pvp options since even an industrial or bs can now speed tank most missles without ab
funny indeed cant even shoot yourself
but dont guns have wrecking damage also which ups there damage missiles dont have this sure they hit everytime but one wreck can match it i just think the nerf was overkillyou heard about weapon disruptors 2 distruptor on megathron and u will shot 45km with nulland dont forget wrecking chance 001 but miss and scraching damage
this has now been up for most of the day over one hundred thousand subscribers and i count aprox 46 signed kind of puts into perspective how much people care and that the whiners are indeed the minority time to forget this subject and put this petition to bed as a massive failureand no im not biased i have got a golem sat in a station with a caldari navy fitting but im not gonna cry about it im going to adapt like ive had to with many of my ships over the last five years
i found some information about explosion velociti in the airfor real explosionsin open space it should be even morethe rate at which the detonationcombustion wave travels through the explosive product the speed or how fast the chemical reaction occurs or the rate of the reaction only high explosives have a velocity of detonation vod the reaction speed is measured in feetsecond or meterssecond velocity of detonation vodof a high explosive shock wave will usually vary from 6500 feetsecond 2000 msecond to 26000 feetsecond 8000 msecond the speed of sound being 1085 feetsecond 331 msecond in air 1 foot  3048 meters no comment about the speed of a soundthe missile explosion in eve is even slover  i am so angry about this patch
i just started to play 20 day ago its just 6 hours that i try to complete a quest somedays ago i can do mission lvl 1 and 2 quite easly with my cruiser caracaltoday i was stuck in an impossibile mission for my cruiser i bought the best fits i try also 3x large shield extenders  but i cannot complete the quest i use the correct damage type for my target thermal but i need 1214 ligh missile to take an 2000 isk bounty enemy downsimply impossible i start reading the forum looking for help and i found lots of topics about missilei just want to kill some frigate but missions become undoable to me
thank you for comparing eve to reality but then why do guns have range limit in space a bullet or laser or whatever should fly until it hits something this is a game adopt or gimme your stuff
signed
s i g n e d 
you are right at 100 its just a game and and it has nothing in common with the real world situations my mistake ps bullets dont have speed right
signed
i m a maxed caldari pilot and choosed this race becoz it was good race when i started to play eve  in 2004 and belive me those days you could even do solo pvp with caldari ships ccp i just think it is not fair to let ppl train millions of skill points for years and then do such big changes in game mechanics by calling it balance coz if is so give to those same ppl a chance to reset skills and change race if you are so confident of balancing raceskt
signeduntil npc rats are speed nerfed and missile nerfed ccp has given an unfair advantage to all players
 signedpsdid a cpp dev read this thread i am too lazy to read whole 7 pages i hope this gets their attention
and how many read these boards or this thread you might have a few thousand at best read the boards and most are complaining in general descussion alot of in game complaining i did a level 3 in a drake modified with 5 heavies and 2 standard assaults and did the lvl 3 intercept the sabatuers mission i could literally speed tank the entire mission in my drake 3040 ships all locked and firing on me and as long as i kept moving they did almost no damage cause my drake goes over 180ms base even the 1015 frigates at close range barely touched me if this patch sticks im setting all my ships up to speed tank oh wait they already come standard speed tank nvm
signed
fix this ccp
yea i have to agree missiles where already useless enough in general combat i thought the speed nerf was supposed to be a boost to missiles please change it back
i can understand allowing things to abmwd tank missiles but just like an tank it should devote a few slots to that tanka substantial amount of dmg reduction against an unfitted mega just because he is in orbit coming from a cruise or torp raven no ab no mwd thats where it has gone a bit too far and what exactly are rage torps for again ah yes the shooting of freighters and capital ships ffsso are shield tankers now supposed to give up another slot for a target painter ontop of the mwdab warp disrupt web maybe for a bs you can pull this off but smaller shield tankers trying to hit the same class sized ship that dont have as many midslots and lol stealth bombers with cruise missiles yeah find a new profession i guessyeah we will adapt yada yada yada but this was a bit too far off the top i do agree bs sized weapons shouldnt be hitting frigs for what they were doing that part needed to be fixed
to start off i havent used missiles in forever i run around in a harbinger and a friend in a drake before qr was released the drakes damage output with heavy missiles was slightly higher than mine we could both 1shot nonelite frigs and at normal ranges 20km there was only a 12 sec difference in kill times for everything else the main exception was elite frigs which i just plain couldnt touch sorry my drone skills are crap and i have other skills i need first it was handy having a drake that when i webbed and painted the frig could kill them in a time far more reasonable than 15 flipping minutesand then came quantum risemy goodness what a nightmare i followed all the changes and i suppose i should have actively tested them as well fact is the only ones that come out of this cleanly are the veteran characters webs took a huge nerf there goes killing frigs at anything but sniping range missiles and medium drones took a huge nerf there goes killing elite frigates before june 2008 webs took a nerf there goes killing normal frigs in anything less than five minutes so to do anything in this game now i need what do i need i need a hulk ah i see what you did here ccp industry buff indeed combat is totally broken for all but the turret snipers now so might as well sell it all and mine wonderful ccp nerfing combat since beta congratulationsroll it back
signed10 hours to delete all the characters on 2 of my accounts goodbye 4year old characters no you dorks cant have my stuff  ive already given it away to deserving individuals i guess i should have actively been testing this but honestly i dont believe in paytobetatest and im already involved in other beta tests as it stands and worked the past 34 years as a software quality assurance technician so i really dont feel like paying to provide my services in that area ccp this is epic fail this is not how you fix problems this is how you increase them i thought that nobody could outstatesman jack emmert of cryptic studios when he instituted the global defense nerf gdn and enhancement diversification but i guess theres always a second time those two nerfs lost by jacks own admission in gamasutra over 6000 players within the first week yet he never had the balls to rollback the patches to their previous stages and admit his screw upccp i hope youre smarter i hope that you realize this is a dumb way of going about to fix god knows what that required such changes for those who are going to stick around for the ride unfortunately im not one of them
signed with both hands upthis improvement in the gameplay sucks big time there was something explained that the missiles were too good against small targets well i may kinda agrree to that but the fix was to intoduce a base explosion velocity of the cruise missiles for instance of 69ms  helloooo every fing batttleship in this game beats that speed even without ab we aint talking just saving frigs from the big bad caldari missile boats we are talking of nerfing the total missile gameplay i had trained missiles for nearly 2 years and now this comes i am mad as hell and seriously thinking of quiting the game this was the last straw if ccp are ok of me canceling 3 accounts then i have nothing more to ad
signed
signedof course there is certainly some ways to adapt of this critical nerf but this dont consider that it was already difficult to equilibrate a caldari ship with the lack of medium slots now it is worse as target painter and stasis become nearly mandatoryand we speak about a UFFFD 90 efficiency nerf who is really difficult to correct in both pvppvethe idea of the change himself is probably gooddoing it by nerfing so much all missiles instead of a more reasonable number is a proof of stupidityi dont hope ccp will not correct a few this change they proved many time that they are a studborn company
caldari is a shield tank designed race and you have to put a warp dist web ab or mwd on your med slots to have a proper pvp  just like the other classes do without dropping any tank   erm i m abit confused now if we spend another med slot for painter how we will tank just incase someone decide to shoot seriously is this a kind of joke  or really someone came up with that genious idea to punish ppl for training missilecaldari skills for years i dont have any intention for blowing intys or frigs with torps or 1 vollying cruiser sizes but atleast i want to make a max dmg to a bs while i m in a bs who cant actually fit a mwdab point web painter atsame time while other races go 2x times faster web and point me without loosing anytank  that realy isnt fair atall please next time dont fix something not brokenedit  i ve already setted a long skill maybe it s time for a break 
signeda single mwdab without any other speed mods is for mobilityrange control not for tank giving huge missile damage reduction is like having warp disruptors give you the passive shield tank of a drake to fix it we need one of two things1 set explosion velocity equal to the speed of an abing target of the appropriate size class no nanosoverdrivesetc no damage reduction period a mwd alone will give zero reduction as the sig increase to velocity increase ratio is 11or2 increase missile base damage if youre going to give them all the tracking problems of guns especially against samesize targets they also need the maximum potential damage of guns
sorry you lost it already yorda that sucks
it doesnt suck when id insured it moments before and my alliance has already given me a new one for freei love making a billion for dying in a cap fight
for the benefit of ccp in reviewing the csm request i strongly support the request stated by jade constantine in the original posts as do my alts 8  secondhand stories about the live events are what got me to subscribe in the first placerewards could be provided easily through the new medals system rather than giving ingame items the major benefit of event participation should be the involvement not profitsin cases where ccp really doesnt want us to act directly ie the coronation strongarm us by preventing us from flying with armed ships eg prevent all ships equipped with high or medium slot items from undocking in or stargating into amarr for 24 hours andor do the events behind crazypowerful station shields while being able to interact with the event would be more interesting bringing the eve universe to life by making news events real is more important to me overall
signed also would like the removal of the qr patch all together ccp has lost the plot and losing me as a customer only thing i would keep is the new ship but would give that up in a second to get speed back into the game this patch is a really bad joke that is not funny
needed for those for us who have to go away for long periods of time cos of work

i agree that drones should return on command or from a disconnect drones should stay in control for up to 5 mins long enough for dc not really enough for a logoffksi so when you land you still have control
signed for 3 accounts 9 total characters as stated many times this is the worst patch in the history of eve these accounts are about to expire because of how much i hate these changes everything is canceled
signed this is a great way to vote the whole patch needs to be tossed out if you ask me new ship is cool but not at the cost of the rest of the game you can read my 10s of posts about how bad i think this patch is

1 step forwards and 6 steps back well done once again ccp signed
i agree with the skill que for some of us its not a matter of getting up in the middle of the night i am a american soldier at times when we deploy to iraq it would be nice to be able to set a 30 day skill and que another 30 day skill in the event i cant get to internet within that time it would also help to be able to change skills through the eve website i may not have internet where i can play the game over there but the internet cafe allows me to acces the eve website and it would be helpful to change my skills from there i definatly agree that if your account isnt active all skill training stops thumbs up to the idea
getting up in the middle of the night to switch a skill is ridiculous no matter what kind of job or other obligations you have getting up for a massive fight in the middle of the night i can understand thats playing the game logging in just to switch skills and go back to sleep nope thats not playing the game
still no dev respondsigh
yallwe have been reeding about the new eve64 and its so wonderfull and all ive noticed thats its better even in places like jita but what i want is a client64 mock me if im totaly out of line most of the gamingputers that one buy today is often with a 64bit processor and since we want atleast i even the client to go smoother much smoother than it does today i dont know where to put a discussion out better in this forum so the issue is are ccp working on a 64client even with a client wich spreads the threads over multiple cpus if it has itissue iisince the day i begun with eveonline ive had problems with memoryleaks wich makes it difficult to use a client more than 46 hours before one starts to notice effect do we get the same amounts of leaks in the client as ccp solve by each patch or does the problem dont have high prio i want a game wich holds the whole op not until i die due to the clients internal glueish due to memleakif those two issues are not in the right part of the forum plz move it j
a 64bit client would only allow you to address more than 4gb memory for your client i doubt you have a single instance that takes up that muchas for memory leaks how do you actually know its a memory leak
from the first time i played eve the client have been a bottleneck the client have been slow i have taken up most of the puters strength i use a asus maximus motherboard 4gb ram 32ghz hyperthread cpu  8600 silent and its still slow i never been around seing the cpu go under 95 while one client is running there must be issuesthe client builds up memory all the time even if i sit in station spinning my ship as slow as possible i ursually starts at around 215mb and when its goes up to 600mb its turns out to be horrible what else can it be
eve caches all kinds of ingame info in memory and on the hard drive the bigger the cache setting in the client the smoother it operates if you have 4 gb of ram then by all means crank the cache size up to maximum64 bit processing is overrated the main use is like the other fellow said addressing more than 4gb of ram aside from that being able to do 64bit math helps some but 322 is already a very huge value most variables in even the most complex pc games are still less than 32 bits in sizehowever i would love to see multithreading come to eve
64 bit clients are a waste of time at this stage in the gaming worldreasoning that your dealing with a piece of crap operating system known only as the infamous and notorious windowsto use windows xp 64 or the 64 bit vista is always unstable at best and full of problemsbecause it is not a true 64 bit environmentthe majority of the software driversare all derived from the 32 bit worldthe only platforms on the market that are solidly there is of course linux and most recently the apple mac computer even they dont widely use 64 bit softwarebut most eve pilots are windows based and whats funny is i experience literally none of the above mentioned or frequent problems other than what you would get for being in the middle of nowhere on the coastbecause i run windows xp pro 32 bit 2gbs of ram a big assed vid card which added to the power bill ouch and i keep my system free of infectionsive only had 1 bsod in the last 3 years ive had my system aside from my usual tendency to push my system too hard so basically this was a totally random occurrence which happened to be evei dont tolerate crashes and for the last couple of months eve crashed on exit which didnt bother me as i was uh exitingits gone now qr fixed thatso with all due respect save your 64 bit requests for the day when microshaft gets there act together if everyou should be more concerned with security antivrius antimalware antispyware your internet connect and your systems load balance and efficiencyyour memory leak could be traced back to a number of possibilityif your running winxp64 downgrade to winxp 32 bit professionalif your running vista welcome to the new windows no i dont have a solution for thatthe 64bit world is still at best a pipe dream and reserved for server platforms until such time the consumer world catches upand im quite sure thats what ccp meant by the eve64 thing
how does these countries favor mass murder and the collecting of corpsesviolence is ok as long as theres no sex and gambling involved challenge the turds ccp those kids dont have enough money on their parents credit cards anyways to sustain multiple accounts
9 times out of 10 its not the game so to speak its the parents who fail to teach
i remember that the first pokemon games had a gambling area in one town and that there were items only available as prizes from the gambling yet i dont remember any complaints over that
i was the owner of one of the top 3 largest poker houses in second life and can confirm that as of midsummer 2007 the us govt put pressure on linden labs and ingame gambling was banned due to the ability to convert the virtual currency into usd
at no time was it said that cardsgambling was going to happen in stationsa strategic game was mentioned which u play against a ai  it was a player that asked if it could include poker and the answer was that it would be looked into as a possibility
something that some seem to overlookisk cannot be sold for real money without breaking the eula rules but real money can be used to buy isk without doing so through selling gametime codessince real money can be converted into isk isk have a very real valueeventually it is very much possible that people with a gambling problem might end up buying gtcs to fuel their gambling addiction those two things in combination might become a legal problemit saddens me to see that things like this actually have the potential to become problems
this is actually a bigger risk then people thinkgambling laws are highly localized and sometimes very sticky for instance within the uk there is a board that decides based off unwritten criteria if a game counts or not or if you are trading something worth something it doesnt have to be moneyin many us states having cards in the game environment regardless of money being involved at all is enough to get the gambling boards involved if they want to and new jeresy is just insane with its laws if the board even thinks a game might effect gambling since the state brings in huge amounts of revenue from gambling and the industry is pretty inbed with the local governmentnote  i say this having worked for a company that produces an online nongambling game while it is rarely a problem if some da looking to make a name for themselves or someone locally takes offense it can be a headache we actually had to alter or disable our product for differnt regions because of it
gambling fake money is badbut allowing people to inject their characters with performance enhancing drugs is goodyou sir have an odd way of thinkingif it wasnt rated r before it wont be now unless someone has a stick up their ass when they rate the gameand above all else eve will always be available for online download so even if a store doesnt carry it because of a local rating you can still get it hassle free online
interesting factoid but  so whatare those local marketscountries actually able to do anything about it and even if they can is eve really such a big game that they will bother
never said the laws made sense i think the idea though is the gambling laws in question dont care if money is actually trading hands it is how the game is playedfor instance the old uk swp grey market games were legal or illegal based off how much randomness they have in them ie the player must always be able to get the maxium score canada works in a similiar way utah all they care about is if it has cards in it and nj who knowsas a consumer correct but as a company ccp can get a lot of headaches if some local laws start giving them trouble you often have to fly to the local jurisdiction to defend yourself at your expense or forfit the hearing and us states have done quite a bit over the last few years for extending their community laws to other countires esp when it comes to gambling for instance arresting members of the company if they travel to the us feezing assets forcing cc companies to no longer deliver payment etcwhile unlikely it is a legal concern ccp is going to have to look into if they implement virtual gambling as part of eve
example  state of kentucky seizes control of 141 domain nameskentuckys gambling board felt that these were sufficiently gambly sites that since they were accessible to its citizens fell under their authority so they seased them even though many were owned and hosted in other countries
they could simply add poker without the builtin ability to gamble people already bet on various things using isk though without it being builtin to the card system youd basically have to use the honor system
pistols at dawnform a player corporation and challenge another corporation of similar size over mining rights to a specific system declare war hell even set a date for your fights to fit most peoples schedule and duke it out till youre all dead 20 times over in whatever you can fly theres no stopping you
hello cyprusthis game is the most indepth game out there from my experience id recommend waiting before you dive feet first into anything and just working on the basics my bio will help you out in game to get you startedmissions was one of the topics you touched on in fact the first one thats the focus of my csm platform i think youll find my website to have a lot of ideas to improve thati do feel your pain as ive been helping new players out for a long time in the npc corporation i would recommend waiting on faction warfare as the veterans in that will probably kill you before you learn anything eve university has a great training course for all aspects of this game so you can decide before you start the longterm skill training
new player content now is far more impressive than it was a few years ago and you also have the advantage of a tutorial that actually tutorsas for waiting a month or two to gain the required combat skills you only really need to be able to use webber and warp scrambler to be an asset to a corporation in pvp and you can generally use them within a day or two of starting
ccps own description of the entrance bar is a learning cliff as opposed to a learning curve they are trying to introduce ways to make it easier to enter the game eg certificates to simplify understanding the right fittings however i fear without some clever ideas eve will remain a complex game support eve university 
eves greatest strength is its complexity no single player can do everything finding your niche is one of the most difficult yet most rewarding rights of passage in this game
if you can find me the provision in american law for isk selling being illegal ill buy your argument any other legal system is good too for that matter theres only a couple countries in the world where it actually would be illegal because of antionlinegambling laws written far too harshlyeg greece a few years ago but in the vast majority of countries you can do just about anything you want inside a virtual world without even being a de jure criminal never mind the extraordinarily unlikely possibility of becoming a de facto criminal
im sorry must be tired need that extra cup of quafebut wth is rmtalso shouldnt this be petitioned and not futzing up here
drawn to its extremes this collective punishment could result in character purchases and setting up of sleeper corporations once in the target alliance farming ensues they then get caught and put the enemy alliance out of commission for 6 months admittedly a high stakes game but not beyond the biggest movers and shakers out there
rmt  real money trading ie isk for cash outside of gtc sales and since hes suggesting a major policy change as opposed to individual penaltiesmostly this is the correct forum for it
ah thank you now it makes sensewell in that case this should be inveistaged on a per person incidentif it happens to involve an entire alliance and or corp well then thats a bigger problemhowever you cant just assume all is invovled in said aspectincidentthere will always be a few who arent or at least oblivious to such thingsi cant advocate the termination of an entire team or allaince because of such thingsyes its a bad thing very bad and not easily stopped but wrong punishment to invokeyou need to make it stick and only affect the criminal not the entire country killing an alliance is like looking for an quick and dirty solution to kicking goonfleet or bob out of the picture based on a good sized number of peoplenot going to work in my bookme thumbs down
hii think it should be possible to walk around in your ship see it from the inside see your crew working do some weight lifting so your character looks stronger do plastic surgery achura are ugly be able to board another ship while its crew is in it and then start fighting each other like a first person shooter game the way you could board a ship when the crew is in it could perhaps be that you have to get the other ship down to hull and then use a special module ofcourse it would also be important to introduce a new set of skills which you could call boarding these could determine the armor and weapons you and the crew are allowed to use
support my issue
whoa whoa whoaslow down1 step at a timefirst introduce the idea of walking around your own ship
heh yeah but is this something a capsuleer wants to do or even canfrom the chronicles that i have read where the pilot moves between his ship he only seems to leave the pod once its out the ship and get back in it before its placed back in the ship so there isnt really any need for a capsuleer to walk around his ship thats what crew are for where necessaryi am on the fence about this proposal i might change my mind laterab
its a good idea but think about ityour in space in low sec and it goes inside your ship next miniut ur zoomed out and all you see is a pod
does this guy even read or bother to do his research
so wouldnt this mean permadeath or at least revert sp to last clone if the ship was destroyedalso im just not getting the point
the only feasible way to do this is to use ambulation and have a tour of the ships as you browse the shipyardsmarket or somethingbut when your in space your in your pod duhthere is no cockpit unless you find the ickygood surrounding your body to be appetizing
with the backstory stating that we sit in our ships in goo inside a capsule with direct neural connections to the controls then getting out of the goo would also mean losing control of shipit would be a nice thing to do when it was docked however at fanfest ccp saw even walking up to ships as an unimportant feature as they figured people would walk and look at it once then probably not do so again hence the priority could be better spent on other featuresall that said i think it would be nice but a nicetohave none the less
pod piloted ships dont have crews as previously mentioned so the ability to walk around inside your ship would basically amount to ccp modeling the interiors of uninhabited ships some of which are simply massive so you can wander around with no real point to it waste of resources at least ambulation has a social aspect
uh yeah they do at least the larger ones doat least theres a large number of implied indications of such thingsbut thats not the point the point is you as the pilot so to speak are in a pod and cannot walk around your own ship unless your not in your podin which case your dockedso to speakas far as the crew bit who do you think fixes the gapping holes in your armor and damage to structure when in mid flightto you its a module but you may have a crew on boardand if your structure fails you lose control of your ship so to speak makes sense to me at least role play or not you cant honestly tell me that those big massive titans have no crew
i figured repair modules were simply some sort of automated repair system you have unmanned drones you can order around automated repair systems dont seem so far fetched thought it was implied that the ship be dock first you wouldnt walk around in a ship youre supposed to be controlling via the pod for the same reason you as a player dont afk while your ship is out in space
sorry but you got to love rick lol
obvious rickroll was obvious
coughstupidspammercough
failmarauders are for missions not pvpi know some people fly them in pvp but meh that isnt their main use
i dont even fly them but this makes sence
did u read the op he said for scanning missionsexplorations ur reading skills  fail
id rather see a large hull exploration vessel i dont think anyone goes exploring with an uninsurable ship like a marauder
scanning a missions what
theres a balance to everythingsome people get accustomed to the scale tilted for so long they begin to think thats normal
supported i woudl actually say that the demise of eve tv was a big part of why i stopped playing additionally if eve tv came back i would have more motivation to return
id support the bringing back of eve tv to the same as it was just before they stopped broadcasting if the funding was found that didnt come from ccp therefore protecting the development of my shiny stuff
currently the only way to set weapon groups is while you are in space with your guns unloaded this means that we cant launch a new ship with guns loaded if we want to group guns so if we are in a new ship and know we are undocking into a fight we either go without weapon grouping or we have to launch with our guns emptythis doesnt seem a good idea so i would like us to be able to set weapon groups while docked
signedi love the weapon grouping feature in general but the man makes a good point
group all would also be an appreciated feature
you can do that through the fitting screen if the guns are unloaded or whateveredit here
so it was just badly documented please close this thread as the suggestion has already been implemented
well thats a suggestion in itself if a small onein favor of better documentation of instation weapon grouping
hii think there should be introduced a new set of learning skills which you will get by hiring special officers to whom you will pay a one time fee the special officers can get lost by your ship not pod getting blown up
support my issue
i dont know what you try to say but i support faster learning
what i mean is that so far we have basic learning skills which gives you 5 in all attributes charisma memory and so on we have advanced learning skills which gives 5 in all attributes and we have cybernetics skill which allows us to buy implants so we have 5 in all attributes i think that there should be one more way to get 5 in all your atrributes by being able to hire officers for example a trainee diplomat could give 1 in charisma a head diplomat could give  5 charisma and so on these officers would die if your ship blows up
so its a carebear feature because i dont think anyone that pvp would buy these just to see you loose em by ship death but then again you could cheat the system by buying a frig and jumping in that in station to learn faster and never loose them xploit detected d
waste of time and not worth the troublefor one everyone here likely has more than one shipand even then it would be messy at bestme thumbs down
did i miss something theres only 2 sets in game now where did you get 4thand no before anyone says it implants dont qualify as the third as they are not a learning skill
might have accidentally counted certificates
wouldnt this further skew the game towards either veteran players as they are most likely to be able to afford the extra attribute boosters  empire mission runners as they are least likely to die
i wouldnt go that farthe damage is training up skills at a too high a pacedoesnt stop you from stupidly fitting your ship and getting killed o 
so 90 is better than 99 now
no but if you read my post youll note that i never claimed it was
a spider drone slapped by a paladin with a t2 web will be essentially unaffectedfrom 500m1kms down to 50100ms inside megapulse tracking threshhold pretty much unhittable with the main guns whereas prior to this nerfspansion they could be stopped dead in their tracksbs prior to the patch would coast through a 99 web pretty well unaffected simply due to mass now they completely ignore webs entirelynow everyone knows that if you web an orbiting frigate your drones will not be able to track it game bug from waaaaaaay back nearly as well but if you dont web it they wont be able to catch upthe paladin needs to have its web bonus increased to return the 99 web bonusnow think about someone using faction webs the domination for example was reduced to 50 with marauders 5 theyll only have the effect of a meta2 web prior to the patch ie 75 max velocity damp doing that at 15km is as pointless as 10km
thought thats what the orca was gonna be for 3 high slots sucks
web bonus is so much more usefull then painter bonus i could set 5 painters on the same frig and still not be able to kill the damn thing due to the rediculess speed dmg decrease while 2 webs will make you instant pop any frig and webs are your medslots that means support slots for you while painters are med but means it takes up the tanking slotsso all in all the golem is much more useless lower dps gotta offer tank and much worse at hitting anything then the turret userswhile i totally agree with you that all the marauders seriously would have a giant buff for the pve purpose i dont agree that the golem is better actually much worse nowi mean when t1 bss t2 fitted can do the missions better and faster then the marauders there is a problem which should be corrected 
a spider drone also does zero damage to you meaning that your own drones should have enough time to kill it before to destroys you
omg get some skilli kill frigs in my redemer with mega beams without using a webwtf do you need a web to kill frigsfit a bombif your worried about concordski in high sec or there just out of range use dronesif all your drones are dead  duh  put the little feckers on approach hit ab and blow them away with your mainsor if you wanna do it properly dont let them get to orbit range in the first placelock them first  open fire frigs go pop  pop  pop  pop so fast you cant press the buttons fast enoughmarauders may be pve orientated ships  but that does not exclude them from pvp and the days of 99 webs are over90 is still awesome compared with what other ships can do
titans need to be changed somehow doomsday devices seem to be somewhat not working properly in any case gameplay wise not technically after a little chat at fanfest with jade he mentioned changing them into death rays rather than smartbombs as in target a ship and kill it this would however be quite harsh thougha little more thinking led me to the idea of changing it to an actual death ray the titan targets a ship and shoots the ray at it the trick however is that it also damage all ships along the path of that beam instead of just the targeted ship the weapon still retains its grid rangethe damage would be enough to threaten capital ships but probably not enough to kill them outright the point to this though is that it forces fleets to spread out rather than hump together as it would mean massive damage to their blob  much more than a current doomsday in any case if they spread out they would limit the damage greatly whilst still keeping the ray very effective in terms of the damage it doesas the fleet has to spread out this means that range will be affected and fleets will have to split fire because the outer ships might not be in range anymorespreading out takes space and the larger the blob the more damage the death ray does to it obviously as spreading out takes time and space but usually starts in the same space for whatever the fleet size is jumping into a cyno for example effectively this means that larger blobs remain effective but have to cope with more losses and have to split fire much sooneron the other end since subcaps are so small compared to caps this makes them much less vulnerable to death rays as theres less chance for them to get hit multiple titans or notin short changing doomsday devices from huge smartbombs into death rays will force fleets to assume rudimentary formations make blobs slightly more vulnerable the larger they get make blobs slightly less effective the larger they get make small ships much more useful in cap fleetsimho a change worth looking into or at least discussing

all i do is pvpi dont put up with bsvote vily
thanks big guy perhaps illuminati are not such terrible posters after alljk they still are
someone has to make the tri ateam look good
well theyre in a class all their own so there is room for downward movement on your part
you always have my vote you seem to care about exactly the same things i do without pushing 00 major alliance warshuzzah
i agree entirely with this the endorsement of anyone from the first csm is worthless these are people that formed friendships and want to make sure they can see their new friends again the heaps of praise hurled on her mainly outline organizational tasks that one would expect from an assistant secretary or that weird lady in the courtroom who writes down everything everyone saysas a player ankh does not really fit anywhere she is not a serious pvper nor a serious industrialist she doesnt have to deal with fleet fights and doesnt have her own pos to run or fuel there are other candidates from the first csm i would vote for but ankh is not one of them
still she makes the effort to dig into things as opposed to just sitting back in a chair and commenting shes explored other corporations ran through ops sat down with people evening after evening it is a generalistic perspective yes but she makes sure she goes where she has toits a choice between someone who knows everything about a little bit or a little bit about everything combined with the will to listen and learn and experience there are csm candidates out there who are further in terms of exposure and to a degree experience but the ability to step into the shoes of others counts for a lot as does a sound communicative and administrative skillseteverybody has a learning curve in eve heck many learning curves over time  what matters is the ability to grow listen communicate and combine from where i stand she is one of the top three candidates exactly for these abilities shell make an even better csm member in a next term she does not fit in one box indeed instead shes capable of seeing more then one box most people never get out of their box in their entire life p
hot discused item curious what you all think about this regarding high sec low sec and 00
no sir dont like it not one bitso id love to see a change where the person that flips my can is aggroed to me so i could attack but while that aggro timer is active i could take back from any can that the flipper has without them getting aggro rights against me this would be in high sec only in low sec flip awayremember stuffs getting better stuffs getting better every day issler dainzecsm candidateceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord
as long as the warning messages around stealing the stuff back are sufficiently strong to inform newbies of what theyre riskingwhich last i checked they are then i have no problem with the rules around can theftflipping in their current state if you just dump your junk into space dont be surprised when somebody takes it and does things with it you dont want done
working as intended
can flipping works fine as far as im concerned
quotesubmitthere is no problem with can flipping
working as intendedid personally like to see unlocked cans floating in space not aggro a character that opens and removes stuff from them there are lockable cans for a reason scoop to cargo hold etc be useful way of cleaning up some areas of space where poor skillwise pvpers drop cans to catch noncombative generally players out if you are stupid enough to leave stuff floating about unlocked youre stupid enough to lose itand if you want to shoot starting players to fill killboards and get some sense of worth target and shoot them without looking to bypass concord gunsarithron
can flipping is fine the way it is same for wrecks as far as im concerned
well i already cast my vote but i recently had an interaction with scagga laebetrovo i felt i should sharehe contacted me rather out of the blue to get my input on some of the pvp changes in this thread here i gave him my thoughts and among other things we had a very interesting and lengthy conversation about how to properly balance cloaking to disadvantage cloaking abuse by nonstealth ships while still making logistics for deep strike small gang warfare units viable a role which my corp has done alot of recently and would like to keep doingwhat that conversation showed me is that scagga will proactivly seek out policy input and feedback from players experienced in the nuts and bolts of the day to day aspects of that portion of the game while i am still happy with who i voted for i really wish we could vote for more than one candidate hes not the only csm candidate id go so far as to support but hes the only one who has sought it out and his thought processapproach to decision making has convinced me to give it fullygl m8 i hope youre in the mix
scagga gets my double vote
gentlemen thank you for your support
vuce 4 votes from me
vuk is sensible and straightshooting nuff said 3 from me
3 votes from me everything ive seen of la vistas first term suggests he was one of the few who truly deserved the position he communicated with the community better than any of the other csm candidates and id be happy for him to represent me againgo
you have three of my votes good luck though no doubt my endorsement will remove your need of luck
as a casual industrialist ive appreciated your contribution and your podcasts one vote from me
at this point i havent seen anything on sisi that suggests blasters are dead whatsoever eventually we will have to wait and see how it plays out on tq but in theory blasters are just fine

puts a vote for oz pin on
yes yes you do
i like your focus on individuals player experience and corporation security totally got meme casts 3 votes for you
when i checked the csm candidates i had two reasons in mind that said i shouldnt vote for you why i havent seen a web page which would be a valuable communication tool it would be good to tell us more about our ideas give us a contact address and if it would come with a forum it would be good to tell you about our ideas how can we expect serious work from someone who doesnt start right now the secound against reason was when i seen a name of a feared by many alliance from 00 spacemostly because any big alliance has permanent advantage compared to new players and when anyone comes out from 00 and makes things harder for new players who dont have a chance can make the game worse right now most of the new players leave after 7 months mostly because entrenched interests make sure they cant compete with others and they see the differences are permanent and they have very limited amount of motivation in pve since it isnt interesting and motivating enoughif we want to see eve online as a strong game in the future it should be able to keep new players interested and the problem with entrenched interests are in sp total alliance size bpos poses experience etcas long as in low sec your new player wont have a chance against most residents why would you try to move to that place you would lose too often and risk vs reward says keep outand with every month we see bigger and bigger gap between new and old players and more and the newbies and carebears will have more and more reasons to leave they wont move to low sec but they move to a different gameto me it is clear lowsec is ruined already several careers in eve are ruined already without a change there the game is dead no point in discussing protecting carebears from goonswarm or making risk more visible to carebears with a stronger goonswarm since without a change there the game is deadso i hope to see your home page soonand there is a question about skills and entrenched interests how would you reduce it would you change learning skills
first time voter here and i must say you have my vote its a shame your all the way at the bottom for candidates i almost didnt go through the entire listsomething i would like to see in eve is a single player owned starbasesructure id be interested in having the ability to setup my own private pos for moon mining while still belonging to a corp currently im using my alt in a 1man corp to moonmine and fund my main characters pvp itd be alot simplier if i could do everything on one character
so to clarify our current goon standings tada o the executor corp for the honda accord was briefly a member of the goons my comment about the intentions of the goons is a result of some of the communications i saw while that was the case we left the goons after it was clear that they were a little too crude in some of their internal communications than seemed to fit the majority of our groupwe left on good terms i even made a brief attempt to get bruce while tada o was in bruce to work out a nap with them when we first moved to syndicate some time later after we left bruce when we moved to molden heath we were seeing them regularly in the space were were active in i contacted them to get us set blue we were told by the goons they would for a while they honored that araingement some time after that several of our members were attacked by the goons and we set them red to be on the safe sideso we consider the goons red to ushope that clears up any confusionissler
deception or not youre one of the candidates i was reading up on seems to fit my bill
i used to be in bob and fought goons for 2 years if that counts for anything
well i am not a big fan of getting 00 alliance politics into the csm the csm should concentrate on the overall health of the eve universe and not on the wellbeing of any political powerblocks i think the csm candidates are supposed to represent specific game styles not political factions like ankh was representing the carebears and later the faction warfare guys lavista stood out for the lowsec darius represented the interests of bigass 00 alliances and i tried to stand for the small 00 corps when i had the chance goons have said and done kind of nasty things to eve which i did not like however the csm candidates are real persons who should not be generalized in any way darius for example has said kind a lot things that made me worry a little bit however after meeting him in person i think that he is an extremely funny guy who knows what he wants and a lot of his interests are the same as mine his opinion on sovenerity in 00 for example were kind of bright he thinks in large has a perspective on the game that also made me think a lot and think on a larger scale so i do not think that it would be a good idea to discredit any candidates just because he was a goonof course it would be a huge risk for the csm if goons had the majority in the council if i am wrong and they are actually the kind of evil people half of the community believes they could actually impose a great danger on csm probably get it to fail completely and i do not wanna see that so in my opinion no ingame faction should gain absolute majority in any csm and right now the only faction that has the chance doing that are the goons but with 7 candidates i do not see a chance of them doing that do not take me wrong i do not like goons in general however i think that they should not be discrimated as candidates as long as it is not proven that they were planning the destroy eve kind of stuff and a final comment yes hun reloaded is member of the gbc
i think this point has been voiced even among the candidatesbut all in all it comes down to one questionwill the goon candidates if elected think of themselves or for the people of evethis is a heavy question it is hard to think in a play style and then suddenly come into an advisory role but in the end only time and opportunity will tell i think any corp or alliance who wants to go for csm then i think at least it would be in their best interests to adopt a good governance mentality politics in the real world is a case of charm chrisma and in the end likability people are afraid of the goon agenda when that statement about us vs them was made regardless of the true meaning behind it statements like this will be taken out of context you have to watch what you say when a faction within whether official or not does things like terrorist attacks in empire space against players because of ideological differences regardless of your meaning behind this you loose credibility because negative ideas get associated with you so as such you have the suspicious voters also the jihadswarm attacking of miners lost you a lot of points from the industrial sectorif you act like an ogre with a battle axe people are going to be afraid of youbecause your a big alliance that already makes people worry and thats when your being friendly i know thats unfair and in many ways yes it is but thats what people believe compound that with the actions of jihadswarm and such groups like this with in goons damage your reputation even more if you work on the direction that goonswarm ultimately wants to go and try to repair this reputation try to put friendly and good nature into goons then i think you will be able to come back i believe even goons can be redeemed this combined with making sure your message is that you really are as a candidate wanting to improve evethen i am willing to give you a chance a fair try but also know that if you try to set up something or otherwise screw the eve community i honestly dont think your rep would ever be able to recoverif you here for good then i wish you luck if your here for a scam or screw job may god have mercy on you because the eve community wontin the end and in due time the truth will come out whatever that truth iskaiden

voted for you today alts your focus on industry lowsec and roleplay is a good match with mine i wish you the best of luck
hope it ends well vily how many precincts have reported in
correct  california gets 55 congressmen out of 538 so approx 10 rounded off so if goon gets 2 they have what percentage and soes that mean that that percentage of players in eve are all goonsothe csm should consist only of members from the 10 largest alliances or should it be a crosssection of eve players
that is a terrible comparison the american government has 3 coequal branches of government one of the best reasons behind this system was to prevent the tyranny of the majorityif you want to use the american comparison i nominate myself for chief justice of the interstellar supreme court
a joke waiting to happen i suppose that could be one result another could be that a great set of candidates get elected become an effective voice of the pilots of eve and ccp makes some great improvementsin the end to quote my favorite asthmahoundhow it turns out will largely be determined by who the pilots of eve choose and how much they choose to support the council so my advice decide who best represents your views and thenpush the shiny red button please visit your user settings to reenable imagesnext to the candidates name in the eve virtual voting boothremember stuffs getting better stuffs getting better every day issler dainzecsm candidateceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord
i dont think this is a subject really here is whyeveryone will be voting for me anywayseven if 7 goons would make it in the csm it seems to me it would not give them any clear in game advantages for the goonswarm agenda the csm topics seem to have generally not to do with single alliance interests so as stupid as it sounds if 7 goons in 2nd csm would do a good job it would not just be a benefit to goonswarm but to bob and even all other players and alliances in general probably 99999 of the topicsthey will do what they think they want to or can do in game anyways regardless of csmand that is if they make it this time
i know that we are the smallest minority in game but a little representation would be nicei dont really blame pirates for not wanting to run for reasons too obvious but i am just curious looks like this time and last time everyone running is just a caldari carebear with no interest in combat that would probably be playing something like orks and dorks if eve didnt exist
heh yeahi think i have seen you in the veto channel it just so happens that my pvp character happens to be in said corp
im an expirate and if youve seen my thread youll have seen that i have paid attention to issues facing it
which is your main lavisa vista doesnt even appear on any killboard including vetosyou seem to mention fw as if its good for piracy have you even pirated since fw came out fw scared away a great number of the profitable targets and the fw pilots taste horrible and drop junk loot since they are already expecting to lose their ship to a hostile blob fw is one of the worst things to ever happen to piracy not because they fight back as some fw noob might state and that is not an insult it is a fact ccp described fw as for noobs wanting to get their feet wet fw noobs fight back poorly and are unprofitable as targets
while im no pirate myself i dont run for people playing exactly like i playpiracy definately has a place in eve and should be considered on its own merits especially when nerfs to griefers affect honesttogod pirates meissa
goons are caldari carebearsi dont know if any pirates specifically are running but many of us share the same goals and would like to see more functionality in the systems that pirates use
lavista cant even fly a cruiser also seeing as lavista is my industrial character going 10 with him wouldnt be all that ideal but yeah this character is my pvp character
allow me to clarify i have never made any mention or even implication that fw was good for piracy have i pirated since fw came out yes for a few days  but i had such difficulty finding targets that i lost interest as for how i have mentioned fw and piracy together  fw is here to stay and i dont think that finding a solution to improving the outlook for piracy should involve sticking ones head in the sand and ignoring it as a consideration my opinion is that the best way to deal with the problem is to integrate rather than develop in complete separation simply rereading these points on piracy and the answers i have given to people who asked questions about it would help clear up this misunderstanding
a wreck to salvage after shooting a structure sounds like a good idea to meunanchoring is too much i guess as the prices for similar modules would be affecter greatly in a bad way probably by becoming a lot cheaper
boom factor is considered a wasteanyway making them salvagable would have large effects on mission values so other mission drops would need to be adjusted to compensate also given the size of some of the structures youre talking about quite a chunk of salvage there to make this realistic youd need something low value that drops in vast quantities something like metal scraps etcmy concern would be impact on other mission loot drops inflation caused by increased value of missions and extra iskgoods flowing into markets from mission runners potentially unbalancing the iskhr ratio with other professionstake carearithron

interesting answers let me pick up on a few posted i have listed them above1 small anchorables have been kicked about for sometime you represented the issue to csm and the csm asked ccp who stated that they already were being looked at and developed9 why does the universe need expanding empire has many systems that are underpopulated or empty apart from pilots passing through low sec is essentially a wasteland in many regions 00 space has large areas that are rarely flown through due to bypass highways via jump bridges etc i fail to see why it needs expanding more at alllarger space means less conflict 11 so you arent good discussing specifics of pvpfleet battles etc missles and fleet battles are seperate than missle changes speed nerf effects on missles etc14 high sec belts boosted to what end you are in favour of making it more viable to mine higher end minerals in empire meaning pilots can make more isk for few risks this in turn impacts on the economy and spreads out from there17 being able to charge a fee for using jump bridge is unimportant but being able to award medals is important interesting1920 what you meant to say is that the csm has raised this with ccp alreadytake carearithron
i didnt mean value of ore i meant amount sorry for the bad formulation hehe
ankhesentapemkah you are probably the most sad csm candidate i have ever seen you talk about things not being possible you are not voted to talk for ccp everything is possible you work for the players
wow  have you read this thread salvaging has nothing to do with the aggro rules being discussed it is simply in response to the ownership of the loot of a player made wreck and not aggro in response to a salvaged shipthus your comment makes zero sense
signed  would be a good improvement
signedcrap constant dps has now been nerfed into crapper nonconstant dpsi fly caldari in pvp and pve but lets talk about pvp for nowi cant tackle without sacrificing a lot of tank and now i cant do jackall dps without taking another slot away come onim feeling like the only thing that caldari has going for it right now is the falcon but with the amount of whiners about ecm im guessing this will be nerfed soon toowell it was a good 7 months i was feeling like i was finally going to have some fun in a hac like a cerb but now its time to train another race outstanding not id rather quit the gamedont forget to pay your subscription fee ccp wants your money for that too
signedi actually have decided not to resubscribe due to this issuebeing a caldarispecd missile specd pilot i have no viable pvp options anymore besides a falcon tbqh so much for balance
signed for the love of f
very glad to hear this might spend the raven money on some shield rigs instead
ran a few missions yesterday with my arbelist raven and tbh i cant see much of a difference and no real problem if they hadnt been nerfed they would have been very overpowered though so i think ccp did ok here for reference im equally trianed in minmatarcaldari and mostly use missiles and drones tested against cruisers bc and bs all npcs and seemed to do fine also this was using the exact same raven setup i had before patch no painters or webs and only shield rigs on it
thx for the fuing missel nerf first think and than do itwhy
signedwasnt around for the first nerf but this one has pretty put me off the golem i was so close to flying its like ccp doesnt want caldari to pvp
most awesome avatar ever ftw
signed give that man a cigar its also ridiculous that a heavy missile is now better than a cruise against a battleship cruise missiles now good for shooting freighters and capitals i mean i did some tests with my industrial vs my raven and the industrial just got a lot more survivable with an ab and a smartbomb come onwin
missile needs boost specially in fleet figths
drones ftwguess its time to use caldaris other weapon the rail
signedi fly an apoc mission running yes i fit 2x cruise launchers on the shipthe changes seem to be way out of line
signed as a pvp missileer
there are too many caldarians in the game and i believe that was the reason ccp changes affect what race people will choose
signed
to all other races who think this is fair seriously do your math and come up with a plausable arguement other than haha you guys suck worseif youre gonna complaing about tracking consider rof if youre gonna complain about damage consider ammo amounts if you wanna complain then give us some cold hard facts with math equations and numbers more caldari pilots have posted math supporting the fact that missiles completely suck than any of you have even tried to give reason against
while i feel that the qr patch is pretty good in most respects the nerf to missiles is a bit over the top i understand the intent of avoiding missile pawnage due to slower speeds but the reductions that are in place now are woefully lower than necessarymy suggestion would be if you halved the explosion velocity of each missile from the pre quantum rise patch you would have had a good balance heavies were 750ms reducing that to 350ms say would have been fine an ab cruiser can easily push 500ms and then reduce damage from missiles while a frig would have a greater reduction of damage both from sig radius and there base speeds close to the explosion velocity already but bringing it down to the current 81 ms is really unexplainable same with cruises pre patch it was 300ms 150ms would have done nicely and easily would have tied in with the reduction in bs base velocity but 69 ms is hulk speed a hulk with an ab could speed tank a cruise missile while rails and artillery would shoot it like it was standing still i dont think missiles should be brought back to there original values i understand the intent but i do disagree with the current values they are simply too low so signed
moved to assembly hall
whilst i support this move i do think its gone too far you only need a minimal speed boost which a single overdrive injector can provide in order to tank missiles even if you are heading straight towards themi applaud ccp for trying to bring missiles inline with guns but this is a nerf too far
signed  support
i vote
supported both this and other features brought about in qr have made me question for the first time if this game has its hooks in yet i guess not because as much as i enjoy pre qr it these changes make me unhappy enough to consider it a bad investment and act accordingly before i get to that ive got too much invested in this to quit syndrome one interesting point after 5 years of eq and what sony did to it i had that kind of investment and i left to come here which softened the blow alot its not so hard this time around so i unsubbed although both my accounts are paid until feb 09 and ill play whenif it becomes enjoyable before thensou kant haz my stuffs just yet edit forgot to hit the thumbs up thingie after previewing
this is the main points of argument for people for and against the new missile nerf  people for the nerfmissiles were far too overpowered they would be too effective against targets smaller than what cruise missiles are supposed to hitanswer to thismy guess is that 99 of people who say this are just plain happy because they used turrets to begin with its their way of throwing their anger around at the nano nerf and saying hahahahaha in your face at someone anyone impotent rage at people who are actually making valid pointspeople for the nerfadapt or dieanswer to thisthose are some great words of wisdom coming from a 20032004 char who has every race trained anyway so they can smacktalk all they want and seem like they know everything remind us again how long it took for you to train up large hybrids to t2 and say that to the players who only just started playing you think you know the answer to everything every game needs some sort of system that lets you make some easy money in the beginning missiles were just thatapart from the above points that i have stated its all about the rage from people who hated missiles in the first place and are letting off steam to make themself feel goodps reported eliminator2 for trolling on a forum and encouraging verbal fights to break out
this
this man speaks the truthi honestly have a hard time seeing how missiles preqr could be argued as being overpowered conventional pvp wisdom seems to state pretty clearly that missiles with the exception of a select few t2 ships are not the way to go one could argue that their lackings in pvp are balanced by their excellence in pve but even in pve there are better t1 options than the drake  raven linei can only conclude that missiles before qr were at best balanced and at worst underpowered and that any changes made in qr should be made solely to preserve the previous balance

yay no more 100s of ravens flying aroundmaybe ill start seeing some spice in eve onlinefunny thread 1010me thumbs down
ccp this is bull you cant even make one reply to your costumers pitiful you are losing 5 accounts today why train anything in this game with the risk of it being nerfed and no i am not talking about shooting frigs i am talking about not doing realistic damage to bcs and bss its sad to go really i really do enjoy eve but i will not train skills that could be obsolete in the future and noone is getting my stuff

signed x6i am supporting this pettition 100 ccp has changed the dynamics of the game so much that i lost completely interest in playing the game any more after multiple missile nerfs this last one is simply rediculous i tested in pvp with my nighthawk manticore and caldari navi raven i have maxed missile skills on one toon and max skills on gunnery on other toon missile boats are so outclassed in various combat scenarios that they are simply inferrior game is brokeni am letting my childrens accounts expire in two weeks they were both caldari and their interest was weak and only npc and my two industry and trade support accounts my combat peeps have about 2 and 3 months left and will let them expire i am dissapointed in training so long and seeing a great game go backwards this is not an expansion  it is simply a patch a bad one at thati am incuding below my detailed pre patch post fyisateneposted  20081107 051500  789  quotereport i have spent hours reading the changes in missiles and things are definitely going in the wrong direction caldari must use mids for tanking new changes require more mids to be sacrified to achieve full efectiveness of missiles complexity is getting rediculous this very reason for mids handicap made caldari so weak in solo pvp gang pvp is not an answer you can say go in gangs to fill any deficiency in any scenario but really not the answer to this major missile nerf why ccp has to screw so much with missiles is beyond me speed issue can be fixed many other ways lets put things in simple terms for examplethere is no way to win in a raven vs a domimegathron in pvp providing equally skilled oponents and appropriate top mods can ccp see this clearly or this is done on purpose or there is no way a nighthawk will win against astarte in pvp providing equally skilled oponents and appropriate top mods can ccp see this clearly or this is done on purpose the above list can go a long way like this my point is missiles are to compensate for the mid slots tanking defence and mwdabwebtpws offence problem or handicap it is a major caldari disadvantage and has always been there are no mid slots to fit all this to be any effective with missilesso stop with nerfing missiles in general and deal with 10kms cruisers flying arround cruisers should not be fatser than missiles period under any circumstancesor maybe you will blend all the featuers in this game so much that everything becomes so nerferd and blended that peeps lose interest and the edge in the game it is a scary thought but it has happened beforerespectfullysatene1 of 6 accounts
changes were needed but the ratio of how explosion vs sig radius and explosion vs target velocity factor into damage needs to be tweaked a bit cruise missiles should be hitting battleships for full damage considering velocity alone but not wtf owning frigates ccp got half of that equation correct in qr but the error they made in over nerfing on explosion velocity will hurt lowsp characters the mostim almost more peeved that 7 million sp in missiles cruisecentric only nets me a lowlevel boobyprize certification thats for another thread however
bs sized guns hit bss for full sometimes and sometimes they hit for less and so it was proclaimed by the masses that missles were balancedbut alas delay is the elephant in the room as long as it is taking 8 seconds for my missiles to reach my target it should be real simplebs cruise missile  bs target  full damagethats the trade i get for having to wait while you get a good shot at jumping away before my volley hitsexplosion velocity was nerfed too hardoh and just for fun comparison tnt has an explsion velocity of 6900 msand rdxc4 has an explosion velocity of 8750 msi think our nuclear missiles are powered by farts
the pb is that missiles dps 30 less than guns pre patch now its something likes 5060

who ever bright idea was this must have there head examined seriously missiles are useless now what id suggest is having two parts to the missile the impact damage and a chance to do 2ed damage thus the explosion damage thus being the one you can avoid with speed but still take like 10 of the damageor just please reverse the missile nerf the worse idea ever in my bookif it doesnt get fixed i think ill quit playing and take the money i spend on 3 accounts else where
i am in your position i dont want to leave eve but at this point it is essentially a waste of time to train for anythingyou have broken missiles and rendered an entire race useless fix missiles please if these improvements stick i will be cancelling my account
maybe not mentioned is the sheer cost associated with being forced to pummel npcs with 5x the  of missiles as before unnerf the missile boats and bring back my raven i dont have 3 hours to wipe out 20 cruisers and frig before getting to the bcs talk about a lousey isk to time ratio
signed
not that im in disagreement but if you want to see how effective voting in assembly is just see the original nano nerf thread that was against this mess to begin withnothing will change waste of time 
signed
the nano nerf was needed

so what its not like theres a 50 chance that concord might show up once youre 04 youre on your own so why pay rent to someone thats not going to give you anything in return its already silly that 04 is riskier than 00 because all the uberpirates are gatecamping
problem repeat 50x if fitting in bulk search for desired mods in hangarwhile your suggestion works on its own i do not think it solves the other problems which were mentioned in the op
signed this patch is making me so sad feel like 2 years of my life enjoying eve have been wasted so depressing to cancel my accounts my interceptors are worthless and no fun to fly anymore i fear trying anymore ships out of the pure pain that eve is over as a fun game please someone at ccp tell us that its going to go back to the fun game it was just a few days ago this patch fills me with hate for the people that changed the game i loved
im sorry but your motion for a repeal of the nano nerf has fail your stuffmy hangerits a date
i vote the recent nano nerf is foolish
signedquantum suck has brought nothing but unsubscriptions and rage
signedyou know theres something wrong when ships such as the thorax deimos vigilant and vindicator get more cap by equipping a mwd that is better than t1i think that guy who failed maths in class is working for ccpoh well they reap what they sow
i think this guy ought to be banned from forums for spamming can i haz ur stuffz everywhere people complain about the new patchit should fall under the category of trollingedit reported
signedfew months ago ccp said ok ok we remove from our plan the speednerf we made know we stay under your suggestion on how to balance thatand know we got exactly the same speednerf without anychange and some nice other nerf likes missile which arent designed to makes full damage to ship bigger of 2 classes
signedmy ass hurts from being sexually assaulted
against too much too fast
lol why carry on voting ccp dont listen and nerf is already in adapt or die as plenty of you so fond of saying 72 pages means nothing to ccp even if some of the points raised in this thread are valido7
ok i see that we can now group similar modules as per the devblog but i would like to see this expanded to include other modules in particular the salvager i moduleyes i understand the followingand want to throw it out there now so that its not forgotten when the next patch comes down and miners get their damn mining lasers grouped leaving us ninja salvagers left out in the cold againoh and where the hell is my salvager ii i want that too i guess thats another vote
i wholeheartedly endorse this product andor service
thumbs up from me also if other non weapon items could also be grouped cap boosters webs and points id be a happy chappy in fact how about no restrictions at all on what can be grouped if i want to point and double web someone with a single click i should be allowed
definatly supporting this one dont see the point of grouping mining lasers one laser per roid avoids the problem of the roid being emptied but one of your lasers continuing its cycle anyway
and tractor beamsdont forget tractor beamswhat
i agree with this proposal and further with sang jins idea about no restrictions to grouping
official stamp of approval
you would agree with yourself tychelli also have to agree but it should be all active moduleslet all active modules be linkedi also second that salvager ii but you are forgetting something wheres mah salvage ship
this thumbs up from me
its called a frigate or an intyyes ive upgraded from an executioner to a malediction nothing beats 1700ms on an ab salvaging the wrecks from an unsuspecting mission runner using tractors although i guess youre looking for some cargo capacity as well eh
allowing players to link salvage modules together would make cleaning up after everyone a lot easier and faster
yes y not
hell yeh
yes
tbh a mercenary contract system as what would stop mercenarys bypassing the system and war decking corps anyway passing all the rules
as this issue has been submitted to ccp discussed in the csmccp meeting and given high priority you and i can just agree to disagree bounty contracts are open to bounty hunters who access contracts based on experience standing with bounty office however this was just a possible way to implement it devs do decide the finer details and may consider good ideas posted on finer detailsreverse auctions just add unneeded complexity to the system and delay the start of the hunt there is mention of a maximum number of characters that can accept a bounty so no hordes chasing after one character theres nothing stopping a player being hunted from returning fireyou make them sound like poor passive targetsarithron
they should just add  gambling and blood to eve and stick a happy 18 sticker on it no one really cares and i always get the feeling that eves moodiness and dark backstory is being held back by its low age rating
again a bit late but showing support
what was the reason they stopped the tounaments anyways
full support as long as the eve tv group is in with it
yes
i agree i have finally gotten to use t2 blasters and this nerf has been devastating i feel like im in a game of tug and pull where ccp leads you to go this way with skill training then switches the game up suddenly on yai dont know a whole lot of the math involved but i do know that ccp should take a look into their very own customers concern about the product they purchase from ccp  and the comments i have heard from ccp regarding it are dissapoiting especially coming from them i sure hope they got looked at because this is very frustrating i now dont have a super 1337 ship
i myself am a huge fan of the megathron hullinfactits the only ship i likeand ive been working on it since i saw itim not a gallentebut if ccp lets blasters diethey let gallente dieon top of thatthe vindicators bonus to large dps is useless if you have bs lvl 5nowwith the new mwd statsany mega can have all the same bonus of my bill isk ship for 6080 millthis thread i support
we need blasters boosted we got the speed boost a very very small one but that isnt enough i think eve was fine with the nano stuff and how missiles and blasters and everything else were i have adapted to it though by training amarr but 2 years 5 months of training gallente down the drain tbh and soon amarr will be kicked in teeth
fully supporting this
i dontwhat is on tq now with qr shows just how incompetent the csm is in judging ccps capacity to  things up
im a torp man myself but i still support this thread completelywe the missile users got hit very hard with this new patch notice how everyones saying patch and not expansion hint hint nudge nudge to ccp but i must say that the insane nerfbatting that gallente ships have received is also unfairthumbs up

before answering please note that i have no opinion whatsoever on the alliance politics under discussion and dont pay attention to them most of the time this reply is purely by way of being an fyiin th us the patriot act gives the government extremely wideranging powers to address whatever they perceive to be money laundering as does rico which is directed at mafiatype organizations and drug dealers additionally a court in the netherlands has recently ruled that theft of a virtual object through reallife aggression was in fact a criminal matter now that was in a quite different game one which does not allow ingame scamming as a playstyle whereas if you are dumb enough to hand me 1 billion isk in return for 1 unit of tritanium its your own damn faultmy point is just that the virtual nature of mmo transactions does not automatically exclude them from legal scrutiny i have no idea what sort of sums are traded in rmt but under us law i believe that cash transfers in excess of 10000 are subject to recordkeeping requirements thats about 300 gtcs or 15 billion iski am not a lawyer usual disclaimers apply but i am interested enough in the subject to see a potential liability situation  more likely for ccp as enabling party than any individual playerjust for funhave you thought about why the icelandic banks had their assets frozen under the uks antiterrorist laws recently have yousome references if youre interested i am not going to get in an argument about this like i said its just fyi material
again when your in space your in your pod you could still have a crew on board managing the less than important systems or auxiliary controlsemergency systemsetcwhen your docked then you can look around perhapsbut not when your in spacedrones humans not much difference the point is still the same if your in your pod no you cantotherwise you can perhaps
no point in repeating yourself if youre not going to try a new argument or bring in new evidence i looked it up though and you are correct about the crews and since its been discussed to death i will speak on it no more i never said you wouldnt have to be docked first though
id love to walk around in my ship cant imagine my pilot is always in the pod i bet she only dives into the pod when the active ship is about to be destroyed i dunno about all the activities the op listed but it would be a fun distraction
the only thing view wise id like to see is 1st person cockpit view as well as external id like to view the world from the inside of cockpit through the view screenyeah im lookin forward to amubaltion and walking round station sk
id like to see them unnerf the use of the word cockpit
hello you asked a question in the locked thread why did the missile thread get lockedi went for the assembly hall forum to find that the thread there was locked as wellso in reply to eliminator2 questionso to sum all this up i can state that in a lvl 3 mission i attempted and still trying to finish after 2UFFFD hours firing 100s of missiles at a single shipmy missiles here do a damage round 1014 per missile that with 2 ballistic control system ii fitted in lownpc frigates fire small missiles at me doing around 40 damage per missile cruisers shoot heavy missles and damage me around 150my verdict this isnt balanced gameplay this isnt even fun to playlets read one quote i borrowed from somewhere elseyes we just have had a radical revamp hereso what relevance do that have to eve please read on the next quotesound familar anyone well next quoteyes i have spent one amazing amount of playing time in eve especially considering that i have a day job and family i have a lot of knowledge of game mechanics a howto on configuring a ship for pvp and pve but now i cant even kill ships in a lvl 3 mission even less conclude itthe quotes i borrowed was of course not for eve at all but taken from star wars galaxies yet they sound hauntingly familiar to what we are seeing herethis is a disaster for a whole faction of players and no matter how many i am cooler than you for being amarr gallente or minmatar comments we will see posted it does not change the fact that caldari gameplay now is entirely impossible
forums suckignore this
the following thread was apparently closed when it was moved from one place to anotherbefore players begin thinking that ccp is deliberately stifling their response to a hated change you may wish to reopen this thread
what about a petition to reopen missile nerf thread just in case signed for me
dude your face from this day forward you shall be known as chaos incarnate the secondoh and to the op thumbs up
maybe make another one with actually suggestions to fix it like gallente did with the speed nerf thanx to bellum ofc we dint moan we gave ideas iv only read moaning so fare so i think ccp are sick and tired of whiners 
signed  please change this missile nerf back how it was before the upgrade btwsaw that you fixed bookmarks in corporate hangar array thx for that
just live with it now they will eventually raise the explosion velocity but the ones that get hit hard are the ones employing failtactics yes u can speedtank missiles well u can speedtank turrets aswell so stop sitting just around and spew missiles and actually move ur goddam ship use support of any kind be it webs targetpainters drones rigs or even corpmates the nerf affected 1v1 when does it really happen btw i think the impact on real gang pvp is neglectible u now have to use different sized vessels in gangs which brings back professions and stops the all bs gangs missiles are now inline pointedit typo
signedatleast ppl have rights to tell their opinions ffs
signednow that i have loged in to eve for the first time sens expantion i can say i quit eve good luck to you all and for devs do you have any fg ide how a missile works in the real world they dont do it by explotion they use speed
working on it
dude now thats conspiritorail  fight the machine
thread needs an unlockmissiles need reviewing not being able to deal full damage to an unfitted intended ship class cruise vs bc torp vs bs is just sillyshow me any other weapon system that does this
signedto be honest im starting to think all of these unnerf missilesnanowebs should be encompassed into one petition thread to undo quantum rises stat changes to all modules and ships whilst still keeping the new features certificates modules weapon linking orca etcsince we cant really have a unnerf missiles only type of request considering how ccp botches rebalancing on a largescale  i say just revert all stuff back to prequantum rise
thread must have been closed in errorit is now reopened

hi guys i am opening this debate in here to see if people have any support on the issue and to see if people can suggest different options to nerfingin addition i for one disagree with nerfing as a policy i think it ruins skill training and is a poor excuse for actualy developing the game further i want to know who else is in favour of stopping nerfsthese links are to my orginal argument against nerfing which encompases one of my suggested reasons for saying no to nerfspart 1
great idea
actually good job ccp
after evetv went under there was a massive massive petition to have them returned it got nowhere as a result the only way its coming back is if people are prepared to pay for it  either in the form of online payments as it was originally or in the form of an extra 2mo or whatever for a premium subscription
its me im perfection
oh hi guys whats goin on in this threadits been over 2 months since ive posted in this thread so i figured id give er a go once again anything changed mission runners still crying about being salvaged by us big bad ninjas
notoo busy crying about missileslucky you
i think exactly this qualifies her for being a good csm member i bet the vast majority of eve players do not fit anywhere but instead do everything a little bit maybe not all at the same time but definitely throughout the course of their careers the hardcore one aspect guys are usually very vocal but just as much a minority as they are biased
its working the way it is got to have some risk or else well high sec mining would be unbalanced
hello laiynathis is indeed a hot topic especially for those of us who spend most to all of our time in highsecurity space i think something should be done about the widespread canflipping but not about the process of canflipping itselfdeployable containers should take up less room in the cargohold about 500 m3 maybe then expand when anchored and allow for a great deal of stuff to be put in it these containers could only be accessed when anchored in space and would have a password as wellthe space inside the expandable container should be about 15k m3 about half of a jetcan but still enough to get you by for quite some time shooting it would trigger concord so itd still be a risk using one of these flimsy units in lowsecurity space over the more stable giant secure containersthe practice of canflipping is an old system and is working as intended there should be more options open for the enterprising miner but it shouldnt impede timehonored techniques used in the game
mr laebetrovo is a rare example of someone who can not only come up with diverse ideas about the problems of new eden but also listens to what other pilots suggest and how they sometimes dont agree with him that quality marks him as a prospective csm member i am sure that my vote is not wasted when i support him  and i do that with great pleasuregood luck my friend
i think scagga will make an excellent csm i have met him several times at various eve events and also know him through our connections in providencei would recommend him to anyone having problems making up their mind on who to vote for
got my votes
im sure vuk will make a fine csm member but more than that hes by far the best candidate for chairman so needs all the votes he can gethe has a special knack for dealing with people in a warm friendly and humourous way thats also incredibly uncompromising and hence effective in a csm setting he wont allow himself to be fobbed off or sidelined by ccp or by other csm members you cant distract or troll him online for instance he insists on knowing everybodys real name and calls people by their first name in corp chat on msn etc which helps disarm the anonymous asshatery that pervades much of the internethe calls a spade a spade and if someone tries to call it something different hell call them out simply and effectively without letting the debate get dragged down to petty biased personal levels judging by some of the problems that plagued the first csm situation i cant see anyone better than vuk to chair the second session and set a nobull business like tone
ill be out of town until sunday afternoon so if i dont answer your question immediately im sorry however i will get back to you as soon as i can
i met marcell through eve and we have become rl friends as well beside his obvious experience and expertise in the game i can also confirm his seriousness and dedication toward the csmmy best wishes and votes to him
i have been asked by a few people if they can contact me out of game if you are looking for contact information drop me an eve mail and we can set something up i learned my lesson on publicly putting my number out there p
i voted for you good to see someone honestly in this for eves betterment rather than to stroke their own ego good luck issler
lolz can this minmatar confirmdeny
lowsec has been a point of contention for quite some time with regards to its riskreward versus empire i am certainly aware of the issue and am looking for solutions i am certain ccp is as well though i do not know how close they would be to implementing iti will not be putting up a web page the forums have a means for the csm to communicate with itself and with the players keeping it all in the same place is importantif an outside medium is needed you could pm me on scrap heap challenge but aside from that we have the assembly hall and speakers forum i read this thread and those forums regularly and will not miss raised issueslearning skills should be removed from the game they are nothing but an extra skill grind for players whether or not ccp actually does it that is another issue with regards to combat effectiveness i would reduce the requirements for using t2 modules the skill advantages are significant enough my stances on entrenched assets are fairly well known
thank you and it certainly would be however with current mechanics it would be necessary to have that moon only in lowsec or 00 since individuals cannot be wardecd and this would leave highsec ps invulnerable fixing that is certainly something to look into but i am not sure how it can be done and still allow pos in highsec without ruining the concept of introductory corporations
id just like to say that regardless of personal feelings  and i certainly have those on this subject as alliance members can well attest  i dont think its particularly constructive for csm candidates to speak negatively about other csm candidates multiple people are going to be elected and if both you and someone you spoke ill of are elected that could negatively affect the csms ability to work as a team
hello allas a character i wouldnt shed a tear if both bob and the goons got into a battle and were wiped out i disagree with a lot of the things which both sides have done as they have both become too big and too proudas a player i understand that theyre just people playing this game for the same reason i am  to have fun while their technique might be pretty crude tbh its their right to play the game the way that they want within reason  actions such as the forum shutdown of a few years ago were wrongas a member of the csm i will take everybody for who they are  a player with a unique insight towards eve ill be the first to admit that the goons have more insight due to experience than i do in certain aspects of this game and i look forward to hearing what they have to say
1 goons are not out to destroy eve2 however last csm has shown that ingame politics can and do affect csm i would dare say the goon is not above this and neither is any of the others3 there is a valid concern but as has been said it is probably a minor one
id like that too actually
i think it is fascinating that a lot of people fear the goons yes over the years there have been goons who have done what could be considered foul things in eve and out of it do i condone those actions as a player and a goon no i dont but to judge the whole group based on the actions of a very few is pretty shallowbut avalloc a lot of goons took part in jihadswarm and killed miners all over empirethe whole jihadswarm fiasco wasnt a bad thing for eve imho it generated excitement and tension in a game we all play look at all the buzz which was created and the elevated activity among all payers when they heard about what was happening to highsec miners i wasnt personally out there shooting the miners but i was following the whole situation on the eveo forums i never want to see eve become boring and predictable do you the simple fact players could create such a huge event says a lot of good things about the game this isnt wow where you are handfed every freaking live event and plot twist this is eve online where the players drive the game a safe game will eventually lose its customers when they max out on their money and levels i dont see eve ever doing that and sure as hell wont let it while im around stll playing iti care about this game and the community that supports it if youre afraid of voting to support me because im a goon then your ignorance of exactly who i am and what i stand for is truly unfortunate for you not me
well said have to agree with you 100hopefully we may meet sometime soon arithron
its me im perfection
alright crossposting blog from before very late but better late than never lets just say that its a long story id prefer not to go intoon to business lets start with ways to improve industry and tradefirst pointcurrently a large amount of tech one modules are fairly useless to produce at least if you intend to sell them because no one really buys them there are various reasons for this i believe and it needs more investigation but i suspect that module drops off of npc ships are largely to blame this can be seen in a number of cases where the sell prices on the market for modules available only as loot meta level one and two items is less than the sell prices for the same type of item that was manufactured meta level zero varieties the sell prices for any manufactured item are of course limited by the mineral cost to produce it people selling looted items might not use this as a consideration thus while buy orders for all meta level zero items exist they are for prices below the mineral worth of items and sell orders for many meta level zero items have very low rates of sale one of the net effects of this is that manufacturing is somewhat more difficult to get into for a new player than combat or mining as one needs some experience and knowledge of how to read eves market to figure out what modules will actually provide a profit when manufactured and even then the competition for limited sales can be daunting for the budding industrialistthere is of course no easy solution for this problem simply turning off all loot is not really an option here it is a part of the game and while there is room for adjustment i do not believe such a big change should be made without very careful consideration of all the potential implications and a plan to deal with them however there is room for change as a possible  and i stress possible it needs a good deal of thinking through  solution or partial solution perhaps a reduction in the amount of meta level loot coupled with the ability to produce meta level items details obviously need to be worked out  would these be produceable from bpos buyable from npcs or would some form of invention be required special components or just minerals would you need skills to make them or not but that brings me to my next pointpoint twowe need more midlevel manufacturing opportunities  something between tech one and tech two manufacturing to some extent tech two component manufacturing helps its something you can do that requires more skills and resources than tech one manufacturing but not as much as tech two research and production requires production of meta level items has the potential to fill this nichepoint threespeaking of niches it would be nice to see a manufacturer be better able to build a brand identity now there are two problems with doing this currently one your items are exactly the same as someone elses that produces the same type of module you cant say we make the most reliable ones or we make the most powerful ones i remain cautiously optimistic about tech three items in regards to this but im not holding my breath second the market doesnt allow for people to choose who to buy from based upon whos selling it more on this farther down so id like to see some way to establish a brand identity and id like to see specialization rewarded perhaps more advanced industry skills that make it faster to build certain groups of modules maybe tech three will allow other things well seecontinued
point fourid like to explore the idea of having components for most all items even tech one items this could give newer manufacturers something to produce that would always be in demand be another thing people could specialize in and make manufacturing of tech one items slightly more interesting that just putting in minerals  you actually put in the parts to assemble the item which makes a little more sense but perhaps not  its an idea to explore not something that im completely sure of and maybe tech three will give something like that im waiting to seepoint fivethe market i think we should take a look at potential changes to the market the current market is fine for some things but it has some noticeable failings  you cant pick and choose who to buy from nor do you know who youre buying from making it impossible to boycott a specific company or be loyal to a specific brand name  in fact it makes the building of a brand name rather hard and makes advertising rather less important for many corporations speaking of which  id love to be able to rent ad space on the concord billboards it also encourages undercutting by 01isk in fact it makes anything else rather dumb in most cases obviously not in all cases  but in most personally id like for someone to buy my goods because my goods are the best or because i have a good relationship with the customer or something like that rather than because i managed to lower my sale order or raise my by order by a tiny amount more recently that anyone elseid like to take this opertunity to thank all the people that have given me support its very heartwarming to see all the support coming together from friends corpmates aquantances and strangers thank you and i hope that i will be able to represent you and live up to the confidence you have placed in me
redlions post almost every canidate was against decreasing the gradient between highsec and lowsecwhyankh is only one in favor of that which is oddly the only canidate that seems not to be a rabid pvp houndone delegate suggest moving to better roids which is fine until you get to ones only found in 00and lets face it a hulk mining is a wet dream for most in 00another states that the roids are worthless enough in 00if so what difference would it make other than not giving pvpr the easy killsi am not suggesting that you should be able to fly to a belt and find morphitejust be able to find a step or two bettereve is a great game but definately puts builders at a disadvantage from roi return on investment
because right now the ores you find in highsec are better than the ores you find only in lowsec this is obviously wrong  its not highsec mining that needs a boost but lowsec mining lowsec mining is rather more risky than highsec mining so it should be a good deal more profitable if it were actually worth it then perhaps people would fight over lowsec territory for mining trying to keep it safe from pirates and clear of rivals creating a much more dynamic interesting and rewarding situation than what currently existsbasically lowsec is bad enough compared to highsec as it is the difference doesnt need to be made even worse besides    unless you put nullsec ores in highsec its hard to find better ore considering that highsec ores are better than i think all but one of the lowsec ores
as you know eve used a riskreward model without going into any ridiculous amount of detail those two words riskreward should answer your question agents npcs moon minerals trading profit marginsthese are examples of areas that are consistent with having a gradient between high and low sec and allowing an active enterprising player a chance to make headway against someone who does not want to take any risks why should minerals be an exceptionas for your reference to ankh ive noticed that your interesting posting history so is running the 00 cosmo complexes for others or owning stations or mining dysprosium having dreams encourages people to adapt and innovate and appreciate hard fought for goals this is a good thing in my opinionplease produce evidence all youve said there is based on opinion which is not conducive to a serious discussionfalse i know groups of people in t1 production with a weekly profit margin of 175 on a 2 billion isk investment i have also had opportunities to make 10 profit on a drake bpo i used to own meanwhile i am involved in trade and can make 50100 profits with investments as small as 25m
first how do you mean wet dream do you mean it is something miners strive for or a ripe target for pirates in both cases i would agree but in the latter isnUFFFDt any solo target in pvp space far from backup a ripe target if you are in 00 you most likely are a part of a corp and should have backup anyways yeah a lone miner is a pretty target but 5 hulks 2 haulers with full sec detail becomes a bit less enticing especially when you consider that odds are most hulk pilots can come back in a combat ship pretty quicklythat said i think there needs to be more of a boost to low sec mining sure you can make a little more money but if you are alone why bother risking your beautiful hulk when you can just mine trit half afk and still make good money especially when in empire you dont have to worry about refining it or getting it back into market areasitUFFFDs not a rabid pvper issue by any stretch of the imagination 00 is one of eves unique selling points and it should be more populated than it is
because in order to draw more people into the other areas of play there needs to be corresponding reward over the riskdecreasing the gradient means less increased reward for the risk increasethis means people will go to empire and stay there and not leave the game resolves around conflict and that is bad for the game
there are allready high end ores in high security space you just need to find them
i dont necessarily think that there needs to be loads of good ores in highseci still want mining to receive a boost in the way of larger asteroids so they dont get eaten in one cycle and more asteroids in a belt so the system wont get stripmined in a matter of hours preferably in combination with more hidden sitesbelts that people have to scan forbut most of all im in favor of a total overhaul of the mining system with game mechanics that reward and interest players that pay attentionmining needs love after all the mechanics are very very boring and have not changed since eves conception
i believe the quality of ore should clearly increase the sec status decreases 00 should be where the most of the best ore is found right now i think it is hard to make a case for low sec mining over high sec ive often run the numbers and there just isnt much money to make in low sec even though the risks are much greaterwhat i would love to see is all ores available in all sec levels but as a rare find the chance of finding a rare roid would increase as the sec level drops not enough of the rare ore to change the value that the lower sec systems offer but as a way to make mining more interesting maybe a skill that increases your chances of getting a rare roid an alternative might be trace elements in the current ore that you could extract based on a skilljust a thoughtissler
do you think that there arent enough hidden belts and do you think that there isnt enough ore to go aroundwhat abouthidden beltst2 mining laserscrystalsmining gang linksrorqualsi think mining has changed a lot since eve started
first a hulk alone is dead in 00 second riskreward i understand the risk to mine in 00 to get mins you cannot get in empire is not right imhofirst miners contend with rat spawns that can take out a hulk fairly quickthen have to contend withpvp aspect in 00 pvpr only have to watch other pvprsthe rat spawns are easy to handle and are no challenge for all but the most new pvp playerthink the exploration mining sites in empire should have even the rare and ultra rare mins to even things up
ok pixel and all othersif you think its not a issuewhich i doif only if csm to me is suppose to be a active crosssection of players and play styles so that everyone is representedif you vote them in thats your choice and i hope you get the representation that you want from itdisclaimerthis is not a antigoon thread it would exist if it was any any alliance i have no problem with goons actually the burn quite nicely and set me on fire equally often
if you dont want too many goons vote for someone elseand ask yourself why no other alliance is represented with any reasonable amount of candidatesis there even a single bob candidate
pretty sure the csm is a joke thats already happened
this sophie character certainly seems to be an industrialist to be reckoned with1 vote
i swear im a perfectly honest businessman yep nothing to see here move alongwhile not a pirate myself one of my priorities for my campaign is lowsec and all who live there and encouraging more people to live there and i know at least one pirate corp is supporting me in my bid for csm so while not a pirate personally i do hope that ill do a good job of representing them
id have to agree with arithron booms are pretty not a wastethat aside i think that while this would be kinda nice arithron does have a point that they would unbalance things somewhat    unless perhaps they became wrecks with a very high difficulty to salvage so it took a long time to get anything out of them or just dropped metal scraps    hmm it would be nice to have them have some other use besides looks but    not really a priority when you consider how much work it would be to balance it
1 should a player be able to launch pos for self or after launching assign towermodules to specific playerssounds like an interesting idea but we never had problems because of the lack of this feature 2 should players be able to use their own hangar when manufacturing and researching at a poswell if they had an own hangar then sure yes 3 should new industry be made fuel rods to make pos refuel easierdepends on what you mean if you refer to fuel rods eg composite material containing all key commodities required to run a pos than yes i am okay with that it is just a pain in the ass that you have to coordinate the purchase and distribution of so many different goods on the other hand i really do not want pos logistics made technically any easier than it is today in my opinion pos logistics should be more difficult and more risky than it is today to compensate that the number of posses you need to feed could be reduced standings4 should it be easier to share standingsyes but we do not need ccp for achieving this it is supported by the api so players can create tools that support sharing this stuff5 should it be possible for a corporation to chose to apply alliance standings so dockingpos use alliance standingyes 6 should standing list be expandedno ccp said it would create a lot of lag i hate lag we did have to juggle a little bit when getting closer to the limit but the ability to set corp standings towards alliances helped a lot 7 should alliances be able to set standings to players and vice versayes as long as it does not create more lag universe8 should all of 00 be conquerableno 9 should the universe be expandedno pvp10 should rokh powergrid be boosteddont see a reason why it should 11 should missiles be more useful in fleet fightsi have not participated in a fleet fight since the speed nerf so i cannot tell you that however our initial tests show that missiles are quite alrightindustry12 should ccp boost hulk cargo capacity by 2000 m3no i do not see why more afking people would help this game forward instead mining should be made less boring so people do not start afking at all something interactive maybe 13 should t2 bpo me be nerfed to 0 and invented bpc gain positive material levelnope they are fine as they are 14 should hi sec asteroid belts be boosted no 15 should a pos be able to refine alloysore at 100no posses should remain inferior to stations 16 should it be possible for alliance member to use another corporations copying and inventing labsyes more pos17 should it be possible to charge a fee when players are using jump bridgesyes 18 should a pos ai get boostedyesfactional warfare19 should fw start actually having any impactdefinitely 20 should corporations in alliances be able to participate in fwyes however there should be requirements that ensures that only the corps that are really dedicated for a given faction can enteralliance21 should alliances get medalsi think this issue is kind of irrelevant but why not yes to the very bottom of the development list 22 should alliances able to change the support percent required for executor by vote that require the same amounti do not think that there should be any automated method of preventing takeovers alliance leaders should be wise enough to make sure that things like this do not happen
if you want change sometimes you have to force it need more people to dedicate themselves in getting rich by stealing loot and salvaging missioners wreck with the missile nerf perhaps missiosn wont be worth doing at all anymore and thats when ccp will notice
signedwas recently in a couple wars had to pop the wrecks because of the scavenger frigs running around to steal the loot from my war targets npc wrecks belong to the player so why shouldnt another players wreck belong to that player if they killed them on a realistic level there is no difference between an npc and a player fundamentally sure but theyre both targets youre allowed to shoot at the npc though not a real player his wreck would still belong to him and his corporation which means regular players should just get flagged to that npc corp for stealing from them
please fix this so i can blast anyone stealing from my wrecksalso if they are salvaging from them as these are my scrap parts
open a new vote because those who voted before you did so for an entirely different reason otherwise you negate the ability to make this vote count

now if the frig would be webbed down to like 300ms and you would be sitting in an astarte you would not even hit him difference is that you are using medium guns  cruisersized  no bs class weapons just fyiif missiles get unnerfed they need to change turrets accordingly or webs

currently missiles cannot even hit for full damage against ships of their own size class moving at unboosted speeds and lose the bulk of their effectiveness against ships of their size class moving at unnanoed afterburner speeds this is ridiculous i full support the principle of the changes to missiles to increase the differentiation between ship classes but this implemented is badly thought out please revise it so that missiles can be effective against ships of their own class
i support this thread in its entirety i have been robbed of my gameplay and 8 months of training time unacceptable period i will not continue to play support or payfor this game if this is not changed to a more resonable system

thank you ccp for reopening this topici may fly amarr ships and i may have the ability to avoid this nerf to a great degree but the entire concept of a nerf on this scale is completely against any sane customer relations policyi do fly a purifier and i do use cruise missile launchers on my apoc both of these things which i trained for are now close to useless the entire purpose of putting cruise missiles on my apoc was for kineticexplosive damage as an option now my lasers do nearly the same damage as cruise missiles even on targets which are highly thermem resistant how many days of training have now been made utterly meaningless i can still use my cov ops v skill for scanning but the purifier is now just a 00  lowsec taxisigned
agreedthe goal was to change speed to bring ships down to a velocity that allowed positive engagement on both sides especially for missile users who were distinctly feeling left out of pvp by the large simply because they could not damage anything they hit but with quantum fail not only are speeds reduced but the ability to slow ships down was likewise reducedthe net resultnothing changedand then missiles were rendered so much worse than they were prior to quantum fail that missile users are left even further behind the curve explosion velocities should have been increased not decreasedand no i dont use missiles as a primary weapon because theyve been terribly subpar since the introduction of explosion velocity that was a godsend but failed to factor for the steady increase in speed i prefer every other weapon system though granted artillery is just as bad if not worse

signednerf is too strong 
signed  letting my accounts expire now that ive wasted months and rl  on millions of sp for missles i think the devs should spend time adding new elements to the game that dont suck instead of constantly rethinking the mistakes theyve already made the only thing worth seeing in qr would have been storefronts and product branding now pushed back instead we get nerfs everywhere certs new players still have no idea how to use this system old ones recognize the point but dont need it because they already have evemon which is far betterhull tankingreally you had so much time to mess around with this dev cycle that you could waste it on that horrid attempt at humor medals and a drone window that doesnt disapear when we dock i wasnt sure why i was paying for the game before and now im not its been a real pleasureoh wait maybe i should stay because i can align the hud to top or perhaps because aa is supported ingame the new graphics with skyboxs using horrible levels of d3dx texture compressiongg to us i guesswe wasted our money guess ill play l4d until next patch and take another look

well i will have to try and adapt and overcome but i agree ive never agreed with the missile damage nerf as its always been nonrealistic but then again when has some aspects of eve been realistici would have preferred missile speed nerfed with the larger missiles making them harder to hit a small tgt ie the bigger the punch the missile is capable of the closer you have to get to the target and mayber the slower the missile gos but damage reduced because the tgt is smaller 0oi agree the missile damagespeed and distance needs re addressing but to more realistic statistics
not signed please do not reverse the missile boost

since you are not stupid i have to consider that you do that on purposeim still asking my self why because you are part of the dev team because you want to be hire from ccp those are just stupid questions could you please answer thiscould you please provide evidence of the boost of missiles
hell nothe changes are good people just need to rethink their old ideas about missiles
missiles pre qr were underpowered post qr they are close to be uselessas you can see i rethink my old ideas about missiles
definitely not signedlarge missile ability vs small ships is now similar to that of large turrets and has been increased vs larger targetsif you think missiles arent balanced then you need to accept that the review of weapons tracking and combat preqr was unfinished and that they all need a looksee including interrace and intraclass balance eg torp raven vs blaster thronif you think turrets are fine then missiles are tooif you think that missiles are unbalanced because of anything to do with missions or npcs you are wrong because pve is not relevant to balance
with pleasure i am a 37mill sp character completely specialised in caldari missile spamming i have investigated the new missile damage formula extremely thoroughlyunder the previous mechanics it was trivial for cruisers and below to avoid 99 of missile damage simply by hitting mwd and going faster then explosion velocity  2x falloff precision lights excluded the high speeds of those ships meant that range advantage of longrange missiles was fairly meaningless so longrange missile users were unable to defend their range advantagewith the new mechanics missile damage linked to sig radius far better making mwds a 500 selfpainter missile damage against fast mwding targets is vastly improved immensely increasing hms ability to inflict damage this in conjunction with the slowing of all ships has vastly increased the longrange missile users abilities to maintain range and deliver meaningful dps across the battlefield also missile users now have options for increasing damage against fast targets such as painters and crash enabling a greater range of tacticsshortranged missiles  hams and torps  are unchanged in practice as they required your target to be webbed beforehand anyway to stop it simply mwding away and laughing at you rage hams still do full damage to webbed abing bc torps still do full damage to painted webbed bs  mods that were required beforehand in fact theyre really received a stealth buff as their ac and blaster counterparts now find it harder to get to optimal and the range advantage of torps is more meaningfulspecific exampleshm drake boosted as it can now hit fast targets for meaningful damage and defend its range advantageham drake boosted because of increased rage damage and the greater difficulty of its acand blasterfit counterparts in getting to optimalaml cerberus boosted as now it is deadly to all interceptors rather than just nonpimped oneshml cerberus boosted as it can now deliver massively more damage to mwding cruisers enabling it to defend its range advantage and even meaningfully damage interceptors its ability to damage falcons is unchanged as its ability to damage tackled targets of its size or greatertorp raven boosted because no additional tackle needed in your gang i dont regard the torp raven as a sensible solo ship nor that it should be one and the greater difficulty of its acand blasterfit counterparts in getting to optimalproblemscruise its pvp role was one of antisupport this has been hit although note that the nanoed support in question could have previously avoided pretty much all cruise damage simply by hitting mwd a feat that is now impossiblesbs although they can now damage interceptors at speed their ability to instapop frigates  which is really the entire point of the class  has been hit note however that this is really a sb problem rather than a missile problem and that ccp has said they are looking at reworking sbsrockets well possibly theyre ok if you can web your target and have a significant range advantage over acs and blasters a range that is easier to maintain with nerfed webs but frigates with their limited slots have difficulty fitting a web so this may require looking at im not sureperceived problems that really arent problemsomg afterburners will not be used commonly used on bcs or bs and their ability to mitigate missile damage is massively reduced as soon as they get webbed  which is easily done by a mwding shipomg i cant hit small ships as easily neither can turrets in general  certainly not within web rangein short the combat utility of missiles has been in general vastly improved
this man speaks the truth i can do nothing more than urge the op to read and understand
ok the sooner you people get this through your head the better its not about large missiles vs small ships its about heavy cruise and torps doing accurate damage to bcs and bigger got it now its been stated many times wake the  up and no combat utility vs large targets has not been improved
me applauds and agrees with jade constantine and the individual who he quoted
okay after the patch i logged in to contine on my level 4 missionsand i was amazed at the changes yall made same mission ive done before without any problems and within 30 seconds i almost lose my raven cause i couldnt kill the freaking scramble frig both my accounts will be cancelled what a waste of my money
light drones are for frigs always have been why would you waste expensive cruise missiles on frigs or torps which is even more silly
its like milk is a drug and my droogs have been taken away
i prefer speaking about missiles that i really use a lot torpcruisefacti can post kills of nano cruiser vagaishtarrapier died against my cruise raven what you miss here is the old webber power with the old missile formulain qr its impossible for a cruise raven to reach 100 damage against abmwd speed tanking cruiser using 12 or even 3 meds read here med slot from support ships if you preferim not telling it was easy killing nano just that it was possible without blob in qr is impossible for a cruise raven  nerfcruise missiles are less effective against frig  bc  nerfalso for sb it was a flyable ship now its just a lol ship against any frigcruiserbcbsetc  nerftorps bs ab speed tanking is very powerful more than preqr mwd bs speed tank bccs can not be threaten by torps any more  nerfabout the stealth buff bss had max speeds higher pre qr but to mitigate speed nerf close range bss have received more agility to reach top speed early also torps had 10 range reduction in a typical 1020km distance situation it doesnt have any impact  just a fair modificationhm drake was alrdy able to do that with nano with just 1 support ship with just 1 web fitted how many meds of your team do u need now for full dmg now more than 1  nerfham drake does more dmg to bs only t2 rage less dmg to bc or smaller for t1t2 ammo  mmm i dunno t2 rage can compensate the less dmg to bc and smallerwe have to see how many pilots will use mwding cruisers now ab is by far better to speed tank also your example is not speaking about ewar necessary to delivery massively more damage 3meds2rigboostert2ammo pre qr one webber was ok for 100 dmg or am i wrongits your opinion about a not known trend for a short range bcbs i guess that we can see at least 50 using mwd and 50 using ab new scrambler bonus  ab tank  lower cap for ab for medium range bcbs better to orbit at optimal with ab than using a mwd and in any case if mwd is fitted also for medium range the new formula allows high dmg reduction only pulse mwd onoff dmg mitigation with this technique is close to ab speed tankingwhere is the missile buff
way to completely miss the point i was making about turret vs missile balance and yes vs larger targets has been massively improved hint rages were useless now theyre not
part of a nerf against missiles hitting small stuff was needed thats not a problem when a bs wo an ab or mwd can slowboat and greatly reduce damage to a t1 torp let alone even larger reduction if that bs fits 1 abmissiles for the most part have been a large laughing stock of the pvp world finally the torp raven was given its boost when they changed torps around then they decide to gimp explosion velocity greatly so with this patch and now unless they are idiots and stay at 0ms there is a large amount of dmg reduction done against the same size hull your engaging inguess my shield tank now has to be gimped even farther to now accomodate mwd 2x web 1x tp web nerf and point out of 6 mid slots that leaves you 1 for tank tp drones hardly do enough to make a difference i would use webbing drones except for the lul 75m3 drone bay only worse bs drone bay being the 50m3 of the rokh and its blaster purpose is lulz and now its only a sniper shipthough its main rolelooking at it from a standpoint that everyone fits mwds is wrong granted it might be that way in a 00 world but in a lowsechighsec pvp environment fits can changewell back to armor tanking gunnery missile shield ship fail again thank you ccp and screw pve you can use a domi just as easy as raven and the raven works almost as well it just takes a few min more to finish the missions

what es me off here is all the turret users telling the missile users to stop whining before even considering what turrets are capable off and what missiles werent even before the patch caldari ships always have had better tanking abilities than other races for 2 reasons 1 because its quicker to get to the tanked part of the ship ie the sheild 2 because missiles although were good at consistant damage always have do lower damage than other ships eg sniping tempest can do 2000 dmg when fit correctly sniping apoc can do 1200 dmg when fit correctly with tach 2s the dmg is lower but the rof is higher than tempest gallante do massive dmg with blasters at close range which torpedos can now never match and would have to sacrifice tanking ability to fit a web and painter but a blasterthon wouldnt in the time i have been playing caldari have had many big nerfs1splash dmg removed2ability to use cruise missiles in seige launchers3missiles were completely reworked in cold war july 2005 which introduced a massive nerf which required the training of several new skills to accomodate the sig radiusflight timevelocityrof changes4torps given a massive reduction in range5now another complete rework causing them to become the worst race in game and the training of more skills for modules which when fitted ruin the ships tanking ability why was it needed its argued that the speed nerf would have given missiles users an advantage however it actually gave all races an advantage because no matter what you fire with its easier to hitdmg a slower moving targetbut webbers got nerfed so this doesnt affect missiles then so instead of balancing missiles the devs completely reworked them so caldari pilots do 6070 of the dmg they did before and thats providing the target sits still when all they had to do is rebalance the current formula by making sure missiles were doing the same dmg after the patch

sigh you can lead a horse to water

war decs in current state are broken its too cheap to declare and maintain war  in essence high sec is no longer high security it is now a newb corp turkey shoot for every joe and every griefer corp that doesnt have the balls to go into low sec or 00 for some real pvp with the introduction of cheap war decs  newb player corporations are becoming extinct imho  needs major fixes ccp  and i agree on introducing victory conditions and mechanics for either side to end the war by some means these cheap war decs are ruining any hope of newb corps to grow and enjoy the game ive seen 3 corps fold this week alone and several players quit due to this broken system and the constant back to back war decing by multiple griefer corpsplease fix this soon ccp as this has done more harm than good for the game and you will see poor retention numbers for newb players as time goes on in essence there is no such thing as high sec space anymore
that just about 90 accurately sums it up
no excuse now give us a skill queue p
neededthe game is so skill intensive perhaps a little too much but ccp needs your money and you dont get any kind of experience points mostly i train log skills while logged out but some unexpected workfamily issue can make you lose a day or a week sometimesnow that certificates exist even though they are a bit broken they are the obvious place to put the skill queue interface better yet let corps define their own ceritifcates based on what skills they think really matter rather than ccp  i mean who uses multitasking when relatively few ships will let you have more than 6 targets anyway most people dont need it but apparently its a core skill now sure
yeah im sure that ccp will be all fine with letting a 3rd party access their db
posting to show my supportgive skillqueue now
ill add my name to this petition a skill queue would be beneficial a cheap alternative would be the ability to automatically continue training the next level of current skill this could be a skilltraining setting perhapsor and heres something to make certificates perhaps more worthwhile to advanced playersallow the ability to enroll for a certificate youd have to ensure you have all the skillbooks of course but if you start training the certificate it would automatically queue those skills for you till the cert was done if this idea was somewhere in pages 3 thru 12 on this forum i apologize i didnt read every post on every page

no excuses ccp

no no no noplayers missing some training time is one of the best ways for younger active players to catch up to older players skill queues will stagnate the game
well weapon grouping kinda demolishes that argument since they say its less stress on the database
players need not concern themselves with what they think ccp will say about database issues if you let that be a concern for every idea you have well never get anywheresupported fitting and hud module layout templates please
supported although the database would get trashed
rethink and redo imo the current situation is unacceptable missiles as a whole require atleast a gang of 4 to be somwhat effective and only once the target is webbed and painted
just say no to nano nerfccp doesnt care and are hostile to paying customers
this nerf was necessary most of nano users i know are agree with that
it looks like i see a thread for the people who are for the nano nerf why dont you folks that are dead to me for it even coming into this thread to waste our time making a post go fly your new crappy ships that move at snails pace and dont do any damage and dont bother posting in the thread that the majority is for reversing this patch not an expansion which we begged them not to do after were told in the live dev blog our opinion doesnt matter
against
skill queue wanted plz to help with those 17 h skills 
god they need to wake the f up and start listening to the playersi know of a couple of other mmos coming out which are prob gonna give eve a run for its moneythey keep fkng aroundthey are gonna lose clients give the skill queue but knowing ccp theyll do something to mess it up look just give the queue a time table of a week after that let the last skill trained train to lvl 5 once thats done stop the training and of course if the account is inactive then stop the skill training wasnt the thing you guys were complaining about was people making alts training them and not paying now we are all paying for the game let us train our sugar honey iced tea i should be able to queue for at least a week and come back and have things training at most a month why because i paid for it and thats what you were complaining about now theres nothing to complain about
i said it before and i will say it again you dont need a skill to fix a game design issue there are enough skills in the game as it is just set the timer lower and be done with it ive polled folks and 12 hours seems to be the average answerset it to 12 hours or some other nice round number and be done with itperiodkaiden
quantum rise comes  and theyre removed from headsand that is all
makes a lot of sense
thanks while i agree that there might be some things that may need to be ironed out ie separate successfailure rates per salvager while grouped i think its something that must be examinedccp  i would personally throw my hat in the ring if youre looking for an ambassador to the ninja salvaging community as a whole to discuss the nuances and requirements for this modification
if payout is only a fraction of the damage inflicted theres not much incentive to risk your own ship trying to collect the bounty either unless you are talking implants rather than ship damagelike the contract idea hate the skill idea why does every last thing have to have a skill associated with it i start to wonder if ambulation will require a walking skill tentative support
everyone is a passive target when enough people are shooting gaining advantage by bringing more people is fine but enforcing that advantage is notif a guy generates a lot of bountiesie one per kill right generated by the pirate and they are contracted then there may be a lot of hunters but the other way around where many hunters can get the same bounty is not reasonable it enforces an imbalance with a single action remember any system that we implement is going to be a brake on pirate activity we have to be careful that it is not too much of a brakeyou have to in order to prevent fraud the payout needs to be an amount lower than the platinum insurance on the ship otherwise the pirates alt takes the contract and blows up the pirate and collects the bounty as profit

i agree with op like most othersalthough i am sure that ccp has some concerns about it that we arent thinking up on our own here were using group think ideology where other possibilities arent even consideredkicker of the shebang maybe ccp has a reason why they are hesitant towards implementing this but at the same time why not let us know what is holding them back so that we may make possible suggestions ccp your players want to help you
and btw forgot to signthere
since the qr expansion i have seen lots and lots and lots of whining about skills being useless because of this that or the other whether people adapt or not is up to them but i had an idea what if ccp introduced an instation service that would allow players to reallocate skill points obviously ccp would have to have a fee associated with it say 5mil per skill or something to keep people from completely respecing overnight ccp could limit it to one skill a week or so once a skill has been completely unlearned the player will not receive the skill book back if the player wishes to relearn a skill previously unlearned he will have to buy the skill book all over again same goes for new skills the player will still be required to buy the neccessary skill books before the sp can be reallocated from one skill to another i am sure there are other aspects that can be fine tuned but i wanted to put forth this general idea to the community i know other mmorpgs have a similar system in place if ccp were to implement it i think it would give players a chance maybe expensive to try different roles and aspects of eve without having to start from scratch
i must support my own topic mainly because i dont have much else to do right now and i also think this would be a nice feature for ccp to implement  cheers
noif you dont like the skills you have simply train some new ones
this sir speaks the truth
again you forget and yet you blindly propose like every other foolish lets unlearn type proposalthe bulk of skills out there require prereqs that must be met before you can use them not including fittings and other aspects of your ship configsif you get people who start futzin around with there skills your going to have a hell of a mess on your handsas for the caldari whiners out there they need to buck up and just adaptthis also causes major issues with the fact that your so called proposed feeeven at the limitation of a timer would cause a massive issue with the fact that some of us put some hard earned time into those skills and its just not fair for us if you can learn one skilland a pile of little skills only to learn an another skill that takes several months only a few hundred million iskin short a very loudand emphatic hell no
i like the current system it punishes people who mindlessly train for fotm which is great
qftmath fail skills train at the same rate whether youre training level 1 or level v youd heave to learn a lot of little skills at level 1 to trade them in for a quarter or half a million or more needed to get something else to level v as in hundreds or thousandsthumbs up for idea with some potential
like i said in my opening post the idea needs to be refinedi am a caldari pilot currently skilled for missiles but i am not worried about the changes i will figure out a way to adapt like alot of the much older players had to during the years they have been on i also look forward to cross training into gallente and minnie maybe i will even wonder into amarr one of these days it is one of the aspects i enjoy in evei also agree that planning your training is very important so you dont waste sp on things you wont use personally i didnt do that and i trained all kinds of crazy things pwhat if the system was implemented but everytime you unlearned a skill not only does it cost isk but the player would also lose half of the skills learned sp due to scotty pressed the wrong button or something i agree it shouldnt be a scape goat for ill thought out skill training but for those who really want a change of pace or want to unlearn useless things they trained as noobs and put the sps toward something useful i think the players would like that
im not quite sure what i forgot i am sure you will enlighten me in some further post however this is not just a lets unlearn proposal i think that unlearning a skill should have a serious drawback maybe something like what i proposed in my previous post maybe more stern like i said it shouldnt be a scapegoati am not even sure why you brought up prereqs everyone knows this and this proposal wouldnt effect this in any way unless someone tried to unlearn a skill that was a prereq for something else they plan on keeping in which case you would not be allowed to unlearn it as far as ship fittings changing skills to support different fittings would force the user to learn to use those new fittings which could be amusing for some players frustrating for othersas far as futzini find this word amusing around with skills i agree that it could make a mess of the server but with some of the random stuff ccp comes up with i dont think it would be to out of place p seriously though you are right it could be a dbscripting nightmarei know all about hard earned iskies spent to train skills i just bought and trained skills for caps and bought a phoenix last week curious to see how the missile patch will work with it but its all goodanyway back to the subject since there will be a ton of scripting and dbserver side work that would go into this i would think ccp would come up with some ingenious way to keep that from happening maybe put a limit like you can only transfer sp from one rank 5 skill to another rank 5 skill this would generally limit a player from taking a ton of rank 1 skills and transferring them into a higher ranked skill like cap ship or awuand last please keep this thread civilized no need to bash each other call names or whine about who got nerfed more then the other i have yet to see the changes with this latest expansion due to me being deployed but i am not going to be whining about it when i do finally see them i will just train different skills and adapt i have the basic skills for minnie and gallente so i am not to worried edit for spelling i may have missed some its been a long day and i havent had my coffee p
i listened to the fanfest 2008 dev panel audio file uploaded to eve files i believe it was tyraxx that asked the devs about the alliance tournament as there had been no news about its statusso i took a couple days to mull over it all and now ive decided its time to make some points about the whole thingi can understand what ccp is saying in that the costs were quite large so cut out a large portion of it dont pay for the evetv people to go to iceland and drink granted i like the show and everything but if u have to cut something thats where it should start cutting the whole tournament i think should be the last resort id be happy to simply watch it maybe a little higher quality client so we can read the pilot names etc with eve sound effects only we have the irc channel on coldfront we have the forums and etcan ingame mechanic is nice for small corp tourneys or etc but the alliance tournament has a magnitude to it its epic it matters an arena system is a poor substitute and i like it for friends to play around in or etc but i would really like to see the alliance tournament continuethe reason players new and old flock to this event isnt becuase of the flasy animations super important commentary or anything else its an epeen contest between the major entities of the game its not just a tournament its community event where all the aspects and parts of the community come togetheri really hope that ccp can come to a compromise on the issue i mean granted there are cuts im sure that could be made its entirely to much apart of the community to let fade to black forever please ccp rethink this make sure to click support people thanks for reading

ive posted several places advocating we keep this valuble part of the community if cost is the huuuge problem we dont nesc need 2 studios and like a dozen hosts keep the feed commentary have someone in iceland or already working for ccp as a general host and use more player made commercials for filler i like the spectacle and granduer but as mcfly said the action itself is where most of the value is
hi ive been playing eve now a good length of time and would like to put forward a idea that i havent seen fixed or attempted yeti would like to suggest that blueprints look different when they are bposor bpcsatm when u have a good sizeable collection or make copys to sell it can be a right pain with endless clicking to find the bposmaybe a set colour for copys or even a small c in the corner it would not take muchor are ccp hoping to widdle all those t2 ship bpos away at any chance by peoples mistakes
btdtalready proposed and turned downyes its a good ideabut i read somewhere that the dbs current designstructure would prohibit such a thing from taking place at least thats what the devs said
point the nano nerf was supposed to eliminate largeish ships going at insane speeds i had no strong opinion but i could see the point cruisers at 8000ms was sort of wackyhavent flown with blasters for a long time but finding my battleship crawling along at 112ms yesterday wasnt fun especially not on top of all the other changesas for the web nerf it might make sense if it was related to mass or so but you can still web a battleship or whatever with a frigate which i have always thought was stupid
as little as i use blasters i am forced to support this thread simply because of the changes that now make blasters a dangerously impractical system ie web changesscramblers need to be extended in range and strength if theyre expected to be used at all currently all a mwd ship has to do is the same thing theyve always done run to the edge of disruptor range and orbitcurrent changes  no change at all everything does just as it has always done in the past just at a slower speed
nerfed missiles sucks i see the reason for having cruise missiles and others not do big damage to small targets but srsly less than 10 damage on a frigate with correct damage type and 3 bcu target painter works but its not a godlike module and certainly there are no comparison towards other races all against the missile nerf check here
are you blind sircan you not see the topic thats already in progress over thisi suggest you file an appointment with the eye doctor
obvious troll is obviousafter those skills i bet you could reach a new set of learning skills super premium ultra learninguhuhu learning skills just should be removed completely and either adjust the stats either x amount for start for everyone to balance out the learning difficulities perception 3 is a bit killer or adjust the skill learning based on the base stats of the race and people who had sps in learning skills would be credited those sps to allocate them skillskills of their choosingwould give the older farts some ooh nice i could pick up this and this too now and for the new pilots they could start following the certification paths that they have now to give some direction where to aim with or do like mmm a guy i know and spread skillpoints all over the categories and actually play the game instead of sitting in the station watching the learning skills to go up for next 1 monththe attribute implants could be thrown away too and those slots could populate some more appealing relevant to the game implants but why not keep them then you have a choice to actually waste either money sell your services etc to receive actual benefit to learning and lose them when you are podded but it would be a real choice in the game by game items which could be lost yeah you could lose the learning skills too by not upgrading your clone and get popped againwould make more sense if you try to learn some electronics skill well you could but not enough understanding in electronics would make it slower but yet the electronics skill would be useful toothe learning boosters well the statistics would see a quite big raise in drug abusers and druglords would be the king of isk just my few cents in the matter j
there is nothing like logging in and seeing that you have reached level 4 cloaking after a weeks hard work of waiting heming and hawingand then you get this thrill of excitement now you can use covert ops cloaking fieldsfor me this in a day or 2but know this now i can sneak up on your  and uncloak right next to you and youd not know itpowerful toolto reduce training skill times would cause mass chaoswhy people cant see this means only one thing deafblindgreedyand selfishgood things come to those who waitdont turn eve into wow
not to hash out the specifics here but there are a significant number of tech ii items that are requested for inclusion into eve ive just read through the eve fitting tool props to gripen to compile a short list of items that do not currently have a tech ii option availableelectronic warfare drones analyzer codebreaker and salvager modules scanrecon probe launchers tractor beams interdiction sphere launchers warp disruption field generators auxiliary power controls remote hull repair systems gas cloud harvesters ice harvesters siege modules bomb launchers doomsday devices lol civilian modules uh maybe not and gang assist modulesas mentioned i dont want the vote to reflect a request for tier ii variants on every group above but i want it to reflect the need to at least discuss the creation of these items a lot of these have been available for too long without a tech ii variant availablepersonally i would like my salvager ii module as soon as possible but ill be happy if this vote spurs someone to at least start talking about it
i wholeheartedly endorse this product andor service
i really have no problem with the 5 mil isk creation fee for corporation awards however to charge me another 5 million isk to issue my award for my corp to one of my corp members is highway robbery and ruins a particularly creative and useful idea this is a small thing yet it works out to be a huge detractor from the game and places the devs in a petty and grubbing light hell these guys make the isk there is really no credible reason to steal it from its own players can i get a thumbs up on this one
if there is no monetary cost for awarding these things then they become worthless
id say the worth is in the reason its given for not in the fact it costs 5 millionif you where in a corp and got the best corporate pvper medal together with 19 other guys i doubt if youd feel any worth in the fact it cost someone 5 million to make your copyhowever assuming you deserved it only youbeing member of a large corporation getting that same medal from your ceowithout any costs involved does that sound worthless to you
i do think there should be a price reduction for buying in bulkif goonswarm wants to award all its members at the end of some campaigni think that the first 10 medals should have the 5 mil fee but after that the price should drop so medal 1125 should cost less and medals 2650 get even cheaper and so onand i also think its a pain that you cannot award medals to people not in your corp
i think it should be exactly the opposite large corps have larger wallets just like the fee of wardecs increases so should the price of medals what you suggest only makes the actual worth of a medal even less if medals arent only given to people for something big then what are medals worth i could be given a medal for every pod i blow up then what are they actually worth
what makes them worth anything is the receiver of the medal and the corporate dynamics behind it attaching a price tag to it is going to turn people off to using them all the price tag amounts to is another isk sink for the gameoh dearkaiden
uh excuse me 5 mil is chump changeno wayme thumbs down
copied here for more supportthe fall of kourmonen  postdt fw plex mechanics in a qr worldorignial edited language
this is currently the 1 greatest issue in factional warfare
this issue has been raised like a month ago no need to raise it a second time
could you please link that threadif you referr to theissue  faction warfare plexing spawning mechanic is brokenthread that one is not adressing the downtime spawning and especially their distribution related to the downtime mechanic which currently favour anybody who can play shortly after dtplayers in specific timezonesas in the linked original thread in the game development forum this mechanism is confirmed as working but imperfect and we would like the csm to raise this issue up into a higher priority at ccp so they can offer at least a working and balanced solution
its obvious that this patch is for the most part a total failure for being a nano nerfing patch it sure didnt nerf the nano ships everyone is moving slower but we still cant hit anything thats moving at a moderate speed read base speed there was never a problem with nanos because there are ships designed to counter them missiles were one of the worst pvp weapons in the game and now theyre even worst than that blaster boats now have trouble killing anything too personally i write this patch off as a total failure lets stop digging the hole fill it back in and try againcerts are neat but ill thought out medals are also a cool addition along with the orca but the nerfs need to go
ccp has rolled back small patches in the past but they have never rolled back a major content patchwhen exodus came out there were so many bugs that they reimbursed every ship loss for 30 days following the launch and made a lot of small tweaks to fix the staggering faults with the expansion but they did not roll it backperhaps theyll realize the monumental failure of qf and perform small fixes to repair all that they broke but dont expect any sort of rollback
i was looking through the notes and saw something which makes absolutely no sense at all45 0102070076 kill rights should be transferablethe idea of trading killrights has been knocked around internally for a long time the two things that have held it up are the aforementioned issues with bountyhunting which tie into this and the fact that a simple killright market lets you buy your own killrights rendering the feature largely counterproductiveif you buy your own killrights you have sent payment to the individual you killed this is far from counterproductiveif the killrights market were an auction market of some sort then people who really dislike a certain person would have the opportunity to bid whatever they thought it was worth to pop them in empire space make killrights transferrable 1x after auction so nobody can know for certain other than the one who ends up in posession of the rights who is the hunter or if there is a hunter at allsorry as far as i see it a killrights auction is winwin it would take a real effort on the part of ccp to make it not work
id say auctions would make it too complicatedwhy not have kill rights set at a consistant price based on the bounty sec status sec penalty etcyou purchase it for a percentage of the cost and the player who has them gets a cutsomething to that effect thats quickerand less messier
i like the idea of an auction killrights system because it is much more likely to generate real compensation for victimsa canflipper who has been around a while flipping cans flips some noob and ganks them newb puts up the auction several antipirates begin bidding on the auction because the canflipper has been making a real arse of himself and they all want to kill him one of the canflippers friends joins in with an alt and eventually wins the auctioneither a the canflippers friend just gave x isk to the noob and wont attack the canflipper or b he just gave x isk to the noob and will have a great deal of fun suprising his buddy sometime in the next weekin either case the noob just got a lot of isk they would have never seen otherwise
well aside from the complexities i have to agree with that statement as ive personally been the victim of a few can flippers who just flipped me off when it comes to my ranting and ravingsme signed
heres that video i mentioned in the op but forgot to postthe escapist eve online review
i highly disagree with the oplast 3 eve expansions have been for new players trinity was for new players empyrean age was for new players now quantum rise is for new players again with content like new missions and  i stopped doing a year and a half ago
id like to propose better controls on the sound settingscurrently i never listen to the music in eve because the sound of warping  cloaking  gates is simply too loud either i listen to the music at a proper volume and sacrifice my eardrums when warping or i cant hear the musici think that many people turn off the sound in eve after a while because of this and i think that reduces reduces immersion and keeps players away from some pretty damn moody musicso i propose1 allow us to turn off or greatly reduce the volume of warping  cloaking sounds3 more diversification of sound controls music ambient module related speech etcplease let me know if you support this idea thanksranges
so yeah big complaint showing up is people who lose there wrecks and or loot and what notis it possible to implement a solution in which the acceleration gates for missions only answer to the owner of the mission and members of the gangwhich means you have to work much harder at getting at the so called mission area it keeps you locked out unless your a member of the persons corpgangfleetif the gates can deny access to certain classes of ship or people who dont have the keywhy not additional conditions
why do so
ninja salvagers running off with millions of loot loot theivery etcits not impossible to jump into a mission areabut only after its donemissions are granted day in and day out to every single individual or group of individuals who grab emsince deadspaces block warp to the area that means they are restricted to the gatesso lock the gates keep the rif raff out and youll have nothing to worry aboutif someone wants in on the salvage and or scans it out after the missions done then go for itthey can even ask to join the fleetgangbut when the mission is in progress people have no business to be messing around in therechaos and sandbox aside this makes what is so very easy to do much harder but not impossiblemaybe my idea is off the wall it just dawned on me that no ones suggested thisim not against salvagers picking up wrecks that no one wants im against salvagers who just fly in grab what they want without bothering to ask let alone bate them with a concordoken trap and or gankfestthis of course is strictly mission area based and just thatbut considering no ones stepping up to comment i feel this idea is going to be shot down quickly oh well
ill comment i disagree eve is a game where people play with other people and are not just free to play with themselves miners have to deal with people stealing their ore so mission runners need to deal with people salvaging wrecksconsider your idea shot down was that quick enough for you
only as quick as my ability to destroy your salvage
not sure if this has ever been brought up so here goes1 with war decs they are sanctioned by concord so why is it when a wt is engaged on a gate i have to wait 60 sec to jump through for recent aggression  this makes no scene the war is sanctioned therefore no aggression 2 why cant a player be kicked from a corp and forgo the 24hr wait ceo should be able to kick playermember with no waiting period at least this would stop unnecessary headachesok just a couple of thought that may or may not have been brought up
to the first point gates are controlled by the empires not concord
2nd point this prevents corp jumping like leaping frogs being struck by lightningmy thinking is wardecs should actually make that timer longer because people ditch and thats not good
see thats the problem with people they hear but dont listen i said kick kick a person if your corp gets a tool in and you need to kick the jurk 24hrs is a long time to put up with him yes i know you can block but a kick option for ceos would be good
well when you put it that wayi suppose something needs to be donething is what if you get an idiot ceo
errr wait what ccp is privately owned as far as i know they bought out the investor a couple of years ago
yeah i was gonna say ccp is privately owned and quietly hiding away in londonicelandthey have a working relationship with an another company but its not viacomif it was viacom youd be seeing crap ads
00 alliance shouldnt wonder about isk farmersrenters at all they should not have to and they are not tasked with doing soccp should go after the corps that are renting instead of the alliances if a player can find out that a corp is isk farming  ccp should be able to do it easier and more efficiant  ccp should try harder themselves 
for too long caldari have been oppressed by the evil npcs of eve now with the drone and missile nerf what we love to do most the killing of endless hordes of hostile npcs is slowerrequires far more expensive equipement and too much thinkingmy proposal is for npc damage hitpoints and resistances to be reduced by 50stupid overpowered nanos have been nerfed more then thisas well as bouties and lp gain increased by 50 ccp have shown that enough feedback on forums makes things happenas proved by the nano nerfvote for changevote for the liberation of eve from evil npcs
i agree that for your standard player isk making can be a pain i for one hate griding missions just to buy a ship i could lose so easy in a pvp environmenthow ever this is not the way to do it
i suggest we boost them instead so they can kill whiners and make them emo quit faster
i vote that each time a emo post whine about ghost trainingnerfing missiles nerfing patches whining caldari gives all there stuff to me o pseriously get a freaking life people
you have my support for this idea
all you would be csms read well and bring this to ccpallow us to filter out want to buy orders from the contracts window 99 of want to buy orders are just twits scamming the entire contract system was set up to slow down scams so keep going and limit them furtheryou dont need to eliminate want to buy but just give us a selection to not see them if we choosealso in the market pane give us the ability to filter out market orders beyond a certain percentage abovebelow the regional median a percentage we can select this also helps filter the dross so we can get a look at the real market and not the scammers
i agree that this should be an option so ill endorse this during my time as csm if i should happen to be elected the second filter while nice is not really pressing
also since the new plex certs are generated from real world money all scams that are attempted concerning them should lead to a ban
doesnt putting a 1 in the min price filter on contracts filter out want to buys
hiwould be great if the eve chats can be accessed by a irc client just with a interface beetween a ircd and eve so users at work they cant start eve they can chat 
i wouldnt be surprised at all if outofgame chat was a part of the cosmos project look out for that ones it ships
nanobots its a big machine with a lot of computers if you had a crew youd have to pay them and theyd probably quit if you kept taking your ship into suicidal situations dont support the op and i think responses like the above are dumb too
offensive words need to be refined in the dictionary as  swearword  there are a lot of words which are not offensive at all but happen to contain the letters of an offensive word its particularly annoying for anyone with a modicum of education
i think itd be cool although im pretty sure anything smaller than a bs will pull enough gforce to turn you into a squidgy mess definately with a abmwd anyway and definately if youre orbiting at close distance hence the need for a pod  goo id assume dunno how the imaginary crew survives if there is one not that eve is very realistic anyway could be a feature for just the biggest ships in eve unless youre docked
x the ninja salvager should not be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because i support ccps current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecksit would be different if every player could salvage without skills however if one doesnt salvage then its just junk out there going to no use
x the ninja salvager should not be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because i support ccps current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecksi like this current system and no i dont ninja salvage and yes i do run missions personally i think this system helps blance out the lvl 4 missions that ccp already consider unbalanced in thier profitability and it helps discourage people from crowding mission hubs not to add to the fact it goes with the competitive harsh nature of evean interesting copromise i think would be if you made salvaging the wreck flag the ninja to some of the npcs left in the mission this would make sense and would also be more consistent with game mechanics that currently exists namley those in pvp
ninja salvager should not be aggrod for clearing wreckschances are the ns will trigger the red flag anyway by stealing some juicy loot from a wreck i personally start destroying the wrecks if a ns shows up and i feel upset about it ie havent had a chance to open them to look at loot however it often depends if i can be arsed or notmost lvl 4s i dont salvage or check loot at alli guess a way to make it more difficult for the ns but still allow it to be a viable profession would be to make the ns have to scan for the mission runner every time the mr uses a gate at deadspace siteit still doesnt stop baiting by ns for the mission runner to attack them just last night i had one return after his frigate was accidently destroyed in a pvp ship obviously with the intention of trying for my mods on domi however this was quite fun really  id hate to stop such excitement and chances at pvp just because missions are seen as isk earnersit should be difficult to earnoh and he warped off once he figured his shieldtank was about exhausted and my armor one was holding welltake carearithron
i think you have provided one of the most articulate and well thought out responses that ive ever seen from someone who runs missions and i respect that all too frequently people are ready to jump up and beat their chests demanding changes and reparations and you sir seem to have found an answergood on ya mate
one of the items introduced by me in the last csm was a particular small anchorable which would be used purely for small gangs operating in deep hostile space that idea has been passed directly to the devs ive also spoken in support of increasing certain types of objectives for small gangs in 00 in the form of decoupling the industrial aspects of poss from sov among other things as time continues im sure there will be a number of other ideas and suggestions that id be happy to supportthat being said i believe the biggest limiter to small gangs today is the creativity of the individual players goonfleet has rather effective units that participate solely in small gang warfare the idea that it doesnt exist is dead or that the game needs to somehow be rewritten in order to make the playstyle viable is simply incorrect i think the pot can be spiced up but i also find it to be far from emptyas far as titans i dont support the idea of any gridkilling aoe weapon whatsoever never have
im telling everyone i know to not vote for you because of that
its common sense that if you sit something unprotected out in space people will come and take it i am a fairly experienced miner and i have never had a can flip why because when i see somebody warp into my belt i do two things first i call in my hauler to pick stuff up second i hail the approaching pilot to let them know i am not a macro miner seriously most of the can flippers will leave you alone if you have the courtesy to give them a heads up those that are not looking for macros will generally leave you be because a proactive target is less likely to be an easy ore snatchi think this system works as intended forcing cooperation between players
gentlemen once more i thank you for your support i shall be adding a writeup of the matters concerning agents and the csm itself this weekend
good luck vuk hope you get in 
well i already voted but i wanted to know your stance on the missile nerfalthough there were some tweaks that needed done so cruises just couldnt wtfpwn little ships coming from someone who has poured way too much sp into missiles for a pvp weapon it means alot
trust me i have tried we had an issue about it in the first submission round and i kept bugging people about it at fanfestsoon
i confirm nor deny
voting for you again point 2 and 3 will hopefully revitalize eve for everyone
perhaps it was but the ganking itself really isnt what i think made it so offensive  it was the fact that it was offensive against a real world religion which i believe is against the tos and made light of in a rather tasteless way real world terrorism and suicide bombings suicide ganking people is a valid game mechanic and while i dont really agree with the rampent suicide ganking of jihadswarm is was the jihad part of it that crossed the line not the gankings themselves
jihad is arabic for holy war its a language and a literal translation shoot us for engaging in a little role play what else would one call a planned string of suicide bombings in the name of god
i thought that jihad actually means struggle as to an alternative name you could have used severalcrusade comes to mind as one example the goon crusade has a nice ring to it
people really need to stop being so uptight this is a game where people murder other people multiple times a day and youre getting annoyed with a word
rp is based upon eve not rl if you wanted a term for a holy war that fits in eve you could have used reclaimingand yes i believe jihad more accurately means a struggle maybe specifically one related to faith im not sure or so i am toldits not so much the word per se but the context in which they were using it and the other real world religious associations they used
dune borrowed heavily from middle eastern words and contexts if you choose to read too deeply into a situation thats your uptight problem assigning intentions to people based on your personal perceptions is silly
avalloc is a pretty ok dude
what part of mechanics did you missthe core game mechanics regarding mining are still target roidcloud activate harvest module pick your nose and wait for your cargo hold to fill upwhich is boring and stupid as there is no interesting interaction that makes people want to remain at the keyboardi think this youtube video illustrates the problem perfectly
well by that logic pvp hasnt changed at all since release either then target playernpc activate weapons pick your nose till target diesedit im not saying that mining doesnt get boring im contesting where youve said that mining mechanics have not changed at all since release
that is true however the core game mechanics of combat are more complex as they involve range and maneuvering capacitor power ammunition choice ew webs scrams inability to disengagewhich results in a game loop which requires user interaction and constant decission making opposed to mining i highly doubt that there are people that alttab out during a combat situationin addition pvp has more interesting secondary mechanics such as the factional warfare system and sovereignty mechanics while mining only has the logistics to haul the ore somewhere where it can be processed and soldused which are not really that interesting eh
so you dont have anything to say aboutor are they not a change to the complexity of mining mechanics
nope as the core mechanics are still the samethe only thing that slightly changed game mechanics is hidden belts  exploration but thats a small secondary just like rorqual compression had a tiny impact on the logistics mechanicsmining crystals and gang links certainly have no impact on game mechanics  if the game requires you to kill someone by swinging a sword the damage range of the sword itself has nothing to do with the game mechancs likewise there is no difference in mechanics between mining in a hulk with stripminers or in an ibis with a nooblaserif players were allowed to constantly modulate the mining beam and this had an impact on the resources obtained that would be a change to the mechanics just an example
ok so youve now admitted that there have been changes but i see that you feel that they hidden belts rorquals mining gang links crystals represent only tiny changes to mining mechanics i dont agree you there but opinion is opinion after allid like you to consider the reasons people choose to mine do you think they do it because they find it boring i dont think so and i dont think you would either lets analyse this thankfully a schedule change has freed my morning up what i say from here is based on personal experience  which can vary one may consider that minings lack of labourintensive demands is something that might attract some of its adherents when i was a new pilot i used to mine and many miners i met used to view the long ops as a social activity crack open a beer and listen to the radio others due to health reasons didnt want to experience high levels of stress while playing eve from that point of view mining can be a relaxing pasttimenow looking at the changes to the mining mechanics i view them as significant changes why when i was miner i was always trying to get the most yield out of my time t2 mining lasers t2 strip miners t2 crystals gang links barges exhumersthese all extended the goals i saw as a miner giving someone something better to want when the rorqual was introduced i wasnt a miner however i know of many people who have spoken its praises it helps miners have ninja mining ops in potentially hostile 00 space it reduces the logistics load now i appreciate that you think this is a tiny change but i think this is a significant improvement to the professionrelevant to a previous post of yours it is important to note that the prices of minerals have also increased significantly since i started mining this can only mean good things for a miner right to preserve these high prices scarcity is key thus keeping the best minerals in a position where they are more challenging to extract is a logical way of rewarding the miners with the most initiativeregarding exploration which you also said was a tiny change like the guys who made this video ive found that finding hidden mining belts is well worthwhile it can give a miner in empire access to 00 quality ores if you still think thats a minor change that doesnt represent a significant change since releasejust wanting to point out that kind of change would make mining more labour intensive are you sure that the miners you are claiming to represent want this
that is not what i saidi said that mining links and crystals have no  zero  nada impact on game mechanics as yield is not part a part of game mechanics any more than the color of your ship is in a first person shooter the core game mechanics are running aiming and shooting stuff its the game loop which a player is in most of the time whenether the player has a pistol or a minigun does not affect the core game mechanics if the player gets a portal gun which changes the running and aiming aspects of the game then it will have an impacthidden belts and rorquals have no  zero  nada impact on the mining core game mechancs but a slight impact on secondary game mechanics as they affect the actions before and after the mining process is initiatedi understand that youre not a game designer though so ill try to go easy on you i dont deny that at all back in the days when i still mined i liked being able to alttab out and do other stuffthats not a change to the mining mechanics itself though id say that would fall under progressionof course that made a chance just not a change to the core game mechanicsit was giving this as example to illustrate what exactly a change to the core game mechanics would be i said nowhere that i wanted to make this specific change any change to the core game mechanics would likely be an increase in iteraction though as it couldnt get much less than it is now i would agree that we shouldnt change the game mechanics from boring to tedious and boring though and for this reason interactivity could be constructed in an optional fashioni got to go now meeting with a client in an hour got a game to sell 
yup youre right  im not a game designer in rl like yourself im sorry for getting bogged down in the semantics of game mechanics versus progression perhaps since most people who read the forums arent game designers like yourself you could use your knowledge of the terminology when you use it to specify for philistines such as myself that the changes i listed were not changes to the game mechanics  even though they made stark changes to the professionindeed perhaps its not the mechanics that are the problem maybe the progressioni look forward to seeing your ideas on increasing interaction in an optimal fashion i really hope you know what miners want good luck with selling your game ill strike up some chats with miners and discuss these ideas
i see you havent seen the how to run missions in a dominix guideit works like this1 aggro mobs2 release drones engage drones3 go afk for 20 minutes4 profitthere is no way to fix mining into a system that resembles pvp since there is no way to add unexpected changing variablesi think it is also quite funny that you also say you want larger roids and more roids in order to fix mining when all that does is reduce the number of things you have to do when miningany system you create will devolve into monotony when the pattern is discovered players will be unwilling to participate in more complex mechanicsafter all i can read forums while i mine if it does not come with increased rewards and said increased rewards will ruin the risk associated with various areas of space
my intention of the question was to boost roids so that you dont have to pop 9 roids to fill your cargo but i see that many probably misinterpreted it
may i remind you that this isnt wow and there arent any swords herein your discussion of mechanics you have overlooked the economic impact on markets and hence on many areas of eve of increased yield or larger volumes of minerals available from increasing size of droids supply and demand dictate prices for minerals more supply same demand  a fall in mineral prices hence mining becomes less profitable some fix ehmining in high sec doesnt need any boosts what needs to happen is that industrial activities like mining need to be made more attractive in the vast areas of low sec that are way underutilised mining solo is a little tediousbetter to also look at ways to encourage gangmining and such like gangderived mining bonuses which also makes sense if you want to encourage lowsec mining for better orestake carearithron
good luck vily hope you get in

i support dual ownership so then you can unite in hate over the dbag who had nothing to do with the said loss kill him together become great friends and share ice cream cones
guys this whole idea is just crap will be hard to implement and will be complicated to usesimple solution loot theft ie looting by anyone other than the pilot who was shot or his corp results in the looter becoming flashy to everyone for 15mins and cant jump dock for a brief period in accordance with standard aggro rulesedit obviously salvage remains freeforall
this is drivel utter drivelyou make utter spurious claims eg blasterthron doesnt need webs or that torps cant match blaster damage hint they can do more now following the rage boost at still four times the range then you selectively edit history to try and claim that missiles have been repeatedly nerfed  and leave out all the immense boosts they got along the way as well1 the fact that missiles got special t2 ammo to murder small stuff and had their velocities and range massively improved by the first rebalance2 the ridiculously overpowered nature of javelin torps when they were introduced3 the introduction of hams 4 the insanely long range of javelin hams when they were first introduced5 the torp rof buff giving them nearblaster damage at six times the range6 the rage missile buff in quantum riseif you put that together with your list of nerfs and guess what theyve had dozens of balance changes over the years in both directionsyou can whine away about the last changes but its not in the slightest bit relevant you need to adapt because everyone else particularly blaster and ac pilots is doing the same we all lobbied for a better balance than what went live in the weeks and months before some changes were made many not now we live with what weve got and theres absolutely no reason why the perfectly reasonable missile changes wouldnt stay if everything else does

with salty sea mans floating in it
wait missiles no longer completely miss or utterly fail to damage the majority of competent pvp setups out there and you adaptationimpaired gumps are complaining because you lose a few percent of that magical eft dps number against most targets its like giving a child a gigantic icecream and him complaining its not chocolatecoated with a cherry on top grow up
hahaha ignorant troll is ignorantmissiles werent that good beforehand dps sucked no instant damage shield tanked ships now theyre even more useless
sur the nerf is too strange for the caldariraven with cruise vs angel bs have more dps that raven torp vs angel bsits very strangecaldary is the bad race in pvp if its the bad race in pve what are we going to do signed
signedi was against nano nerf and dont pve or rat so im pretty unbiased raven is dead cerb is pretty crappy as a hac now i still got my rokh i guess
why does everyone always say torps got boosted after quantum riseit only got a 667 increase over the old damage in exchange for increasing the explosion radius from 540m to 650m thats over 15 not exactly scaled with the damage increase isnt itthis means you now do less damage with a standard rage torp boat fitting because the damage given per m of sig radius is decreasednow to the losers who say fit a painter are utterly clueless  one always fitted a painter on a rage torp boat but now postqr you need 2 painters for most battleship hull sigs to match your torps explosion radius please note painters do get a stacking penalty on your targetplease bear in mind that torpedoes do not benefit from crash boosters missile precision skill or the radius reduction rigsalso this is not taking into account the fact that your battleship targets can easily ab or just naturally speedtank your torps for a significant reduction in damage this thus necessitates the use of dual webs to be fair though one should makedo with onetorps have not been boosted in any way if you call increasing the damage by a measly 667 a boost whilst disregarding the unproportional increase in explosion radius then you suckso postqr if you stick with the same rage torp setups you will do less damage adapt is what people say but its somewhat difficult to fit 2 painters and 2 webbers on shield tanking shipsyes this isnt a solo game but i shouldnt need support ships or so many support modules to use t2 high damage ammo against ships of the same class  bs vs bsi dont see megathrons needing as many support modules to utilise t2 high damage ammo effectively against battleship targetsedit by accident i posted with my alt my main is ursaemajoris in case any of you were going to try that argumentdismissingpost with your main crap
you did actually flyed and tested caldari missile boats before and after the patch with proper skills and claiming all those points or just making estimations with what you are hearing aroundi personnaly see the obvious difference by flying those ships before and after the patch and seriously when u say murdering small stuff or  overpowered nature  etc its like we are playing different games and talkin about different things
this tbfh threadto all those eft warriors who dont fly the ships and just saw a damage  increase then try to state that torps got a boostand testing the supposed torp boost take a raven w t2 torp launcher fire 1 t1 em torp at a bs not moving w no mods then fire 1 t1 rage torp at a bs let alone the bs moving w out a ab hell now w the same revelant lvl 4 specialization skill do the same with a 1 cruise launcher do the t1 cruise then do the t1 fury after that compare the t1 torp to the t1 cruise the t1 cruise to the t2 torp and vice versa then start moving the bs againthe results are eye opening
firstly its not driveli pointed out that the different ways missiles have been nerfed over the yearsi pointed out caldari ship now have a lesser tank due to the nerfi pointed out that missiles do a lesser max damage than any other weapon typeat no point have i said the blaster boat nerf was reasonable so stay in your own thread

dearie dearie me get a clue missiles were fine  except from the speed cliffgood dps excellent force projection shield tanked ships with full room for damage modsnow the speed cliff has been removed and all you do is whine cluelessly because you dont do full damage to an mythical abing cruiserkhemal youve been on sisi youve tested the cerberus youve seen that its now able to kill any interceptor or drive away any fast cruiser how are you coming to such absurd conclusions
i dont know him but ive been on sisi i dont think you can kill anything using only a cerberus you need support to scram  web  tp  etcim telling that pre qr caldari ships needed less support less meds of your gang to reach 100 dmg its a factpre qr a cerb with support of only 1 web was able to do full dmg to every ship in game with only one module4now you need much more meds to achieve 100 dmg do not be surprise if ppl is not happy with this patch
well this missle nerf has pretty much gutted an account i have worked on for months when a manticore can barely dent the shields of an assault ship i have to say i may as well just cancel that account and start over sorry but that will not happen i will waste my time elsewhere  this nerf has made my caldari pilot somewhat of a joke as now i need to go and spend weeks probably months training skills to compensate in a war dec i as pretty much now a permanant ew boat or repper from a sales standpoint aweseome job you just created a program that if i want to enjoy my character i need to pay you more money to train up just to get back to where i was before the nerftime is money this nerf has ruined 8 months of patience and gameplay seriously considering just going to another rpg that rewards players for loyalty not waste it this was not a well tested change in my opinion and i have played many rpg on line  the good ones actively for 7 years now adn none have ever made me feel like i may as well just cancel the account because of a game patch or upgradei have played another rpg from its birth and when a major change like this occours at least they allow you to respec you character so that situations like thes never occour and hey they have gotten my money for 6 years to play is that not the purpose for the game creators it is a business afterallwell sorry long winded but i am so disapointed this may very well be my last post and i cancel my account and look elsewehre good luck all adn fly safe

yeah 8 months wasted
better than i could have said it thank you sir
tbqh i can understand the frustration of training missile skills and then having the system change quite a bit i have over 9mil in missiles alone and i will continue to usetrain them i suppose i will have to rethink how i play but i am always up for a challenge maybe this patchnerf will make t2 missiles more widely used before qr i didnt really see a reason to use t2 ammo but now t2 cruise can hit ceptors not a lot of dmg but its funny none the less as for having the patch taken back we all know it wont happen ccp is considering trivial additions any else read the thread on instrumentswtf however maybe ccp should consider revising the systems for all weapon types actually didnt have a problem with the missiles pre qr or with them now to each his own i suppose
yes skill tree queue please and a skill tree dependency chart as well thank you
edit fully agree with the ability to train a secondary skill6hour skills are simple to handle leave a longtraining skill going when you arent playing when you log in switch to training the 6hour skill when you log off switch back to the longrunning skill youll chisel away at that 6hour until it finishes while youre playing i do this all the time and it works greatthat said i do like the idea of training two skills simultaneously at 12 speed and i would certainly use that feature if implemented
this game has a steep enough learning curve and high enough barrier to entry without adding extra hurdlesannoyances a skill queue of some kind would make things a tad easierif i wanted more micromanagement in my life id just go to work and get paid for itpaying 15 a month for the privilegeno thanks
enlighten me pls
i would like to suggest that the slots for turrets and bays be directly linked to high slots so that when fitting a ship a pilot can arrange his weaponry as desired and be sure that the next time he visits a station or reconnects to the game the weapons on the ship wont be randomly rearranged i know this is not a performance issue but it does directly affect the aesthetics of the game by affecting the appearance of the shipsas an example of what i mean take a punisher and fit it with any two identical lasers and a rail gun as the game operates now the weapons are randomly distributed on the ship and the distribution changes each time the ship reloads whether from logging in going through a jump gate or visiting a station what i am suggesting is a change so that once you establish where you prefer your weapons to be mounted on your ship they remain in those locations no matter how often you connect to the game or visit a stationyes this is the same suggestion i made in features and ideas a gm suggested i should post in both places to get twice the visibility for the suggestion as he felt it had merit but gms dont have any direct ties to the devs

im supporting this as well i would like the option to select where my turrets are displayed on my hull
tbh i think that this is something that the alliances themselves could come up with with ccp providing the prizes and enforcing the rulesvideo and commentary can be provided by mutually agrred upon people im sure there will be a long list of volunteers

proposal extra trading skillwhen a caracter has all the skills that allows you set more orders on the market the maximum number possible is 305 this includes the skill tycoon at lvl 5 a first impression may be that this is a high number but for a player that realy likes to trade and is playing the markets it isnt to realy play the markets of eve one needs many orders more now of course one can also use to a certain extend contracts but this is only possiblepractical for a limited amount of more expensive items and contracts are not as flexible as market orders an other alternative is the use of alts however using an alt has a serious drawback one has to log in and out all the time this is annoying for a player but i suspect logging in and out all the time also put a strain on the servers computation resources and more active traders results in more competition on the market so more players can get better deals so the best solution would be to add an extra skill so one caracter can generate more ordersjeancolbert
you mean setting up 305 buy orders in jita asking for a stuff for some silly prices and then setting other orders selling it back for a higher price thats why there is to much money in hisecprocuders have 11 slots at max market manipulators have 305 market orders miners have 3 strip miners on their hulks and cnr empire carebears have 7 missile slots deal with it want more slots  train more chars
i totally agree with you mira i have a whole container full of bpobpc and i have to click on each and every one to find out which are my copies i would think that ccp could just change the icon that represents the copies to either include a small c on it or just change the overall color of the whole thing i wonder if ccp could put something in the database that could recognize the bpc and alter the icons appearence at the database level say all bpcs have an identifying number that the database attributes to adding 63 yellow hue to the image to make bpcs a greenish color or whatever color they deem bpcs should be or just try and organize your bpobpcs until they fix ithehe i guess i should do that one of these days as well
yes i am

missile boost is great
we already had several threads about this
that is excellent idea hmmm they could call them something likeimplantsbrilliant
signed
you are right it did not say that in the thread  but i did add it in the issue document that ccp gets
thanks for that then and was that document made public i must admit i missed a lot of the csm documents after trying to read through the first few chat logs from the meetingsanyway with the situation currently arising again and this time having a bigger ingame impact we might see a bit more support for this issue from the community the original thread in the general discussion was already three pages long before i copied it here so i hope with those returning here and some more voices we can give the csm a stronger base to push this issue higher at ccp
im affraid its not public but im working on that with the wiki im setting up which will be live at the second csm startanyway this is what i wrote in the doc
ccp should work on making it possible to literally dock in ships with ship maintenance bays allowing for easier moving of pod pilots in and out of 00csm push them on furthering this
then what would be the point of jump clone bay thats what its for not docking in
make it text only dont turn
this realy is a good idea the music in this game is very well done and desrves this
i support myself also i extracted the music so now its playing in winamp
well now i do doh
i agree with this but i allso feel like sayingturn speakers down
whats wrong with setting the level of the music high and the ui low theres even another level for the computer voiceedit now dt is over i test i notice that warp noises etc are not ui sounds or voice sounds  supported

weird suggested something similar tonight on another thread on ninja salvagershere is what i postedninja salvager should not be aggrod for clearing wreckschances are the ns will trigger the red flag anyway by stealing some juicy loot from a wreck i personally start destroying the wrecks if a ns shows up and i feel upset about it ie havent had a chance to open them to look at loot however it often depends if i can be arsed or notmost lvl 4s i dont salvage or check loot at alli guess a way to make it more difficult for the ns but still allow it to be a viable profession would be to make the ns have to scan for the mission runner every time the mr uses a gate at deadspace siteit still doesnt stop baiting by ns for the mission runner to attack them just last night i had one return after his frigate was accidently destroyed in a pvp ship obviously with the intention of trying for my mods on domi however this was quite fun really  id hate to stop such excitement and chances at pvp just because missions are seen as isk earnersit should be difficult to earni dont agree with you regarding ns being locked out altogether of a deadspace site deadspace is just a way of generating the missionit should still be scannable or the mission ships should be and available for characters to enter who arent associated with the mission it livens things up a little and who ever stated that missions should be major iskgenerating activities with low riskarithron
you say lowrisk and yet you obviously ignored the fact that npcs shoot to kill o  ironicnot to mention that nss have literally zerorisk
actually if you are doing missions in a decent fitted ship missions low risk  a ns has same risks as anyone flying into a beltdeadspace area where there are npc he also has to deal with the missionrunner and if he triggers a red flag he runs a high risk of losing ship of course he has to first scan down the site so you get a head start on the deadspace as you get an auto bmjust because you trigger the mission it doesnt automatically give you ownership of everything within the deadspace npc rats are npc ratsanyone can warp into the deadspace and kill them if they can find the deadspace you get rewarded for the mission by the agent loot and salvage a bonus that you may get if no one scans down site before you loot everythingarithron
never had anyone flip my can to get agro in 00 they just kill you straight outseriously according to the backsstory of the game everything you do has dangerriskconsequences associated to it in space thats why i play i have been can flipped tons of times and no i dont like it but thats the risk of mining anywhere in this game suggestionsjoin a corp that offers some security for their minersuse a gscget an alt that can warp in and close the dealchange your subscription to second life and cry no more
qfe on this im not a can flipper i have a miner alt that doesnt can mine unless we have a mining op its a mechanic i find part of the game that makes it interesting and adds
it could also be cool to see also some sort of micro governements inside alliances i mean still in the adding content in 00 alliances purpose why not create some tools for corps  players to manage their global assets poses mobiles bases or whatever you could imagine  you could directly though such governements make some products illegal set laws that could flag pirates or any other kind of player if you are a kind of a pirate alliance why not etc maybe a bit ambitious though but your idea made me think to that raw concept well btw that is something i have always wanted to see in sov places some tools to manage standings easily some tools to get overlays of your assets some tools to get closer to the alliances  growing empires conceptwhat do you think of that 
yup this is along the line of ideas i want to work onwith giving alliances the ability to set certain laws is something ive been looking at but the concept is still very open let me share with you how far i think we can take thisive been working on the idea of nation states where sovereignty is at a level higher than alliances this would work somewhat if several alliances wished to cogovern space without merging in such a setup there would be the option of allowing citizens rather than the current system pets whereby any member of the eve community who isnt on bad terms can apply to become citizen of the bespoken nation state and thus pay taxes to the nation state coffers and be given docking rightsstandings automatically this works more realistically and fairly in my opinion than the current rentstandings method which i also think is also more labour intensive allowing the game to support the empire building it has gone so far to advertise would be consistent with where i think eve is goingnow coming back to the laws suppose this is linked with citizenship eg make a trade order of a certain good in one of our stations and you automatically lose your citizenship npc in a certain system and you lose your citizenship these are just hypothetical examples i admit that they may be impractical from a programminggame balance pov so please stay openminded with regards to them where could the nation state lead us to perhaps it could be the precident of nationstates forming relations with the existing npc empires perhaps it could be a platform for a real form of empire government which could perhaps be democratically elected food for thought
tbh i didnt had time to check misiles after qr was deployed will try to answer you in next couple of days
i am despite being ingame for over a year still a carebear i usually dont care much to look atinto anythign other than what i want to do and for the most part i can do the things im interested in doing with little or no hindrance  then again im a simple pleasures kind od person i started looking into the csm election thing because i was pretty much told to every time i logged in and i figured if it were that important to nag about it was probably worth looking into as i knew absolutely none of the current candidates i looked at all the available websites to see who was offering whati knew eve was an incredibly involved game but i had no ideaafter looking at everyone i decided tusko hopkins pitched the best offer  longstanding experience was presented issues were outlined simply and in plain language and support for my kind of character and corp was offered having read the more detailed posts and answers here my choice is only validated i am happy to cast my vote for tusko hopkins and will further encourage others to do so best of luck to you
you guys are funnygoonswarm does 00 sovereignty warfare and likes to griefergo the issues you can expect gs members to represent is 00 which we regard as what eve truly ought to be about we would love to get the game changed so more people can come out here and bump elbows with us and keep things interesting and keeping eve a free and dangerous universeneither of which are bad for eve imho if you want safety and comfort you really are playing the wrong game i think you will find that most of our candidates campaign topics are p serious and not offensive if you actually read them tbh
up for any questions
issler and scaggai wish i had another vote for youisslerthat is exactly what i meanthe mining sites that i have found do not have what i would call rare roids will keep looking would be nice to find a site and it have a little arknor in itscagga i like your objective explanationvery niceboth of you good luck on csm
boondock try some low sec sites 
this only happens if the quantity supplied increase for each individual is lower than than the price reductioneve has proven to be a very inelastic system an increase in mining yields would mean more profits for the majority of miners an increase in the fun of mining may mean less profithour but it would be made up for in the fact that mining was more funand so people would likely do it longerif youre going to claim an economic reason at least get it right
hehe sorry about thati did not mean to say that mining has not changed at all since eves launch when i referred to the core game mechanics i meant the game mechanics that lay at the fundament of mining target roid activate lasers wait for hold to fill and everything that is slapped on top of mining is not core game mechanics because if you remove it all mining would still work and still be the sameyes and no i think the mining progression has already gotten a lot of attention in the form of lots of new mining related ships and modules do we need more of that i dont think soon the other hand the players often do not progress to areas with better ore in them a mining barge has a smaller chance of surviving on its own in lowsec00 than a frigate with a mininglaser slapped onto it for example thus it is not a good idea to take your shiny new stuff there you can do highsec exploration thoughi think we need more discussion with miners first but one of the things that could be done is that mining beam modulation which is optional as you dont have to keep it modulated but will extract morebetter ore or have a chance of gaining rare resources if you domissions are not pvp last time i checked and it was pvp we were talking aboutand why cant a computer introduce unexpected changing variables to the equationas if people really want to spend time looking for a belt that has not yet been mined dryi dont see the problem here any changes could simply be optional and there could be rewards associated with it and there could be better rewards in lowsec00and i dont see why it couldnt be completely dynamic so there is no direct pattern
issler dainze  csm candiadate  let me be your voice when you scream in spacecsm a joke well here is a csm joke i wrote so a csm member a ccp developer and a genetically altered cow walk into a pleasure hub they all head over to the bar and the ccp developer asks the cow to order them a round the cow proceeds to order three glasses of vegatable feed liquor the csm member and the ccp developer look at the revolting shots in front of them while the cow immediately knocks back its shot and orders another the csm member suggests to the ccp developer that maybe having the cow order was a bad idea the ccp developer replies no that is working as intended but maybe we can consider some balance changes next patch he then uses the gm tools to change his shot to a nice 40 year old single malt scotch and begins to enjoy his drink the csm candidate looks at his shot of disgusting liquor and realizes that he might as well drink it after all if ccp says thats the way it should work there is no reason to try and change itok i shouldnt be writing jokes but i can tell you im going to push back if ccp tries to tell me a cow should order my drinks you should too support the csm let them be your voice and help make eve what we want it to beremember stuffs getting better stuffs getting better every day issler dainzecsm candidateceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord

this is geared to the candidates whats your opinion of the recent qr changeswhat are your plans about it suggestionsthanks
i am generally happy with the changes people have to readapt again new playstyles need to be developed this is good for the game i am sure that quantum rise will bring something new strategywise which is a good thing as the old tactics were getting boring the only thing in quantum rise i am really not happy with is the black ops ability to jump bridge blockade runners i think this change makes transportation between 00 and lowsec even easier which is a bad thing as it has been too easy already
issler dainze  csm candiadate  let me be your voice when you scream in spacetoo early for me to say much i think they may have gone too far with missles i definitely see them as dramatically less powerfuli would have picked a different skill tree for some certificates that said i am excited to see them i am also excited about medals i will be handing some out this weekendi cant say id have done the same thing with blockade runners and deep space transports i was happy they decided to address some of the issues with those ships but as person that flies each regularly im not sure they addressed my real complaintseveryone in my corp is excited about the orca but no idea when well actually see one in our groupi would love to seem them expand alchamy to include other rare moon minerals we just lost a technetium moon and would love to have a way to cope with that without having to resort to the marketno noticable change in performance but i am not regularly in areas where that has been an issueso currently mostly happy about itremember stuffs getting better stuffs getting better every day issler dainzecsm candidateceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord
in general its good it pushes the game more towards tactics and less towards money there are fewer one size fits all ships and more ability to metafit whether or not anything is too much or too little we dont really know that yet i am sure were are going to get a number of small tweaks in the months to come but in general it moved the game in a positive direction
im glad the interceptor role is not dead the speed tanking still exists and overall it just broke the bogus game with the physics enginein general but i didnt see everything in action yet its not a huge change but a positive one
id say its a bit early to say in detail for me itd be easier give an informed answer after the transition period

not supported sure on one hand i dont mind getting people go flashy red towards me so i can shoot them but by doing so makes messes up some good things about not having you own the wreck besides the only reason you have an issue with this is because your in highsec
nop iv voted for ownership of loot and wrecks i dont see any diference
then you didnt read the opthe pitboss is looking for the aggroownership mechanic to be changed on looting not salvaging so thus you did not in fact vote for both in this thread were only voting to change the looting mechanic
at first i was like sure why not make the salvager flag to the person that killed the ship but then i was like what next a thread about people complaining of the person in the salvager came back in a neut domi and killed their super expensive mission boatsalvage as you kill me points to the maurauders
so you want the nano balance but dont want the missile balance did you play sisi during the time this was active missiles were insanely overpowered ask anyone who played there are massive threads about it all i see are a bunch of whiners who were expecting to get an overpowered iwin buttonunless you want to reverse all changes then im all for that
i use torpedoes t2 on a regular basis its not that bad just get one or two of the newly boosted afs to tack for you and problem solved i run 1 painter on my raven or widow widow usually uses cruises and one on my alts ship and the problem is solved it was a bummer at first but whatever do have to say i am having fun finally training turrets tho on the topic of the op saying that they need to roll back or whatever sorry not from this missile user imo they do need to rethink the velocity and exp radius to make torpedoes more effective without 2painterswebs id be happy with 1 paint 1 web vs equal or greater size shipsedit cold hands horrible spelling
of course ive tested it i have topend missile and gunnery skillsyou totally missed the point ofc most of those changes were in the last four years  not quantum rise try reading the acutal postwhoever whined abotu rages  you confound your own errors by repeatedly saying with the same setup  newsflash  you need to change your setups everyone else has had to do the same with the patch the fact is that your max dps has gone up again you can whine its eft dps its theoretical but that is true of all weapons  considering how frequently people need to fight in falloff or get outtracked you actually need to put effort into acheiving that dps not just train skills to 5 then press f1f8 and now thats true for missiles tooso what get used to it thats how the game should be
i am the op1 yes i agree that missiles should have been hit to limit the amount of damage done to smaller targets2 yes every weapon has different tactical advantages and disadvantages3 no one told any of us which race to pick or how to train our characters your choices were your own missile or turret4 each race has specific strengths and weaknesses you chose it yourself at the begining of the game5 not everyone uses rage missiles the nerf in general is a negative effect for all missile users caldari or minmatar 6 blasters have a higher rof missiles have a longer range blaster have a higher ammo capacity missiles do more damage per round blah blah blah it makes no difference when you compair them theyre different for a reason in general now if you want to compair 910 times missiles fall short of thier counter parts7 i fly caldari minmatar and gallente ships yes i know what im talking about i will be posting formulas later in the evening
newsflash you missed the point of my argument  yes rage torp users do obviously have to adapt just like every other battleship pilot but what im arguing about and this is the point you missed out on is that rage torp users need a lot more supportsupport modules to adaptcompensate for the changes introduced in qr than other races battleship counterparts for bs vs bs fights your max dps has gone up again that is only a 667 more dps than the old preqr damage which is nothing to brag about when youre getting an explosion radius increase of 110m over 15do other t2 high damage ammousing battleships have to equip 4 ewar modules to be able to do full damage or at least more damage than t1 or faction ammo to make rage ammo even worth usingtraining for against other battleships dual webs required to prevent them from speedtanking the ridiculously small explosion radius of torps and dual painters to bring the signature radius up to rage torpedoes awfully large explosion radius
you forgot amarr yet only ones complaining are the missionrunning caldari carebears you are stupid because you just think about your missiles you should actually sit in something like a vaga or interceptor attack a drake or cerberus and see how much the missiles hurt even when orbiting with 45ksec it is not only unfair for caldari to be the only ones hitting the newly nerfed speed ships  as you did before the patch  but you want to do even more damage to them while other races dont hit them at all  you should come out of your missionhub and should look how missiles actually hurt all the smaller ships you should stop collecting numbers outgame and actually get in the game play the other races and see how much missiles hurt now no you dont you seem to not have a clue about other races ships at all
might be quite hard to get into one since he has 72 sec standing in any case signed
i guess you can do missions even in lowsec
only 667 thats a huge damage increase considering that void conflag and to a lesser extent hail didnt get the same loveand are still useless compared to faction ammfempyou dont seem to understand rages at all  its a bonus ammo for use when you can  eg instead of whining you desperately need two painters why not choose rage when youre fighting one of the bigger bs  tier 3 marauders for which you only need one painter as for needing two webs  this is only true versus afterburner bs how many of those do you really think well see on tq precious few and yes you should be worse against those because theyre chosen to lose their ability to get through a bubbleback to a gatein range just to speed tank your torps 1 60 web vs any other bs either mwd or slowboating will allow rages to hit for full damage due to the new formula mwding with high sig elimintes your damage loss due to speed as its now based on a ratio of speedsigso you only need one web and one painter for faction torps one web and two painters for rage on most bs targets some may require just 1 and 1 its hardly a difficult thing to acheive especially with the absolute rarity of bs 1v1sas for the other t2 highdamage ammo  it depends on the ship beause different turrets perform differently at that range certainly with blasters you need at least a dual web if not triple to get void better than t1 am let alone faction because crippling your range and tracking isnt so difficult but even though you need 3 mods on a blaster ship to hit max on void and you need 3 mods on a torp ship to hit max with rage i dont think its fair to compare because nobody uses void and it didnt get the luxury of being improved like rages didyou keep on ranting about how you have it so difficult but the fact is you got benefits with your nerfs too where you lost out was on easymode just firing and forgetting now you need to be a bit cleverer like a turret pilot in where you put your ship and locking down your opponent this is how it should beat the end of the day what is this thread about i hear lots of ranting but the actual op says something along the lines of revert this nerf  ie just go back to the stats from prepatch could that possibly be serious i mean missiles would be so insanely overpowered in qr without these changes
well im galentte i dont agree with the nerfing of any caind in fact i consider that other things should b created to contradict a overpowering issue like it appends in naturefox its to fast for rabbit natures reply ups lets nerf is legsowever ive tryed t1 standard missiles in enyo gallente af and i found out even with out any weapon upg fitted in low slot thing that all caldari ship can easely do due to any tanking restrictionsthe damage dealt by this low skilled gun less than 1 m sp was at least as effective than my highly skilled 9 m sp t2 rail or light t2 5m spin fact i know people that can passive tanking trough any v3 mission in caldari bc that is impracticable with any gallente bc in fact gallente drone bay ships have theyr drone bays nerfed and now with qr medium drones tracking as well drone skill training for a gallentian was mandatory to complement tower gunns tracking and range issuesso its bad but fare if missiles and explosion velocity its nerfed i have same problems with rails against smaller ships and i have to use webersso if and wen i use missiles that can select damage type by the way ll b using webers and drones every caldari use drones wen mining so use the overpowered raven and drake drone bays to use some weber drones do some active tanking and put web in middles as well instead of whining about every time someone complains about something all of us get nerfed
a change to the qr missile change has my amarrian supportthat change was while needed in a certain way over the top simple as thatup the explosion velocity again by 100 to 300 from current values and we should be ok and be able to adapt enough without feeling being completely hit by the big bad nerf sterrmhhhammerdont feel like argueing more about it here as well we do that enough at the moment ig
signedccp has put down missiles so much that are now useles in pvpthey did umbalancing the game
missile changes are fine because of the speed changes on all ships in the game if they were left unbalanced then it would be caldari i win button more than what it isget over it
plz tell me that you are caldari and made a few tests already after the patch and surprise mewhy ppl talk about things that they dont have a clue ccp  plz take take 2 sama skilled char and test raven for a start with 2 of the fallowings pointwebspeed mod  vs other race bss then lover the other race chars sp and make the same test again you will notice that the result wont change we are unable to kill anything who is smart enough to move around abit our dmg become worthless
the naglfar needs some love
this is one of the longest ongoing issue threads right now and the only response from ccp is we may look in to it maybe but only if were in a good mood and its not raining sunny cold or hot outsidew t f is the point of this forum and the csm
training is playingyou should have to pay to playim tired of all you whiners complaining omg i have to pay to playif you cant afford to pay a monthly subscription but expect ccp to allow you to play for free then go find something else to play you rage quiting will not be missed
sign ccp do it now
that is completely false as a new player with practically only 3hour and 6 hour skills i was missing training time a lot now that i have lots of multiday skills i miss training time a lot less
i am against this speed reductionat least base ship speed should be like it wasvindicator now has a base speed of 105ms
funny at the same time you are complaining about changes that came with the nerf enjoy your missiles now you too haha have fun with missiles
there should be no limit to the training time ccp forget that a large portion of their subscribers have jobs ive probably at the moment in time got about 15 skills with between 1 hour and 6 hours training left that i just cant get around to traininga primarysecondary system would work better so before i got to workbedwhatever i can leave my primary skill as something with a few days to train and put my secondary as one of those hourlong skills i have get that finished and the next day do the same ill be able to finish off loads then current method of training is fubar
i am also one of the people realy convinced that even the most modest form of skill queue 1 to 2 slots would enhance the managing of skills while not being online in a major way i regularly miss 4 hours of research or just end up researching skills that are at that moment totaly irrelevant just because i cant be online in time to do the research on those skills i realy need to havei dont see what the problem or objection could possibly be against a 12 slot skill queue
check this outaccording to entity this is a really old picture but god its so much easier to actually figure out whats going on it shouldnt take all that much resources to do and it would decrease the amount of mistakes people make when they by accident reprocess stuffhi verone or trash iti see no reason why it shouldnt be done thus ccp should do this with true exploration along with the ui being reworked
make it so
i endorse the addition of the ops content to the client
i see this as just one part of a major ui overhaul requirement
make it so should be incredibly easy to rearrange the menu

ccp nerfed open monitor we want that back or something similar  ccp made this to hide qr memory leaks 
i live in and around the drone regions and recently had the good fortune of finding my first faction drone bpc in an exploration site now ive been living here a while and these seem to be relatively rare so i though great ive found a nice valuable bpc that is worth the time it took to find it wrong the drone bpc i found 5 x integrated warrior is actually worse than t2 and is only worth about 1 million isk not only this but all integrated drones are only slightly better than their t1 counterparts now these are meant to be faction drones but only the augmented ones which are almost impossible to find are actually better than t2this would all be fine if there was other stuff to get in the drone regions but no there are only 3 things you can ever find out here minerals faction drone bpcs and the parts needed to make them now since almost all of the bpcs are worth little more than 1 million isk the parts needed to make them are almost worthless too this leaves us with the total useful exploration content in the drone regions minerals greatnow all other 00 regions have regular spawns worth anything up to billions of isk from bpcs the most you can get in the drone regions is a few hundred million from an augmented bpc but having asked around the alliance very few people have ever found one of these this just feels like a total joke in terms of exploration since it is actually more worthwhile to just rat and collect the minerals rather than probing them outanyone who agrees that this needs to be improved significantly please support this topic

i like the alliance tournament signed
i agree the tourney was one of the events that brought the eve community together and 1 of the things that made eve online differant to other mmorgs doesnt have to be biyearly  annual will be fine costs are halfed already  
how aboutccp stops paying to send the csm dweebs to iceland and keeps the alliance tournament runningi mean if its a matter of money i know which one i find more importantandor and being preferred tbhhow about paying some icelandic locals to do the commentary instead of flying in people from england
being a trader myself juggling with 301 orders with my main  i can see the reason behind this proposal300 orders are a ways insufficient  if you play more than one region considering being present in one core regions market only 305 orders are enoughthe positives of possible order raisestraders can control more goods on the market its their profession they can expand their gameurrhmnone else that cant be countered reallythe downsides of a possible raisestarting traders wont ever be able to compete by finding their untilthenneglected nichethe rich get even richer  ok thats why a trader is a trader after all capitalsimyarrras a result of rising influence of few on the markets speak monopolism prices would skyrocket driving off younger ones that arent even interested in trading but have to rely on it anywaysevery pilot in eve is relying on a healthy market the downsides outweigh the single positive reason by far so even while i would personally wish for more orders myself as well you wont find me supporting this proposalinterestingly enough you didnt support it yourself nay
easiest way around the confusion at time of purchase put the bpos in one secure container and the bpcs in another label appropriately ive several dozen and that is the easiest way the only thing i keep out is what is currently in the works merchandise goes into its proper receptacle at time of delivery easier i keep my own db of my bps

i concur
get over it
i see a reoccurring pattern with the trolls in this thread they feel that since they had to walk to school uphill both ways in the snow with no shoes the newer players have to as well clearly this is flawed and ultimately selfish reasoningsome of the trolls even fear new players climbing into battleships right off the bat a very silly fear when one thinks about it scared of a newbie whos on equal footing as you reallyi fully support a reduced training time though i somewhat dispute the specific reduction posted imo i believe skill training times should never be longer than ten days either that or a different method of training would be preferable anything rather than logging in starting a skill and turning off the computer for two weeksif ccp is serious about getting newer players into the eve universe the odds against them should not be so drastically hopeless a guppy in an ocean filled with hungry predatory sharks come on nowedit and i see trolls claiming eve will turn into wow if the game eases new players into the game isnt that in the best interest of ccp more paying customers you can criticize blizzard but by setting the entry bar relatively low it encourages newer players to stick with it giving them goals that are reasonably challenging yet are not discouragingly impossiblethis is why wow is the 11 million playerbase mmo juggernaut this is also why eve is not not even close ccp could rake in some serious cash if they wanted the mmo playerbase is desperate for a decent scifi mmo unfortunately eve online doesnt fit the bill because of its steep learning cliff that so often bars and discourage new players
50 flat reduction is a little overboard but i think ccp need to boost new characters with additional learning skills yet again like they did in rmrcharacter progression is supposed to be rewarding but there is nothing rewarding about training skills that just make your other skills train faster it feels like a painful waste of time but every single character is forced to do it if they are going to skill at all
i think we should be the first game community to get past using the dont make this wow quote when ever anyone posts something you dont like anyway i think a small hike would not be a horrible thing or perhaps something else in game that would give a slight boost make us earn it but make it available im sure it was much worse in the beginning but just because you had it rough doesnt mean everyone else should too besides training times were slower but there was also less to train for with all that has been added to the game over the last few years people will still need to specialize and spend time on support skills to really fly the ships they choose the idea is to find a happy medium between keeping existing players and attracting new ones the extremely long training times are one of the major reasons a lot of players leave before they ever really get started but yes 50game destruction imo
its and idea but noits ok for the new players but what about the veterans they have trained these skills for years and then the skill gets cut in half there gunna be enoyed that noobs can train the vets skills in half the time it took them
if you are gonna give me 45 million skill points to distribute can i get a free titan skill book too pleasesorry mate but your idea sucks i know long training times are boring wait till you want to max out marauders or all four races dreads to level 5 then you know boring 
skill training times need to be reduced by alot over the years things have got out of hand it used to be that no item or ship required anything higher then a skill at lvl 4 when they brought in tech 2 things got sillyim surprised at all the people claiming the time delay is a good thing i wonder how many of them have learning skills and implantsmy opinion is that being able to train some of those prerequisite skills to lvl 5 while i was taking a break from the game made the whole situation almost bearableccps new pay to train policy is the straw that broke the camels back
no they are directly related with ghost training and a skill que people would be able to train for an incredibly long time without paying now there is no ghost training so that is no longer an argument against a skill que paying customers have every right to some for of a que
there is no such thing as training boredom you are bored do something else while youre waiting for longish skills to trainyou cant have exhausted all of your eve options during your limited time in eve go have fun and be glad eve releases you from having to grind exp to advance your charactersalso if youre really dismayed by a mere 3 months of training to get 3 classes of ships open to you eve may not be for you longterm just wait until you have only 1 months per skill level waiting for you
t2 salvagers would be nice with an increased access difficulty bonus or longer range and possibly scripts for both i would also like to see t2 small tractor beams in addition to medium and large more range but intended for cruiserbattleship i would also like to see an item possibly modify the tractor beam interface with scripts or something to push an item to another ship to resupply it with ammo or other goods that it requires this could possibly lead to an ammo supply and production ship that could make and store ammo out of range of a pos and transfer it to ships engaged in combat hope this is the direction you are looking for tchell  i know i went a little off subjectedit scripts for salvagers
sure why not

hino i was not stupid enough to get scammed and so this is not a whining threadi am simply annoyed by these 1001 scammers in eve they are even getting more annoying then the few isk sellers that are still alive in evein jita it is simply impossible to do any serious trade talk in local because of the flood of scams offering a normal ship as navy issue get back 10x the isk if you send me isk selling bpcs as bpos etcif it would be against the eula you could simply petition these idiots and after a while only serious trade chat will happen hopefully currently all you can do is block them but you still see the discussions and warnings about their scamsi guess i know why it is currently not against the eula because it will be a lot of work for ccp but i think placing one gm into jita and watching the incoming petitions is enough and it will get less after while and the game fun would increase a bitregardszyrus
you obviously dont do any serious trading or youd already know the answer to this one join the specific channelothers have to read posts about useless crap they dont want so why wouldnt you even if something is being sold as a scam its still a sale and viable isk for the seller and buyer the world is harsh place  and its buyer bewareheres an idea make jita local free without the ability for anyone to post up in local then you dont have any issue
in soviet russia scammers make you an eula violationbut in all seriousness scammers have just as much right to use the market as you im sure they feel that your legitimate orders are hurting their business and would like to see you banned but they dont go making crap threads about it on the forums the only thing i would support would be an option not to display local chat if you dont want to read it
this topic is being opened anew every few weeks sighok scammers are the social most negative bottom of the barrel of the pod pilots communityso what if they wouldnt be hugging their personal hangar 237 you would hunt them down like you do with overly annoying griefers or even pirates that you have a problem with unfortunately enough you cant shoot anyone whos docked bad luckeve is about being smart enough to survive and make a living in its universeas a result scammers have the same right of existance as anyone has who leads hisher life in eve conducting piracy which is an essential part of our universe or finding stuff even before someone else has lost itas soon as it leaves the borders of this universe oog it is against the eula automatically anywayig actions within the coc should never ever have any influence on a players accountmaybe one day a system of ig trials and indictments on characters is introduced that day the population itself would hunt these antipilots  with ingame meansuntil that day or a solid proposal for exactly that kind of system arrives here nay
scammers are sad peoplebut we shouldnt make it an eula violation i think we shouldnt make darwins theory completely worthless yet
says the member from the conservative shenanigans party
scamming is a legit business practice in eve there is a saying that there is a sucker born every minute on eve id say it was a bit more often scammers generally succeed due to player greed they think they are getting a great deal or the scammer has made a mistake etc and snap it up without really looking ccp take steps to stop practises that are eula violations or exploits of mechanicsscammers are actually quite inventive sometimes additionally once you get scammed for a fair chunk of isk you get very cautious etc which sets you up in the longer runarithron
just because i have a funny corp name doesnt make me a scammer far from i do by no means condone scamming neither does the corp my pvp character is invetobut i still think most scammers are sad
2 words ignore them the ignore tool is so wonderful
i dont think that ccp should divert resources to deal with scammers we can use those gm for other things
there are tools in place to ensure you dont get scammed take the extra couple of seconds to use them and stop being lazyoh and get over it
you might have misunderstood my comment however i understand how that happened what i should have said was i guess scamming is too conservative a shenanigan for you or your corp to dabble in to make my point clearer
gets a 1 anyway
maybe it is the 1 issue in minmatar factional warfare because the amarr recognize the mechanic and take advantage of it clearly it doesnt matter on the gallentecaldari front or nennamaila would probably be back in caldari hands or more systems in black rise would be owned by the gallentewhile yes it is a problem and should be addressed it is far from the 1 issue in factional warfare
cant say i like the idea of making pvp any less likely
carrier with intys pilots inside would be fun to jump 
i agree that the qr patch is a failure this is the big boost to industry theyve been promising for quite some time and what do we get out of it for us industrialists a single new ship redesigned haulers and a small upgrade to fix t2 mineral hogging sheesh rmr and rev had more upgrades for industry than this patch doesthe nano fix is needed but i feel that ccp is swatting a fly with a nuclear bomb the fix doesnt need to be this big  affecting 90 of the ships in the game  it just needs to fix a problem with gunswebsetccertifications arent honestly all that useful although they are a step in the right direction needing to have mining drones very limited value for some of the droneharvesting certifications is a joke as well as needing to know both armor and shield tanking just to get a basic tanking certificationthe etc trading method while somewhat alright has jacked the value of etcs up even higher than the previous threshold instead of giving us new etcs to use they instead make it so you can make more money and give players less options by skipping the forum system all togetherim sorry for the longwinded whine post but i feel that qr is a disaster of a patch if only for the fact that its a huge industrial patch that has little to do with industry whatsoever while theyre not going to roll it back they do need to give us an actual industrial patch and not this halfhearted attempt im hoping for a qr 2 like rev had
this is the truthi wont support the topic but this is no industrial patch

i support his choice to not help i was just forced to put lights up on the roof way to early for that i felt pretty gay the whole time
have to agree with the op i dont think he means item or skills boosts he means content pvp in the beginning stages is really nonexistent gate camping really only gets you so far i love the concepts behind this game but the fighting really needs to have more to it than gank warfare keep everything the same but add some purpose to it if you cant keep new players interested then you cant keep them periodthe op doesnt propose any changes to game mechanics or skill progression he just wants more accessibility i want to join a major corp because i like what they are about not because i feel i have to that takes time to find in any game and in the meantime id like to have fun playingfahtim how can you find a niche if you have limited opportunities to explore the roles
just voted moge de beste winnen
shoot someone in high sec get concorded flip someone in high sec its up to you to enforce the law why should an aggressive act have no immediate consequences for the canflipper other than the possibility of getting shot at canflippers are jonesing for a fight often against someone inferior to them so that their epeen can grow i watch them often they will warp in with a passive targeter ship scan go back to station refit then return to flip my suggestion is simply this so called canflipper should take a security hit for engaging in aggressive behavior everyone gets to keep their cherished mechanism like suicide ganking the penalties will get stiffer as you transition from low sec to high sec and also based on the standing difference between the flipper and the victim
not working well atm people seemed to of stopped fighting back 
lolwut we err mean they warp in get a bm warpout wait a min or two then warp back in on can there is not much point in knowing how many mining upgrades or miner 2s the target has

as we enter the last week its really time toget out the vote and get charlie into the chair positioni of course support my friend and cohost lavista vista2 from me
hello lavista and good luck on your campaigni am hoping that this session you will champion the issues related to industry as you appeared to do the last timei do have one particular bit of pork i am interested inremote refining and remote reprocessingit seems so great that i can remote purchase things like blueprints and even remote research them i can set up a remote manufacturing orders and remote sell orders i can even remotely manipulate the price i am requestingto keep this process at its most efficient level i need to purchase refined materials it would be the grand link in the manufacturing chain to set up orders to by raw ore or mission drops and remotely refine and reprocess them this way with good skills i can truly set up a trade empire that spans a region having to travel to the purchase location of raw materials to reprocess or refine seems to water down the benefit i gain from all those remote skills refined minerals and ice products also fit nicely into those undersized courier contracts but that is another issue for another daywell enough begginggood luckpatrips you have my vote
you got one of my votes while i not always agree with youre views you seem to have a bit of sanity during discussions and will listen to the other side and give a well thought out responce

ive slogged through the numerous blogs but have not been able to find a clear answer perhaps it is best to ask outrightwhat are the candidates views on solo gameplay
im a solo player so i might be a bit biased here but i think solo play should be a valid strategy in eve in pve industry as well as pvp the same goes for people that hang out in loose groups or small corporations i do not think that people should be forced into large corps or alliances to be successful of course we cannot expect all content in eve to be accessible by solo players but fortunately eve is a sandbox where people can set their own goals
can you be a bit more clear in what capacity of solo are you asking about
solo play in eve is good and there are opportunities to do well i solo play generally for missions tradingmarket activities industry and exploration however solo play pvp with the expectation that you can do it all the time and win is much harder since many players gather in small gangscoprs larger corps and alliances etc its unrealistic to expect to be able to compete with nonsolo players in pvp ultimately you will lose if the small gang etc know their business i dont think any players think this is unbalanced in any waythe nature of eve allows for all play styles teamwork and cooperation mean these types of players have an advantage over solo players straight off esp in combat activities its possible to solo play all areas it just might not be a good idea if you worry about coststake carearithron
i think that playing as a solo player is a perfectly valid playstyle however i also believe that eve is at its core a social game and that to be among the most successful at most there may be a few exceptions goals and tasks you do need and should need to be part of a group  depending upon the goal you may need to be part of a very large group to be really successful and this is as it should becertainly one can have fun playing solo and some things like missions are more suited towards solo play than others such as pvp  not that you cannot be successful at pvp as a solo player but being part of a group gives you an advantage as it rightfully should some things such as holding territory are and should be impossible or at least nearly impossible to achieve soloin sum solo play should not be discouraged or given disincentives however group play should be encouraged and rewarded
i enjoy solo piracy but im not really a pirate because i dont ransom and ive enough money that i dont care about the loot or losing ships its more about the challenge and im not really alone i run into solo fighters all the time theyre generally the people who will enter a belt and slug it out without calling for backupin the grand scheme of things were not considered very important for instance as a 1man corp i cannot even post in coad we hang around lowsec as we have no means of affecting 00 sovereignty any way the infrastructure of a 00 alliance is designed to be engaged by large fleets there is nothing for the solo hunter to do out thereand while i believe that one person should never be able to say dismantle delve on their own i still believe the resourceful individual should be able to become a thorn in the paw of the large 00 alliancescurrently this ability is reduced to sitting afk cloaked to irritate ratters so i felt this would be a good limitus test to determine which candidates to support
as a mainly solo player i think that solo play should be given the same attention as group play group play is currently encouraged in a few aspects which are understandable for mining but not for pvp with the focus on blob warfare and system siegesccp has hinted that they are looking for techniques to make sovereignty different and i feel this might also include the ability to be a pita for some groups by guerrilla warfare well have to see how ccp fares in the long run with this change but i personally feel that solo play should not be discouraged or encouraged but rather given an equal platform option
unfortunately for you i do not think that this is going to be possible within the framework of eve if you design a system by which a single individual can become a thorn in the pay of a large 00 alliance then coordinated actions would be near impossible to defend againstcurrently the only way that a single player can become a thorn in the side of a large 00 alliance is by flying under the radar there is simply nothing that can be created within the framework of 00 where anyone can attack anything anywhere for any reason that a single player can become a hindrance to many the many will simply group up and solve their problem by shooting it until it doesnt movethat doesnt mean there should not be things for individuals do do but it does mean that no one will be able to design a system to do what you want without ruining the game for everyone else they types of things that solo players are able to achieve without breaking the system mainly amount to logistics and production interdiction these arent changing any time soon though hopefully we can get some sensible changes in that would increase the strength of these types of operationsin terms of promoting offensive solo play the only real and productive way to do that is to promote player activity into lowsec and the surrounding areas in these areas there is little to no infrastructure advantage which is what drives the main advantage in 00 without that advantage solo pirateseven if they dont ransom can thrive it might also be possible to have npc 00 style with more station density but youre looking at a lot of reward needed to draw people out there
sadly i agree though it seems silly that to have any affect upon the political structures of eve i must submit to becoming a faceless member of a blob as le skunk once put it part of the fcs extended dronebay the individual unless an alliance head has no importance hereunfortunately that means cloakyafk games trying to pick off a ratter or miner but understand that this is on an individual scale the target loses a ship but the 00 alliance is not hurt given the ability to easily jump goods from empire logistical lines cannot be harmed only if all ice belts were removed from empire would you start seeing some gaps in the alliance armor until that time comes they are untouchable and that breaks the whole risk vs reward most pilots play lipservice toto what purpose weve all been in syndicate at some point from the solo fighter perspective it is no different than any other patch of 00 blobs rule this game as long as 00 alliances are able to feed off empire and easily and safely truck the goods back to 00 there will never exist the ability for solo or even wolfpacks to damage the alliance logistical lines are not vulnerable these days and therefore cannot be harassed i appreciate the responses here thank you for taking the time to reply
it really depends on what youre doing you can mission with one player you cant conquer a region with one player obviously those are both necessary you dont want to exclude people from playing because their friends arent around but there are some things a solo player simply cannot do at present i think that balance is about right  the primary forms of moneymaking are soloable and pvp can be done solo with some success but both generally gain in effectiveness with gangs industry is actually far too solooriented given that the only groups there outside the real high end tend to be either buddies who group for chatting or alts with 10 extra lines but mining and combat professions are balanced basically properly between solo and group gameplayi see what youre saying but as was said above theres limits in how far you can go with that yeah you can gank the odd hulk but can you really justify a system whereby one player can do more than that without need for extreme amounts of player skill any serious alliance should be able to hunt and kill one player somehow  not instantly but effectively enough over time
answer this question where do 00 alliances get the lions share of their needed ice products thats right from empire jumped back to 00 safelynearly every candidate here has mentioned a desire to reinvigorate lowsec and support small gang warfare i believe the answer to this is to remove ice belts from empire restricting all ice harvesting to lowsec and 00then pilots would be able to affect logistical efforts by targeting macks and hulks in lowsec and 00 and then you would see increased corp presence in lowsec large 00 alliances would have a tool to use against rival alliances disrupting their supply lines which could also be turned against them they must protect their minersyou dont have to rewrite sovereignty mechanics you simply have to open up some vulnerabilities in the process of fueling towersattacking ratters does nothing to harm the target alliance but if they were forced to gasp actually defend material acquisition forces youd see a more interesting game

little update  the fleet battles since patch have been vastly improved on the lag sidethe memory leak becomes a new lag priority but this seems naively a simpler task than fixing lagedit  but tonight it is awful everywhere
for canidatesgive a quick one sentence summary of what you think is biggest concernissue in eve
many candidates have already answered the above question herei hope that i have given you the information you needed to choose
sure there are  minmatar hics
there are those min ships but i dont think that was what she was referring too upon reflection and linking changes for low sec to encourage players there i would like to see most ore types moved to low sec from empire im not in favour of mining becoming more low risk than it currently is in empire or better rewards for miners that choose to stay in empire if you want better rewards you need to take risksarithron
worst case scenario there would be 6 months of no issues being raised to ccp that were relevant remember that the csm raises issues and recommends solutions and priorities to ccp ccp still make up their own mind about what tonot doin particular when it comes to balancing the game ccp are pretty careful and stubborn about their approach to it what could change is the priority with which empire00 were treated which could potentially have a negative effect but unlikely to advantage a single factionalliance
its not an issue as the csm has no legislative power yes goonswarm as a political party could get every single seat on the csm but unless they make decent decisions that the devs agree with its irrelevent any more than 1 candidate for an alliance nets no advantage for the alliance its actually a pretty good system the devs have an absolute requirement for the game to suceed and if the csm aids that all is well if it doesnt nothing is lost edit chribba got an orca today thanks to the csm giving a great case to ccp for the ships worth there are numerous other examples of the csms relevance
apart from 00 politics you should vote for the one you like the one who shares your grudges and visions the one having ideas and knowledge about what he wants to changeget the csm out of 00 stuff csm is an installation to give a more precise players view on current game mechanics so ccp can draw conclusions out of it and change the game for the betterso what matters is not 00 politics its the fun for everyone playing this gamemight it be goon nc reds bob or whoever vote for the guy working for the game to evolve not for the guy boosting your shipalliancei am a gbc guy and voted for a goon did so last time too not because i like goons but cause i like the ideas and the way my candidate presents stuff approaches issues etcbest guy for best job if i think a certain char is representing my needs i vote for him regardless of his 00 affiliationedit chribba can have a titan to mine with result would be more lovecans
i would have to say that the quantum rise patch is a step in the right direction for some things but a travesty for otheers the following information was already posted on a different thread but ill repost it here so you can see what my opinions are
vote prom i did o
seeing this quote does make me change my mind on the matter i skimmed through the thread and didnt see this until now but a change like that would be a good one and fair to both the killer and the killed
the problem i see with the whole situation is the fact that if the thief was in a non npc corp their corp could be war decced and you could take action against them without concord assisting them by shooting you i would say that these pilots who no doubt have alts in player corps are actually hiding behind the fact that you cant war dec npc corps it is really more of a high sec issue because of that low security doesnt have concord roaming about willing to pod you for looting the wreck of a legitamate fight
the fact alone that pvp wreck and npc wrecks aggro different are enough to warrant change imojust like npc wrecks anyone can salvage but the l00t belongs to those who killed him i would say it should be aggrod to the person who laid the final blow it at least gives the l00t theives a chance since in of itself can be considered a profession albeit not high on the totem pole of peoples viewsstill this needs fixedchanged
some points to the gunnery skill treeright click and train
thats not adapting our missiles sucked before they suck harder now and we want them to suck just a bit less
that wont work you have to have rationality to understand such things
my major problem with the whole missile adjustment and the way that has been handled is the fact that most of the other races normally are fitting a web in a midslot and 910 wont be comprimising their tank caldari ships to me are suppossed to be damage and tank ships because we really dont have the same versatility in fittings for midslots as most webs and target painters happen to fit in midslots which is where our tank is suppossed to be where as armour tankers have their tank in low slots sure i would happily fit a low slot target painter or web and happily take out a damage mod missiles have never been a i win button in pvp and a battleship isnt exactly a fast target and really is bigger than the barn door so why shouldnt another battleship be able to hit for full volley damage at a stand still with no mods fitted on the ship being attacked whether it is caldari minnie gallente or amarr i dont think it should go back to what it was but some adjustment is neccessary
oh only for pvp i only need a scrambledisruptabmwdwebpainterpainterthats ony 45 med slots on a shield tanking ship with 6 med slot i got 2 uber med slot left for tank ois that a joke if ccp dont wanna change a bit i didnt say remove the current nerf to missile change the tank of caldari ship  makes them armor tankgime caldari ship with a layout more low slot less med slot that allow armor tank and ill stopped complaininga raven with 4 med 7 low would be fair
or low slot equivelants of webber scram painters actually wait would it be easier just to add an extra mid slot
one extra mid slot for all caldari missile boatsamen
both statements are correct for me if you dont do anything about the missile nerf at least give us the possibility to web scram paint and have a speed without sacrifying to much tank like the other races can do without sacrifying anythingor just fix the missile nerf and leave us as we were before but at least do something it s obviously to much and plz if you have nothing to do in this topic but say yes missiles are ok as they are now all caldari pilots should train gunnery then plz go to make another topic and expose your arguements but stop spamming this one with  for a clear readability of the problems exposed
without sacrificing anything are you stupidthey sacrifice their 3 damage mods that all medium and large caldari missile boats can fit without any issues whatsoeverthats one of the fundamental differences between shield tankign and armor tanking boatsthere actually exists armortanking missile boats in the game if you want to tackletankmissile then you need a typhoon a sacrelidge a vengeance a damnation etcif you want to shield tank missile boats if you want to 3bcugankmissiletank then you need to pick ravencerbdrakenh and leave out the tackle everyone whined they couldnt fit tackleshield tank before but accepted it and worked in gangs now you need more support mods and you whine that you cant fit them all solo is dead im sorry its like this because it sucks for other races too and indeed more but if you want to solo in a large ship that train has sailedif you are in a gang webs and painters help everyone

hey smart ass lets see what you have added to our knowledge else then i m stupid jhmm nothingi m playing this game for around 5 years and knows what to do with caldari ships as i m ony caldari trained but you still didnt understand the issue here i was saying what about ppl who are only caldari trained by your exemple you ssy if you want to fit a point web mwd etc you need to cross trainwell the whole fckn point of this topic is why caldari cant be self sufficient why we have to cross train now not 3 years ago or 2 when i was maxing my skills to fly caldari ships effectively why if you train only gallente or amar or minmatar you survive but with caldari you cant do nothing on your own  those were the questions and you enlightened us by saying there s other missile boats then caldari and they r using armor so use them woooow and solo is not dead at all many ppl still loving and doing it maybe you dont but it doesnt make it dead you can easily solo with minmatar before and after the patch you can solo in amar in gallente  even i heurd some ppl whining about  but when you cant fit a point your target can flee when you cantwhen you cant web them your cruise missiles do 24 dmg with all missile skills at 5 and spec 4 to an heavy assault who dont have ab or mwd on he laugh at you and continues to kill you slowly while arbiting you again without anyspeed modulewhen you cant approach him coz you are slow you cant web him or even point so you need a speed modwith the nerf you need a painter to make more then 20 ish dmgso if your answear to all those questions is use typhoon a sacrelidge a vengeance a damnation etc  you simply say train something else then caldari well thats the whole point here mr einsteinedit  well so gallente bss and tempests abbadons have dmg bonuses if i remember well maelstrom has shield boost bonus and abbadon shield resist dmg that makes you think about missing dmg mods or tank mods on low slots
i fly a mega on my other character it still solos exactly the same as it always has still has 1100dps and the same tank as my raven 930dps with torps still tackles fine can fit a sensor booster which my raven cant without changing my tank did i mention thats with 2 damage mods in that mega fit compared to 3 in my raven for more dpsmissile ships werent over powered before the patch they most definately are now under poweredi would think that because i have a character for each race that at the equivelant training and ship i am not particularly wanting one ship to pwn them all i just want it to be able to fullfill its role an extra midslot was needed before the update definately needed a lot more now
no youre doing it wrong when i say if you want tacklemissile choose typhoon or sacrelidge i do not mean caldari suck but its balacned cos you can cross train that would not be right all races should have value in their own rightwhen i say use sacrlidge if you want this it means if you had wanted the versatility of tackle and tank then you should have chosen early to do x if you choose y you need to play like y are good at  in this case caldari in a gangits not y sucks train x its if you want to play like x train x dont choose y then try to play it like x then moan like a whiny  when it suckscaldari have never been good at solo on their big missile boats you can argue away but the truth is that all solo got a big nerf and might as well be dead you are wrong if you think missiles arent balanced because of a difficulty of soloing on certain boats on one race why cant they be selfsufficient well why should they all races are different i neednt remind you that you have turret boats and fast boats as well your last point is nonsense all missile boats have rof or damage bonuses or both
yes i m clearly saying i want to fit a scrambler and web and tank and dmg which is my right as all of the other races lol if you had wanted the versatility of tackle and tank then you should have chosen early to do x when i choosed caldari you could hang around in a torp raven with only 1 scram and no other rubishness and have a proper pvp kill ships or any size or lose your ship to another ship who s doing the same thing as you so i choosed the x many years ago maxed the skills and then x become z and later today it become y that you are talkin about so these skills and sps are wasted today is that clear if not read odessimas post right above you cant not understand mine quote  why cant they be selfsufficient well why should they all races are different are you serious how long you have been in this game to decide what role caldari have or to decide what role it should have i tell you it was possible to have a proper pvp around in a bs or bc whatever you want with only 1 scram  web and shield tank it wasnt wrote on caldari ships like  if you wanna fly this you will need some other support ships to scram web and paint if you dont have that sit in a station that is new atleast the fact it got worst is newevery race in this game can and should be able to be self sufficient which means scram web tank and dmg  not beeing the best on everything but do everything tanking and making dmg while able to scram is not a race specific fact it s duable for 34 of the races in the game and it was like this for the 4th one as well but now not anymore so stop saying that caldari cant fly alone or shouldnt scram web and tank or shoudnt do better dmg and dont try to fix it some roles from your mind drakes nhs ravens cerbs were self sufficient ships nh drakes and cerbs weremaybe still are able to make somethings on their own as they have resist bonuss they can fit scram or speed mods but the dmg become crap for them this timeme stops here argueing with you you have everything infront of your eyes to understand if you want to understand but if you dont it s not becoz you are right missiles are perfect as they are and not underpowered at all or caldari should not scram web or use speed and tank at same time it s one or another for them wtf 
never thought id say this to a tri butthread
thumbs downi find it funny all the ones saying how they are leaving because they cant ghost train anymore even though in a majority of causes ccp wont miss it because they werent paying for it anyway except when their long skill has finally finished and have to log in to change it againfor the ones with multiple accounts it is a bit of a problem but i would think with the ability to have 3 characters logged into game there is a fair bit of opportunity to run missions mine build to make enough isk to buy gtcs fairly easilyi dont agree with account deletion after 3 months someone mentioned it above because if you are deployed get sick or otherwise unable to access your account it would be unfair to come back and have to start over againoh yeah and i have 3 accounts and i pay for all of them i dont expect free skill trains
uggh
new players best way to catch up is to  off the older players so that they leave the game which is exactly what ccp seems to be doing

i hate 2 hours travels to unload ammo so you have my support

with the introduction of certificates eve is one step closer to a proper training plan which can then be queued accordinglyie set train to elite whatever and just let the certificate prerequisites automatically train
one of many necessary ui fixes but probably the most obvious the location of trash it on the menus has alone probably claimed tens of billions of isk worth of stuff over the course of this game not that i pity those people too much but its still terrible design
being a new player myself i had been wondering as to why exactly the menus had been so disorganized and seeming to change based on what you clicked i support this and hope to see it in the game soon
yup theres a few support modules that should be stackable salvagers chief among them just so long as we dont forget the othersmost notably neuts when this gets implemented
nice notion and i can see uses for it
absolutely
my partner and i both do this all the time its damned irritating when your choices are be annoyed at eve for interrupting the rest of your life or be annoyed at eve because you lost training time
here here
as a drone user i feel that the faction drones both augmented and integrated are worse than standardt2 drone version thank to the split damage in missions and where you will be using drones that cost several millions each if not in missions the split damage is a drawback not a bonus the other stats are slightly better than the commonly produced versions but not enough to make them worthwhileto make them worthwhile there are two ways make them and the components much more common and easy to find so making a low cost faction item that will be used and brought regularly an in large quantitiesor keep them as rare as today but making them much more powerful
just like most faction shipskeep them as they are now rare and pointless bling for your hangar
support however drone region has been useless since its birth in eve to make you feel a little better serprentise spawns are equally as useless take a little gratitude that gallante and drone 00 space is not saught after for hostile take over 237
im fine with annually might make it better tbh more special n stuff

annual is fine by me i like evetv but learn when to say dudes free ride is over if they want to commentate so bad make them pay for the ticket and hotel one of the coolest things ive ever been able to rub in the wow s at work is that eve has a live pvp slugfest anyone here gonna disagree that the tri v ev0ke fight wasnt fn epic granted we all see it now and think damn dude shoulda killed the ruppie when u had the chance but when it was happening live well it was epic
hell ing yeah babywildcat

in missions missiles have received a boost in qr group the launchers of your cnr and npcs fire 7 times less defender missiles not signedbtw get a megathron fit railguns and try hitting frigs
so whit this ccp should double my skill points  if dont double my sp i dont agree whit this
there is more to the game than sitting in the station and waiting for a skill to get to lvl 5 do you see the undock button in the bottom left of your screen
what the new players dont seem to understand even if you take away the obvious selfishness of the older player in not wanting it changed because they didnt get it to me really you would loose a sense of accomplishment when you actually trained the longer skills battleship 5 anyone in 22daysthen you have the fact that quite a few people really dont understand proper tactics that early on combined with the fact that actually being able to fly a battleship hac or really any t2 ship becomes old real quick if your loosing it all the time because even though you have the skills to fly it you really cant anyway because you havent got the know how to fly your u beaut battleshipi quite often fly smaller ships and still find them fun to fly and actually more challenging when running missions because running level 3s in a drake or lvl 4s in a raven becomes very mechanical and not really that much of a challengepvp wise sure you can dash out in your brand new battle ship into pvp and you will probably loose it inside 10mins even with a good fitting it realy doesnt mean you know how to use the ship at alleverytime i see one of these posts it just seems to me that op wants everything other people worked for straight away to me there is nothing wrong with the people against it its the people who dont have the patience that are really asking for a little to muchyou can significantly reduce your skill times by actually training your learning skills and implants in the beginningi have a lot of loooooooooooooonggggg skills to train and i dont want it changed at allbtw is that dapto as in aus
bah another training whine let me help you a ton with the new patch train frig to 5 train assault ships to 5 fit small guns or missles equip with armor repper or shield booster and a after burner roughly 30 days of training and extremely effetive in doing something if not pay your dues like everyone elsefor instant gratification return to wow
one other thing just noticed there are no t2 drone mods ie drone link aug drone navigation and the trackingopti one cant remember the name at the moment
please provide 30day gtcs to give players more flexibility in managing their reallife and ingame cash flow
what industry standards is ccp following in implementing this change other than greed
i suggest you stop whining and look up 30 day pilots license extension on your local markettake carearithron
yes lets make scamming a eula violation and lying and theft andoh wait a secondyes your idea is that stupidthe basic scam is just that the moment it involves accessing someone elses account or real money transaction is when its a eula violation
1  there are people who are stupid enough to fall for the most obvious of scams i say they deserve to lose their isk2  i was attracted to eve because i heard about the eve intergalactic bank scam3  how would you define a scam so that players and gms could easily agree if something is a scam when given the same information so i say no if you fall for the scams you deserve it if you cant stand the spam just have local minimized until you leave jita
if its too good to be true then it usually isif it walks like a duck quacks like a duck and looks like a duckthen guess what its probably a duckthese are life lessons that have been pounded into our brains for the better part of our life and considering that eve is a intelligence heavy game and a lot of life principles can be brought here then i see scamming as a game mechanici do not promote nor do i scam myself i just feel that for the realism of the game in a cutthroat society with corporations and alliances constantly trying to better themselves and get ahead in the market that scamming should be totally legal if you look around in your own daytoday life how many scams are you presented with each day whether its that telemarketer or a new weightloss program or even a coworker trying to jew you out of something at work it happens to all of us and if we werent intelligent enough to understand and realize that these were scams then how would we make itexactly
ccp dooesnt allow scamming because it would be too much work to police it ccp alows scamming because thhey wanted to creat a sandbox a virtual world where everything is possible there is no reason in thier eyes why virtual crime shouldnt exist and i have to say i agree with themeve without its dark side and its virtual crime and its freedom of choice would not be eve personally i think that the harshness of the eve world is part of what attracts eve players to eve sure i dont much like scammers myself and yes they are probably the lowest of the low but no i dont think its ccps job to police them if anything they help keep the comunity on its toes
ah now i get it 
there is risk in everything you do but if someone is stupid enough to fall for it its their fault just use the block function it exsists in this game for a reasonthen again you already stated all of this stuffthen what defines a scam overselling by accidently adding one 0 by a wtb for 200mil less than the item is considered worth at the time what about 100mil less or 50mil less where do you draw the lineto much grey area for you to stick eula against it and have accountscharacters banned for it supplydemand and suckers born everyday especially the idiots that buy isk then try to come and buy all the best faction so in some ways scammers are helping to clean the dirty isk bought by the rlm isk buyersthese are no longer the days of escrow now that was a scammers heaven to fall for a scam nowadays means you really deserved it in the first place if it wasnt profitable scammers wouldnt be doing it either pjust some things to think about for your flawed plan
scammers are necessary part ov eve to make stupid ppl emoragequit back to wow
look before you leap comes to mind lol
not going to bash the op but scamming in eve has been around since day one getting scammed sucks but logistically it would be near impossible for ccp to go back and put a stop to it not after the game has gone this far in its life
i agree that scamming is frightfully annoying but its a big part of human existance screw the other guy if you canthe only scam i would like to see resulting in instant permaban is when dealing with the new plex certs since they deal with realworld outofgame currency
claiming oh i made a mistake on my contract offer so it looks like a scam is another scam in its self scammers are like the child molesters of eve they prey on the weak i donlt think they should be banned however it would cause a serious reduction in whine threads between nerf patches
hello allim brand new to eve but am working hard to start a career in politics so figure i might petition some problems ive seen so far in the game one of them being how bonus expire during downtime im not sure if theyre supposed to do this but my missions have expired during dt and i would like to see mission times be halted once the servers go down this is a negative action to the player that he or she cannot control once the mission is accepted there is no way for a player to complete the mission and therefore shouldnt be punished since its not their fault that they were unable to complete the mission in a timely mannerwould love to hear everyones thoughts on thisthank you for your timecandy
for most combat missions the timer is long enough that any serious mission runner can do it with more than an hour to spare and if you cant finish it before dt dont accept it until after dtunless youre looking to kill everything twice to farm cash from a good mission i dont object in principle but i see no need for it
agreed further more all missions in my opinion give ample time to complete and collect bonus if you find you are having trouble completing missions period perhaps you need a better or more suited ship for the mission i f you are unable to do that i suggest lower level missions not needing to warp in and out to survive until your skills as a player develop
heh yes its a problem for people who actually want to play factional warfare rather than just get free wardeclarations
lol  minnies crying sadly because they cant blob us all day long and might actually have to fight outnumbered sometimes seriously guys cri moaredit to put it a different way in other words its not fair that the plexes spawn when we actually have a chance to capture plexes but having them spawn during the other 18 hours that you outnumber us is aok
i support this
much as the idea seems good for streamlining many things ccp has said that their database really does not like players inside players and as such it is very unlikely to happen
whut this lists as an industiral patch wait why am i laughing its sad
personally i think the ability to buysell kill rights would be a good adition to the gamewhen you have the right to kill someone why shouldnt you sell that rightit woulda  add bounty hunting into eve on a solo basisb  give people who are killed a bit of isk backan auction imo would be the best way to do this and at the end of the auction the kill right is transfered to the buyer and the person who can be killed gets a notification that the right has been sold but not to whomon a side note i didnt think flippers generated kill rights because he flips canyou can kill him for 15 minshe can kill you for 15 minsno kill right generated but i may be wrong
scorps  this guy cannot be killed by any mankrugerrand  i am no man
would it be possible to implement a filter on the star map to refine your agent searchinstead of show my available agents to allow you to pick say show level 4 only or level 3 only etcstaring at a bunch of small to large green globs and trying to read extra small text to see which system has what level agents for me is a bit of a nuisancenot sure if this has been suggested or not but it would be a nice tweaktldr put an agent refine search on the star map
this is not going to be a whine about battleship speed just some of the gates such as recon 23 are 80 km off the start point that takes about 10 min to cover in a bs these days even with an ab its about 5 some missions were changed to adjust the gate closer for the lower speed of battleships anyone else know of missions that are similar i seem to be geting the same after the qredit forgot some info
without the ability to can flip the market for deployable cargo containers would drop off to almost nothing theyd become near useless when a player can create a much larger one for free
so what you are requesting is the ability to remotely process thingsit makes sense to me in fact i think its really missing big time its certainly worth doingthats a quite solid issue i will make sure that its on my list for some of the things to do inside the first submission round when we go to ccp hq and talk to them
got my vote err 2
i love your signature
i take your point but i think youre being far too onedimensional with your solution mining ice is important but id rather see a broadbased solution to the problems of lowsec rather than just take one of a dozen things people do and wallop it with a nerfbat
they would after that change as well it would just increase prices if it caused any supply hicups in lowsec it would certainly get a number of people to move to lowsec but i am not sure its a comprehensive solution ill look into it
thanks ive posted a more detailed topic here
well i have always been a bit of a soloplayer in many aspects my daily life especially now with csm keeps me from playing for extended periods of time in order to make actual gangs so i soloplay a lotsolopvp is still alive its not not easy and it leaves you only the option of ganking poor targets but i guess that workspve is nice and solo friendly such a shame it just sux and is no funindustry is solo friendly and interesting i love itwe do need more highend industry however but thats a whole different topicsolopvp is viable and so it should be but eve is still a mmo its focused around gang warfare but it shouldnt limit it to that imo
have to say that i really dont understand people who pay 15mo to play solo there are many single player games out that provide a better single player experienceyes every player should be able to get to a certain point solo be able to replace their own ships buy some new modules and otherwise not be a destitute pod pilot however i think to get the best ships the craziest content and other high end items one should be forced to work with a team
the competitive environment is really what does it at least for me its one of the few games where it takes a reasonable amount of work to progress a reasonable amount thats quite unlike another game which has been quite a bit in the press recently with its new expansion
because i cannot resist hacking every single game that runs on my own pcand i seriously have not found any game worthy of buying since oblivion and i think that game sucked balls too and got bored with it after 3 days i finished the main storyline in two days and found it very unrewardingdwarf fortress is of course the best game ever but even on my nasapc it runs too slow to my tastes plus whatever i build now will be incompatible with the february update
actually im not surprised i get that a lot one of my pet peeves really its the challenge no ai can surpass a human being at the keyboard therefore no singleplayer game can provide the challenge of a mmoso why am i in a oneman corp because i believe flying solo in the pirate hubs not going after ratters but targeting people who want to fight and sometimes bring friends is far more challenging than traveling around in groups calling primaries and wondering if your lock will complete before the target vaporizes but given the response to my post in gd i have to say i get the feeling im the oddity in eve anyway thank you for the replies i have enough information to make my voting selection good luck to all you guysgals
this sounds like a really excellent idearight now the 00 alliances are extremely monolithic probably the biggest barrier to new players in eve 6 mos to a year old is the inability to do anything past low sec unless they are willing to put themselves under the thumb of a 00 alliance  and they frequently dont have the connections to achieve thattake a section of space away from a 00 even if its not being used forget it taking out even a small tower doesnt automatically require cap ships but it comes pretty close the one tower i have on my killboard took more than a hundred ships a long time to killperhaps another thing that would help the game would be to make towers more of a liability something that requires protection rather than something that provides it almost flawlessly
nice ideas especialy agree with the lack of ingame events one thing you might want to mention is the recent merging of the ingame events forums and out of game player gatherings this further compounds the fact the ingame events never happenperhaps you could suggest a support system for helping players wanting to create ingame events coming from a rp corp ive thought about starting afew but been put off by the fact that without any offical backing any attempt is unlikely to be taken seriouslyim going to sound stupid here but what exactly is blobing and why is everyone so opposed to it
i hope this is soon something of the pastbasically blob warfare stricto sensus used to be defined by the ability to field 23 of a node capacity or more to prevent any fight to happenthis is now more or less gone but still conquering a system is a matter of numbers large numbers can be boring sapparently sov is under heavy reconstruction and i hope the csm will be involved in overlooking at least the new system
i hope you guys remember this thread as the council chair has to have authorityroberts rules of order already exist dont reinvent the wheelak
the csm does not use roberts rules and likely being a small body does not need it even then roberts rules are administrative and if no one will cooperate with that administration then they will not workthe council chair arranges meetings and moves along the meeting discussion that is all it has no authority
small bodies are just as capable of petty infighting and stubborn disagreements as large bodies aremy time on the student senate taught me that roberts rules are invaluable and that we should definitely use them on the csm
asuri as far as the csm is concerned rro does not exist gou as far as im concerned they should ive run a group before where the rules of order consisted entirely of dont be a jerk and that functioned in perfect harmony doing so and hey that works great for a group of buddies running a campus club whose primary activity consists of weekly trips to the pub however ive also been on groups where debates over who could do what when have gotten to rather extreme levels in the case where rro was in place and understood by all parties it merely created longterm adversaries in the case where it wasnt it led to people ragequitting groups that had been their life up until then and physical violence the former is bad the latter is far worse the csm is a group of egotistical geeks who only know each other from forum argument the fact that the first council had half a dozen lowlevel wars raging for its entire term of office surprises me not a bit when harmony is nonexistent you need to replace it with either bureaucracy or force of those choices i prefer bureaucracy and thus rules of order i dont like the need for it but i dont see the world through rosetinted glasses rules of order make groups function better small or large and theyre necessary for any but the most peaceful group that wants to consider itself wellrun as for the role of the chair that can be debated  nobody has said what the rules would have to be rro has just been an assumption even if you dont like rro i hope you can agree on the need for some kind of rules to exist
as an update this channel is still live and a good number of csm candidates are in it much of the time  right now there are 8 of us other candidates and noncandidates alike are certainly welcome
its what you said but its not what you were discussing unless you were discussing how to be completely unrealistic in your goals and expectations seriously youre going to develop a pvp system for use in miningbecause of the framework of the system because there is no direct player competition any such variables will not be acted upon and simply be random returns any variables that can be acted upon will those naturally effected by scarcitywhat in the world does this have to do with what you quoted if all the belts are mined dry then people can go to exploration if all the exploration sites are found then people have to go to lowsec or 00this is the driving force created by scarcity and is good for the gamehave you ever designed a completely dynamic system so there is no direct pattern to do something so terribly simple are you going to introduce minigames into eve how do these systems interact with the riskreward modelyour ravings and rantings are ridiculous and nearly incomprehensible we started out discussing why a small gradient between 00 and empire was bad and you claimed you wanted to boost empire mining we explained why that was dumb and you have now gone off into lala land about completely overhauling a system in a manner which is pretty much impossible while possibly reneging on your original claim
i was directly responding toso we were discussing mining mechanics and pvp mechanics it was you that suddenly went raving about pve afk missions which had nothing to do with what we were discussingand where did i say i want a pvp system in mining what the hell are you referring to maybe if what i say does not make sense in your head its not what i said at allof course they will be acted upon if the system was the thing that introduced these variables in the first place as the return is part of the variable outcomebecause wasting time looking for ore that is not there is not good gameplay if players want to mine they should be able to mine immediately it is fine if all highend ore is hard to find but it is not fine if all ore in the system is simply gone within a few hours after it spawnsthe riskreward equation is incompletethere are other models as well timereward skillreward effortrewardnot all activities in eve are or should necessarily be linked to riskright now the problem with the pve activities in eve are that they are all static missions are always the same exploration sites are the same people know what to expect if these systems were modular and dynamic then this would provide players with new experiences and challenges all the timeif you take the mining beam modulation example which i said several times was and example not something i actually want that would be a minigame of sorts the challenge with those is to make them interesting and nonrepetetive players do not want to play the same silly minigame for hours and hours just to get some ore thats why i proposed to have these things as optional players can use the same mining mechanics as we have today and alttab out if they like but if they want to uncover special stuff they have to put more effort into it effortreward that is what i would like to see special stuff being able to be uncovered on occasion through mining if the miner is putting some effort and attention into itspeak of yourself and why is it dumb to have morebetter roids in empire
no they do unless we arent discussing the system by which mining occurs you responded with a non sequitur and changed the the discussion the system by which pvp happens doesnt relate to whether or not the system had changed his logic was correctthe only way that bringing up these differences between mining and pvp could possibly have made any sense whatsoever was if you were claiming that these were the things you could do with miningbut you then mentioned how you cant do afk combat now youre now claiming that there is some system by which we can make mining like combat and have it not be boring by comparing an activity played against humans to an activity played against a computer while ignoring the main difference between activities played against humans to those played against computersi am sorry eve is not a single player game if people want to mine and everything is mined out then they can go to lowsec or 00 scarcity is one of the primary driving factors in eve miners the first cog in the economic system should understand thiswhat its impossible to divorce any activity from risk risk is a factor in everything you do its a factor in everything you do in real life its a factor in everything you do in your virtual life it is impossible to divorce actions with risk because risk is defined as the chances of adverse effects if those chances are zero then risk is still a factor in your decisions it simply has no modifying effectif you increase risk effort time or barrier to entry without increasing reward the amount of people partaking in that activity will go down this is just basic human decision making its no other models its a single model that incorporates all those factors ahh yes all we have to do is develop a modular and dynamic mission and mining system congratulations give yourself a star now if we just ignore all the reasons for why we cant easily create a modular and dynamic mission and mining system we will be well on our way to declaring victory over the problembecause then no one will mine in lowsec00 because risk will increase and reward will not because people are risk adverse and we want to utilize space to its fullest to create a competitive and cooperative game rather than jamming people into safe space where they dont have to make these types of meta discussions
because highsec ore is too good asis the last thing we need is for it to be better
the only one changing the discussion is you with your totally irrelevant and nonproductive comments there wasnt any problem between me and herschelstrangely enough it wasnt even me that brought up the combat mechanicsi claimed you cant do afk pvp combatjust because there may be some differences between computer opponents or computerized mechanics and humans does not mean that computers cannot be challenging or interestingthat is no excuse people should not be forced into a specific playstyle if they do not want to playing in high security forever is a perfectly valid playstyle eves playerbase has expanded the abilities to mine ore has increased so its time the belts increase to matchoh really is there risk attached to progressing through skill training no  too bad i never claimed that there is no such thing as risk i only claimed that riskreward on its own is incomplete thats exactly what ive been sayingwhy couldnt weif one man can then why cant ccpwell too bad eve is a sandbox game and there are people out there that may have zero interest in competition or even cooperation and they are entitled to play this game in the way they likeyou speak of we but there certainly are people out there that do not want what you wantand there will always be those that are willing to take the risk to come out if the rewards are better one of my campaign points is to boost lowsec you know
sorry with better i meant larger as stated in my first post in this thread

best nerf ever
ok here is the thing bud a mega may have 1100dps on eft but the truth is you will never get 1100 dps in eve and not only that but the actual sweet spot for that dps is minute compared to the 30km ish range of torps not only that but there is plenty of ships in eve that cannot solo well the raven is just one of themmissiles may get a reduction in dmg due to speed and sig but then gunships get a reduction of dps depending massively on range and transversal speed
i agree with dierdra vaals original post that empire wars needs some changes im a ceo of 3 months old corporation and we have been wardeced by griefer corp for last two months it seems it will be neverending war our new corporation in empire was soon wardeced by griefers that time we had many new players joined in our corporation it made our operations very hard after two months the war is still on but enemy gets less and less kills we do not want to pay pirate scums any isk so probably the war will continue forever this sucki would like to see some changes in wardec example after few weeks price for keeping the war on should double each week until it will end another problem is that usually griefers are not after the money they have plenty of money and just try to make playing for new players miserable no wonder why eve is considered hard for new players and many quit after a month or two please ccp do something for neverending wardecs in empire
eve wardeccing is now that aggressor pays the war how about if a new corp or maybe any corp could pay for protectionif your corp is in caldari empire why not to be able to pay insurance money for caldary navy if you are wardeced then caldari navy will help your corp in war after few months insurance money should increase significantly to make it more expensive for older corporations example a new corporation could pay only 2mweek for insurance 1 month old 5mweek and over 6 month old 50mweeki believe a system like this for new corp would definately make grieferes think twice about wardeccing a newbie corp some highsec corporations could think paying hundreds of millions every month is a good price for not getting wardecced we need a stromger police or somekind of higher author in empire
i disagree completely with the op the amount of time a pos manager put into setting up a pos shouldnt be shorter than the time it takes to destroy itbest argument i can put forth is the issue of people like goonswarm knowing full well they can take advantage of any leeway given on this subject to ninja a deathstar into somewhere theyd normally never get away with sort of like sticking yer tongue out and making a raspberry since it would take them way less time and effort needing only one person to impact a great many more players negativelywhich is what goonswarm pride themselves in is it not
last time i anchored a death star i was happy when a dread fleet unanchored it for me ccp allow cooperation when anchoring modules stacking penalty when anchoring n modules eve supposed be a multiplayer online game not a linear batch script add skills decreasing anchoring time
the nerf of unsubbed training has been the most illadvised and destructive change ccp has made to eve in the 212 years i have been in the game like many others i am reducing the  i send to ccp from the 1620 annualized when all my accounts were active as they were when the nerf was announced
do it
this may have been mentioned before but i didnt feel like searching through 12 pages of postes to find ithow about a new learning skill to que skill trainig each level adds an additional que slotno lvl  train one at a timelvl 1  que 1lvl 2  que 2lvl 3  que 3lvl 4  que 4lvl 5  que 5this way you can have one skill training and be able to que up to 5 additional skills
sweet jesus yesget with the times ccpyou let us click to train so that more casual players can play eve then expect us to wake up at 300am in the morning to change skillsskill queue
i agree with a skil queue idea if only for the fact that people who work are at work while their skill ends and loose hours upon hours of training time
count me in
a skill queue thread wouldnt be one if ol sir smelly didnt show up to give his support skill queue we wants it we needs it
then you must also check the thumbs up box anyway just found this  doesnt look good in the same threadskill queueas i said in the live dev blog yesterday thats just something we were talking about and one of the risk factors we had to keep in mind were not really decided upon if we want a skill queue or not and its something that requires some serious thought on our part ill see if i cant get ccp hammer to answer this question in more detailandghost trainingi cant comment on that at this point sorry currently however there are no plans to implement a skill queue or multiple simultaneous skill trainingsthats a bit contradictivejust say yes or no sighkeeping players hopes up and then just letting them hang there instead of just saying there will be none is contraproductive
about time we had this  its not like people character farming dont already have an easy time of it  how about those of us that dont play eve as part of our job get a break
againsti dont even have to play this patch to see that its the farthest thing from a good idea possibleremember the days where good things werent messed around with what happened id rather go back to playing gemini or red moon rising than this crap signed
lets play eve  not world of evecraft
certificates bite tbh if a skill queue would mean you have to train all skills for a certificate ill keep doing it manualy which is prolly just what ccp will do and then say look weve implemented a queue what you whining about we need a proper sort of queue one which you can fill in yourself even if it was just possible to queue 1 skill it would be a tremendous improvement today i got lucky was home early from work and had enough sparetime to babysit many of my nearly finished skills so i finished a bunch today but with a skill queue this could have been so much more enjoyable and i would have been flying my salvage boat about a week sooner ccp stop this torture and give this the highest priority
i am posting today both to query ccp as well as making some suggestions regarding the up and coming configurable ships when i heard about this it got me very excited infact im looking forward to this more than ambulation shock horror and want to know more about itfrom my understanding you build your ship using 5 different components each giving you different stats and make the ship look different sounds great and it got me thinking is this ccps take on adding player generated content to eve as many of you know player generated content is the new thing in social networking games with examples such as spore which is ing aweful and little big planet customizable ships would definately be a good approach to adding this kind of thing to eve especially when combined with ambulation imagine designing your own ship and selling it in your own store  and best of all it keeps within ccps artistic vision of the game while the first release of this will see around 3125 different combinations there is nothing from what i can see stoping ccp making this on the kind of level that would work as player generated content by making duplicates of the components which give the same stats but simply look different or even adding components which do nothing but look good as well as some components which give new stats that also look different we could theoretically expand the different combinations from 3125 to tens of thousands of different combinations without making eve unbalanced and of course ccps artists do not need to design tens of thousands of ships simply design a few more components as well as the 4 main races we could see the pirate factions also offering up components for there own ships ok maybe the last bit is wishful thinking with tens of thousands of combinations we would then possibly see a situation in eve where players design there ships not only to give them tactical advantages in a fight but also designing there own ship purely based on asthetics which they can truely call there own then with eveopedia possibly even uploading there designs for other players to look atas you can probably see this is worded like a suggestion however i also mean it as a query to ccp is this the avenue ccp are considering taking with customizable ships could we get a dev blog with a basic rundown on the future post initial release for customizable ships and if ccp plan to vastly expand this fantastic feature
im pretty excited about this new direction from ccp myself but we must keep some things in mind first this is going to require a ton of balancing and changes before it ever goes live so itll probably take a whilesecond the ships are tech 3 ships meaning the skill requirements to use are probably going to be insane and keep them out of the hands of most starter pilots we dont even know what size the new t3 ships are going to be frigates cruisersoverall its an interesting direction which ccp is persuing im glad they made t3 customizable rather than the rumored thermodynamics bonuses which few people even bother with
hell yes
1 yea to this stackable salvagers just make sense
im only approving because i believe a complete overhaul is necessary for the current skill training system uberness should come from effort and experience not by logging on clicking on the next skill and leaving for two weeksa complete revamp of the skill training system is needed
rather than this thread merely saying youre wrong ccp  which they are  perhaps it would be better if we via the csm said ok ccp you claim skill training promotes playing the game show us some statistics find the number of characters logging with a skill change following that by say 5 minutes and then graph the logoff time following i think their position would be a lot stronger with some actual data to back it up and a lot weaker if they discovered that actually their belief is complete rubbish just a thought
my idea is trying to change low sec that would necessarily be an increase in overall security of low sec but also create better optionality for the pirates so heres my idea 1 remove sentry guns from shooting global criminals stationsgates making them essentially work like 002 create a concord faction navy spawnsentry guns as it is now deal 200250 dps fail warfare faction navy in 05 systems spawn roughly 200250 dpsthese concord ships just like the faction navy spawns are killable which respawns in a bitso what changesthose for example who are mining in low sec belts have increased securitygate camps are allowed dronesthe aggro from concord isnt changing ships so smaller ships are capable to be usedon top of this ideamake it possible to declare war on concord for free obviously automatically stays activeso you can spawn the concord spawn elsewhere in the system and jam it up so those  a gatecamp wouldnt be bothered by the concord navy with this make it also possible for corps and individuals to join concord you then become wartargets with those declaring war on concord aka pirates
i like iti always wanted to be able to pew pew more with any ship i want no matter if i am in 00 or low sec the sec status hit should still be in low sec ofcthese police ships should be killable i like but they cant be uber ships that webs and scrams at 100km range and can track everythingwonder if they would drop some nice loot
if the concord spawn is comparable to the 05 faction navy spawns almost entirely the respawn rate obviously changing depending on 01 vs 04you would still have sec status hitsthe police ships would be killablethey arent anywhere near uberno loot though at all
pretty nice way of making antipirate not pirating in itself using the fw system already in place toospawn the concord spawn elsewhere in the system and jam it up  means the big gatecampers arent too effected ether but then the antipi sneak in and finish off the guys keeping concord occupied thus allowing concord to respawn to coincide with an assault on the camp lol tictacs
hah
its even still in the list of shortcuts

so it seems that ccp has decided to make a series of changes to evemail in the next minor patch released of which the two most notable are making it impossible to read more than 1000 mails and deleting all npc mail more than three months old the former is wholly irrelevant to me given that i dont get anywhere near that many mails but many corporate officers will get that many inside a day or two and as such will be even less able to read their mail than they were before the second issue however is absolutely appalling killmails are the core of a pvpers recorded achievement especially in small gangs and piracy and many players have years of them stored up from the time before the combat log came into existence this is just going to erase them to no purpose except freeing up some database space i dont have too many old killmails and itd be easy for me to archive them by hand but what about the guy who has been playing since 2003 and has 1500 mails stored its not apathy that has led them to be stored for that long but instead the fact that he does care and now ccp is going and trashing his achievements to save a few stinking gigabytes at a minimum ccp should convert old killmails to combat log format or keep them intact and unchanged ideally wed get a proper mail system that doesnt have the embarrassing deficiencies of evemail but id be happier if they at least didnt further wreck the system they already have while we wait for a replacementupdate ccps plans have changed and killmails are being saved as such this is no longer an issue
supported making seperate topic in regards to the issues i have with it but i understand this issue as well even if it doesnt apply to me that muchthough i might like to keep the message i got the first time i got podded
new rules noone knows how to play anymore perfect time for a tourney to show ppl the new strengthsif any  and weaknesses of the quantum frog leap mouse or whatever they call it
i had been hoping to work on improving the eve mail system after the csm elections however it seems that ccps announced changes to them make this rather more urgent and so i am bringing this up nowits no secret that the eve mail system sucks and sucks badly message length is severely limited just this past week i had to split a diplomatic message into four separate mails and while four separate mails is a little rare having to split mails into multiple messages is an everyday occurrence if ccp is going to limit the number of mails this is something that needs to be addressed and addressed very soonthere is also no easy way that i know of to mark messages as things that you need to deal with  messages that you have time to read when you log in to change skills but that you dont have time to deal with until the next day but that you forget about because theyre not new anymore and are lost in a sea of other messages you keep in case you need to reference them at some point which brings me to another point but lets finish this first we need to either have folders we can put mails in or a way of marking messages as unread so that we know to deal with them next time we log onas mentioned above we also need to be able to store old messages without them cluttering our inboxes this is something that needs to be dealt with before any limit is set on how many mails appear  we need to have a way to export mails to a text file keeping all information about sender subject and date sent copying and pasting this info to a text file manually is far too tedious especially for corporate and alliance leaders who get a lot of mailan outbox box would also go a long way  ive more than once had to try and remember if i did or didnt reply to a particular message or send out a mail yet or been unable to recall exactly what i did say while not as urgent as the things above this would be extremely useful even better would be if you could keep drafts in it before sending them instead of having to write drafts in the notepad and copy and paste and then deal with different length restrictionsive also seen the idea of an api for mails mentioned this would be extremely nifty though not as vital as some of the things mentioned above many of which are really necessities and not things that should be done  they are things that must be done but an api and a way to read and maybe even send your mails while offline would be totally wonderful for people who send a lot of their time on eve dealing with mailsthere are possibly other improvements that can be made and i encourage suggestions in this thread
adding support  clicked it when i posted the topic but it didnt show up odd
it is a truly sadand sadly true statement that replacing the current mail client with outlook express 10 would be a massive upgrade weve all known for years what was necessary and why the devs have chosen not to fix it is utterly beyond me how this game ever got out of beta with this client i dont know for that matter  could they not have grabbed something opensource and slapped it in as for having to support your own post its a known bug annoyance oddity in the assembly hall ops cannot have thumbs personally i prefer to wait until i have something to say in a reply and attach my thumb to that so that i dont lower my postsupport ratio but instant support is common too
supportfaction drones need a boost i fully agree
setting the required skills for the t2 version of the faction drones down to below t2giving more dps to the t1 version would be the other option

this was answered in
this petition is in response to the panel which i re watched today granted ccp have a lot of claims as to why not to do it i understand that their bandwidth bill alone is probably staggering but in response i say cut some costs scale it down a bit spend less money on the side stuff and keep the tournament running player based mechanic would be interesting however it just wont contain the magnitude that was the previous tournaments the bob upset by hun reloaded the ascn v bob inty fight rails on a crow the destruction of tyraxxs impcc tri v ev0ke at the finale of v its not just about an arena to fight in or bragging rights its about the depth and experience of the fights ive never flown in one would be nice in the future but ive watched many of them live even through some hijacked bandwidth when i was in the military and deployed its entertaining its historic its epic and its awesome i agree give the gms the tools to manage the tournament lighten the load on them of course make it work better and more efficient a ccp hosted tournament carries so much more wieght an arena system would be entertaining but a tournament championship team from an arena fight and an alliance tournament championship team are very very very different i just see it as too deeply in the eve community and history to downsize into foam weapon jousting in empire sure put that in for people to play with but keep the big epic battle for the crown
they took all the fun out of combat with this last patch i personally looked forward to the alliance tournament every year but a lot of the good pvprs are leaving the game anyway it is just another sign that ccp is knowingly killing off evei support the vote even though i have canceled my 3 accounts
heh give power to the playersyeah cos champions league is so similar to amateur competition with a few guys and no camerasits all about the tv the atmosphere the silly remarks ppl will remember what that or the other guy said the aaahhhs and ooohs of commentators when the ships explode ffs we already have pew pew by the tons slapping a few medals awards or titles aint gonna change it we love tv and eve for only eve i can log in every daywhen ppl remember more a 10vs10 man fight than titans blowing upyeah now you know the difference between reading about it or watching it live you know thats the real thingguys at ccp eve tournament is our soccer our basketball our baseball our f1 and the teams playing are up there among the champions and legends of those other sportsffs put in a ton of commercials if you must it will feel like a real tv anyway d this sells this is global this is sports give us tournament with cameras and commentatorsdont worry about the beer and popcorn i already got those
bumping is really weird i support this
i support this simply because its an immersion breaker
i want to know which moron first spread the rumour that eve was remotely realistic
considering that we are set in space a small ship hitting a big one fast should move it as you are in a vacuum with no gravity and i suppose the lack of dmg can be explained by deflectors
nyx does not bumpbut some system that prevents larger ships from being thrown off course easily from smaller ships is needed in my opinionbut then again emergency evasive action taken by aura is a good rp point
just a simple mass velocity rebalance would fix this issue
you mean like the one they just did for qr or did you want them to go back through and change all the masses again and undo all the work they put into balancing the game
there ya go fixed a mistake in your post
minor oversight since most of them require a wizard hat and robe at some point
in full support of more t2 itemsin addition found some serious defficiencies in the caldari fits especially passive tankingcurrently all passive modules of the faction variety have no benefit other than cpu or power grid over the t2 version estamels thermal hardner is 2 lower resists then t2 hardner with twice the meta lvl
a lot of names are reserved and taken by accounts that havent been played in years i suggest that the accounts that have been inactive for a certain amount of time have the names of characters changed so that the names can be used by more active members or new players coming in
its been raised before  it was a bad idea then its a bad idea now you do not mess around with the accounts of paying customers even if theyre inactive its not like theres any shortage of names to be had
supported the value does not come from the cost but from the reason a specific decoration is awarded and the frequency cost simply limits the imagination of poorer corporations in using this otherwise wonderful system
say goonfleet wants to issue a campaign medal to people who fought in a certain theatre of war 3000 people at 5 million a medal is 15 billion you can build a mothership for that that is a wholly reasonable use of medals  not just good for corporate morale but entirely analogous to rl military medals  and yet it is mindbogglingly expensive to the point where the corp will never issue one id have no objection to it costing a billion to do but at 15 billion the math just doesnt work fat wallet or not thats a painful hit look at it the other way  i was in a wardecmerc corp a while back and it had maybe 10 active members who fought in most of those wars 10 active members cost 55 million to give a medal to and our usual contract was for something on the order of 100 mil before expenses again wholly infeasible the current prices basically limit medals to pure vanity that is not a worthwhile use for the system and it should be made more reasonable for larger use theyre in place now and as such ccp will wait for data before they consider any changes but personally i cant see this being used for anything like their desired purpose
hi allwhen i first saw that eve websites have list of player alliances i thought it is brilliant idea and spent lot of time just browsing or looking for ideal alliance and corp for me but how i was disappointed in the game everything what iUFFFDve read was terribly out of date i know that alliances and corps are changing every day but would it be so hard update that list at least once every month now it is just very old gibberish that could only confuse newcomers and therefore it is better to donUFFFDt show it at all
you find that depressing if you are using this site as a background you will find all item databases seriously out of datesecond patch to include new ships and skills yet cant find them here if you are looking for an alliance eve mail me i can point you to a few that would probably fit your corps needs not matter what you do
solution make drone alloys only reprocess into tritaniumproblem unless you live under an icelandic rock youll know that a tritanium profits are now lockstep with other belt roid types from 01 space on up b nocxium prices have only been attractive enough to draw players to low sec to mine just before drone regions were coded inexperience jaspet has always always sucked except for that small time period before drone alloys swamped the noxcium markethypothetical situation were noxcium to raise price by x5 it would not break mineral balance and mining habits but actually balance the attractiveness and highlight the riskreward that should be intuitive not counterintuitive as it is noweven if it went to stupidly high levels in price say half that of zydrine it still would not make a mockery out of eves mineral indexbenefits of this more targets for pirates in low sec and of course more excitement for miners because theyd actually get a decent reward for the risk they put in now most people might not understand my point of view let me just state for the record that high sec mining bores me to tears and i enjoy low sec mining simply because the risk factor keeps me awake theres another benefit i think most of you might not realize currently drone alloys of the commoner sort hold more tritanium volume than the alloy to be refined in other words the more rare drone alloys would naturally hold more tritanium in a sort of free compressed stateand wouldnt that be attractive all on its ownthe cons hmmmwell im not sure if it would impact the production business i wonder what lord fitz would think
ive lived in the drone regions for a while now and they are one of the most annoying regions to live in yes you get minerals but you get nothing else no exploration content of interest no loot no bounties nothing if you want to come down here and try ratting here for a bit feel free maybe then youll learn just how terrible it is trying to make money when you have to loot and sell everything in order to get any return yes you get more money but imagine trying to run l4 missions where you have to loot every single wreck with an industrial yeah funin fact only the high end minerals zydrine megacyte morphite actually get hauled up to empire in significant quantities most of the others are used for manufacturing so we have ships to flya much better idea since most of the nocxium actually comes from highsec belts pyroxeres ore would be to make highsec mining more dynamic and rebalance the ores to give less of the midrange minerals and more of the low ends this would both boost the drone regions and make lowsec more attractiveshameless boost request
fix for both of you add drone bounties and sec increases then add the content of zydrine in jaspet to 5 yield to put it more inline with low sec mineralsoh and a bump for fellow caldari pilots put a roid in cladari low sec that gives a high end mineralcurrently kernite only yields isogen that cant be found in caldar high sec but easily found in gallente or amarr space wtf carbears are happy and drone region is actually worth something
ah yes there are plenty of 90 day cards around there and they knocked down the prices of gtcs to be inline with credit card or other forms of subscriptionoh wait no that didnt happen at all
of course they didnt they are a company that would prefer a regular cashflow hence a price differential to encourage players to use credit card payments etc many companies do it eg in uk companies give discounts for paying regular direct debits instead of billingpayment besides this inducement to move to credit card payments there is the matter of reseller profits to consider a company selling gtc needs to make a profit on them ccp need their bottom line add these together you get a more expensive gtc than just paying for your time direct with ccp buying a gtc from ccp cant be cheaper than resellers otherwise noone would buy from resellers number gtc sold and hence players logging in would dropthe 30 day pl available ingame on markets allows you to buy multiples of 30 days for iskie no rl cost to you at all if you are smart enough or partake in the right activities you can play without costing a cent or whatever of you rl moneytake carearithron
cant happen just say no
scamming is finethey add flavour and character to eve 
scamming is an extreme edge of the diversity and openness of the eve economic and trade platform it should be no more banned than people who adjust their orders by 001 iskneither are very sexy clever or creative but they do have their place
nothing at all wrong with the suggestion but your corporations name means i cant take you serious out of spite no support
nah kinda pointless and whiney the bonus ammount was likely chump change at bestheck i did 5 missions back to back and made more money on salvage than i did on the missionme thumbs down
ankhesentapemkah i think you are misunderstanding the idiosyncracies with the current spawning system of course i could be wrong lets confirm my understanding of your understanding of the issueyou believe that the current system is such that when a system is captured it respawns somewhere else and that constant farming of hightraffic systems combined with the fw hinterlands remaining relatively untouched causes complexes to accumulate in outof the way systems leading to a shortage of complexes in highvalue systems until such time as the complexes in the boondocks are captured and redistributed in some cases to hightraffic systems or until dt when the complexes are reallocatedwhile this is true to an extent if that was all there was to it then the problem could be addressed by more aggressively searching lesserused systems the postdt crowd would still have an advantage in that almost every system would have a few plexes immediately available but the remainder of fw could still force plexes to spawn in target systems with enough effortunfortunately the problem is worse than that and also difficult to explain but ill try during any given day the number and ownership of each complex in a region is fixed and proportional to system control i dont know how many complexes exist for each region but for the sake of argument lets say that the bleak lands has sixty complexes distributed among its fifteen systems if the bleaks began the day with kourmonen under matari control and the balance under amarr control then there might be four matari complexes in kourmonen and fiftysix elsewhere dt ends and the post dt crowd captures the kourmonen complexes as quickly as possible since it has been declared a primary target by the fw flavor textas each matari complex is captured it respawns to a random location if that random location happens to be kourmonen then all is well and the postdt crowd gets an extra complex to locate and capture however if it spawns to any other system then it will in effect become invalid and unavailable for use for the remainder of the day  because it will continue to be a matari complex and therefore cant be discovered and captured while in an amarrian system and the same time as amarrian complexes are captured elsewhere in the region some of them might end up in kourmonen but those too will become invalid since they are amarrian complexes in a matari systemthis has two key effects first the total number of complexes in the region decays over the course of the day second the number of matari complexes in kourmonen drops to zero almost immediately as each complex has about a 93 chance of being spawned to an invalid system each time its captured so only those active in the half hour or so immediately after dt have any chance at all of capturing complexes in kourmonenwhile the problem you describe is worth addressing this problem is entirely crippling and it needs desperately to be addressed greyscales comments show that they are aware of the problem yet uninterested in solving it
its not that hard i think maybe it should work like this if you dock in with your ship in to a carrier then your ship will be stored like atm in a carrier in the ship hangar after this you can only see look at likethe carrier like your own ship but you cant control it you can only leave the ship in a pod or in the last used ship if its in the hangar if the carrier use a portal you go together with itif someone destroy the carrier all the pods drops out
so they perhaps put a team on the project of optimizing and creating a change that will allow thisas a note you can check the ccp panel videosomeone suggested an idea of hostage taking and such if they were to try this they would also have the same database issueactually afaik they would be all destroyed anything inside the ship maintenance or corp hangar is automatically destroyed
well you hit a major one with me dariusthier customer service is horrid just look at the forums reams of posts on the qr patch being laggy and riddled with gamebreaking bugs a week after this patch and nothing  no response paying customers gettting more ed each day and they are logging off how many wont come backdo you know that issues workarounds  localization section where players are ing 247 about qr bugs has yet to be updated with any current bug info known issue page updated empyrean age 11 last thread stickythe known issues page hasnt been updated since 91 seriously what in the hellliterally even their facebok page has issues about qr lag and crap gameplay and im not even talking about the missile nerfi honestly have come to the conclusion that ccp must not play the game bug reports ignored portraits not updated bugs not even acknowledged this company has 400 employees what are they doing drinking coffee and eating donuts all day smoking weedi have 4 accts jarius you get ccp to communicate and i will vote for you on every one right now im too ed to even log in this bugged qr release im more ed ccp has ignored thousands of their customers without so much as a response we are aware of the issues and a patch will be released soon to address xyz bugfix it
maybe you are unaware of this but if you encounter issues with the client this includes after a patch you are way better off bug reporting the issue gms dont handle bugs quality assurance does ie the people you send bug reports toas for people being upset and logging off look there is nothing anyone can do within the timeframe that you want that will make you happy it is simply unrealistic however if you believe nothing is being done to address to various issues then you are sorely mistakenpaying customer only equates to you being allowed to not pay if you are unsatisfied with the service provided not that you can boss them aroundi have to agree with you here that they need to update their material but that still doesnt invalidate my point about filing bug reportsi dont know this for a fact but i wouldnt imagine that the developers posting the material on the website are the same people who actually work on the reported issues it would be a waste of resourcesbug reports are certainly not ignored thats imperically proven time and time again and ive played since 2004 so ive seen patchnotes that include things ive bug reported many a timesas for what they are doing most likely drinking coffee as you said but for a reason they work extremely hard  they may not pull it off that well all the time but i have only witnessed them improving over the yearsback up your claims with hard data in regards to ccp ignoring thousands of their customers and ill be more inclined to consider your words more than just mouthdiarreah
hi cardela i didnt realize you were an alt of dariuslet me give you an example or two of a couple dozen ed off customers who were ignored some who have already canceled
im notbeing told when he can play the game which i believe to be an exaggeration at this point because i for one play the game every day  maybe not as smoothly as id like it to be but its doable  is an impossible question to answer as first there would have to be an existing deadline secondly this deadline would need address the specific circumstances of the user which is impossible thirdly theyd have to agree with him that its unplayableim not saying i think its cool that ccp arent responding in a basic fashion but chances are they have a good reason for it and yelling from our side wont make it any betterif bugreports are being filed with the proper data im not sure what that is exactly but id venture a guess its dxdiag files and logserver files i dare say that it is being addressed its just a matter of timehowever the cruel thing about software though is that problems are sometimes simple and takes a day or 2 to make a fix for or its extremely elusive and you have to use several weeks to find out testing trying new methods rewriting code and so oni know this as im a software developer myselfnow i can easily imagine with a piece of software like eve that an elusive issue might occur like 20 times all at one time with 20 different issuesoh i know what your point is but that doesnt mean youve made it or for that matter provided data to your claim about thousands of customers ignoredfrankly its just more mouth diarreahoh i already agreed with you that ccp could with communication improvement i really did and still do however that doesnt lend credence to your other arguments
i believe that was one of the major points ive tried to drive home with them and i believe theyre aware that its something which needs to be remedied we have seen an uptick in communication regarding certain necessary items like updates from the lag team i believe personally that they may very well need a team responsible for this communication they may also be able to get away with just one or two people focusing on the need or expressing in no uncertain terms to their staff that its something they need to make a priority one thing to keep in mind is that the playerbase itself also has some extremes and we need to be careful to temper what is feasible against unreasonable expectations i honestly believe though that there is a happy medium which can be worked out that will leave the majority on both sides of the fence feeling more satisfied its a slippery slope but a necessary one to travel
you got my vote i want to see the skill queue getting pushed forward
go post in cp if you want to engage in trolling behavior jetcans have a timer this the mechanism intended to keep people from storing crap in space anyways i digress stick to the topic next timefurthermore it was a suggestion an idea something to be improved upon in the spirit of the csm for the improvement of eve for all
deployable containers are useless for mining purposes they can hold 12 cycles of ore on a t2 fitted hulki think the huge and giant cans should be bigger as their names imply and maybe more expensive alsocan flipping is a way for wannabe pvpers to grief noob carebears only thing it does is people drop mining and do missions zero risk and decent rewardsthe only people mining in high sec is people running a macro script more or less
jetcans were never meant to be used by miners as a method of storing vast amounts of ore in space it was for this very reason why at one point taking from a can did not even trigger an aggression flag and why at one point ccp said this would not change despite the protests of highsec minerseventually ccp did change this and the situation became even worse for miners as they began not only losing their ore but their ships as wellas the complaints of jetcan miners continue even today i caution the complainers that not all change is good nor does all change have the intended consequences tens of thousands of mining vessels have been destroyed as a result of the changes stemming from the last batch of complaintskhoda
i am on topic my friend and ill tell you where to take your trolling comment your idea is malformed as it also nerfs the abilities of other noncorpmates from removing stuff from a jetcan without taking a sec hit many corporations use noncorpmates for the transfer of materials from jetcans and with your idea you make that impossiblesure you can throw out the gang mechanic as a possible solution but my point remains  jetcans are simply garbage cans in space they are not and should not be policed by anyone except the owner
i have quoted you and removed points not relevant to the dicussion at hand for the improvement of all remains the point of thisyou have a single point here with a possible solution anybody else want to suggest something constructive regarding canflipping
edit for brevityi agree with having a sec status hit for taking loot the aggression mechanic is weird as it stands today and doesnt really work right newbie miners should not be losing ships to pvp baiting and players who repeatedly canflip dont really belong in hisec space anyway
how about pirate factional warfare ability to join a cartel and attack the other cartels plus the faction warfare pilots associated with the range of the pirate cartelbuild in the same incentives you have discussed regarding factional lp for pirate lp etc edit for clarity
ah yes pirate factional warfare i have been having extended discussions on pirate factional warfare design i will quote for you a few things ive said on and around the topic much of which ive written today in other locations of course take note that it discussion all hypothetical and very open for rethinking
regarding piracy in general and integrating it with fw
more on factional warfare but emphasising an integration with live events and giving pvp more of a meaning

i think the list for the voting should not be static as quite some people might not be patient enough to go through the whole list they will just start from the top and go to the bottom until they find somebody they can really agree on at least that is what i did and i stopped at 13 of the list for 2 accounts   just delete the post pls if this has been discussedpruposed already
i would like to veto this measure
i agree fully using the same random list for everybody is a bad system  just look at the welldocumented and large advantage you get in municipal politics from having a last name earlier in the alphabet i can see some utility to having the ability to look at half of them close the window and come back to them in the same order but there are better ways of doing that  alphabetical order starting with number accountid mod 42 say much as im sure pattern is happy with the current system its not a good one and no im not just saying that because of my position on the list  im in the top third it could be a lot worse besides if i win id rather it be because im better than my opponents instead of just being luckier
i have a counter proposal instead we just flip the list
i agree with this manin all seriousness yes i think it should be randomizedthough at least i got the unfair advantage of having my campaign message be the only one that was properly formatted    i guess this makes up for that
thank you for your support
opinion isnt factinannapleased to be sitting it out this time around but might reenter the fray in the summer
roberts rules does not negate petty infighting it formalizes a system by which people interact this system reduces confusion when a large amount of people have to deal with one another if people do not recognize the authority no bureaucracy is going to change that and the petty infighting will be just as bad as it is with or without rrothe csm should be a sufficiently small body that it does not need a formalized bureaucracy in order to function and as long as everyone accepts the administrator then there should be few conflictsthe problems of the first csm had nothing to do with a lack of bureaucracy and everything to do with the members not accepting authority claimed by the chair and the actions taken
i should clarify that sentence  i dont mean it as an insult and i do include myself in that geeks is fairly obvious  were all people who not only play an internet spaceship game and spend goodly amounts of time on it we like it enough to want to run for office inside the game and care enough about political processes to want to fight and win elections egotistical is a bit more tenuous but i think its a fair generalization  i know quite a lot of politicians and few are truly humble even though a lot of them pretend nobody would run for office unless they had a certain force of personality you have to think you can do well in the jobbetter than your opponents usually and you have to think that you can win some candidates are jokers or slackers but they dont really count the average candidate who gets elected has a strong vision a strong commitment to seeing it enacted and a strong belief in the merits of themselves and their ideas those generally arent bad things but they do certainly lead to conflict they dont negate it they do channel it and while large groups will always need rules of order small groups will still usually need it  ive seen groups as small as five where dedication to the rules was critical to continued function besides 914 isnt especially small as groups go especially when theres no clearcut groups to simplify interactions as for everyone accepting the administrator therein lies the biggest problem of the first terms discord  there was serious disagreement over the proper roles and powers of the chair last term for that matter those still havent been solved theres just been nonaggression on that front for the last few months you say that there wouldnt be a problem if everyone agreed on what the chair did and how and for that matter youre right now when you tell me how to get jade constantine to agree with you on those issues ill think that your ideals are achievable until then id prefer to use rules rather than an assumption of agreement when no agreement exists its not ideal but its better than closing your eyes to reality
i would like to state for the record that i garion avarr am an egotistical geeki do like to think that im not blindly egotistical though but egotistical enough to think that i have good ideas and would make a good csm member
larger i have no objection to but its a really minor change
no but it does mean that they cannot be challenging and interesting in the same manner that humans canyesman what since when youve been suggesting decreasing the differences between lowsec and empire in terms of miningi am not sure what dwarf fortress has to do with eve but it is not analogous to eve mining in eve or anything that can be done yes if we delete the entire eve client and start from scratch as a god game we can make mining interesting by adding things entirely unrelated to the act of miningit is a sandbox game not a beach game you can play within the confines of the systemthe confines of eve are competition competition in the markets competition for space competition for resources if you dont want to compete no you dont get to play eve too bad that is outside the box it cannot be modeled on the eve system without removing the planks that keep the sand from washing awaysame thing less time finding roids less cost of mining  more profit in empire  the thing that we have been telling you is bad this entire time
so i tend to prefer to play against good or challenging computers specifically because they do not have to adhere to the same rules that players do and thus can provide different challenges because computers can control multiple units a the same time and because they keep their mouth shutyesreally how i dont even have to be logged in to the game to progress in such manneractually not at all as ive said im all for making lowsec more lucrativesurely the point went way over your head we were discussing dynamic game content and if it was possible it certainly is clients do not have anything to do with this the underlying game mechanics havei disagree that eve has to have any form of competition and i refuse to compete and i am playing eve so you are wrongyou are just looking through your own glasses and fail to see from a different objective perspective playing without competition is a valid play style just like solo play is yes there might be some interaction with other people but that does not mean it competes on any scale deal with ityoure making a mountain out of a molehill cutting down search times will only have a marginal effect on mineral production but improve gameplay for many players
the risk is zero or 1 however you want to define iti am sorry youre right i should have said that we have to scrap the entire game of eve and start anew whoops my badyou buy things on the market you mine youre competing removing that competition would be antithetical to the game design goalno see their search times are already zero you just go to any belt in 00 or lowsec and youre golden it is not the search that they are looking for but the risk lowering that search time is a flat profit boost to empire miningthe last thing we need is a flat profit boost to empire mining how simple does it have to be before you get that
quit being silly if there are no factors that compose risk then there is no risk so there is no risk to training skillsthese game mechanics are compeletely compatible with eve its not like im asking for a true physics engine or anything hell hobbyists like me even managed to build things in this direction into ultima online when they built playerrun towns dynamic progressive spawning and parametric ai that went beyond the simple finite state machines we originally had there is no reason why eve should continue to have the static environment it has nowadaysno no and no and if i was mining id mine in my own private mission spawns the ship i fly was given to me and the fitting is my own loot even in factional warfare i did not compete if anyone warped into my complex id leave and they could have it since the complex would respawn somewhere immediately i never consumed resources i never even had to fire a shot and the ships i flew were unfitted t1 frigslowsec and 00 is not an option to a large amount of players and as i said lowering the search time is too marginal to influence profit that much all it does is allow casual players that do not have much time to play eve to get into the action when they log in
just quoting
if you were at the factional warfare roundtables i told there and i told ccp in the fw document which is public by the way also said it at the promotion threadi still think that my ranks are well deserved as it took me 3 months to capture all 523 required complexes and at the end i spent 14 hours straight on a single day to get it all finished in time for the fanfest i invest time i get reward that is completely fair and in fact it cost me a lot of money and completely bankrupted me at the end due to loss of ships and clones definately deserve the rank now i invest isk and i get a shiny rank icon in returnpeople could and sometimes would try to stop mesometimes i had an entire fleet in the system and noone would bother with these plexes not my problem eh my actions do not harm anyone so there is no problem
you dont need to defend yourself i was only quoting you
either way its gone completely off topicgoumindong ive been thinking about this on the way home and i understand where you are coming from but i do not think we can come to any productive agreement or solution on how mining could be improved im worried that we will end up with bickering back and forth we both agree that there should be more incentives for lowsec i believe you are taking things i say out of context or inflate what you perceive as negative aspects of themi do not like that you only quote parts of my posts focussing on negative things and replying with more attacks rather than working towards solutions and agreement by coming up with your own suggestions and improvementsi hope that if you become a csm you learn that eve is more than your own playstyle and you should be able to at least understand the concerns and motives of people other than your own just like i understand people that do empirebuilding in 00 those that want to partake in small gang warfare and the players that want to conduct piracy in lowsecyes eve has competition pretty tough competition too which is good for some people but there are also some that do not want to compete or have entirely different views and interests when they play eve than both of useither way i lost interest in competing with you in this thread if you want to collaborate in the future csm or not you are more than welcome though
i fail to understand the reason why you did that though care to explain
zero risk is risk just as zero is still a number even though it is a number composed of nothing training skills has zero risk because its expected return is always the same that simply means its not a risky endeavor that dies not mean that it does not account for riskbull top down single player god game mechanics are not compatible with eve if you think they are prove it design the system you dont have to code it just design itand i suppose you never bought anything from anyone you never sold anything to anyone you never had any friends who gave you anythingthat is competition though in a different structure than the same you never built anything never researched any blueprints never undocked and warped to factional warfare complex which if captured would provide a shift in the strength of one faction over another you only ever bought and sold to npcs i call bsnot that any of that matters because the rest of the game which is to say everyone else playing is competingif lowsec and 00 is not an option for a large amounts of players they are just going to have to figure out how they are going to get what they want in empire the fact is that it is not that hard to be a casual player in lowsec or 00 corps want all the bodies they can get even if their play time is not prodigious the vast majority of reasons why people dont go into lowsec and 00 has nothing to do with some foolish notion that players simply cant do it and everything to do with costs and benefits gf takes new players right out of creation and throws them into 00 these players have no skills knowledge or aptitude and they can make it out in lawless space there is no reason why anyone would then be unable to make it in lowsec except that the costs are too high and the benefits too low when compared to less risky activitiesdecreasing the costs andor increasing the benefits of those less risky activities then has precisely the opposite effect that is needed it drives people too empire and locks out the majority of the game the actual fun game that is sitting there waiting to be played but isnt because its not profitable to do so and the fun is esoteric two people are sitting on a bench one says to the other i agree we need to improve the cities water supply that is why i propose that we dump large quantities of arsenic into the water supplythe other says what no that will have exactly the opposite effect as what you want to happenyoure the person proposing the arsenic
goumindong im not replying anymore it simply is not constructive and will only be childish is not is so between the two of us which wont get either of us anywhereso have fun doing your stuff in eve ive already said what i wanted and im sure you have made your points too
vily szentlexx is banned for 14 days so these questions are coming from an alt1 many people have asked you for a stance on the nano  nerf as you are probably aware the thread for dont nerf nanos went to around 70 pages and yet they were still nerfed heavily even without the refinements suggested by the players on sisi from my point of view this provides a case  in  point on how ccp fail to listen to the established playerbase if elected would you bring this specific point to them because whether the nano changes were warrented or not it was clear what the player base wanted would you question them directly on this and other such changes made in lieu of the player bases feeings eg missile changes and how it displays contradictory statements on their part to the extreme of ignoring their playerbase2 with reference to vipers questions on kug what is your view on meta  gaming in general3 what would you do personally to bring current gtc prices down and perhaps regulate them for the future4 please suggest an adequate fix for lowsec 5 if you could replace pos warefare with another sovereignty mechanic what would it be6 currently 00 could arguably be defined as a no go zone for smaller bands of players unwilling to pay rent to master alliances due to current sovereignty mechanics  could you suggest a fix to encourage more small corp participation in 00 on a meaningful level7 what are your views on solo players in particular the current state of solo  pvp8 finally motherships really have little usefullness or uniquness that justifies their price in todays large scale alliance warefare outside of protecting cynojammers with the prices of supercaps coming down this issue has become more apparant as of late as more people hop in them if you could suggest a unique bonus to motherships to make them more than a liability in fleets what would that bonus be what niche would you put motherships in do you agree with my view
awesome ideas suggestions in generalim not a fan of where it produces fuel for poss though im open to it its been mention how it will have detrimental effects on the economy of high sec ice miners a alternative  maybe a source for t3 mats or the nonice fuel for poss definitely needs to be for empire as well though there should be some limits on what it can produce compared to its 00 counterpartthis is a great opportunity for growth in small scale hauling missions contracting out fuel transporting and delivering or market tradingto go with the above suggestion maybe make some npc substations for the grainoxygencattle stuff to be sold or distributed from this is where the missions would come in bringing supplies to other npc colonies or some suchsubstations only have a fitting changing ability plus the ability to move the input and output items around maybe a limited personal hanger size for docking peoples this would allow some mod changing but its main purpose is one thing picking updropping off fuelfor the substation in orbitim not sure if this is already said or not they should be able to be siegedhave enough hp that this is required with caps or big bs fleetsand have no timer so that it can be destroyed right then and then and the only loss would be the substationso basically isk and it would drop some portion of whatever was in itinputoutput fuels and matspeople were discussing that the longer colonies exist the less fuel it requires to run and maybe instead produces colony fuel after long periods but for colony destruction after a colony is setup on a planet i think that it should 1 not be reset after destruction as if it was a new colony 2 start fresh after destruction but at a accelerated rate of requiring less fuel 3 have a timer otherwise a hostile force could come in and pop the colonies before a defense force could form or if it was a different tz etc and move to intercept the attackers these options allow a quick return to normal operations in colony foodmat production after a colony was destroyed there would still be the isk loss but it wouldnt soak up even more money through foodfuelsubstation must be destroyed before colonysry if these are repeat ideasps love the piratingraiding idea to steal fueloutput

so heres the thing it may be according to eft but ingame there is no major change as tested on my gallente character ie just so you get it not a butt load of difference compared to my caldari character which is noticably less than what it was which was less than my gallente character in the first place before the patchis that clear enough or do i have to draw you a picture im not talking about eft comparisons im talking ingamebasically although i have t2 siege missiles trained i may as well use faction or standard torps because there is now no real benefit of using rage at all and precisionyeah righti am not talking about soloing a raven i have never bothered to try soloing a raven for a long long timedoes void ammo need looking at yes it does but this thread isnt about void ammothats a thought maybe i can bribe someone with a picture of a spiderand quite frankly i am not your bud i am well aware of the ingame capabilities of both ships as i fly both types on different characters and my caldari pilot is better specced than my gallente one for those specific ships and it isnt just torpedoes that are suffering from problems either but i am not directly comparing them atm to my other characters
signedthis is a stupid nerf everyone knows that missile boats are used by mission runners not pvpersthe only thing this nerf has done is to annoy mission runners just for the sake of creating a nerftheres a saying dont fix what isnt brokemaybe ccp should remember this when tweeking with things and consentrate on fixing existing bugs rather than nerfing stuff all day long
im sorry but i pvp in missile ships all the time and they should be beter than they were and are for pvp and shouldnt just be looked at by the masses as pve ships
this imo is a stupid ideawhile i agree that the current wardeccing system needs looking at i still think that the agressed corp should have a choice tooall this does is allow pirate corps to wardecc carebears in highsec and create a surrender condition if an isk amount thus fueling more wardeccs and disbanding small corpsmany corps in high sec dont want to participate in pew pew thats why there in highsec and to force them to pew pew against their will is wrong imoin comparison to the small area of empire and the rest of the eve universe there are hundredsthousands of systems in lowsec and 00 were crazed trigger happy people can kill each other all day long why go into highsec and pick on small noob corpsif i was to make a change to wardeccs my personal opinion would be to only allow pew pew in highsec if the agressed corp consents to the war
yes because thats how real wars work
intriguing idea
well smarty pants what would you recomendthis is going to be an ongoing battle between the pvp comunity and the carebear comunityccps official responce to ppl whining about wardeccs is   go join an npc corpbut if they do that the pvper whine that they cannot wardecc all those lovely poor helpless carebearsatho i agree that pvp is an essential part of the eve uiniverse for the moment there is no resbite for the carebears in eve as ccp dont give a toss and pvper just wanna kill them all day longlet me ask you thisif yu was a caebear would you like to be shot at and wardeccd every day of the year thus stopping yu from playing becouse someone wants to wave their epeen aroundpvp is part of eve but so is being a carebear this is something that will always be the case how far do you think your pew pew will get you if their was no carebears around to make your ships ammo fittings or rigsand if your going to use the age old responce of i make all my own stuff so dont need any one then doesnt that make you a carebear too or do you already have every bpobpc in the game with maxed out refining and building skills
people will point out that this falls along the same vain has the cost of the war dec too cheap 50 million a week is chicken feed to a 6 month old corp heck its chicken feed for one person running level 4 missionsyou want to pay for protection the mechanism is already there hire mercs
i recommend wow where you can play intanced pvp to your hearts desire you expected something more mature to the smarty pants commentactually more often than not carebears do not argue for permissionsbased pvp they understand the mechanic and take precautions against it this can include hiring mercenaries to do their fighting or they focus more on docked activities such as market pvpi believe the pvp community as a whole dont really care about it since theres never a shortfall of targets in playerrun corporationstrue working as intended only the strong survivehi we havent met but im tchell dahhn ceo of suddenly ninjas were a ninja salvaging corp not a pvpbased corp and weve been around for 6 months and have been wardecced since our second week when we only had twelve members thats consistently my friend i created our corporation because i believe that ninja salvagers shouldnt hide out in an npc corphas it been easy no hell no have we adapted absolutely have we been preyed upon by superior see epeen waving foes absolutely did we disband did we whine nothe big guy preying on the little guy is inevitable if you make yourself a big enough targetso work on what you can do to make yourselves an unappealing target dont smack in local dont go out of your way to look tempting get some help find some friends who want to fight who want to help youthere will always be carebears there may not be whiny carebears since a lot of them will emoragequit or move to instanced pvp see wow or evolve but thats the way the game worksdont worry  most of our members are carebears weve just adapted and were still around and guess what we enjoy the game more today than we did when we startedthats the way it goes

it would be one thing if ccp didnt mandate the use of evemail as the main focal point of communication for ingame pos mailsdirectors mails can flood inboxes which would undoubtly make alot of stuff dissappeari understand the need to clean up the system but ffs why are you force deleting all the npc mails cough old killmails unless you can provide a way for all the old killmails to become merged into the combat logthis slipshod evemail cleanup is a farce ccp
serious thumbs up for this one its time we dragged the eve mail client kicking and screaming into well the nineties would be a nice start
i know that ccp is in negotiation with intel for new servers but maybe they should look elsewhere for system improvements talk with operafirefox for an improved igb talk with ipswitch or somebody like that for an evemail server talk to any one of the numerous forum softwares such as the free ones for websitesadmittedly these are not absolutely critical changes but they go a long way towards qol upgrades i mean how many times do you have to log into the forums just to post a stinking message
totally agree with all of the above posts
we already discussed a new evemail system it will be a part of the cosmos project which ccp showed off a bit at fanfestyou should read the minutes of our meetings with ccp but i assume you did that seeing as you are a candidate the changes to how many mails there can be shown was obivously also something ccp did based on csms issue raised about too many mails in ones inbox making your evemail unfunctional but there is too many problems with the proposed way
if they discuss improvements and then implement feature removals i feel wholly justified in attacking them im judging what theyre doing not what theyve said
im aware that the csm has raised the issue about the evemail system with ccp  but the current changes ccp has said are planned suggests to me that the csm might need to raise it again and insist that it be dealt with in a sane way

t1 drones were made for those who cant use t2 drones faction stuff in general is better than t2 and one of the advantages of it is the lower skill requirements this however should not be the only benefitalso please if youre supporting the idea check the support this topic checkbox
in the eve universe it makes sense that you should be able to pay off the interstellar cops to raise your sec status i had heard in another post i put on this topic that it was in the eve beta and they took it out i think this would be a great time to bring it backyou should have another option other then ratting to raise sec status having to rat doesnt make sense in both eve as a self contained narrative and as a game you should be able to throw some iskies at concord to raise sec status you make the cost a little prohibitive and you now have an alternative from spending a week ratting in 00
afaik theres nobody in the csm who does trading a lot first of all we need to streamline the market its been untouched for a long timefirst i think you shouldnt have to go to my orders page to modify your own ordersi also think you should be able to spot your own orders it could be differently coloured
i do tradingwhat is the problem with having to go to my orders i open my wallet with my orders and then use the market order to spot if im the top bidderas for the colour coding theres the issue that we do have colourblind people but i quit elike the idea but i dont think its all the viable
good so if you get to be a csm again you could drive our intrests imo market hasnt been taking into consideration much only thing we have now is economist and he has a good vision but its not enough and if they make colour stuff it wont take anything away from the colourblinded do they

i dont want local to be nerfed
im for a local nerf on the condition that it doesnt nerf the ability of players to gather intelligence on the system that theyre in in fact i want to see intel capacity be improved when local is taken out at least for those willing to invest a bit of time and effort a blind nerf is not the goal here a proper intel system is chat channels have no place in a proper intel system and as such they ought to be taken out i dont know if thats the answer you want or not but its what i think
i like to have several ships around with basically the same fittings but i hate the time i actually spend fitting shipsconsequently id like to be able to buy the stuff i need to fit x ships fit the first rightclick on the second or the remaining stack of ships even and choose fit by template and choose the first all ships would then be fitted similarly provided of course i have the required modules and ready to goi would even like to be able to save the fittings in some kind of fitting bpc and move them between stations contract them to other people or whateverthis change would have no impact on in space gameplay whatsoever but it would make fitting ships a lot easier if you are simply going for some standard fittingsyou could also use it to prefit tacklers for instance and then setting them up for sale using contracts  it can be done today but it is soooo boring fitting 10 ships one by one and i just couldnt be botheredor how about fitting 25 arbies with tech i junk and then calling free drunken arbi op x up in alliance and then going to waste it all

ack
i think this is a great idea my personal view would be along the lines of a fitting bpc container for t1it would be a container print that you place the bpos of a ship and the components you want on itthe container would then have a rollup of all the minerals needed for production and the time it would takeyou would then just install the whole set and when you diliver the production job it would be a fitted shipt2 and beyond would need a lot more prints for production component invented prints
this would be pretty cool

greatnow theres 2 of the damned topics about missile nerfing1 was bad enoughtt
1removes all learning implants and make global learning time a little fasterother possibility remove all learning implants and give all characters 4 or 5 to all atributes
if done correctly this can last a couple hoursand i like the training times the way they are if you want it bad enough you will train for it and one can still play the game has one is training for it
uhm do you mean tier 2 as in not base but just slightly better and still t1 like named lootor do you mean tech 2 the stuff with the pretty yellow icon in the upper cornerif so yes there are a lot of modules that could be much improved by t2 such as the range on tractor beams or even the implementation of diferent sizes medium  large tractor beams
thank you for pointing that out that would explain why this thread wasnt getting the traffic i expected or had hoped for op edited
i had an idea about that a while ago just delete the characters with less than 2m sp and whose accounts are inactive for 6 or more months this would do nothing against those people with accounts that have been deactivated for a while due to rl issues but only affect those who created a trial account and decided not to make it a full account
why even look at the sp i say that if the account was never upgraded from a trial account and has gone a year since the trial ended then the account should be deleted if they managed to somehow get a high sp character transferred to it then it it also deleted
if they just did it to the trial accounts that were never turned into paid accounts i cant see a problem
now that wouldnt be terrible still unnecessary but inoffensive
you missed the obvious from my posts1 working as intended2 get over it3 these arent the droids youre looking for move along move along
id like to see the jetcan mining issues solved along these linescreate a new can type protected mining can that can be carried packaged by most ships and when launched unpackages itself into a semisecure can that can hold an amount similar to a jetcan like the existing secure cans the owner can set a password to limit access unlike current secure cans these cans are vulnerable to those with hacking skill they should be a challenge to hack so that hacking takes some time but is not impossible any attempt to hack the can successful or not counts as aggression furthermore once hacking starts the cans security system locks down the can completely so that nobody can access the can while hacking is occuring this prevents the owner from just transferring the cans contents to another can to prevent the theft successfully hacking the can clears the password for fifteen minutes allowing free access to the contents though the cans ownership does not changethis would create a situation where orethieves can still engage in ore theft albeit with a higher skill training requirement thus eliminating newlycreated and disposable alts from the profession yet miners have the opportunity to defend their property either by calling in reinforcements switching to a combat ship or racing against the thief to unload the can once its hacked
interesting idea perhaps our soon to be appointed csm candidates can use the ideas set forth for discussion
now that is an interesting solution not sure itd work but its the first quasisensible replacement for the jetcan system ive ever heard
i like your idea and see it in a similar vein as salvaging in the fact that it will receive a huge number of complaints by both sides this of course makes it a smart and viable solution since the ones that work always seem to get an increased number of people angryit takes skill and there is an element of risk to all parties and i like your idea
can flipping is fine as it isif someone steals from you one cant just go and steal it back without consequences both in game as in life

this is silly there is no such thing as an antigoon or progoon csm  any changes made to the game with csm input or not will help out some goons and screw over some othersthe reality of having the largest numerical alliance in eve is that goons are involved in every aspect of this game there are goons in t1 frigates goons in nanohacs goons in covert ops ships sniping battleships and trimarked blasterboats there are goons in carriers dreads motherships titans rorquals and jump freighters there are goons manufacturing with t2 bpos and goons inventing with datacores there are goons who x up for 200man fleetfights and goons that only fight in small gangs there are goons that roam lowsec solo and goons that roam in highsec solo there are goons who make their isk playing the market goons selling timecards goons running missions on highsec alts goons picking through asteroids belts for unwanted salvage goons multiboxing half a dozen hulk pilots and goons scamming pubbies there are goons with 1m skillpoints and goons with 60m skillpointsso what exactly do you mean by antigoon
ok will be a first time voter but my question to the delegatesif you could remove a single aspect or function from the game which would it beas an example mine would be the can baiters who sit in 10  09 with cans like great free gear for noobs written on them in the hope of killing a 3 day character yes its against the rules in the starter system but not 1 jump out thats my example can you offer yoursthanks and good luck to all the candidates for friday
i would probably remove jump bridgesthey amplify blobbing and they make it almost riskless to move across space
thanks for the quick response and as a side note love the corp name wonders is it named after the uk conservative party
i would personally like to see eve without alts as people avoid consequences by using alts for criminal actions or as an anonymous income source for other activitiesand id like to see eve without smacktalkers and other childish people and i suppose people that canbait noobs fall into that catagory as wellbut neither of the two are realistic unfortunatelyi agree with lavista that jumpbridges are a plague in 00 and makes it too easy for large alliances to hold space without having vulnerable supply lines it also invalidates small gang pvpbah i rather add things to eve than remove things
a single thing to be removed the first thing that comes to mind is doomsdays in their present form  switch them to either targeted damage or ewar or maybe bothgive people a choice its not as important as some other changes but its the top thing on my list that would qualify as a removal removing jumpbased transportation might be cool but it will never happen especially not now that jump freighters have been introduced and the idea of removing alts is madness as for can baiting the warning messages should be written in such a way that what happens is made obvious to the 3day noob since they still actually read warning messages the people who do it are pathetic but they dont need to be nerfed explicitly
the current sov system replaced by something better
for me id have to say the t1 meta 0 loot drops from npcs theyre depleting the market for the creation of t1 items and theyre flooding the market with minerals  sometimes even gaining more minerals per time period than mining would meta 1 or higher items will remain in rat droppings but get rid of the meta 0
if i could remove one thing from eve i would remove npcsnow you can regret not paying me to run for csm eh
id remove the emergency warp ability of all ships so that the logoffski trick would no longer workif your internet connection goes down your kid flips the power switch your wife pulls the plug you have a brownout a blackout you spill coffee on your computer you have a flash flood your water breaks what have you your ship stays in space exactly where it is until you log back onits all part of the experience imho for rp purposes during the time you were away from the game your ships systems had a catastrophic failure and scotty was busy rerouting power from the bridge controls to main engineering if you get back in time to save your ship fine if not youre in your pod or youre in your clone baynow arent you glad im not a candidate i wanted to post to give our candidates something to think about or discuss
aoe doomsdayssov and bridges just need some tweaking the complains of the above are totally unfounded we blobbed just as much before they were implemented
thank you all for your response both candidates and non candidates  well good luck too you all on friday and please who ever gets in bash ccp over head about the patch day problems
security status restrictions and responses in below 8 systems gates have responses dwindling as sec gets lower all other areas are a little wildthis is a wish not something ill be advocatingarithron
completely untrue and off base whilst blobbing obviously occured before the deployment of jump bridges and cyno jammers  it was something that both sides could do now only the defender can blob capitals via jump bridge into a cyno jammed system with inpunity and that throws out the balance and chances for a decent engagementmost people now see that the balance in 00 warfare is wrong and its certainly the case that overproliferatiion of jumpbridges and cynojammers have removed a critical element from the game of eve online that we can call fun jump bridges promote threatfree logistics and make it easier to build vast space holding alliances that nobody has the patience to remove cynojammers are single module that ensure overwhelming capital ship superiority for the defender and act as a massive disincentive to aggressive warfare but combine the two modules together and you have the rootcause of many of the ills in the 00 game i can understand why you are pro status quo on this issue goumindong because you come from an organisation with a vast jump bridge network that holds space protected by cynojammers that you would not be able to hold in their absense but as a csm delegate you need to learn to see the bigger picture and appreciate the future health of the game beyond your personal biased view of status quo maintenance fortunately im pretty convinced that ccp are already convinced that 00 need to change urgently and there is limit to the damage you could do on the csm panel  but its useful for the electorate to see your gut instinct on the sovereignty tool issue is to slightly move around the deckchairs on the titanic rather than make an honest attempt to actually avoid the iceburg altogether
so what youre saying is that i am right and that you have no clue what we are talking about gotcha1 yes there are issues with sov and bridges they need some tweaking you would notice that i said they need some tweaking 2 no they do not cause people to blob any more than they did it just changes how those blobs got into the system you will notice that the claim had nothing to do with logistics creating empires or capital ships it simply has to do with a simple claim that the bridges cause blobbing this is false hell you just admitted it was false3 the statements made earlier said that these needed to be completely rewritten and in the case of jump bridges removed this is simply not true a number of tweaks like not allowing jump capable capitals to use jump bridges and tweaking pos so that strategic modules are easier to disable with small gangs entirely solves the complaints regarding jump bridgesnow stop lying about me my goals and how the game works and do something productive with your time
if i could remove one thing in eve it would below sec gate camps the guns at the gates should be enough to keep those gates safe i dont believe ccp intended folks to be able to sit and tank them all day otherwise they wouldnt have put them there in the first placeissler
mostly just doing this to say hi to splag here is blob warfare in pic form
to clarify the chair has no power its roles are explicitly laid out in the founding document it schedules meetings and arranges paperwork that is all when it has been left to that there have been no issues nor do i anticipate there will be
id like to know if there are any candidates who actually have improvements in the igb andor api on their list of things to address more and more web tool developers and corps are creating websites that theyd like to be able to access from ingame using the igb but with the current igb implementation its very impractical for a lot of things due to speed issues and lack of support for some basic featuresand thats ignoring the fact that its been nerfed in the qr release so far and just going on past performancelikewise while the api has been a great addition there are still some oddities here and there which seem to be very low priority for sorting out for example passing the playerdesignated names of items in the asset export but which could lead to a whole new range of tools we could all potentially benefit fromessentially im curious to know if there are any candidates who plan on bringing these sorts of issues to the table in addition to the usual gameplayrelated stuff for which a policy of fixing whats there rather than adding loads of new stuff would get my vote  its time to consolidate ccp not concentrate on new bits which will introduce new bugsmy 2 cents
yes that would be mei have raised issues about the api and we discussed the igb with ccp in icelandeventually we will see the igb replaced at least ccp said so 
what lavista said we brought it up as well as improvements to the email system but ccp will not make improvements to the current one but instead will replace it with a whole new thing in the future
the three most obvious and egregious problem with the games support structures are the igb evemail and the forums all three were embarrassments in 2003 and have gotten no better since and any of them could be trivially upgraded within the space of five clicks on sourceforge youll also note that those are about the only three times my usual position of granting the devs as much leeway as possible falls by the wayside because while their other mistakes are excusable these ones simply are not ive submitted 810 threads on the assembly hall and still mentioned all three of those because they really do matter to meand aggravate me to no end i dont know what the current api structures are in detail so i cant comment as intelligently on what needs to be fixed there but going by what others have said its another thing that needs some work im all ears when it comes to suggestions and id like to build on past suggestions from the csm about possible upgrades i know those arent explicitly listed in my platform but i put them under the header of ui improvements which ive repeatedly stated is the most important issue in this game that the csm can have an impact on so yes i care
i am also quite ready to champion eve api and the igb myself as i have been developed quite a few eve related tools mostly webbased myself if you want a web developer in the csm just vote for me
i absolutely support improvements to the browser and the in game mail system the browser seems like an easy one to address how about a chrome port  seriously there are some great options that would get us a real browserimprovements of the api would be great as wellissler
ive decided to share one of the internal goonswarm videos i created for our own primaries yes i know voting ends in just two days this is being done more for entertainment purposes rather than winning votesof course a few extra votes wont hurt 
you censored swearing in an internal goonswarm video somehow i find that hard to believe
why is it so hard to believe i didnt censor it for eveo it was already like thathowever i have another video i will have to censor if i plan to post it tonight and that is only because of the song having colorful metaphors littered throughout it 
their both overdressedgood luck on the elections
i will be on when i can unfortunately since i am going on holiday next week i have to work extra shifts until thursday
thanks i missed that one
ankh is rightit is simply not worth eeping this discussion goingas i see it the only real reason most people want more miners in 00 is to have more targets to killi personally do not mine but i know there are a lot of people that get fun out of it and btw theydo put a lot of time and iskie into thier ships and skillskinda hard to explain to them that they reallyare not playing eve because eve is all about pvp i mean jeez reallyi would say that a lot of miners have a second jobas being industrial also the minerals they mine gointo building things not a iskie sink there is it which can make money once you spend a fortune and a year trainingskillsof course i have a idea for some that really love pvpgo play on the test serveryou get all the pleasure in killing peoplewithout it hurting someones funbut perhaps thats why you get so much pleasure knowing you ruined someones fun
the fact alone that a majority of eve consider missiles to be for pve purposes only detracts to the basic idea that theymissiles arent sufficent enough to pvp in that alone would raise most concerns with the fact that an entire weapon system is gimped against others this being before qr and now after the patch with missiles being worse your justification is that missiles are for pve onlysadly i believe this was not so much an aim at missile nerf as it was a stealth reliance on bringing target painters back as a legit form of acceptable ewar just as rsd and ecm honestly i dont have a problem with it the nerf as much had they come out and stated that but for god sake bs vs bs warfare shouldnt require something to increase the sig of a 1ms bs just so it can hit for full dmg let alone if that bs is moving full speed without any propulsion mods just as guns are different from missiles sometimes they get their excellent blows sometimes they get glancing blows where as missiles have a cliff before the cliff you can only do max dmg w multiple painters or a 0ms bs after the cliff they do exactly 0dmg but this discussion shouldnt delve back into missiles vs guns the fact these arguments exsisted before this missile nerf they still are the same exact arguements after earlier i already showed how the shield tanking bss that are a 6mid 5low layout are pvp gimped in most instances requiring 3 pvp mods1abmwd 2 point 3 painterweb but only having 2 slots in which to pull it offwhere as the majority of bss are armor tankers which are also a majority of gun ships that are a 7 low 4 mid setup which allows for the 3 pvp mods plus 1 extra slot cap eccm second web sensor booster second cap boosterboth the 65 shield bss and the 47 armor tank bss in most instances can do their tank w 2 dmg mods sometimes only 1 the problem is if you give the raven that 7 mid you seriously give it a chance of an amazing tank beyond almost every other bs in the game including the teir 3s if it wasnt given a pvp focus or didnt have to worry about fitting the needed pvp mods due to a support fleet that would create an imbalance thats the basic problem at hand  ccp wants you to use a support fleet for pvping maybe even for pve coincidence that this lines up with a new power of 2 advert just after receiving the harsh backlash of retiredcanceled accounts due to ghost training gankage solo bs pvp is a dying art let alone other solo work except for a small portion of ships they havent nerfed yeti cant wait till t3 bss come out i want a 1 highslot bs called the nerf bat  the dmg output of this ship well surpasses any other ship in this game
signedive played this game for a while now call me boring but i get my kicks from sitting there blasting npcs with my caldari character and zipping around at daft ms in my inty thanks ccp u just destroyed most of that fun for over 2 years i have honed this character in on caldari missiles and boats and as far as i can tell you have just decimated a lot of that trainingwhen i think of the amount of money i have piled into this like many others will have done some more so the prospect of retraining this character to get back where i was is stupid economyi can understand some of the aspects to the inty and tackling patches the missiles i do not and this is getting perilously close to being canceled if i hadnt already put 6 months on 3 alts and i assure i have played little else all year long ccp sort this stupid missile nerf out or refund my money or give me the 10mil skill points approx to redistribute into useful skillsthis nerf is so poorly thought out as people have said guns have many advantages prepatch compared to missiles so if the angle is pvp is it not the guns that need reducing you can say that i should use drones more maybe so make the drone bays bigger myrm 150m3 drake 25m3 ok screw the explosion velocity stuff up so make the target painters work more effectively so i dont have to swap all my lows for bcus to get to where i was sry im going on but this has seriously narked me off like no other unnecessary nerf before you have wasted my time and money thanks
signed
i believe the nerf was long over due but not to this level the explosion radius should be set at a minimum to the highest base speed of that class of ship a good place imo would be at base speed plus l2 speed skills this will allow the computation to work a lot better at adjusting speed to damage thank you for your time
the mentioned caps do need a look into but how about a less drastic one for the nagone more low one less high 33 gunslaunchers
there are some serious clunks in this threadits quite unbelievable that there are some who expect in eves harsh brutal world that living in empire equates to guaranteed safety it quite simply isnt its just safer it just means there are some safeguards it doesnt mean a nursemaid will be at hand at all timespeople need to look past the i dont want to fight mentality and accept that whether you like it or not in this game someone can war dec you under certain conditions the game should not be bent to favour the mistaken preconceptions that they inadvertently brought to the game its always been this way in eve and it should remains so as it is a small minoritys mistakethe initial post is unworkable victory conditions and associated penalties for the losing party are so open to exploit it should never have been even brought up in its current form though i think the op is well aware of this and quite frankly i suspect his motivesone thing that i dont believe has been suggested yet taps into the mentality of some eve players some corps are ransomed usually the player on the other end will flatly refuse point blank on principle never to hand over isk however a mechanic to ensure that if a fiscal agreement by both parties were met then it was held to would be beneficial to the game by this i mean if through the war dec interface a demand for a sum of x isk was placed and the decd party agreed on condition that they would not receive another war dec for y weeks from the same attacker then this may give players more confidence than just trusting the word of the attackers ceo as it could be enforced by the system naturally if those people attacking were to leave and reform under another corp to make another war dec then this is a clear and easily identified exploit that noone would be stupid enough even to try this wouldnt help people who would never hand over isk out of principle but then neither do they defend themselves out of principle this is their choice if they suffer needlessly or have restricted play as a result then that is the consequence that they have brought largely upon themselves i would have the members of the csm would remember that consequences are a key part of the game and would not act in a way that allows people to evade itthat said its all academic as i believe no action was ever taken regarding the ivy leagues exploit to evade a war dec and consequently this route is still open to all alliances that would like to shake of a war  although the alliance may need a player on the csm to pull it off captain thunk
i support it automatic trainging to v or a skill queue
aye
speak the word brothersister
i cant really see a downside to a skill queue
it would be nice if a player gets disconnected the drones auto return to drone bay though i am a bit concerned about the disconnect abuse and the unforeseeable problems this could cause
awesome you finally are onboard with black ops receiving the cov ops cloak or maybe you dont know how cloaks work whatevertrolling aside i think that bo at least need the scan res bonusfuel bay and immunity from cynojammers and a boost to jump range and stuff that rajere mentioned 3ly would be nice but 25ly is better than nothingalso i retain the right to want a battleship sized force recon ship ccp probably wont make the bo into one but that doesnt mean i dont want to fly a huge typhier typhoon  rapier
yes please this would be great i hope ccp listen to this one

1 why would a dev respond to this topic its the same stuff theyve been hearing for the last 56 years2 skill training ques will not stop or help character farmers anymore then regular players3 for all the players who had to grind out their 6 hour skills and wake up in the middle of the night why stand in the way of the players who dont want to what do you gain do you remember how angry you were that you missed 61218 hours of skill training whos the people that cry the most when the downtime lasts longer then their skill training dont you wish they went away4dual skill trainingsplit time  stupid now i have twice as many skills that are half finished cause the dual skill training stops in a dt or other inconvient time5 stop whining sometimes you just miss skill changes6 some of us have lives some of us dont stop being jealous of those that will benifit from skill ques7 hurray wall of textmake skill training harder that way we all can whine at you more ccp make skill training into a mini game that involves flashing strobe lights and random trivia questions
i love the way ccp say not being able que skills makes people play more  this is totaly wrongwhen my skill ends i log in change it and log out who here apart from ccp counts that as playing a gamealso at the end of the day ccp still get money the customers are happy because we can do something we have wanted to do for ever may even reduce server loads a bit as the one hour skills wont require you to either stay loged in or log in every hourat the end of the day skill que is winwin with no down side whatso ever
yep logging in to change skills  playingin for at least a fallback time
ui improvements are always good
i came so close to trashing an ishkur the other week
much better

yea salvagers stacking is goodmaybe also add reppers shield boosters to this
oh certainly stack anything know what would be awesome being able to stack up your dmg mods like magnetic stabilizers and see what the final percentage boost to your guns is with the diminishing returns applied

i dunno baulders gate 1  2 and fallout 1  2 all have gambling in them neither are rated 18 then again rl money isnt involved in these gambling practices if eve had gambling introduced there would definitely be a grey area since rl money is used to buy time codes and time codes can be traded for ingame moneyin a roundabout way rl money can be used for ingame gambling ccp could introduce gambling but i suspect its a whole can of worms theyre just not willing to open
you are assuming the country even notices also as many people here have already mentioned the laws do not apply to digital assets holding no legal value finally if i recall correctly other countries laws cannot affect the operation of a foreign corporation operating over the internet

fixed that for you
excellent idea 1 support
this makes me laugh
it came up in a topic in general discussion that it really cuts into our time we have to spend on eve to stop and load up the log server and go bug hunting most players displayed a reluctance to even consider it yet they still complain that ccp isnt fixing the problems affecting themthese same players including myself i admit displayed greatly increased motivation to run logserver and form detailed bug reports if some sort of ingame incentives were applied to reports that were used to successfully squash a bugsuggestions ive seen and devised are as followsisk the old standbyships had to be saidccp community service medals perhaps a series helpful pilot forum warrior bug master etcgame timecredits like somewhere in the patch notes you can click on a bugfix bullet and get a list of the pilots who aided with good bug reportseve store goodiesitems nothing ultra rare more like a random t2 bpc or somethingthe list can go onso what we the undersigned would like the csm to propose to ccp is to provide some sort of simple yet meaningful incentives for providing quality bug reports the result of which we hope will be a much greater volume of good bug reports and far fewer its borked fix it reports and faster bug squashing
having to reply to my own proposal to show support4tl
it seems a good idea so ill support it
signedheres the thread in gd if any1 want to have a look
yeah good idea personally id like to see medals as this could be expanded to include such things as rewards for participating in load tests on sisi
i can get behind that  use the new medal system to give players a visible token of thanks for helping out game goods seem dangerous but purely symbolic thanks are a good idea theres a possible downside of people getting too obsessed with them but itd probably be well worth it
if this will make it there would be a certain need of balancing the rewards when it comes to terms of items or iskotherwise people could get the idea of bug reporting every tiny bit they find just to rank up and gather the rewardsfirst thought would be keep track of all players reporting the same bug only reward these pilots if that bug gets confirmed  resolvedonly having these pilots a medal would be ok as there isnt anything yet   but giving them at least one or a few low tier items would be more desireabledoing a freighter run currently i thought of something like this maybei combined commodities with low tier items  for example there should be no chance to get some ridiculous valueable item 1 bug report concord technical assistance recruit medal comes with 1x quafe 1x random t1 frigate bpc maxrun 3 bug reports concord technical assistance officer medal comes with 3x quafe ultra 3x random t1 cruiser bpc maxrun as well maybe less 5 bug reports concord technical assistance general medal comes with 5x quafe ultra special editition 1x random consumables bpos ammo drones  10 bug reports concord technical supervisory manager medal comes with 10x test dummies 2x random consumables bpos 15 bug reports concord technical supervisory executive medal comes with 15x synthetic coffee does it even exist 5x random t1 battleship bpc maxrun 20 bug reports concord cluster integrity consultant medal comes with 20x exotic dancers 5x random t2 bpc runs to be defined by item type 10 days of gametime when you filed 20 goodconfirmedresolved brs that was presumably quite a bit of workeverything just out of mind  feel free to flame rant whine change remove double triple or eat contents of this post
like the idea of consecutive useful reports increasing rewardsthe original idea might not have worded it well included the provision for no incentive rewards unless the bug report was deemed useful in eliminating a bug
the recognition is a benefit that is tiny in cost and great in its impact i support this
as an avid industrialist seeking to mine and refine out of a pos i find it extremely odd that a players skills do not influence the yield from a refining array as they would at an outpost refinery if a outposts refinery gives a base yield of 35 and my skills make that a net yield of 100 surely my skills should allow 100 refines from a 35 base refining array
yay for cheaper items in 00i did not realize that pos arrays were like this as i dont use them however i do agree with this
true the use of evemail for many of these notifications is a bad workaround and it badly punishes people who run big corps i dont think theres more than a handful of people in the game who want to save their pos fuel evemails its the fact that theyre doing it blindly and on a massive scale that annoys me
imo i think that ccp should look at the possibility of setting a page up through wwweveonlinecom to operate as a killboard theyve given us api keys to transfer our information to different programs so on and so fourth would it really be so hard for them to add a little tab that for player kills and when you log on it brings up your entire combat history a kill board made by ccp for players who pay to play their game since a majority of eve reverts back to player versus player combat at some point doesnt it strike you odd that theyre not already doing thisanyways signed i earned them kill mails they should be mine until i stop paying for my account

bring it backbring eve tv back too
i would really like to see some sort of skill that shortens the amount of time it takes to set up a pos or allows you to anchor or at least online more than one structure at a time yeah im working on putting one up right now but really it would be nice even if it was just something that allowed multiple people to set stuff up at once well what does everyone else think
supported
perhaps the higher the anchor skill the shorter the timein addition to that id like to see them more easily destroyed if they are offlined and out of fuel after say a week of no contact from ownercorp owner
rokh is fine yes i fly it
its fine go away
its a nice idea but as other posters have already observed it would be a programming nightmare since many skills require other skills backtracking would cause many more problems than it would solveno trolling intended but maybe you should head back to the drawing board
not needed imho
last idea i gave this one to ccp at game dev 2 years ago but never heard it mentioned like pos fuel savings your 0 space sov level would boost everyone in your alliances training times when they were in that space owned by that alliance so if you had sov level 4 you would train 5 faster then any other part of the gamesov 4  5sov 3  35sov 2  25sov 1  10simple an easy makes 0 space more valuable and will motivate people to move from empire to 0 gives players something nice for being good at eve
and completing the trifecta this one is actually even worse than your other two  technically infeasible public relations kryptonite and a terrible game mechanic all rolled into one
i dont expect this idea to carry a lot of love but you never knowso change the system to this idea and everyone will be happy your character account expires let everyone keep training what ever skill they had going to reactivate your account you have to pay for every month it was training so if you set a long skill like cap ship 5 which can take up to 60 days and you account expired in on day 5 of the 60 the account owner would have to pay for the 55 days worth of subscriptions to reactivate the account if you are paying with gtcs this would be 1 x 60 day gtc ccp is basically loaning you the money to keep training and gets paid back when you need your character back they dont lose anything you keep training if you cant log in for awhile if you had a 6 day skill training and your didnt come back for 30 days so 25 days of not training you would still have to buy a 30 gtc or pay for your account to go no loan from ccp they are getting the benefit
so make players who already quit once pay extra to resubscribe if theyre inclined to come back um no
another idea for the people with real world money super charger game time card you can pay 60 dollars for a 30 day play card and your skill points train twice as fast as normal so you can pay ccp to train faster with a limit of 6 scgtcs per year per account help you get into pvp faster etc
thats absurd no
if you dont like the region move
now this is just silly almost as silly as saying if you cant kill nanos fly one yourself or how about remove 00 because anyone who disagrees can go play wowyes there should be differences in the quality of regions but there shouldnt be multiple regions where a whole gameplay element is basically nonexistent how about a region where there are almost no asteroids or one where the market is limited to t1 items both of these seem ridiculous concepts but they are only slightly worse than the idea of a region with hardly any exploration contentim all for fighting for the best space but considering that in the coming update ccp are placing the main focus on t3 and improved exploration it would be nice if we could at least get some meaningful exploration content in all regions
ive never even been there but im going to support this i cant imagine living where i do without the occasional 1 billion isk bpc from exploration among other things
yep
proposing to nerf the minimum npc standings required for all mission levels except l5my account is barely one month old yet ive outgrown level 1 missions about a week after i started the only problem is i still dont have enough standing to start level 2sim currently flying all levels of cruisers w proper skills and weapons and am about to start flying bcs soon but im still stuck grinding away on those horridly easy l1 missions stuck until ive ground up enough standing for l2sim willing to bet this is a common problem for everyone required mission level standings need to be reduced by a significant amount i propose at least a 30 reductionwhat do you guys think
if you spent just a fraction of your training time working on social skills instead of the other skills you have been working the last month you would already be in lvl3s
i cant say i had a problem personally  l1s flew by and i got a cruiser cruiser skills and l2 standings all at about the same time the same goes for most of my other friends who climb the mission tree if it isnt working for you in that fashion train connectionsto up your standings or advanced learning skillsto leech off your money and training time until you grind your standing up
eve is a game where it takes time and investment of that time into skills etc in order to access the higher income streams its not wow or other type of similar game where players quickly climb to high levels and then compete directly with each otherthis imo is how it should besocial skills cosmos mission sets and storyline missions raise standings a little faster and allow access to higher lvl missions however accessing these missions without the ability to fly correct type of suitable ship or use decent mods etc will quickly drain your wallet of any isk you havetake carearithron
this ill even be helpful and point out the specific skill you should train connections which requires social 3 my guess is that youre well under a day of training from l2s and perhaps even a few days from l3s
get a cruiser and blitz them missions will take all of 5 minutes standing requirements for l2s are already low standing gain also increases with the level of missions you run making it actually rather quick to get to a l4 agent
nothing wrong with missions m8 they scale rather well with ship sizes and skills if youre doing level4s before 6 months in game something is seriously out of balanceoh wait it was and they nerfed ravens
without the connections skill there is a big gap between l1 and l2 missions since standing gains work of a percentage system if what i see on the standings screen is correct at the lower levels you already have low standings so it takes a lot longer to improve your standings from level 1 2 than it does for level 2  3 or level 3  4 so i am recommending that they increase the percentage gain from l1 missions
you know what thats a great idea raise the percentage gains from level 1 missions so everyone goes and spams them to death for very speedy standings gain
1 if they are running l1 missions they are getting crap for isk and lp2 add a system so that after you are eligible for the next level agent it reduces the amount of standings gain
youve got that entirely backwards the percentage standing change is a percentage of the difference between your current standing and 100for positive changes or 100for negative changes if youre at 00l1q0 getting to 20l2q0 is a 20 change if youre at 40l3q0 getting to 60l4q0 is a 33 change that same 20 boost will only get you to 52 standings you gain standing faster at low levels  otherwise 100 would be easy instead of nearimpossible
you guys do know that t2 transports were changed in qr
oh god yes
that would make eve even more a game where the wealthybe it ingame or real life can do whatever they want while the poor have to sufferiow go on rampage buy gtc bribe concord repeat ad nauseami agree that there should be ways beside ratting to regain sec status but it should be nothing so trivial as throwing some iskies at concordsec status is there for a reason
i propose an idea where you can bribe concord for a set period of time to access high sec space its part of some ideas i had for improving the life of low sec players walking the darker paths in low sec and 00 low sec needs work ill be looking out for good ideas to support if i get onto the csm this round bribery of concord to allow dash and thrash runs into high sec would be interesting take carearithron
im a pirate concord doesnt like mebut i think its a really poor idea eve has consequences if you start killing somebody you take the consequences you have to prove your worth to them not just pay some isk
you still have negative sec standings with concord so there are still consequences docking at stations etc would be difficult or could be made difficult plus aggressive actions could just result in normal responsesbribery levels could be set against sec status lower the sec status the more isk it costsimagine you could slip beneath the radar of concord for a bit eye up a juicy target and surprise themthere would be consequences but it would make empire a more interesting place to livearithron
id be inclined to entertain reasonable proposals for altering the way sec status is recovered but simply buying it off most likely through gtc sales doesnt make the cut
consequences such as you already lose your ship if you shoot things without reason what reasonable consequence could there be when surprising things after sneaking into highsecie getting your pod zapped would be unreasonable having it arrested so you cant do anything during your gametime would also be unreasonable so what would be reasonable
i was referring to losing your ship and taking a sec loss hit thus making it more expensive to bribe into high sec again currently there is no way other than using an alt for a low sec player to enter high sec to target juicier unsuspecting preybribery for a certain time would enable pirate gangs to make forays into empire it at least keeps the local on their toesarithron
when did they drop the tournament anyway
i dont want to be disrespectful here but i dont think you can really satisfy someone visually impaired using a guithat said did you know that the market automatically sells you the item from the person who has the lowest price listed however it sells it at the price listed on the one you are selected as that is what is transfered to the buy orderin other words undercutting by even 01 isk will guarantee you sell the item it does not matter if the buyer selected some other buy order even worse the difference between the selected price and the lowest listed price vanishes
where does the money come from he gets items from x gives money to x and sells item to y getting money from yso y is somehow creating moneyrightly soafter all we are playing alt online arent we the last thing this game needs is less altssarcasm
i think its been prismxthey decided to ignoredidnt see the issue of bpo and bpc and instead went for a more efficient storageill see if i find the thread edit here it issticky in features  ideasworks at purchasedoesnt work with copies later on is sometimes not even useable as even the smallest available container is too large100m3
this thread and the missilenano nerfs are evidence that 99 of most gamer forums are full of people who have no idea what they want but will screech for it anyway and then accuse the devs of being tards for allowing it to happen afterwardslets say bumping is replaced with collisionscheap t1 ship hulls no need for modules insurance scams and concord doesnt pod pods put all that together i guarantee you the roaming kamikazie gangs invading highsec space bumping off haulers or transports or mission ships looted by alts waiting in the wings will light these forums up like a string of nuclear tests or howabout expensive faction fit fleets popped by swarms of t1 frigates cruisers cheaper than fighters i would think goonfleet velator inconvenience op anyone itll certainly liven up eve thats fer shure
real collisions are only one option you can only modify bumping not replace it
i also do not want local to be nerfed though increasing intelligence gathering tools is another option it is not a very appealing one for a number of reasons
thanks 3 votes to your tally
just noticed that scagga has already done a thread along these lines so go there and pledge your support and well let this thread die
im flying a blaster taranis i can assure blasters doing fine in qr all bspwnmobile guys just socialize a litte bit having friends is a good thing
i actually like the idea of smaller ships standing a chance against larger ones
i think size shouldnt matter a small ship should be able to beat a big ship just like gnoms and taurons in wow
there is no missile nerf big weapons are not supposed to hit smaller targets thats all although a proper fitted ship flown by a competent pilot can still own smaller ships
if you havent voted yet this is the guy you should vote for
i officially endorse goum hes a bit lacking in the niceness department but when it comes to ideas on ship balance i would trust his opinion over any other
i never said it was less offensive merely that there were alternatives available would that mean that the 24th imperial crusade the amarr npc fw corp should also be considered offensivesure jihadswarm hit a few nerves but at the end of the day people need to remember that this is just a game
i didnt claim that using religious terminology was offensive garion did i have no problem with 24ic jihadswarm or any other group like that
oh give me a breakyoure actually debating whether or not the use of the word jihad is appropiate or not because it exists in rl seriously slavery is soaked all over the amarr storyline and the game itself they make a point of mentioning it as often as they can not to mention its religiousslavery was and is a very real thing that id argue is far worse than some miniscule dingbat word like jihad and its connection to religionwe have plenty of people who rp amarr to the fullest you guys are awesome btw including the parts about slavery and why shouldnt they in fact i would be sad if they didntyou know its people like you who advocate religious political and racial sensitivity to the extremes like this who are the ones partially at fault for problems existing around these kind of topics in the first placeas soon as you make it law or somehow proliferate the idea of a new word badness or some other thing from the previously mentioned topics onto people as it being a taboo then you can demonize genuine good people who are nothing close to what you accuse them of being just because you have an ignorant superstitious way of thinkingif pure hypothetically i wanted to play a zealous amarr who not only advocated prejudice religious doctrine slavery holy wars torture and all manners of religious utterings to justify my bombings of a defenseless mining operation including jihad i declare holy war or struggle on your mining operation so there but also was quite active in utilizing various slang to degrade the minmatars  then dangit i want to be able to and if you cant tolerate that then either block me go to a different topic on the forum a different system in the game declare war on me or simply get the hell out of my pretend spaceship universeim not saying common decency towards each other is bad not at all of course we should respect each other and try to get along and we do  it is in our nature as humans we to tend to want to work together to achieve various goals and to do that it is in each others best interest to get along but see what happens when you turn the act of kindness and tolerance into a mode that equates to a witchhunt of fanatical proportions the second you spot the latest fashion in words the cant be usedits a gameand many years ago the word breast was highly improper which is also why the terms white meat and dark meat came to be think about it3edit ii just realised im defim defe man this is hard to say its so unreal im defending goonsoh godthis is itthe world is endingfaints xx
military experts are calling this a clueless rant
i normally dont have a snipe at whatever csm candidates feel like they want to do its their business but i feel i just have to give my 2 cents here sorryunrealistic as you said it is entirely counter productive business wise and community wise to one way or the other force alts out of the game if anyone for any reason wish to have an alter ego as far as ingame characters go they should be allowed tosince before 2008 i didnt have any alts whatsoever but today i have 2each one of them disconnected from the other 2 in terms of what they do what corporation they are in and only i and a small handful of close friends know who they are and i prefer to keep it that wayno disrespect intended but i will would a point out of opposing you and this idea if you ever tried to run with it i want to keep my privacy thank youwell this one is a no brainerwill never happen in any shape or form as you said unrealisticblush you know i wish i had read this before i started replying to the post but to tell you the truth i had already written half this post before i noticed this little gold nugget and so i figured i might as well finish the posthonestly the way i see it if you have the finances the resources infrastructure and dedication why shouldnt you have benefits like thisposes are a pain to maintain and this is proportional to how many poses you have over large areas of spaceif you put in the effort i say you deserve a little comfort imhowaityoure an eve playerand you want to add things as opposed to the usual fix stuffz befoar u add moar crapim confused
i would remove the solar system jita from the game i think
all i can add to thiswithout clearly demarcated rules in place to direct behavior it takes a very disciplined group not to break down into infightingthe last csm from internal and external influences had a lot of infightingi would like to see this not happen this timethanks for being patientak
exactly my point with making csm fixing a big priority rules of order dont tend to reduce the amount of infightingnothing but having people actually get along can do that and theres no procedural change that will do that but it does reduce the severity of infighting and while thats not perfect it would be a distinct improvement
all this talk of rules of order is distracting while it obviously inevitably consumed wasted a great deal of the 1st csms time it didnt stop getting on with the issues at hand it is interesting therefore that this is such a high issue on the 2nd csm candidate debate when the 1st csm found a working method for a group of philosophically opposed individuals to still bring the 5 year backlog of relatively small player issues to the table imo it was explicitly through too much focus on rules and not enough get on with it pragmatic approach that the rules became so important as such for 2nd csm candidates jostling for position on i am holier than thou debates on would you step down is misguided you can step down if that is a wise thing to do that has already been set in place as a second csm you will need to focus on what are the big issues facing the eve universes players and what effort you can put into defining and shaping those issues in preparation for your term
yes you guys cleaned up a good deal of a 5year backlog despite your differences i dont think anyone here is trying to disparage that achievement but im not running for the first csm im running for the second csm cleaning up old issues isnt going to be the defining characteristic of the second csm the way it was for the first if this project is going to succeed in the long term it needs some structure  force of personality is great when everything is new and the process is being run by eager folk full of pv but it doesnt sustain things over the long term furthermore given that you have cleared up a lot of the bigticket items we actually have the time to sit back and come up with procedures instead of just taking whichever course gets us into the meaty topics fastest while your results were good last time your methods sucked utterly there was no real documentation no easy way for new players to understand what was going on internal governance based entirely on how the chair felt like doing things today meetings that stretched on endlessly because nobody prepared much of anything an assembly hall that looked like eve general with thumbs and inexplicable monthlong gaps between meetings and lets not even get into yourpersonal not collective baitandswitch on reference materials thats why i focus so heavily on internal procedures  theres as much room for improvement there as there is in the forums and igb combinedeven if its have less effect its just as badly broken and its something we dont need to wait on ccp to implement we can fix it ourselves nearly instantly and make everything else thereafter work in better fashion its not the most important thing the csm can do but because its both relevant and easy to actually accomplish its one of the highest priorities now that the first wave of ancient grudges is largely off the table
new blog post is up finallywill copy it over tomorrow morning as we head into the final day of votingto all my supporters out there thank you your support and confidence has meant a great deal to me regardless of the outcome of the election you have insured that i will leave this election process more inspired than ever about working to improve our wonderful game and if i am on the csm or not i hope to do my best to work for your concerns in the days and months ahead thank youto all those who have not yet voted and are reading this what are you waiting for read up on the candidates ask them questions ask me questions and whether you decide that i am the person you want to support of not vote and make your voice heard
had a look around and you got my vote if i can ever get good enough to get out to null sec
crosspostingplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesand were back from a bit of a break in blog postslets talk about lowsec now the general consensus is that it somewhat sucks living in lowsec a good bit of the time as i do i have to agree  in fact it sucking is why i dont live in lowsec more than i do id love to spend most all of my time in lowsec i think it could be a really cool place to try and build a mid sized cartel not quite like the big 00 alliances but a group that still manages to control the area through economic military and political influence even though the sovereignty mechanisms of 00 dont exist i personally think that has the potential to be a cooler endgame than 00 pos warfare and lagfests not that i have anything against 00 i just personally think i might find lowsec more interestingexcept for that one little thing about lowsec sucking its not worth the effort of all that right now so being enough of a pragmatist to realize when it would just be plain silly and dumb to totally devote my energy to that and waste corporate and alliance resources for little gain my dream remains largely unfulfilledoh sure i idoi run a coalition of alliances and corporations that have all signed naps with each other and try to work together in a small area of lowsec but thats really just a taste of what i wish i could accomplish in lowsec and the reward so often doesnt justify the effort that its only my devotion to the idea that has kept me going with it as often as notso lets identify a few specific things that could be donefirst i think we need to promote rewards for industrial efforts in lowsec lowsec needs to be worth it in terms of industry or else the only reason people will go there for the most part is for combat maybe to get to 00 or to take a shortcut and once a month to fuel their pos and that doesnt really give the pirates enough to shoot at mission runners and ratters have some reason to go to lowsec and people that want to run a pos but miners lowsec ores are a joke and this is in urgent need of attentionresearchers do have some reason to take shuttles in once every so often to get shorter waiting times on me research slots but there currently exists no reason for industrialists to do the same with manufacturing slots now im normally the last to advocate a nerf but i think we need to consider all options here when it comes to making lowsec manufacturing slots advantageous over highsec ones and advantageous enough to be worth the effort of securing a supply line if this were done we might see industry corps start to try to use lowsec a bit more  the clever ones would prosper over both ones that were not so clever and fell prey to pirates and over those who remain in highsec  which is as it should be and certain friends of mine who operate on the other side of the law tell me that this would make things much more fun for them toosee improve industry and everyone profitswhile improving industry and mining i think it might be a good idea to look at a few other things in lowsec as well missions are better in lowsec than highsec yes  but still most people choose to do them in highsec rather than lowsec despite it being a irelativelyi safe activity to engage in in lowsec perhaps we should look at farther boosts to lowsec missions  though this is purely speculative of course any changes need to be carefully consideredcontinued
now if highsec is considered the home of the carebears and 00 the home of the great alliances lowsec is generally considered the home of pirates while i would like it to be home to clever industrial groups as well im not adverse to it maintaining something of a reputation for shadiness  in fact im very much for this reputation for shadiness and think it would be great if some of the industry groups that become successful in lowsec acquired a similar reputation for perhaps bending the law every so often so perhaps we should put more or any pirate agents in lowsec so that people can run mission for them there and gain standings and then lets make those standings mean something like standings to the empires do  say if you have positive standings or standings over a certain amount with a pirate group rats of that faction wont shoot at you this might be of some interest to miners if they cant get someone to tank the rats for them   lets also give traders a little something and make npc buy and sell orders for various illegal commodities  drugs and the like  in lowsec arrange things so that long risky journeys through lowsec to trade these goods will be very profitable as will trips that require smuggling through highsec to reach an isolated pocket of lowsec traders will have fun with this and pirates who prey on them will as wellnow simply improving reasons to go to lowsec isnt the only thing that needs to be done its very hard to control and defend unlike 00 or at least so i understand while i think this is part of its charm and i would never want lowsec to be as easy to control as 00 is or as broken up into power blocks i do believe it should be a bit easier than it is now  and that their should be rewards for managing such a difficult feat besides the fame of course how well ill be honest with you here  im not sure this part of the plan needs a bit of work i know at least one of my fellow csm candidates has some plans regarding this and i hope that this is something we will have the chance to work on together and you can be assured that im thinking carefully about this but i also want your thoughts and opinions on this so tell melowsec sucks how can we make it better
i have cast my vote today it went to you
whilst im still small ive found killing rats and salvaging quite lucrative better than mining the problem i have is the one youve hinted at and that is who owns the wrecks one time i was salvaging wrecks that somebody else killed and they were ok with that and actually apologised that they had killed the rats as they had only done it out of boredom another time i was killing rats near some miners in highsec and they moaned about new rats spawning even though they were fully tanked for 00 and yet another time miners were killing rats as they came in using drones so i had no chance to kill them and then moaned when i salvaged them even though it was obvious they were only interested in mining it should be noted at no time do i take the cargo what is the deal with salvaging i know concord has no problem but there seems to be no consistency within the eve communityjavascriptinsertsmiliewebposttext
it would make sense to be able to probe out wrecks in addition to ships the chances of probing wrecks inside deadspace should be reduced as currently happens with missioners in deadspace those that moan about salvagers and ninja salvagers are missing the point about wrecksthey are available floating about in the vast tracts of space for salvaging they dont belong to anyone the loot inside them has ownership currently to the person that killed the ratcharacter stealing this ensures some flagging and a little bit of extra fun for the salvager and mission runnerarithron
i do believe that wrecks should be able to be probed yes
this is really a key that mission runners have been missing considering the number of missions that are turned in that still exist in deadspace when a mission runner leaves adding the ability to scan for wrecks would inevitably allow us to clean them up and reduce lag on the systemtheres a greater chance for the ninja salvager to target a field of wrecks that have been abandoned especially if theyre searching out for a specific type and ignore the mission runners found on scan completelyconsider this with the current mechanic you scan out an area and find 5 ships on scan you warp to each one and out of that 3 are still active while the other 2 hits were ghost hits possibly a ship warping tofrom a location you now have 3 viable locations to ninja salvagein the proposed change using the same 5 hits and 3 viable locations as above you also find an additional 5 wreck fields upon warping to each wreck field you find that some have mission runners return but some do notthe key to the above change is that you now have more targets than before and for those who are only in it for the salvage they are more likely to go to the empty wreck fields first and for those running missions you are decreasing the chance that theyre coming back to your missionfrankly thinking this way its a winwin
i as well would like the evemail igb and forums to have a major overhaul and perhaps a rewrite the systems do work but theyre a pita to use and could definitely see some improvementsevemail sent items folder new items first expanded text spaceigb talk with somebody in the browsing industry and theyll be happy to help most browsers are freeware so all it would require is a little bit of code adaptationforums how many times do they expect you to log in to post a reply 3 4 the webservers and forum server could use a little bit of communication between eachother along with other upgrades
currently you can change your characters face i would like the option to change the character name could charge a fee could be part of buying a character could be freei feel it would be nice for someone who bought a character to change the characters identity remove former associationssomeone who wanted a specific character name that wasnt available at the time of creation is now available biomass processinganyone who would change the picture of their character would surely be interested in changing the namean argumentyou can already do this simply by buying a new character now money is transferred directly to the character being sold so there isnt necessary a post to track who bought it and an alt could have been used anyway was the buddy list an intended intel tool like local if this was tied to the character name rather than some other value associated with the character it could be a problem easy fix would be require that the character doesnt have any kill rights
when a jaguar can own an assault launcher equiped cerberus that is flown by a pilot with more or less maxed skills for missiles and shield tanking then something isnt right
meh just repeal the whole patch turret boats got hit hard too deal with it
you must have been doing something very wrong for this to have happened
i did nothing wrong as i was the jag pilot and it was with repeated testing on sisithe cerb pilot is one of the best i have known and he even tried kinetic precisions as well as cn bloodclawsits not just us that have found this to be the case either
i find the missle nerf excellent i can now tank guristas rats in a bc on the same level as i tank gunbased rats adittionally from everything ive seen and ive been out ratting with some mates in a raven they can instapop the frigs moving at full speed no problem sure he fits a target painterwhat this has done is put caldari ships in line with the ability of galente and minmatar ships when it comes to ratting and pvp where the ability for torps to hit frigates for full damage was ending the usefullness of ships that were smaller than cruisers and not speed tanked this nerf did more to end nano fleets than the nano nerf
signed
getting in range of the jag  doing it wrong tbh from my experience aml cerb casually slaughters all frigatesbut even in a straight slugfest at pointblank range with an unwebbed abing jag which cant actually close on a mwdfit cerberus and if it uses mwd to do so then it just dies im having difficulty modelling a sensible jag fit than can survive for more than a couple of minutes of kinetic aml fire  which just isnt long enough to deal enough damage to cut through any kind of tanked cerbs tank so id like to know the fits tbh
signed i have had to hang up my mission hat for perma mining i dont wanna retrain new skills just so i can friggin do missions ccp please revert or find a medium for this please
wait a minute i think you might be on to something hereanyway im still in suspense for the big changes alluded to by bane glorious on scrapheap im sure theyre coming any moment now
god thats a terrible changethe worst thing about the nagflar is its terrible cpu if youre going to fix anything give it more cpu the next thing is its dps make it so both guns and launchers have 2 bonuses applied from the hull dont take away 14th of its dpsfinally it doesnt really need 6 low slots with fixed cpu so drop a low slot and add at least 1 preferably 2 mid slots so the shield tank doesnt suck horriblytldr shut up stupid alt troll
but havent you heard minmatar ships are supposed to speed tanknah id like to at least see some investigation into this
now come on its just a suggestion this is my main forum main but it does not matter for this task and i will not use another just to give others more ammo against me like you fascist bob or you dumb goon please dont take this personally its just an examplegiving 4 bonuses from the hull seems a bit much a third non weapon related would be much more minmatar style imho admittedly i dont fly a nag myself but i saw action alongside them if you feel like the master of all things sure go ahead see if more cpu alone makes the nag betteri should also add that ccp seems to balance across races not ship classes so minmatar end up having overall above average small ships and overall underperforming capitals
this game has the special feature of training your character while you are not online we all know its a really unique feature compared to most if not all mmorpgs out there i support having some kind of queue feature for this game since ghost training was nerfed it would be good to have a long queue list ready to train as long as your account is paid i suggest a long queue because of all the possible reasons why a player might not be able to log in like mentioned on some of the previous replies on this topic i strongly believe that it will only beef up this games reputation and add to the unique qualities this mmorpg already has i love this game
hmmm posted the exact same idea in the features and ideas discussion here
yep
the it idiots at work are blocking ports i cannot switch while at work anymore getting ready to take a trip for work too in brazil no internet down there skill queue please
my second paying account supports this idea too
imo the key role of the bo so far is the portal gen now portalling 1 stupid hauler i used up 2k nitro iso holding 26k nitro iso in totla  a few missiles in my cargo that means the boat itself was not able to do the jump to the same cyno afterwards cos the bo itself would have used 900 nitro jfc lvl 4 btwcant be true that u r not able to jump a single hauler  urself how the hell should the bo be able to move small recon gangs around which was announced to be their role ccp wake upimo the usage of a ship jumping trhough a portal should be about the same ammount as if using a bridge like around 25units for a cruiser no cargoincrease fuel bay fuel bay mod neededthough ll gladly drop one launcher if there was to fit a fuel bay module for example i dont fly a bo widow for dpsi like the idea of creating an additional role for the bo cyno jammer takedownimo the ship is pure support but the main role still is the portal of which the fuel consumption is absolutely ridiculous
yes11 i support
i dont understand ccps view on this used to be able to put fully fitted out ships in carriers with their cargo in them ccp made a change and still not sure why they did it just seemed designed to give pilots a headache so sure this has my support
oh for the love of godthis doesnt require considerationonly one thing needs to be done add an option to the right click menu of a skill set as backup skillwhen ever your current skill training finishes the backup starts if no backup is set it stopswhen a backup starts the backup queue is reset so you can only ever queue up 1 skill after your currentthis fixes the 6 hours skills by allowing you to group two of them together to cover overnight or pick a 6 hour skill  battleships 5 and each night nock off another 610 hour skill and then return to battleships 5 its super simple super easy to implemement 1 extra value on a charactor record with the id of a skill to train upon skill training completion or null if there is not one setseriously why has this not been done yet single worst thing about eve is the lack of any form of queueing
this
well i often leave my eve client running in the background when im training the shorter skills cause i find the logging in process tedious while doing some other stuff i think im not the only one so ccp might mistake that for me playing had another nice run in with the downside of having no skill queue just this week my connection went to hell connection was down for bout 20 hours and according to the helpdesk of my isp i should be lucky it was only 20 hours as they gave me an estimated time of 5 work days so i just missed about 18 hours of training next time who knows might be a week
incorrect the codes to make a 1 skill queue is not easier then a 10100 skill queue or atleast it is such a little effect that it doesnt matter
well thats nice and everything but havent this been on the workbanch for like 45 yearsand wouldnt you imagine that after x months without any real replies it starts to be kind of a joke that you aint saying or replying about anything that have to do with thiskind of like the speed nerf how could it take you x years too fix something that needed it that badly pbut well you fixed it hmm
i prefer the second option the dual training mechanic because if you can connect in too many hours the short skills is a real problem but with this system you dont have the problem you put a very lonk skill and the shot skill and you ensure that you dont lost time
well its the difference of single pointer vs single pointer wrapped in linked list object trivial but the single pointer is harder to screw up panyway support
way better
1those menu really need an overhaul
i support this topic

would like more clones as wellsupport this idea
i have only used bombs on the test server i can cloak immediately after deploying bomb and it will still explode is it not the same on tranquility
battleships got phased out of rl naval warfare because aircraft carriers gained the ability to generate useful levels of firepower at far longer ranges given the nature of naval detection systemsie you cant hide a capital ship this meant that the battleship was sunk without those big guns ever coming to bear they still have roles even on the modern field of battle but they dont have a big enough role to justify spending several billion on one besides the only nation with a serious navy already has two in commission they dont really need any more of them that said the comparison of rl naval warfare to eve warfare is problematic ship losses dont matter so much in eve  really the comparison is pt boatsbattleships destroyerscarriers cruisersdreadnoughts and the worlds most expensive b29 dropping a nuketitans that changes tactics pretty fundamentally when losses are nearly irrelevant
dear csm i feel that the current situation of characterbased posting on these forums is not a good thing if you have a look at general discussion for example you see a vast amount of trolling swearing and general effing and blinging this is frequently down to people realising the following 1 they dont lose anything by trolling as they can alt 2 trolling can be very hard to detect as alts can switch between trolling so as not to be rumbled 3 you can say pretty much anything on the forums with an alt as such i propose the following system for the forums 1 the current system of altposting is suspended 2 your game account is linked to the forums directly not via your characters 3 instead of one of your characters you instead get a display name your avatar remains the same as today  you can chose between the faces of all three of your characters this would counter several problems 1see that chap with the stupidly long name imagine if ccp could just shorten his forum name without affecting his characters 2it would promote the community as people are less able to trollalt 3an effective moderation system can be implemented on the forums of course this would not stop all altposting if somebody has more than one game account hell have 2 forum names as a moderator of other forums i feel that this system  which would be similar to most other forums  would help improve the forums yours doctor penguin and this is my main fyi ps dont forget to tick that thumbsup checkbox if you like this idea
because youd set a permanent display name youd have your username yes that would not be displayed on the forums for example bobs username is bob he logs in on his account bob currently has three characters  bill jack and irene he can post as all three of them he could be the essence of a great forumgoer on bill but he could troll all he likes as jack and irene with is proposal bob logs in a page comes up telling him about the changes and prompting him to give his bob usernamed account a display name because hes well loved as bill he chooses bill he may only post as bill but he could use any of bob jack and irenes character portraits
i support this 100 transparency is a great thing
death to the trolls or at least better accountability for forum users fully supported
this wouldnt stop people from making new accounts then shutting them off but if anything it would make it harderso yeah im all for this makes it a bit more challenging to sneak around but hey would make these boards a bit more readableme thumbs upps of course this also puts a lot of multicorpers on the spot but if anyhting it will make it interesting
bring it on baby
enough with the trolling alts
this idea delivers
this would be sweet but for rewards how about doing them through the lp store under concordme thumbs up
definitely a great idea wouldnt even have to be that much of a reward maybe just make there like a monthly raffle for a prize and for every good bug report you file you get one ticket for it or something medals would be nifty too something that we could toggle to appear below our portraits to pimp them out
hello all i was going through some of the nonpublic skills and i saw a skill called reverse engineering which will be re from here on out and i was wondering what the community thought about asking to bring it back for those who havent seen this skill it basically lets you take an item and take it apart to get a bpc from it obviously there would have to be limits and restrictions like you cant re deadspaceofficer gear maybe the number of runs for the bpc you recieve will be ralated to the lvl of the re skill like re lvl 1 would give you 1 or 2 runs on a bpc that makes 1 or 2 of the item since this skill is already in the database all ccp would have to do is open it up to the public and populate it they could also use research slots to do the re jobs since it still counts as research i also think that maybe ccp should make it so you have to use up more then one of the item when you re it with the possibility of you getting the item back growing percentage wise as your re lvl increases please let me know what you guys think if you support please dont forget to check the box thanks
well i cant see why it wouldnt be a good ideabpcs and bpos are such an expensive and massive yet scammed as well industry this just adds a new twist to itheck why notme thumbs up
supported
yesi finally have drakes supporting vote on one of my posts  just messin with you drake i do agree with you that bpobpcs are an area that people get scammed in a good bit and i hope that ccp will do something in the future to help remedy this but that was another thread maybe ccp already has a system in place that would let players distinguish re bpcs from regular ones this was a nonpublic skill which means it has been in the db for a whileits a possibility thanks for the supporting votes so far and the commentssuggestions made please feel free to add your own commentssuggestions and your support if that is the case fly safeps supporting my own topic because i like the idea of taking stuff apart
how can they ever think about letting the ally toutney run out bring it back with eve tv

the purpose behind a war dec is so that two corpsalliances can fight in high and low security space without concord interference this is all well and good and should be kepthowever this latest trend of war deccing people and essentially not bothering to show up kind of makes the whole thing pointless so heres what i propose1 the corpalliance that initiates the war dec is required to get at least 1 kill per day of the war dec2 failure to get a kill for a day would mean that the corpalliance that declared war pays a penalty for wasting concords time with their lack of actually fighting3 the penalty payment could either be done as the dec fees are or paid to the members of the corpalliance that was decced4 penalty payment should be 5 million isk per member of the corpalliance that was deccedthis will ensure that corps and alliances declaring war actually come out to fight lest they get hit with massive penalty payments i suppose an alternative would be that if the corp deccing fails to get a kill for a day you shorten or end the war now while some would say that this encourages people not to undock from what i have seen thats not actually the case with many decs on the contrary weve always had the problem of finding the wts who dec us and then immediately seem to run away or hide from us if you are going to declare war then you should be made to actually fight or suffer for it
i agree with punishing people who declare a war but dont turn up but im not sure about the specific trigger for not turning up because if you force a trading corp to stay docked up that still hurts them because they cant haulmaybe require the corp declaring war to either get one kill a day or spend a specific length of time uncloaked in space in a system having war targets online in it for example camping the station they are docked up in
at the risk of seeing people not read this post carefully and make assumptions let me be clear on whats being said here1 corp a war decs corp b2 corp a doesnt show up to fight at all3 corp a gets slapped with fines from concordme thumbs up1 corp a war decs corp b2 corp b dosent show up to fight at all3 corp b gets slapped with fines from concordme thumbs downget it got it goodbut only in that case otherwise forget about itpunish the war decer not the recipentas the recipent has no choice in the matter the declarer of wars does have a choice
if someone launches a dec and doesnt show up there already is a penalty  2 million isk per week thats not huge but a lot of wars are small so a flat rate would have to be set around that level this isnt necessarily a perfect system and id be willing to listen if you had a concrete suggestion for change but the status quo isnt terrible enough that ill advocate blind change
the whole war dec mechanic needs reworkedi dont really see why this is an issue if i dec you and change my mind i paid for the right to kill you if i want to i dont see why it should be mandatorywhat if we try to kill you but you kill us all and we dont get a kill do we still have to payas for the rp of wasting concords time they took the payment now youre also wanting them to keep track of killsinstead make this part of the revamp one of the win conditions is getting a kill if we go three days without killing anyone the war is retracted due to lack of interest or everyone being dead
i think the time to online is a useful balance because it allows opponents a chance to preventobstruct the construction of the pos however it would be nice if you could set up an onlining script so that you could place the modules then have them automatically online themselves one at a time as occurs now  but without the need for someone sitting there clicking a button every so often unattended construction would of course be done at the owners risk
allright then at least consider the off lining time being shorter  o p
train more skills so your 20m powergrid implant is the same as my 20m cpu implant on my gallente character to fit t2 blasters on the hyperion
ok try fittin t2 arty and mwd on tempest without multiple rcu d
tempest is cheaperand hyperion is gallente so it should be crap
some very good feed back i do agree that the programming and scripting would be a nightmare and everyone changing skills would make the db a bit messydrake i agree with you i like the changes i wouldnt change any of the patches they have released even though i am a caldari pilot specd comletely in missiles p i always enjoy new challenges its what makes a game that is worth playing not to mention the sexy graphics just a thought i wanted to share not really supported so i withdraw my proposal  maybe i will find something else to suggest that may rally more support something useful thank you all for your comments and fly safe 
o7  nonbitter caldari pilotif anything this has made it more challenging and not so easy to gank raven someoneadaptor die thats what eve is very much liketime to move ontheres always something new around the cornerps im only semicontent im quickly realizing that minmatar ships are in need of much loving
at least this one has a somewhat decent rationale while i dont think its a necessity nor do i think this is the best idea some real incentive for participating in sovereignty warfare would be a good thing for this game most people play it either because they have friends or simply over old grudges other than resource rights there really isnt any payout for the individual pilot
no
i will take anything good for free so this is good too
wouldnt this play a lot of havoc with skill training plans as you cant predict when a skill will finish unless you know when you will be outside your alliances space what about people who refuse to take part in alliance ops outside of alliance systems because they dont want to lose training time or people who only defend the high sov system so your saying that your alliance will be happy letting you use the rewards of holding systems even though you dont help hold them 
bad idea
is the op on drugsoh and this is a no on my part o p
no
signed i like it
so after you have ghost trained a realy long skill and dont want to pay for like 3 months to reactivate can i have your stuff
so if this training change is here to stay i wouldnt mind some sort of micro transaction method set up so i can continue training without having to subscribe
well hell then lets make eve online freeno
keep your account active if you want to progress
eventhough i am pretty sure this idea will be found to be not feasable just giving my 2 cents there are still plenty of people with dynamic ips and eventhough i have a static one i am in hotels and the like during weekdays quite a lot so logging on with a different ip then
i wouldnt support the idea of locked ips for accounts as you said people who travel alot and use local wireless in hotels and such would not be happy at all it would also effect people who travel overseas for instance i am currently deployed to afghanistan and my internet is run through a satellite isp which is in italy or some crazy thing like that so i wouldnt be able to login and change skills i would have canceled my account so i dont waste money and i would miss out on a year or more of training i really hope that ccp doesnt implement something like this because there will be alot of unhappy people just my 2 cents
make it optional and surestatic ips 4tw
you must have misheard or not understood what was being saidfor ccp to even think of such a thing would either have to be optional or just downright hilariously stupideven broadband connections migrate ips over timeeven if you knew nothing about the nature of tcpip structure when it comes to internet connections its nigh impossiblei mean im sure people who are on dial up even play this game granted not really playablebut what about those people too
no
no
like this one too two for 2
strange how those against it dont post any reason why it is a bad idea
your internet has been revoked op now please leave
no dont think so
this ive said 4 many years
stop posting already
why this idea is awesomeness wrapped in bacon i have a job i can afford 6x60 a year per account love me poor person love me jk
nej
hell nogtfogb2wow
dont like the topic leave the discussion
i would check the quality of your agents that you are using and go to the highest level agent you can use keep checking when your standings are increasing as well train your social skill depending on what agents you are using stick with the same corporation as much as possible i can do level 2s in high sec after a fortnight running missions for a couple of hours a day
they probably dont i mean one day they may realise they can use covertops cloaks and jump portals on blockade runners and werent designed to have cruiser sized mwds on them
yeah you probably dont want to vote for me i like the other stuff more not that i have anything against the pvp or that it would stop me doing my job if elected its simply not where my interests lie
in life you usually contact the police if your property is stolen in eve theft isnt a crime so you have to deal with it yourselfas i see it the problem arises when people in big ships like battlecruisers for an example steals from a miner in a retriever as an example the bc pilot has alot of skills in gunnery the retriever pilot has alot of skills in the industry departmentthat makes it an easy gank its not as easy as some people portray it for a miner to retrieve his lost property from a high skilled pvper
get out your hauler align to station drag the stuff from a can to your hold half a second before you warp and stay docked for 15 minutes if youre stealing to steal and your timing is good its pretty close to safe and if you blow it hey haulers are cheap
its definately a possibility but if the jetcan is full you need cargo expanders to move a full can into cargo bay or you have to do two trips which is ofcourse impossible in this case so you have to risk some expanded cargo iis i would say you got a decent 50 chance here since pvpers aint stupid they will most likely try to bump you when you do the transfer  theft and web scramble and shoot you so the timing has to be perfect lucky if its a can of veld most miners would probably shrug leave the stolen ore and consider the time and effort a waste
the smartest ones will already have you targeted and even if youre aligned to warp a point will stop that move quickly without the targeting the odds are severely stacked in the competent thiefs favourthree words ice miners and angymonne easy pickings but bring your cargo expanders
can we get some response real quickwhat do csm think about mission rewards in high sec and various aspects about it like loot from mission causing problem people not going to low sec and not giving pirates a chance to kill them and things like thatreal quick before the voting
missions are an issue in that the rewards due not scale well with the risks associated with various security ratings of systems more needs to be done to increase profitability of lower security status areas in general loot is a more complex issue that really deserves its own thread the long and short of it is that tech 1 item production is going to have a problem no matter what you do with loot from missions so long as it exists what should be done is another matter
the higher missions in empire lvl 3 and 4 give decent returns for relatively low risk loot and salvage make up a good chunk of the reward for missions and ive stated elsewhere that this side of things should be freed up a little to allow more access to salvagers and looters essentially making mission deadspace a little easier to find gates within deadspace will need to be locked to the missionrunner and any associated gang to prevent mission griefing however at all stages the mission runner should be able to be probed outthe effects of t1 loot on markets eg minerals is essentially a guess atm without firm figures its hard to calculate what deflationary pressure loot reprocessing and mineral sales have you also have to consider what happens when you stop such mineral streamsprices go upwards modules and ships become more expensive etc for newer players ships and modules have been getting cheaper the past year or two invention has certainly helped bring down t2 gear etcnamed gear allows newer players to have better modules and weaponry at lower skill reqs getting rid of this would make the skill divide all the greater its interesting how all the calls seem to be to get rid of plain ol t1 loot aloneim all for making more missions essentially a percentage of lvl 3 and a bigger number lvl 4 go into low sec at times for such missions risks increase so the rewards should be the incentive to do such missionstake carearithron
eve resources are generally distributed widelywith the coming of the salvage and some shelves exemple the bonus rooms of some lvl 4 missions which allow wide quantities of uber items through highsec and highsec only i see no point in getting any kind of high end minerals also in highsec missionsits not a risk vs reward thing but splitting resources totally would be a way to force players to spread everything where you dont need anyone else to get be it market or 00 space is imo bad for the gamewithout the market and the fact that i need to get to some other place to finalize my itemsfittings eve loses a lot of its spice
i firmly believe that we need to encourage more people to go to lowsec indeed thats one of the main points of my campaign missions are indeed more profitable in lowsec already but perhaps not enough to convince many people the risk is worth it  so yes we should look at possibly making lowsec missions more profitable possibly people may simply need to be made aware of the greater rewards in lowsec as well but definitely we should consider if those rewards are currently great enough to justify the risk though of course the risk is far less than many thinkas for loot from missions yes the t1 loot at least does cause problems anyone thats tried to manufacture and sell t1 items knows that unless its popular or doesnt drop much you have a hard time selling it and yes this is a problem however im not sure simply stopping t1 loot is the answer  if player ships drop their modules as loot then in my opinion npc ships should drop modules as loot  but only modules that one would expect them to have used none of this nonsense with npc pirate ships dropping mining modules but balance is the most important thing here though hopefully it can be balanced while still maintaining a high level of similarity with what happens when you destroy a player ship well see either way it needs to be looked at very hard and very carefully
 lowsec missions need to be buffed somehow  they arent good enough to draw anyone out of santenpaa at present id suggest a serious bonus to overall rewards from doing missions in lower sec statuses among other things there is a progression at prese
click here to download the issue document i submitted to ccp while i was on the csmindex1 missions need to be made more dynamic and unpredictable2 mission payout in lowsec and 00 needs improvement3 module loot may have a negative impact on the economy by making t1 production obsolete and injecting too many minerals into the economy4 missions in factional warfare require improvements5 mining missions require improvements6 level 4 missions in their current form do not belong in highsecurity space7 standing is being monopolized by missions no ways to get standing outside of mission running with the exception of fw standing8 less ships but higher difficulty
i think the mission rewards need to be skewed to make running missions in low sec clearly more rewarding this would be just one of many things ccp could do to make low sec more compellingissler

agreed there is a common belief that something large can be brought down by a multitude of singularly weak attackers its like being pecked to death by ducks is one way of putting it sadly in eve this only affects ships not corporations or alliances logistics of the 00 alliances are kept hidden and safe and have been since capitals were introducedthats the way the 00 alliances want things to be and ccp will bow before their whims the proposed carriernerf was halted in its tracks by the massive outrage of 00 players and unbelievingly ccp backed down so i have little doubt that the new sovereignty mechanics will continue the proud tradition of allowing the powerful to claim vast tracts of space without being bothered by troublesome logistical concerns such as defending their territory from lone attackers or small groups or actually working ie mining fuel to sustain their empire players out in 00 refuse to do things they find unpleasant or which might impose a vulnerability upon them the the game should reflect that the only place these days for the solo fighter looking for a challenge is lowsec there is no point in his going to 00 to take on the biggest baddest boys in the game since he can affect no damage on their logisticsto that end im merging my two accounts into a single one while id be happy to support ccp if they had plans to change things i cant really say i believe they will and quite honestly if there is no means for a single player to harm a 00 alliance then theres no reason for me to go therefore there is no need of a second account for scoutingfieldrepairmaybe im getting too old for these games in my youth and to this day i always sought out the toughest challenges i could find ive modded pc games to become nearly impossible and still beat thembut these days people are more interested in the easy way
not in the slightest logistics chains that are easier to attack mean that alliances can do more attacking of logistics chains if you want to kill someone this is a boon to you the issue as it relates to this thread is that even then these are not solo actions because if they were than any decent coordinated effort would make these logistics impossible alliances already do that having dedicated people that exist simply to make production for the other side difficult can you imagine what it would look like if the actions were made easy enough that a single player acting alone could have such an effectthere needs to be a balance between the difficulty in maintaining infrastructure and the difficulty in taking it downcurrently one of the largest barriers to that is fueling pos are big expensive and continue to be expensive over their entire life they are also a pain to keep working if you make them too easy to destroy holding space suddenly becomes unprofitable whenever anyone sneezes in your general direction since we want corporations to fight over space making space unprofitable is bad no one will go there and set up shopit is ironic then that you rail against people not mining because it is actually the time effort and costnote whether or not it is mined by the alliance is irrelevant the market has determined a measure of equivalence between the actions that generate the income for the fuel and the actions that generate the fuel itself of fueling that enforces that infrastructure be so hard to effect if it is not hard to effect then the benefit of owning space would drop while the cost of owning space would stay the same or increase we already have problems with 00 space not being profitable enough on an individual level we do not need to deal with the prospect of it not being profitable on a corporate levelin any fair game between three people if two of the people gang up the third person will lose it is not a fair game if the third person can win against the other two it seems that this unfair game is what you want to play this may not be true it may be that you have legitimate gripes that stem from an inability to catch ratters and cloakers but on the surface you seem to be saying i want to be able to hurt hundreds of players in an alliance disproportionately to the amount that they can hurt me and i want to be able to do it without expending the effort that they have taken in order to secure themselvesthat isnt to say that there isnt a lot to be done on the issue of making space easier to take but it is to say that your specific complaints are unwarranted and may even be impossible to implement dont believe me go find rise on the political map they were dead before we got there and it had nothing to do with the pos that were on their way but everything to do with a group of people simply making production on an individual level impossible soon enough they could not afford to fly battleships in fleet ops and by the time that gs and allies got there they were a skeleton crew in poorly fit ineffectual ships this is a whole other post dealing with hybridcooperativecompetitive games and the optimal play choices that evolve from them and is a little bit too complicated to get into right now
i appreciate the reply i really do but come on i wish to see what damage i can inflict upon a 00 alliance logistics assuming they ever hit the belts in mining ships which is not likely to happen because im solo lets face it i really dont have the means to take out jump freighters lets say i target gs me and my rifter or stabber or even rapier and an alt in a covert ops with a small armor rep drone and a remote hull repairer against 5000 combat players who control their space share intelligence channels and work in coordinated groupsand you saydude the odds couldnt be slanted any further in the alliances defense one against 5000 is unfair to the 5000 everyone glosses over the truth a 00 alliances do not care to mine its boring and opens up weaknesses if they are forced to do it instead of buying fuel from empire and jumping it back and of course morale doesnt exactly go through the roof when the call for group mining goes out b youre not worried about me and my rifter i can tell you that right now saying my oneman crusade would be a challenge for gs is just silly but it would create a new breed of player wouldnt it the deep space pirate who operates solo or in small groups and only cares about pulling down a target alliance assuming they had to pull their fuel from their own spacethis is just idle conjecture i cannot envision ccp moving ice to lowsec and 00 the outcry would be worse than the aborted carriernerf but the truth is 00 alliances are insulated from individual attack by the sovereignty mechanics and theyre quite happy that way otherwise all of eve really would drag down bobcan you imagine what would occur if the individual not to mention pilots of rival alliances was able to slip into an alliances space and begin disrupting operations to fuel towers
no 1 against 5000 is fair when theyre playing on even groundyou see eve is a hybrid game all player have roughly the same starting resources and ability to take actions but they can choose to ally themselves with othersthe system means that so long as the person you are working with has the same goals as you its impossible to create a situation where aligning is not the optimal play choice such in any system where all the players have a standardized starting point the players that align themselves with others are going to do better than the players who do notwhat this means for you is that you have deliberately chosen a path through the game that is the most difficult path that anyone could choose the odds are not stacked against you because the game is unfair but because you have chosen that they be that is your problem you could also choose to only fly merlins and wonder why you were unable to compete with the rest of eve and it would be just as fitting to tell you that only flying merlins is a bad choice and is going to be very hard in any fair system for you to get aheadi mine do not be so assured about your ability to stop people from miningyes which is why i told you it was a stupid idea to be able to challenge infrastructure directly it would end the ability of any alliance to do anything
relax this is just a theoretical discussion we might as well be arguing how many angels can dance upon the head of a pinyes you understand my position or not freighters were good you ended up with massive freighter runs to get goods tofrom empire at least someone could hit them or nip at their heels but jump freighters made logistics very easy and was not a good decision in a game where points of contention are sought neither was cynojammers but lets not go down that particular tangent and its not just that the jump freighters are bad its the jump freighters combined with the macrominers in empire which have caused again imo and imbalanceinteresting given the gsjihad history i may be reading more into that comment than i should was the jihad against empire miners an attempt to drive up fuelore prices in specific areas given the proclaimation that miners could operate freely in minmatar space which was closest to gss territory at the time id always assumed it was an experiment to control a heavily insulated market and put pressure on ones rivalsthough id only followed the massive whine threads about it on the forums and have no direct experiencequestion is it probable under the current mechanics to strangle off an alliances ability to gather fuel for their towers you mentioned rise but from my understanding that operation was directed at keeping people from ratting and had no effect upon claims of sovereignty it was to break their will but i may be misinformed
it was two things1 it was a diversion for our players2 it was a pressure to mine ice that we used more heavilythere is a lot of ice mining that goes on in various areas to supply moons regional ice meant that we had an easier timeat the time fueling and running minmatar towers our ratters produced domination pos bpcs which use minmatar fuel bob was running amarr towers due to their regional ice such any pressure to increase the costs of amarr ice and lower minmatar ice would put pressure on themwhich was a massive increase in cost for alliances when the shift went from owning space as production in isk and faction items from static complexes to production in tech 2 moons the methods of moving the massive amount of stuff back to empire had to changethat being said even then carrier jumps and cargo expanded dreadnoughts made hauling large amounts of goods to 00 relatively easy especially with tractor beam compression ratios jump freighters actually represented an increased cost in moving goods for empires since they were coupled with massive reduction in the ability to compress ores and a large increase in the types of goods that were being sent back outyes its probable its not easy but its probableremember that removing the ability of individual members to produce is the same as removing the alliances ability to produce alliances are simply a group of people working towards the same goal fuel doesnt get paid for by magic pos dont get defended solely by guns ships dont buy and make themselvesthe effect is just not seen over an quick time period
love that stuff like this is possible in eve im curious did it succeed in modifying the prices i watched the stats pile up on the killboard but couldnt shake the feeling that the operation was trying to empty the ocean with a bucket it is a heavily insulated market
not sure i didnt pay much attention to it even if it did the fact that an alliance was using regional specific towers hints that they might have their own production capacityedit it could also be that we wanted to sell hulks and the suppliers were influencing domestic policies to increase demand i know one of our guys had a symbiotic relationship selling ravens in that manner step 1 put ravens on the market step 2 wait for friend to blow said raven out of space step 3 put more ravens on the market
solo play in eve imo doesnt need more love you can do almost everything solo nowi didnt say it needed to be nerfed i just say imo this area is rather well developped and other areas of the game might need more urgent work for now at leastedit  and about my views eve is a sandbox solo is part of it and fine
ive been leaning towards goumindong ankhe and scagga but id like to ask in this eleventh hour for any last thoughts on who has the strongest platform to improve faction warfare from sovereignty meaning something modest rewards for plexing and pvping wardec mechanics and alliance involvement who has the best ideas to get some changes done right awayship balancing skill queues and changing the sov mechanics in 00 all have some importance to me but fw is what i love and i want my vote to go to the candidate who is best positioned to save it and make it better
thank you for considering me for your votei would suggest when you consider someones ideas on improving factional warfare to not treat it as an isolated case  ie just their ideas for factional warfare many of the problems inherent in factional warfare will also colaterally benefit from improvements to other areas of eve for example  small gang and fleet warfare mechanics for which i have made proposals nonlinear objectives eg introducing pirates to factional warfare and improvements to the economy and agents both fw and nonfw the other comment i would make please dont hope for changes that can be done right away
unfortunately nothing is going to get done right away and for the rest i mainly agree with scagga regarding what it takes to solve the problem which i suppose doesnt help you out all that muchwith regards to the specific problems in factional warfare i see them as1 problems relating to the spawning of complexes to be taken2 problems in the types of npcs present3 a lack of incentive to complete objectivesi have been working on some ideas that i will be posting in the assembly hall forum some time after the election with regards to mission based pvp and how we can implement it which includes simple and easy fixes to npcs in order to achieve missions that can andor must be completed in pvp fits which can be used to make fw missions betterbut in the end what its going to come down to financial rewards in the form of flat payment or loyalty points for completing fw objectives that get people interested in the system part of the problem i think stems from the fact that it is a pve originating system that ccp wanted to be based on pvp i say it originates from a pve style because with typical pvp you have an organic objective based on some incentive the aggressor wants to prevent an action from happening and the defender wants to make it happen the aggressor wants to reap rewards from the destruction and the defender wants to secure their rewardswith no real rewards worth fighting over fw doesnt become an interesting system it become and isk sink that you participate in for kicks fixing the incentives are the first thing you need to do before fixing the system now i will say that i do not have any specific experience on tq in fw my experience comes in sov based warfare this affords me the ability to distinguish what works in sov warfare and what doesnt and apply those things to fw and make sure the things that dont are not includedspecifically were looking at formalizing objectives and rewards if you make plexes into specific types then have those plexes correspond to a specific benefit then players can make informed decisions about what they want to take eg you could have the largest of plexes correspond to lowsec jump bridges where whomever controlled the largest number of plexes was afforded the right to anchor jump bridge networks within the system you could have the medium sizes plexes correspond to agents where owning the medium plexes in a system opened up factional agents of increasing quality etc etc etc now these are just ideas thrown out there but it should give you an idea of what i think needs to happen to make fw profitable to the people involved rather than just adding up points and flipping systems there needs to be a real monetary or infrastructure benefit to having your faction control the space
well it was asked today in the csm public chat what the 2 or 3 items were that were highest on my todo list and i named factional warfare the skill queue and 00 sov mechanics and ways to develop space in 00 to make it more meaningful i would personally not focus that much on ship balancing because i think that ship rebalancing should be done in a big patch that affects all the problematic ones at the same time not one tiny individual change at a time and the csm can only bring up these individual changes when it comes to black ops boosts and such i agree that there is a role for the csmi have been at the roundtables and spoke with the designers about factional warfare and did my best to relay the problems that plague factional warfare currently unsustainability people being forced to run missions for money to expend on fw lack of meaningful consequences player actions do not influence the world even after conquering systems everything is still the same save for a little nametag change lack of rewards there is nothing gained from factional warfare except onetime standing boosts through promotion thus no incentives to keep participating and nothing to work towards no diverse objectives when factional warfare was announced i expected that we could get missions such as smuggle these weapons to the rebels at this planet and there would be enemy players scanning people at the gates to prevent them smuggling stuff people dont want to sit at a complex for 1020 minutes over and over and over again missions not influencing system contestation mission runners are better off running highsec missions as mission runners are not beneficial to their faction in fw no indication of progression in the system contestation i know a flat number is not desirable but at least give an indication exactly how contested a system isid say the thing we need to get in there right now is rewards remove those standing gains from complexes and instead have a loyalty point shop like thing that is paid with victory points when missions contest systems give some victory points from missions as well victory points are awarded from kills already so just make sure that the amount of vp is based on the ship class that is destroyed so people wont blow up their alts anyway with these vp players should be able to buy items from a special shop which has some militiaexclusive things i personally think that standing and thus promotion should be bought through this as well so people can choose to be gunsforhire and take the money or join for more idealogical reasons and thus rank up for either type of player factional warfare will have something id personally take useless rank icons over items thoughnext meaningful consequence to system contestation ccp said they cant make stations deny docking but they will look into rendering station services unusable for opposing militia i dont think that goes far enough as id like to see more of an impact on the game world i suggested having cosmoslike agents in the systems and their appearance is based on the faction that controls the area of space and for how long they have been the owners thus to get the minmatar agent that rewards you for handing over liberated slaves the minmatar would have to capture and hold system x for a week but if the amarr hold it theyd get an agent that looks for some new manpower then it would matter which faction you fight for and which systems you own id even go as far as saying that after a while a special agent should appear that gives a difficult mission which can make the players earn specific medals but hey thats the achiever personality of me popping up againas for alliances participating we already brought that up in the current csm and ccps answer was yes but with a standing requirement
i have already sent in some documents while on the current csm but ccp will review them as part of the next csm because they ran out of time so i better get reelected or else some random dude will have to advocate my stuff you can download them herelack of focus and goals in factional warfareproblems with complex spawninginitial reaction relatively old document from right after fw introductionfactional warfare by eva jobseso who has the strongest platform seems like ive already got it in the pipeline oh and handson experienceplease visit your user settings to reenable imageshow is this for credentials
me chucklesi didnt know i was supposed to repost my entire manifesto on fw here to answer the ops question well i dont think the problem with fw stops at rewardsprogression unlike some people whove decided to solo their way through factional warfare ive been a commander in the amarr militia and been in touch with a large number of combatants and mission runners  im a bit more in touch with the reasons on the ground as to why many people feel they could enjoy factional warfare moreit can get damn boringi wouldnt enjoy running complexes even if they paid me better the objective isnt just to make factional warfare a little more financially rewarding that it at the moment making fw profitable to the extent that the numbers skyrocket  if you think about it  is not what people want if it becomes the next best way to make isk it will become the domain of the most powerful the objective should be to make it fun first profitability is not as important its a goddamned grind at the moment if you didnt noticei find the aforementioned notion disturbingly lacking in many of peoples ideasto save creating an eyesore ill link some of my ideas hereintegrating piracy with fwintegrating fw with roleplayingstreamlining fleet warfare ie improving fw by proxymaking rank matter in fwintegrating pvp with fw via agents remains to be written up formally but the gist of this is that agents could give people reasons to kill high ranking enemy members
i dont think soyou did a bunch of complexes solo
ankh flew with our corporation during her time in the gallente federation during that period we fitted her out with topofthe line faction gear and got her in an interceptor and taught her how to use the directional scanner how to tackle and how to avoid potentially dangerous situationsshe was a lot of fun to fly with even if she was constantly trying to get us to fly into plexes with her 
no we noticed but its not going to change without removing the primary concept that ccp had for it which was to make capturing independent of gang size there are certainly ways that you can reduce the amount of sitting around in complexes but they arent going to make a difference if no one is there to contest it instead of sitting around you will shoot some static object and leaveif you increase the density of players and add reward to attack and defend sites then that time spent sitting around is more likely to be filled with real combat which is exciting and isnt grindingyou have the same effect when you add real infrastructure results to the plexes then its not a grind since you have a concrete goal to achieve rather than some unknown number of captures that might get you the system maybein short i am trying to answer the question of how do you make it fun is it fun because there is pvp is it fun to shoot npcs if its fun because there is pvp which is what i suspect is fun then the way to make it more fun it to make more pvp happen and the way to make more pvp happen is to increase incentives for taking the actions on each side that will bring ships into proximity with competing goals
this is too simplistic ive been involved in factional warfare for months and interacted with a large number of players pvp edit read quantity and isk are not the main problems these are more commonly stated problems pvp i cant lead fleets these noobs people from other corps fleets are too difficult to formlead because at times there arent leaders this is why i proposed ways of making leading fleets easierblobbing is another problem what you said about making site capture dependent on gangsize is the opposite of what should be done that aspect at least allows gangs to spread out last week i led such a gang splitting up into twos and threes to achieve objectives in 34 different systems at once spies  there are no counters ive previously proposed ways of tracing spies via agents to find isk sources pointlessness why should we bother to take that system the minnies will just get it back its not isk that will change this nor a few fancy game mechanics the time invested needs to be rewarded with something memorable more memorable than implicit pats on the back through ingame news announcements i have proposed this to be a place where live events can interact with fw giving rewards that cant be matched by mission running or more pvpedit if there was more of a point to factional warfare people wouldnt see it as much as an isk sink but a worthwhile investment for the chance to take partthere is a lot more to be mentioned but rl demands my attention speak to you soon p
something to say about you to immediately start mud flinging at another candidate especially since it immediately gets proven that you are taking a quote out of context for your own supposed benefit if you care about factional warfare and had read the threads where i publicised my findings on the rank structures you would have found that i flew with the aduro protocol as well as some nice people of pie1
its your own words and its trueand i have personal experience of you when you were in the amarr militia you refused to join gangs and cooperate as well as leaving plexes at the first sign of an enemy even though they could have been defended
hadisprovengive it up already
this is a problem that cannot be solved via game mechanicsi didnt say it should be done i said that in order to get away from the grind as you see it that would be necessaryincentives are the point you want people to come and fight you need to give them the incentives to do so
only one of these things can be trueeither way it you who is not telling the truth
without pages of text with what i suggested on my candidate first post which is to vastly improve the gmgame organizers events faction warfare could be made so much more dynamicon the npc generated events minmatar space entering widely into amarr space could make amarr need to ally more with caldari cheaper faction ships or some npc delivery of some random gallente faction items to help the fighters defendon the attacker side minmatar empire could provide some extra logistics which could really be npc haulerslike the convoys you see on many npc stations which are worthless attackers would have to protect their logistics slowing down their attack but wiht the possible benefits of for example t2 items in their new conquered places or hand out free loot to defenders if they dont defendjust brainstorming there but actually all those ideas are spread over all forumsjust type faction warfare on eve search 
so now theres two of you that want to make personal attacks against me how gallant im sure youd make excellent csms we didnt have enough bickering during the first csm ehperhaps you could have considered that both things are the truth you were looking for things to rip out of context to use against me in political slander and read what you wanted to readyes i said i never had to fire a shot to obtain maximum rank that does not mean that i never did and that also means that people can obtain maximum rank in factional warfare solo and without competition do you really think that there is any gang around that wants to capture 523 complexes not really so that rank part is indeed mostly a solo endeavour that does not mean i havent been in gangs and captured plexes though maybe youd consider that i have two maximum ranks perhaps i used different strategies in obtaining both ranks after all capturing 111 plexes back in those days is a lot less than todays 523 is it not
i think it can be solved by game mechanics  but not easily nor instantaneously the problem partially lies in the barriers to becoming an fc  ie being a fleet commander for a normal fleet isnt easy and one must appreciate that commanding an open militia fleet is even more difficult  hell it took top class fcs to get those kind of gangs operating in a coherent manner i recall there being fewer of those kind of fcs in the amarr militia than i could count on my fingers  there are even fewer nowso the approach id take in that respect is to make fcing easier these are some of the minor changes ive proposed enable motds for standing orders which helps reduce the need to repeat orders if you are reconnecting  joining late allow fleetwingsquad commanders to have a differently coloured text create a merge fleet option to automate the unifying of different gangs supporting the automatic continuation of fire after reloading allow the fc to know the shiptypes of his gangmembers automatically from his watchlist or another ui option allowing him to assess the situation more accurately allow the fc to label aforementioned list with roles if necessaryi think that the cons outweigh the pros here honestlyyes goum incentives but as you can see i dont think that it is isk and pvp that people want most they want a reason to fight factional warfare is a longterm project the endgame of win a system or win a fight is not satisfying if peoples objective is to make money there are better ways if people want to get the best quality pvp there are better waystherefore i mentioned the integration of live events with factional warfare it needs an incentive that sets it in a different class from suboptimal missions endless f1f8 keypunching and killboard whringotherwiseits just a rehash of existing mechanics imo what im saying is even if you give people isk and more pvp it wont necessarily make fw better i know many who wouldnt see it any differently if that was the endpoint of our scope of the problem
those are good but its not going to make any more fcs that can only be achieved by a willingness to lose shipsvery possibly but the sitting around problem as expressed cant be solved in any other wayi dont think that these alone would make the experience gratifying but in the end you need to feed the system so that players continually take part its the first thing you need to fix before you can start thinking about an integrating it in with the lore
they are not personal attacks if they are true and not against you as a person we have both found fault with your credentials it is your own fault for painting a false picture of yourselfok ill assume they were both true you ran complexes in factional warfare when the gains were out of proportion and refused to cooperate with other militia members i personally witnessed you abandoned positions at the first sight of the enemy when you were in the amarr militia only interested in raising your own standings thats nothing to be proud of nor to use as proof of good experience of the problems facing fwthen you met up with a corp in the gallente militia while you were a csm member that gave you free faction fitted interceptors and combat training i dont know whether every corp gives someone who they consider in need of combat training free faction fitted interceptors to train on is that what the fw joe the plumber experienced  what do you thinkthe stories told of your time in fw are not representative of any norm thus you cant come here boasting credentials without expecting people to point this out also jumping to the conclusion that every criticism is a personal attack says something about you as nobody here has attacked you as a person
too bad both of your so called faults have been disproven with factual evidencefunny as those scribblings on the killboard clearly say 24th imperial crusade and i was flying with a bunch of other guys at the time i also flew with pie ask laerise if you had read the thread i posted theres a list of names i worked together with so we would all get standingsi think they were convinced that i could improve factional warfare as a csm and they found me a likeable personyou know what the norm is the norm is that people join fw lose a few ships and think what the hell am i doing this for and go do other thingsso instead of debating my credentials how about we stop this  right here and work together to make sure the above is no longer the norm
so to get back into the discussion that really matters id like to start with thisyou are right here but i still think that rewards should be implemented to make factional warfare sustainablesustainable does not have to mean it has to be ludicrously profitable it just needs to give a little incentive to fight for as well as a means to cover some expenses that are caused by ship lossesif fw would be too profitable it would attract the wrong kind of people imowhen i discussed fw at the fanfest they indicated that they are working on this aspect of incorporating live events into factional warfare as well as influencing the storyline so theres hoping
they havent but i can prove them later showing up on a killboard doesnt mean what i said didnt happen why should i bother bringing up logs thoughankh im happy to let us change the subject however if you really want us to stop debating your doubted credentials please dont add fuel to the debate before saying that
many thanks to everyone for giving me their trust and votesvoting almost closed and i have no idea how smashing the results will be extreme
good luck extreme
well to be point here a lot of the people who claimed it would be offensive wouldnt have found it offensive themselves i am a muslim player and i know a fair few others we all found it hilarious people seriously need to learn to lighten up it is a game not real life we play games generally to enjoy ourselves and escape real life the goons were enjoying themselves evidently good for them if people are going to whine about something that needs to be taken as a joke then they should seriously just leave the gameit isnt offensive to islam at all the whole spin on suicide bombings and terrorism is largely bull to the masses what is really terror someone who is prepared to wipe themselves out in the name of something they believe in or a nation that declares war on a much more inferior one and crushes it which is really the terroristlets avoid the last bit and not get involved in a political debate i enjoy a lot of politics irl and i dont want to completely bring it over here aswell tldr  im a muslim i know a few others we found it funny people need to lighten upas for the topic at hand the newsworthy events that goonswarm does gives them credit as pointed out prior in the thread it makes eve exciting a lot more interesting than a lot of other mmos it generated a lot of buzz ingame so what some people lost some ships that goes handinhand with the entire risk concept of eve just because some more goons may get into the council that doesnt really transfer anything into their favour i remember someone pointing it out before may have been lvv that csm really doesnt hold that much power when you get right into it so they wouldnt really turn eve into a sour apple anytime soon by getting hold of csmplus any alliance in theory can blob out csm with their members the goons may not be the only ones edit besides you shouldnt really just be against a csm member just because heshe is a member of goonswarm alliance that just proves you cant even make your own opinion of someone
if i couldid add a real mass and make objects real i want to crash in a station and to dogfight in asteroids p with asteroidsother ships shielding the opponent ammo and i dont want a pod to bump a titan soops thats a lot of if
that was one of my first thoughts as well but then i realized wed just have something jitalike pop up somewhere else issler
so where is it

yeah you probably dont want to vote for me i like the other stuff more not that i have anything against the pvp or that it would stop me doing my job if elected its simply not where my interests lie
noto easily exploitable to hide scammers thieves and other nefarious sortswhy make their task of hiding even easier
this pretty much covers everything as to why this idea should never go through there is no good reason to rename a character at allcaptain thunk
not that i agree with the op wholeheartadly however heshe does raise a vailid proposal people should have the right to change their name but should have like a corp history have a history of previous namesalso the name change should have a damn good reason ie if a char is purchased through legal methods the purchaser should be able to apply for a name change but with the previous name in its historyjust my 2 cents  although in the ops opinion this is put up for a vote i think it would have a better home in the ideas and suggestions forum
it sucks what can i say
this is very much supported minnies need some luvin
agree didnt they boost caldari ships cpu or powergrid a year or so ago even tho minnie capitals were in fact more lacking i seem to remember something along those lines could be wrong though
what is the point of the naglfail other than to be outmatched by the other dreadnoughts in almost every situationit needs a clear strength
bring back ghost training
ghost training is just daft buh bye all that have to find another way to make isk without any risk vs reward
i dont like mmorpgs much ghost training feature which is now called a bug was a reason why i started playing eve if ccp has money troubles theyd better fire financial advisers who come up with such great ideas and pr managers clever enough to turn features into bugs so im voting for returning ghost training
its not about money its about ccps lies and features turning into bugs
add me on as someone who would like the queue any of the ideas presented would work for me what ever is easiest for ccp to implement
whaaa whaaaaa whaaaaaa my speed is no longer my iwin button whaaa whaaa whaa its balanced quit whining
thanks for the free bump idiot think about it this way since everyone is voting for reversing the nano missile and many other changes in quantum rise you have to expect that a lot of these same people are thinking about quitting eve all together so you will have more of everything to your own less people  less lag i say quit whining about peoples opinions and just play this less fun version of eve to your hearts content the devs made it clear they dont care about what we think at all or they would have never made all these changes
against the nerf
back to red moon rising
this is totally the answer strobe lights and trivia ftw

being able to jump one day and jump back on login the next would be very very hot the 24 hour delay as it stands tends to mean that i have to wait through a fair bit of my available game time just to be able to jump back
a very good point indeed however the assumption is being made here that the skill requirements for tech iii is going to follow the logical path of tech i  tech ii  tech iii and frankly there isnt any reason really that i can see that the skill requirements have to follow this pathlets work on the assumption that these ships are cruiser sized though my prediction is that the size of ship will depend on the components you use to build it with just racial cruiser level i and the most beginning of tech iii skills you would have available the most basic of tech iii components to build your ship by training cruiser up a few more levels and the tech iii skills you open up more advanced components and maxing out both areas of skills allows to use the best components available by doing the skill training in this way it would open up this to the availability of even the newer players while at the same time giving players a branch of skill training which they may feel a good goal to aim for meaning that people that spend the time and isk training up get better components to build there shipsusing this branched version of skill requirements would also be very easy to explain away from a roleplaying point of view if you care about such things  with the simple statementtech 3 is completely different technology to tech 2 and therefore does not require knowledge of tech 2 to use
where is this mentioned i want to look at the data on it 1 support
so long as minmatar gets some serious loving o 
i really hope ccp is able to release this option in the near future i have always wanted to play an online game that let me piece together my own ship from different partsi would also like to see pirate parts i would really like to put some sansha parts in with my shipsspikes are imposing looking forward to this release ccp 
i too would like to see the bombs become fire and forget but i dont think they should automatically hit their target if you cloak plus i dont think it will work within the game mechanics it would make the bomber way to powerful if anything a bomb should simple run out its remaining flight time and then explode from the moment the launching bomber either is destroyed cloaks warps or docksit would be nice touch if you could set the fuse on your bomb so you could control its flight timezero would become the new suicide gankif they want to make it more challenging because eventually good pilots will learn how to fire them this way they could add some wobble into the flight path as missiles do now when lock is brokenalso they really need to revamp the explosion graphics and what the bomb looks like it should be pretty obvious someone just let loose something destructive verses the little fire cracker pop we have nowto keep from getting instapopped make sure your target is one that is preoccupied an alert gate camp makes for a poor target you will diegood targetsa friendly carrier besieged by drones and fightersa tight blob of enemies remote repping one another during a posfleet fightinterrupting two other groups fighting with a well placed bomb in the middle is good funwith the current mechanics the trick is you need to be shooting at someone who is already invested at shooting at someone else if you want to live to launch your second bombrange is not much of an issue with bombs if you train up your skills train up missile bombardment for a 50 range bonus and missile projection for 50 velocity increase with mb 5 and mp 3 i can launch around 35kms from the targetthe cost of the indivdual bombs will eventually drop once the market starts adapting to the 50 reduction in manufacturing costs that occurred with the last patch
giving it a thumbs up even though sbs need to be able to be used in more than 00 so shouldnt just have great bombs
im quite pleased people like this proposal thing is im not sure about the exact scale of this it would be a good time to update the whole of the eve site too but im not a web designer
dear csmfor australianz players every days regular dt comes right in the middle of peak playing time  9pm aest brisbanesydneycanberramelbourne or 10 pm aedst as such anzac players feel a little discriminated against and gameplay style gets crampedyes being a oneserver global game dt runs a chance of being inconvenient for someone and i fully understand that in terms of volume anzacs dont compare to europe and northern america i ask only that the issue be discussed to see if there is a time slot that would not create issues for europena and remove the issue for anzacsassuming that noone would stand for dt in their local 800 pm to midnight slot and that ccp need staff on deck during gmt daylight for dt maintenance then a quick and rough calculation says to me that some time around 15001700 gmt could achieve this thats around 200 to 400 australian 9001100 us east coast 600800 us west coasti dont know what the player presence online is from europe at that time however  could be that is a moderately heavy period there and thus not an optionto progress this it would be good to initially ask ccp to provide figures on the number of players online from each geographical area over a typical 24hr period if thats possible analysis of that may show that the win criteria i outlined above isnt achieveable or it may show there are options that havent been consideredrespectfully submitted for your consideration
god not this gain
dt is fine as it is
i support this idea and hope to see it implemented soon
you will not be able to create money so if you hide money earlier you are not getting more money you are losing them and getting them back i rather have more control of corporation walletalso private offices would be cool in ambulancion
love this idea im 200 for the idea
yes i fully support this
this sounds like it would reduced lag and streamline pvp much more as well as make pvp more fluent as realism in the game dictates it should
i really hope eve becomes 18 ratedccp include gambling
meh thats what i have to say because this thread has no point in existing to many arguments and people trying to make there own facts since were on the whole 18 theme we might also want to start bringing up trading on the market because its a great way to make or loose a lot of isk just like gambling also like gambling if your doing your own trading through sites like etrade you have to be 18 oes noes how could they overlook this
no gray area at all you paid rl money for in game time that you can buy isk with which is just more ingame stuff at no point can you turn it back into rl money without breaking ula which frees ccp from any legal action that could be taken against people trying to do it such as an isk farmer o
isnt the incentive to bug reporting that its much more likely to be fixed if you do so than if you just complain about it on the forumi agree the process is a bit convoluted i currently have a crash issue that can happen either 2 minutes into the game or not at all over a 4 hour session which makes it horrific to try and logi think a better suggestion would be to streamline the bug reporting process somehow maybe a small memory dump directly from the client upon crash especially helpful for those reallyhardtoreplicate bugs though not sure how this would help noncrashing bugsanyway im not supporting this idea because i believe the fixing of the ohsoannoying bug is the reward for reporting it properly
are you playing eve or some bizarre utopian version of eve where everyone does everything for the greater good
small recognition to the people who spend their free time bettering the game for everyoneprobably the best idea ive seen in a good while
support from me  used to bother doing bug reports in the old days but never knew if they even got looked at so i stopped bothering
youll find that while im terse and a bit temperamental i do keep an open mindthis is a place of idea hashing i hold nothing personal against people who come up with bad ideasbecause that same person can come up with something we or i didnt come up with o 
well as it was said during fanfest some of the best ideas started as really bad ones  i make it a point to keep an open mind so many things that we enjoy today would not be here unless someone opened their minds to the possibility 
supported
yes
noif someones paid for a war and didnt turn up theyve already wasted their moneythe proposition is ridiculous and has little basis  people should not be fined when theyre already wasted their money if people want to waste their own money thats their right but to add fines ontop of the privilege no thats just sillyif ivy league are just interested in having a war dec removed you could try 20 alt corps decing a 21st and absorbing it into the alliance i hear that workscaptain thunk
brilliant youre a genius corp a wardecs corp bcorp b slips into their alt corpcorp a station camps the remote traders logging on from corp bcorp a gets to pay more because corp b remained docked or logged into alts all dayjust brilliant nice to know youre putting that uni education to such good use
lame
the fee for paying a wardec is too cheap even then its chump change to most corps
they are busy with learning how to do essential stuff like activating weapons against npcs all day long that are the challanges eve uni members really face

supportedi need to organize my evemails 
personally i think they should add cpu implants to some pod pilots so they have more processing power so they dont make silly statements you just madewith caldari pod pilot like you no wonder they nerfed caldari ships so hard
have to admit this is a surprise rokh is one of ships with least pg issues also due to the utility low slot 3 damage mods dc free slot
inb4 boost armageddon grid by 7500
train up engineering thats how i managed to get things to fit o 
no doesnt need fixednow you want to talk about the raven needing cpu then we can talk
it is insane if ccp actually thinks that they do not have a large under21 player base i agree with a 18 year old limit just because that is when most countries legitimize adulthood but what really matter when it comes to trying to better the game is ideas one puts forth and their maturity and seriousness when handling issues in the csm
18 would have been a far better number then 21
omg dont ban me because of communism

monday we find out how everyone voted that is one point of data that will shape the csm going forward i think a more important question the csm should ask is whyit would be extremely useful for the new csm to understand how they came to beso id ask everyone that voted or didnt vote to post briefly why they voted or chose not to the way they didso what the heck were you thinking in a couple of sentencesissler
ankhesentapemkahs stance on getting skill queuing into the spot light and given serious consideration by ccp
you know that just about every candidate running was proqueue rightoh and i voted for this crazyawesome guy with a name eerily like my own all the cool kids were doing it
voted ank because she is clearly the best of the returning csm candidates for continuity purposes she served admirably as secretary in the first session and would make a good chair for the 2nd in my opinion enthusiastic dedicated and willing to learn all in all a very good candidate voted pattern because of all the candidates he seems to have the greatest understanding of what needs to be done to preserve small unit pvp in eve online at the moment hes a pvper in a small roving alliance not a blobfighter and his posts on shc have a decent level of vision and insight voted omber zombie because hes a guy of great character and long experience in eve online and is the single process reformer candidate that i would trust to do the job he also steped up as a replacement alternate in the first session and performed very well with good attendance and insightful decisions even though he often disagreed with me id love these 3 candidates to make it onto the council
voted for lavista vista because everytime ive read his posts they have made sense at least the vast majority of the time sadly the same couldnt be said for some of the other csms but then thats why i didnt vote for them
i would have voted for ankh and vuk lau split if i had not been running ankh because she is really dedicated to this game and the csm and while in some areas completely noob at least convincable and vuk because he is the only one among the candidates i have ever been flying with and also because despite being a titan pilot he wanna see titans nerfed thats exactly the kind of mentality we need in the council people with perspective who do not only care about their own virtual life i hope both of them make it into the next council
i voted for me but i probably would have voted for tusko or herschel if i wasnt running tusko because after a fair few discussions with him he seems to have the games welfare at heart and we both like his homelands cooking and herschel because he seems as insane as me 
same i voted for lvv too same reasons as the first election
i voted for myself because i want to represent all these lovely people who voted for me
i voted garion avarr because i want someone on the csm who cares about the rpg in mmorpg and he was most visible in supporting the roleplaying side
i didnt vote because when i voted the first time csm was made it pretty much did fek all so i thought y waist my time again 
huzzah to all the candidatesragu
i voted vuk simply cause hes a awsome guy and when a titan pilot wants titan nerfed it showes that he actually care more about the gameplay for others then for himself
i figured that if i was asking all my friends to vote for me i should set the example by voting for myself tooif i wasnt running    well id have had some hard choices to make though theres one candidate that would have gotten at least one of my votes no question my only decision would have been if id give all my votes to him or spread them probably at least partially spread them there are a number of candidates i like im not going to name names though as i dont want to prejudice my relationship with anyone i might be working with on the csm
thanks to all that supported me
thats a joke right
no just an interesting definition of top  shes got top rank in two militias but she does it without fighting unoccupied complexes get you rank quickly it seems
i got exactly 68000 victory pointsaccording to fwstats that puts me on 5th placekills are meaninglessstill took me 3 months to get the gallente one after they nerfed the standing gains so quickly it was not
in a pvp game alright
bbbuuuuumpwith the new changes afs are more of a threat but i still dont think they are where they should be
1 dont necro 2 you posted this in the wrong forum try ships and mods features and ideas eve general or the assembly hall
jetcan mining should continue to be allowed  wheres the fun without the riskpersonally i dont jetcan it would be interesting on putting a bit more risk the canflippers way though its a little too easy to pick on a new player whos trying to earn his way rather than begging sure join a corp and get corp protection is one way but in your first weeks youre probably learning to play and not looking at joining a corp another way is to allow players in a fleet to look out for each other add a jettison for fleet option where aggro is against every member of your fleet when you flipbenefitsadds the risk vs payoff for flipperspromotes player interactiongood introduction to pvp for new players aside from fwmore fun some group action is always better than solo you guys chip in with the drawbacks that i cant think of
thank you gentlemen whatever the result of this election i will work on getting the best of the ideas formally written up and put through the assembly hall
now that the polls are closed id like to sincerely thank everyone who voted for me its been a fun campaign and im looking forward to the release of results on monday
now that the voting is officially over i would like to say thanks to all those who gave me their support all left to do right now is to keep fingers crossed and wait for the results
congrats
login screen motd says that voting closes midnight gmt but i dont see the candidate list any more voting page  is voting already closed since yesterdays midnight
yes it closed at 2359 on november 21st
is it just me or is this csm thing a load of bulls h i t after reading 34 threads about people who want to become a csm seem a little to sad imho i mean running for something like that in a game anyway in this laughable thing from ccp i choose not to vote with any of my accounts also since this is the 2nd time around people are being voted in i havent seen any huge ing changeall from my point of view
i found that to be a fascinating question so i hired a large staff of research assistants and yes strangely it is just youi would not have suspected that my guess was at least one other pilot in eve thought the same thing but statistics never lieyou are the only one that thinks thatissler
that is a very good and amusing answer
but i like to be different from everyone else
my research says you have suceededissler
its not just you if theres one thing i hate in this game its celebrities getting a free ride on their reputation if these gots want to go to fanfest so badly let them pay for the trip themselves joining csm simply to get to fanfest is a disgrace its one of the main reason csm is a failure in my eyes perhaps if this free ticket to fanfest was removed by ccp we would have candidates joining csm simply to help improve the game no
if these gots want to go to fanfest so badlyim not a piece of wood
kinda concerned when given the chance to vote for changes the same ol people retain power unless they  up in a huge way even if they completely underperform you can just use the same ol gimmick that got you elected the previous term and multiply it by your tenure for what i like to call an electorate oligarchyhappens irl all the damn time im american and thank god our presidents have to retire after 2 terms not all elected offices have such guidelines though there are certainly no such restrictions for the csmfood for thought
there is a 2 term limit on csm members
its me im the misinformed conspiracy theorist in the opwe finally found me
i had hoped to use the csm to eventually become the supreme ultimate maximum shiny of all eve and be able to set a 75 tax on all pod pilots we will have to wait till monday to see if the first phase of my plan for total dominaton has suceeded actually no there are a bunch of factors that lead me to believe no one would end up involved in the csm for more than a year or twoissler
i seriously hope anyone planning to vote for either of you read this thread before doing so
not that it could possibly affect the vote now that it is closed but i was interested in fw when it came out quickly i lost interest so at the moment i think of fw as a failed experiment i think of it as way to advance story line or rp experiences in eve but in the end i think it fell shorti love what it tried to do but i am not happy with what we ended up withissler
out of curiousity how different do you feel your experience would have been with more isk and pvp incentives vs other ideas like live event interaction
it needed more something i think if there was a more rp in game storyline effect i might have been more interestedissler
good to hear
viva el presidente
great candidate got both of my votesgoumin what do you think about personal feat content aka bragging rightsthere are a lot of playstyles in eve and it is only natural that people want to share their accomplishments with others in fantasy mmos they have gear trophies titles etc that show off something of a playerin eve the most you usually see of another player are their corp alliance sec rating bio and bounty that tells players so very little about what yourself in wow if you saw a player with the arathi basin tabard on you knew they were experienced in daoc if you saw someone with the lordladyfruemerald ridier title you knew you were in for a fightin eve you fly by and see a bunch of squares on screen a bunch of ships that all look the same and a jumbled list of names in your overviewimo eve needs an overhaul in player accomplishment recognition
medals have just been added so that corporations can decorate their players and certificates can be made public to show competency in general areaswhile it would be nice to have a system that had such achievements the first step in doing so is figuring out what we want to make an achievement it seems to me that if medals could be awarded by third party entities that might allow players to fill in the blanksall in all i am not sure how something like that would be implemented but it would be a handy feature
if this were even possible yeah i think eve would be fixed at that point and wouldnt need a csm
what is the difference between buying a new character and changing your characters namemaybe include name changes in corp historyand i support this
while i have an awesome name it doesnt really fit when i want to rpand yea there should just be a history like corp history
added idea to the features and ideas forum for suggestions to the proposal
its obvious that ccp wants us to adapt and have to fit target painters to do full dmg for caldari they made a reason to require it not just make it easieron that note training amarr bs lvl 5 since everything else is basically nerfsd to hell seeing as i have already laid out the problem with caldari and the midpoints for pvp
this is your nano nerf you guys brought it on your self
how is that obviously you think that its only missile users that were only complaining about nanoing not the capitals not amarr ships not gallente ships yes thats right it must have been those rotten caldari pvp missiles ships that apparently are so ive been told only good for pve and of course we should have all apparently gone and trained so that we could nano our ships because yes you guessed it we should all be flying only ships that can be effectively nanoed and everyone who doesnt do it must be a loser cause they dont want toin actual fact you got nano nerfed cause it is actually a fact that you guys bought it upon yourselves 1 or 2 nano ships wasnt the problem its just the fact that it was becoming the only viable ship to fly and i am quite sure that ccp on its own are quite able to realise that they dont want eve to go in that directionnot everyone who uses missiles is ing about the fact that we have trouble hitting frigates with torpedos
i just post my message to say that i do not like this nerf and that im considering to stop playing eve when my gametime expires
exactly there are different groups of missile users that want missiles retweaked some want the whole patch put back others just want some numbers redone1 tears that my bs guns dont hit frigsinterceptors2 group that says as yes 1 more pvp midslot mod needed on missile ships now where to put it3 bs vs bs warfare just gimped missiles even more so even w the web nerf missile boats fail next to gunnery boats fit for pvp most of the timei have no problem w speed and sig radius coming into effect for missile damage it should of been that way in the first place its so many other issues surrounding it and some of the base values they choose for missile explosion radius and velocity where is the missile users lowslot version of a tracking enhancermy adapt and overcome for this is fine it just killed one of the ways i loved to fly  solo in a bs w missiles and actually have a good chance of surviving now its back to flying my wetpaper dps vulture and nighthawks or fly blastergun ships and im leaning more towards guns neways whats sad is the amount of idiot carebear n00bs that fill these threads or make new threads full of whine that their missiles do crap dmg against mission frigs and somehow think the pvp missile community agrees with them
a last bump before my account expires even if it seems to be schizophrenic taking the fact that i dont know if i will return to evegl and fun too u all  and gl to ccp perhaps you reconsider your crm strategy p
you probably got a ore standing that is higher than 2 then you can run missios for ore this results in higher syndicate standing then you can run missions for them next you can run missions for serpentis and i think angels like serpentissyndicate but not sure about that onebut yeah there should be a bit more straightforward method but it shouldnt be easy
sorry figured you were just another alt troll pretty much all of your suggestions are a complete nerf to the naglfarlosing a high slot means you lose more dps on its already subpar dps gaining a lowslot is completely worthless because youre starved for cpu as is and cant do anything with iti honestly dont know why this hasnt been brought up sooner people use to love nags i would imagine it was because they saw 4 high slots and figured they did 25 more damage than other dreads maybe the incredibly strong tempest had something to do with it too most of these were armor tanked too so they did even less damage than the other races counterpartsthe whole they have good small ships so the big ships should suck thing is really old take amarr for example they have decent inties probably the best hacs right now maybe the vaga is still king with the sac  zealot coming in 2nd and third they have good cruisers good bcs good command ships the recons are still pretty meh but better thanks to the nano nerf they have amazing battleships the best supercaps both titans and motherships the best dread and all the carriers are pretty much the same in every place apart from carriers and dictors which all 4 races pretty much perform the same role they are in the top or at very least can compete recons minmatar battleships and dread  supercaps are really sub par in every way right now and id still probably fly a falcon over any other recon and a zealot over any hac maybe thats just me though
im tired of making petitions of macrominers and im still looking at them in local how they strip the belts and they are never in front of the pchow the ppl needs to ask in the petitions to make the damm gms ban this damm ers u make a petition and in less than 5 seconds they send u a response that are all the same i send more than 6 petitions of 6 diferent macrominers and the answers are all the same they do copy paste or whatlet me explain how u know when someone is a macrominer so u guys can see how u need to ban1st casethey go to a random or not belt they set the drones out and 20 secs later they start to mine if u see this guy 3 mins later strip miner cicle and 1 of the lasers goes oflline takes another 3 min to start it again macrominer number 12nd case they are 23h all the days 365 days of the year on in the same system they got convos off they dont talk in local and they are allways minning ice or common ore come on u cant tell me thats not a macro 3rd casethey mine ice in macks do a cicle and dock come on even if u are a noob and u doing that kind of minning u do better whi hulk because has more cargo and ofcourse they are allways in the same spot 23h4th casethey orbit the asteroid thats the most common macro and the cheaper and some ppl thinks we are stupid or the gm too i hope they are wrong because if it is we are in a big problemin all 4 cases there is allways some common thigns1  they got auto reject convos2  they set a shield booster on or set drones out they even are stupid enough to leave drones when u can tank the rats3  they dont reply in local4  they go to the same spot all the time even when there are not asteroids thats pretty funny when u see it or they go to a dif asteroid every ing time they undock5  they allways stay a certain ammount of time lets say 20 min and is all the time like thatand to let u guys now too i will explain what is a macro in eve casethe guys that use macro for minning is simple there are 2 kinds1UFFFD  is a mouse recorder that records the movements of the mouse and clicks and the player that is gona macromine do a single minning to record the moves of the mouse and after he finish he replay it over and over again how to see that is this kind they do allways the same whit a exact ammount of time in the same place2UFFFD  ui macros this ones are more easier to see what kind of macros they are ppl create this amcros like programs specially for eve minning farming etc how to detect it easy the playe is allways on it automaticly log in after downtime or after a reboot they warp to dif belts or not they are allways an exact ammount of time in a belt but some ppl think we are noobs and they configure it that the ship stay the first time 20 min for example and the second 25min and then repeat the cicleso pls im ing tired that this ers ruin the market when i do it like a true miner does sit in front of the computer and mine while u chat etcfast way to see if it is macro miner convo him if it replay is not a macro or maiby it is but his at the pc if u get refused locate the miner and look at him 3 times and if u can check times if u see is a macro miner is easy ban him for god sake is not so hard right click and set ban end of bussniss one fuker lessim tired of this so do something damm so many new thigns on the game mechanics thx for the orca but this problem comes from long ago and still not being solvedsry if i got bad writing im from argentina and i do my best to write a good englishpichonsitaedit there was a thread aobut macro but had 90 days old so making this one plus it was very incomplete
something definatley must be done against mmit seems there are getting more and more over the last few monthsfact is if the gameowner ccp doesnt do anything against it  people start to resign at some point and use macros themselvesccp do something 
the problem is acceptancethey are accepted not just by ccp by large sections of the playerbase when it suits themthe biggest alliances are happy to harbour corps alebit often through a pet alliance for plausible deniability that are clearly macro mining its a symbiotic relationship where the protector gets a slice of the profits and the macro miners get an aura of legitimacy as well as access to higher end mining materialsuntil this is broken not much headway against macro miners is possible and to do so means going up against the biggest alliances in the game consequently while i would like to see them removed i dont see it happening myself token bannings of empire macro miners maybe but the underlying problem is unlikely to be tackled directly because its a big can of worms that most dont really want to know aboutcaptain thunk
yup they should be banned drawnquarteredthen shotme signed
i am with you guys on this one i might start suicide ganking macros for the fun of it some other things i have noticed alot of macros mine in covetors and work in teams of 43 miners and 1 hauler i also noticed macros usually have some name that doesnt make any sense
yes
what how do you know they arent in front of their pc is there some sort of built in webcam or somethingya petitions are usually copy pastedi dont see how you can have any idea if a person if macro mining or not
my website includes one way i have formulated to stop macrominers im strongly against their activity and have noticed the copypaste responses for petitioning them ive petitioned over 100 and any guess how many of them are still in the game

it was mentioned in one of the fanfest 2008 videos
world domination video and it release date is suppossed to be in the next expansion which is march april
didnt they said that t3 will have curent t2 reqs and curent t2 will get reqs lowered
yea i love this idea ccp have got for t3 ships but would be nice to no what class they are and if they have figured skills out or not give us an estimate on time line to get them 
i live in new zealand and i have no problem with dt happening at 11pm or midnight daylight savings if im still up then its a good time to go to bedmoving the dt will make some players leave because it sits right in the middle of their playing time these players will leave quickly any extra players gained from this will trickle in you dont count because your playing eve despite the dt being a problem for you
lavista hesod thanks  one of my intentions in posting this was to gauge to what degree its an issue youre fine with it where it is no problem if im in a minority on this ill retire it gracefullymalcanis god not this gain sic tells me nothing whats the actual argument what geographical location are you in if youre not an anzac i wouldnt expect you to immediately care because we havent even established whether enough anzacs have enough of a problem to warrant it going any further but neither would i expect you to pour cold water on it because im alright jack so  you unless you have a point to make or an actual view to express youre just trolling if this discussion has taken place in the past please paste the linki would like to hear from anzacs and asiapacific zone people what they think one way or another  is this an issue for you if so how badly i hate it so bad im leaving i dont like it but i can live with it or meh im okay whats your delusion you braindamaged idiot actually no insults would be preferable but this is the eve forums and weve already established we cant have three replies without someone getting condescending hesod my original post says clearly that im trying to find out if there is a slot for dt where it doesnt unduly interfere with anyones playing time if theres no such thing fine its a dead issue but i would like to see evidence of that if theres a slot where really only 16 people from outer lithuania are playing then as far as im concerned they lose because howevermany people from the rest of the world could be playing instead and as ive said if its just me that has a problem then fine ill shut up
always wanted a rainy day fund division i support this 
totally awesome idea not as good as a skill queue but hey

i thought you had to be over 18eula to play it in the first place like all other mmos

ive been a bughunter in many other games and id like to continue that here but the lack of support or even acknowledgment that our petition didnt hit a brick wall is disturbing i would love to see some feature included in the game which recognizes the people who go out of their way to find these details outwhat more can i say supported

as we all know the target painter is the worstless used ewar module in game with the recent nerf to missiles and webs many ships were penalised mostly the caldari but also the minmatar ship line due to the fact that their reckons for example have a bonus to web now that web is nerfed they have target painter bonus but wait that sucks too anyway my point is that as it is the target painter importance is little it would be good to encourage people in its use by increasing its effectivness so my idea on how to do this is the followingthe tps could be improved without touching the module base efficiencies per se but just by give the player double the effect of what the current tp related skill signature focusing is giving now so whereareas signature focusing gives today a 5 bonus to module strength make it 10 so it would change like thissignature focusingadvanced understanding of target painting technology 10 bonus to target painter modules signature radius multiplier per skill levelwith this implemented the overall tp stregth would rise from todays 36 30 base for techii tp  max skills with max skills to the still modest but more significant 45 30 base for techii tp  max skillsthis way the game will have more variety in the fittings and useless ships like belicose will gain some trustso what do you think
nothe target painter already grants a major bonus to not just the user but to the gang at least thats what ive noticedand speak for yourself minmatar pilot here quite happy with the setupthey just need a bit more in other areas
ya theres a bunch of alt corps around right now so mercs can wardec people for 2mil each war they just have to corpjump around to get to the war they want to play in2mil to wardec a corp is such a waste of time oftentimes you can park a cloaked ship in their home system and jam up the game for many people thats no fun at all
you only need to do it once and its not like you have to sit at the pos while doing itobvious easy fix is simplyanchoring 1 manages 1 action at a timeanchoring 2 manages 2 actions at a timethat way anchoring 5 could be onlining 5 guns at a time for example
seems poses count towards sov having them anchoronline quicker is only going to promote pos spamming and make sov warfare even worse than it already is i do however think its unreasonable to expect players to sit at towers for hours at a time onlining structures with this in mind i think a much better option would be the ability to place all the structures and then queue the anchoringonlining process then simply run and go do something more enjoyable and all your structures would onlineanchor one by one while your away
not being able to tell what is camped 100 yards off the station undock without fannying about getting confirmation from other players in system is neither fun nor interesting isnt it about time the station managers fitted some frigging windowsin leiu of that overview working in station would be fine

hello all i have been watching the fanfest 2008 videos since i was not fortunate enough to make it this year and i am really excited about the walking in stations and everything that goes with it i was however surprised about the hanger area being pushed down the list since ccp thinks it will not be used enough to warrant more attention i would like to ask csm members the player base and ccp about moving the captains quarters from the station to being on whatever ship they are currently flying players would only be able to go to their quarters on board while docked since you have to be in your pod while flying the ship but once docked you can exit your pod to your quarters put on a fresh set of cloths and take an elevator to the airlock on your ship go through the airlock and into the hanger once in the hanger you will be able to take a moving walkway to the station elevator to go whever it is you were going but while you are traveling all pilots will be able to look at their magnificent starship in all its glory  now different class ships could also be fitted with different size quarters on frigates the quarters could be sort of small where as quarters on say a carrier could be quite lavish but this is an extra that isnt really required i know some of you are thinking this guy is freaking crazy thats alot of graphics work if you have different quarters for each ship to help the guys developing this here is an example the devs build an enviroment for the caldari frigate quarters instead of changing it for each caldari frigate just make all the caldari frigates use the same enviroment which could also be used in the t2 ships of that class just an idea i wanted to present to everyone i figure since they are doing all this work to get walking in stations to be as magnificent as it looks might as well go all the way  fly safe all and i look forward to your comments and suggestionsinf
good idea except for the fact youd have more than one ship it would be too easy to set up your quarters on the station or something to that effect
from what i have heard it was originally intended that it was to be aboard your ship but for some reason they had to change it
i dont see the difference between different ships and different stations the only thing i could see is with the stations you would only have to make quarters for each race of station but if you change the quarters per type of station there are still a ton of quarters enviroments to put together considering all the different factionsit was just a thought that would still let us get a hanger enviroment to admire our ships what do you guys think of ccp adding a window to the stations captain quarters to let us look out and see our shipi guess i just want to see ships in all of their glory p let me know what you guys think
i would be satisfied with a ship viewer for example you could have a ship database module that you could place in a bar or storefront that would let you view different ships as if they were in your hanger as an empirehugging carebear i wouldnt mind seeing what all the cap ships look like without getting blown up for my curiosity
pg is okish if you must boost something boost rokhs cap that sucks badly even with perfect cap skills and hardwiring
ill be recording the names of everyone that thinks there should be an age limit
i voted for sophie daigneau because i figure having an economyfocused rep from 00 could add value and perspective that empirebased carebear productionminingetc reps may not have
aww thank you and yet not only did you think it worth your time to read this board you thought it worth your time to post on it you realize that for the same time investment as keeping up to date on this forum you could have researched the candidates and voted accordingly right
1 eve is a sandbox game2 the game mechanics of factional warfare do not offer any rewards for kills thus there is no point3 i plan to fix point 2
i havent flown all the afs but for the ones i have flown heres my opinion on themjaguar its built to be a highas shield tanker so it performs admirably in that role with the potential 50 damagewolf one more turret slot but only 25 damage which equals out its the armor tanker of the mini afsishkur agreed theyve underperformed ever since the bandwidth nerf and they could stand to lose a turret or two
i know the voting is over but i would like to say that missions was the crux of my platform when running for csm well have to see how the voting turns out soon though
i love it when people say that the best way to improve missions is to make them better it really puts me at easeas your question included the word various aspects ill widen my license on aspects to cover  some proposals im writing up regarding missions includeincrease the gradientlow sec l4 agents require a higher margin of increased profitability compared to high sec l4 agents to be worth doing in a hostile environmenti say this from personal experience i dont like the idea of directly reducing rewards of missions in high sec arbitrarily until ive seen more information on the potential incomenew agent functions information disclosureadd interesting functions to level 5 agents enhanced information disclosure examples of this include ways to trace alts such as being able to reveal a pilots wallet transactions in case one suspects a generous donor main for instance this makes sense in the context of eve where you rarely have reason to trust the legitimacy of certain pilots and want at least the assurance that the pilot is earning his own iskother advanced information disclosure items may include revealing the contents of someone elses hangar if it is in a station of the same faction this may allow a war target to know what his enemy might bring to the field in my opinion this is a logical progression from the underdeveloped agent perks of the current locator agentspirate agents in low sec spacepirate agents for their respective factions could be introduced in low sec space in ships hidden at planets for pilots to discover also their location could change every few weeks to add a bit of realism and work against promoting agent hoardingpvp missions for factional warfare assassination missions and variable ranksive always felt that factional warfare should be more than just a rehash of existing mechanics one idea ive been working on is assassination missions whereby an agent asks a pilot to kill an enemy militia pilot of a certain rank im not sure a podding is necessary that is being decided upon rank as it stands is only a slowly rising matter one cannot be demoted in factional warfare this means to a great extent that your fw rank does not correlate with your actual ability as a pilot which means that people can sneak into unoccupied complexes for extended periods get a high rank and claim that they are amazing pilots being successfully taken down in an assassination mission should lead to a loss in rank i also think that killing high ranking enemy pilots should improve your rank  and that it should possible to show rank in the overview can you imagine how fleet warfare would be in that case imagine people shooting the officers first it adds a touch of realism imocontinued
mission lootas for the actual loot that missions drop i am aware that people have pointed out that substantial module drops lead to a glut of the modules themselves and the minerals they refine to before saying whether this is a problem or not or whether intervention is necessary id be curious to know exactly how much in the way of modulesminerals are being produced and what fraction of the market this makes up from my experience it is not the norm for every single mission runner to always loot every single wreck in their mission to conclude this point id like to request figures and compare this to market volume as i have never read a proposal that has included this if mission loot meltdown only accounts for eg 15 of the mineral market why should intervention be considered necessaryalso we have to take into account that there is a niche market based around buying up minerals and loot from mission runners it is important to realise this things before deciding to accidentally destroy gamestyles we are not familiar with
finally got some of the agents and missions ideas jotted see here
there are many historical analogues for thisthe blockade runners of the american civil war gun runners to many countries commerce raiders of all sorts including most of the dreaded real world pirates of the carribean uboats in the two world warslogistics chains in any real world sense are generally extremely fragile and quite susceptible to individual or small unit attacks witness the somali pirates were hearing so much about today witness the pinprick insurgent attacks with ieds etc on modern militaries in the middle east and afghanistan the viet cong the french resistancesmall groups and individual units ships in eve which are after all not a single person have always been able to make a dent by using insurgent style hit and fade tactics against large and unwieldy empires and nationsright now  insurgent style tactics cannot work in 00 that needs to change and on the day that it does many of eves 00 issues are likely to change for the better blobbing will no longer be the only way to take territory suddenly those blobs will need to be spread out to protect the logistics and voila less and less blobbagesuddenly small gang raiding forces will be able to really make an impact instead of being done now for lulz even in areas constantly raided by the gbc in morsus mihi space the effect of the raids is only on individual players the poses still get their gas and the overall affect on sovreignty is neglible to nonexistent tending toward the latter if you cannot get a blob to deal with the pos all youre doing is glorified griefing as the tactics dont do anything other than annoy people and make their game miserableim sorry but i feel youre very wrong the game needs to have more sensible vulnerable and realistic supply and logistics chains this will create a great many benefits across the board for everyone well everyone except those who like the status quo i guess
ok jarvis im going to call you on what youre claimingok have you read previous proposals regarding how to do this if you havent i suggest you do a lot of people are trying to solve this problem its very easy to jump into a discussion without any background reading and say things must get better so things get better and none of you have thought about this kind of posts do you have any of your own suggestions as to how to solve this problem im not talking about vague ideas i mean something tangible that people can actually use to find a solution if you arent part of the solution i request substantiationhow vulnerable and realistic are they now that they need to be made more vulnerable and realistic can you elaborate on this do you maintain any poss in deep 00 to know whether this is truly the case what benefits are you talking about there is too little content to work with in your post
1 just because it happened in real life doesnt mean it can or should happen in eve2 your historical examples are all wrong logitics chains have always been the number one priority of any successful marching army uboats were a massive coordinated effort and it still failed the french resistance provided no real pain to the germans and only served as a network for downed pilots it might have provided intelligence but it sure as hell didnt liberate anyone ieds are not a military deterrent in iraq somali pirates only exist because the un hasnt decided how it wants to fix the problem you have listed only one successful instance and that is the viet cong then again if you actually look at what the viet cong did and why it succeeded you would notice that it had nothing to do with guerrilla attacks and everything to do with the fact that the entire damn country wanted the us out or and the conventional army didnt hurt either3 insurgent  guerrilla insurgencies are where the fighters integrate in with the population insurgencies are possible in eve you just have to join the corp you want to kick out and then actively work against their goals no see here is the thing it already does but just like guerrilla attacks you1 dont see it immediately2 dont have wide spread effects3 have to work very hard at it to make a differencelook if you want some modern day examples lets give you some farc has been fighting in colombia for 48 years the insurgency in iraq has been going on for 6 it took the viet cong 25 years before the fall of saigonthere are groups that effectively deny space to the people who live there right now live on tq but it is hard to do doesnt always work and takes time to see resultsits not about status quo its about understanding how the game works how people interact and what is likely to happen if you make changes its about not implementing bad ideas edit now there are some things that ought to be done but its not because the small guy cant compete its because there are real balance problems and objectives that can be achieved my making them
i have to say i wholeheartedly agree on that point
by all means  but be advised that what i can add is somewhat limited i can guarantee that there are people much better qualified to enact a design concept like this than me fortunately some of them work for ccpi do a fair bit of forum reading but its easy to miss things on these forums particularly if theyre not recent i havent seen any previous proposals of this nature but that certainly doesnt mean that there havent been any its a bit of an obvious place to go for anyone with a military and or military history background really solid detailed ones no im not a jump capable pilot so my experience with jump ops is limited the problem definitely lies with being able to use various cynosural capable ships to resupply poses however whether the solution is to change how jump ships work to make them more vulnerable to attack make certain types of pos fuel something that cannot be jumped perhaps too unstable or some such or some other solution i dont know i dont have the experience to give you detailed solutions whats more there are lots of variables that touch into sovreignity issues etc the people best qualified to look at these issues are those with access to the databases at ccpim not trying to dodge you  but trying to claim that because someone hasnt a detailed plan to fix something means they cant see a problem accurately which you implied isnt wise you dont need a mechanic to tell you that a car wont go because the wheel is lying next to it on the side of the road but you probably will need one to rebuild the suspension so you can put the wheel back onyes ive helped maintain some of our poses although ive had to fly fuel to them the hard way in a hauleras to how vulnerable they have impervious shields and even when coming out of reinforce large ones can take huge fleets a rather long time to kill their guns can kill even large battleships before they can get away without the owners evening knowing it this has happened when one of our poses blew apart one of our allies and weve lost hacs and bses to friendly pos fire  its fast they are virtually invulnerable except to a sizeable force this is true even for a small posas to fueling them  jump in a ship to just outside the shields fly inside and fuel it leave the shields and jump away unless the pos is under continuous siege this is simplicity itself manymost cyno ships are cloakers certainly mine are and they wont light a cyno with reds in local unless there are only a couple generally you can afford to waitcurrently poses give sov impervious places to hide ships and work and other benefits like moon miners jump bridges etc they are fairly simple to keep supplied unless actively sieged by a large blob in short theyre too good the need to have some weakness and right now the blob is the only one they really havemore difficult logistics andor a requirement to protect them in order to preserve their benefits isnt rocket science nor is it hard to wrap ones head around the idea that if you have multiple requirements to keep them running then the ships doingprotecting those operations arent available to blob up
spoken like someone who entirely doesnt understand the primary rule of any speculative fiction that suspension of disbelief has to be maintainedput succinctly rubbishi agree and in eve at present they are virtually impervious to attack unlike any other example you could giveto win the war indeed however hundreds of thousands of tons of material was sent to the bottom and a huge coordinated effort had to be put together to stop them including many new technologies without any question they kept dday from happening years earlier well aside from those pilots naturally oh and the intelligence you so denigrate saved many thousands of lives on dday and may have made the difference between success and failure you need to study your history betterthey are the weapon responsible for the most deaths in the entire conflict and have had a great deal of political impact on the american people they were certainly far more effective than saddams armyyou seem to be fixated on trying to focus on examples of winning conflicts and ignoring things that you would prefer not to pay attention to or dont understandthe french resistance knew full well it wasnt operating in a vacuum and conducted itself that way it was an extremely valuable element to the allies and was on the winning side in that way it could certainly be said to have been liberatingblockade runners kept the south supplied for years and required massive spending of men and material to stop they postponed the confederacys defeat for yearsi suppose i could also mention the afghans against the russians too and unlike the viet cong they didnt take 25 years of course neither did the viet cong as the war was from 1959 to 1975 try 16 years contd
more along the lines that if you havent experienced what youre trying to change you might not appreciate that things are not done the way youve described in reality correct me if im wrong cynocapable ships are not used to fuel a majority of poss directly the only cynocapable ships that can hold a substantial amount of pos fuel are the jump freighter and rorqual the high price tag merits this lighting a cyno in 00 can be a nervewracking experience if you arent assured that you have substantial protection at the other endworking as intended imo a battleshiphac should be seriously at risk if it decides to warp to a defended pos as for small pos ive had my corp use 8 battleships to easily take down a moderately defended small pos had it been more heavily defended my carrier would have been fine for tanking or a single dreadnought again experience matters before trying to suggest changes to the game mechanics try setting up a large pos in 00 and before you say you genuinely think the defences are too strong consider this making all examples relative to your own ingame capabilities can be misleading for others i think you neglected to mention buy the fuel in empire or mine the fuel risky if you are at war or low sec00 get the fuel to your pos riskyyou said unless your pos is under continuous siege this is simplicity itself i dont suppose we all can stay logged in for 23hrs a day to wait out a camp please try spare a thought for the majority of players who may not devote such exuberant amounts of time to the gameyou can afford to wait if you spend longer logged in than your opponent again please spare a thought for people who cant spend all day logged inthey are not impervious they are quite easy to take down in fact dozens are taken down every day unless you have the ability to field a capital fleet you cannot do much to stop the many groups out there that do and will with impunity knock over a lovely pos while you say you didnt have any detailed ideas you dont have any nondetailed ideas either on a problem in a field that you claim to have little experience in
the south vietnamese most certainly wanted nothing of the kind and it had everything to do with utilizing casualties and a hard to hit enemy to bleed out the will to fight of the nation  in the case of vietnam quiet successfullyoh and as to the un doing something about somali pirates thats just funny you mean like the did something about rwanda or darfur or the congoif anything gets done about the pirates it wont be the un that does it it might try and take the credit later but itll be done by othersno thats espionage and something entirely different insurgents in iraq dont join the us military to accomplish their ends you need better analogiesof course  because giving the defender the advantage they never have in real life that of being able to pick the time and place of the battle makes all kinds of sensehowever we arent talking about station ping pong thats been tried and shown not to work obviously you can defend your logistics  because you choose when your fleets will fly to supply your stations but as its an ongoing thing youre unlikely to be able to protect each one with a blob therefore you have to spread out more thinly therefore smaller gangs can land attacks which cause a pos to be unsupplied leaving it vulnerable or perhaps several which means the blob needs to split to defend them until resupply can take placehonestly  try thinking about new ideas rather than assuming im talking about the old ones that didnt work no see here is the thing it already does but just like guerrilla attacks you1 dont see it immediately2 dont have wide spread effects3 have to work very hard at it to make a differencelook if you want some modern day examples lets give you some farc has been fighting in colombia for 48 years the insurgency in iraq has been going on for 6 it took the viet cong 25 years before the fall of saigonyes because i really want to play a game for decades in order to see any results sorry that doesnt sound like something i want to pay for and spend my leisure time and funds doingin the real world weaker attackers have very few advantages  but they do have some in eve as currently written they have noneyou may not like that and thats fine you may think its a bad idea but i dont see any from you at all which inclines me to believe you think its fine as it isthe realities are simple even for big alliances resources people mostly are finite forcing them to spread thinner cannot but help to reduce blobbage
i obviously cannot speak to what bob and the goons do ours are actually fueled by carriers and those are more than sufficient when run down about twice a month and they carry enough for several poses a couple of which are small ones a rorqual or jump freighter would be much better for the job as they would need to make fewer trips we do not currently have either so we use carriersevery pos ive been involved with in my admittedly limited experience has been fueled directly by jump capable ships this may not be done in more secure areas but then it wouldnt need to be now would itas to lighting a cyno in 00  no its not nerve wracking at all if there are reds about you dont do it if there arent you do if they still catch you unawares they still have to deal with the pos guns and the carrier youve just cynoed in ive done it many times and im doing it with my main not even the entirely disposable cyno alt that most of my corp mates usetrying to discredit an argument by ignoring the point and using spurious logic is transparently an attempt to mislead othersalso the devs have said clearly that the entire possovreignity structure is not working as intended indeed the basis of some of my arguments has been taken from some of the things that have been said in the devblogs straw argument of the worst kind 1 buying fuel in empire is a no risk activity obviously anyone can do it quickly and easily all you need is isk if isk is in short supply for your alliance then you have bigger problems than supplying your pos2 getting the fuel to the pos is risky how the entire argument that is being made is that its virtually risk free as it currently sits now ill demand an explanation of you how is it risky how can you possibly stop a pos being refueled that does not involve a blob besieging the stationcont
wow that was pathetic in the extreme trying to make a personal you obviously have no life attack on someone with a family a full time job a long commute two time consuming main hobbies that dont involve computers and who runs three conventions a year in three different cities all across the continent sadthe point was that the camp cant be up 24 hours a day nor can it be particularly close unless being fired on by the pos besides i said the only way to stop a pos being refueled was to besiege camp it if you arent doing that you just wait for the occasional red to go away and youre good to go not to mention that if you are at all intelligent you dont wait until the last day to refuel the thing which gives you a wide window of opportunity in which to do your fueling op its hardly rocket science i dont have to sit at a computer to wait out a camp if there is one ill just log on tomorrow or the next day and do it then hence the lack of riskthank you for making my point for me they are quite easy to take down  if you have resources that only a capital fleet can stop some people see that fact as a problem clearly you dont but others dothanks for your very illuminating post i think youve made your position on what you would like to see out in 00 very very clear
i didnt say that you dont have a life nor did i intend what i said to mean that sorry if it looked like that the point i made was that if the only recourse to a siege is to wait the enemy out ie until they go the ones who this favours quite disproportionately are those who can stay logged in for ridiculous amounts of time this is not conducive to a edit easy task changed from fair game thats not what i meantyou know well that i didnt say it wasnt a problem at any point in my post i was stating facts  this is the current status quo we can ignore that at present pos are quite easy to take down by many people in the game and then start saying they should be even easierit is important to appreciate that making this even easier is a bad idea imagine if it cost 1b to put up an outpost for instance
re 1 you misread what i wrote i said that mining the fuel yourself was risky if you are at war in low sec or 00 i did not say that actually buying the fuel in empire was risky freighteringhauling fuel around from high sec to jump points is a possible interception point as well unless you have a jump freighterre 2 your argument is that it is risk free mine is that there is risk that you are neglecting to mention it is risky if you have to transport bespoken fuel a long way particularly if this involves passing through potentially hostile space a cyno can easily be identified on the map by a nearby roving gang there is risk however small you decide to make it look
recognise this the possovereignty structure concept has little to nothing to do with how actual pos defences work the devs has said clearly that the coupling of pos to sovereignty is a problem to focus on i have not read anything to the tune of pos defences not working as intended
thats the point i was making jumpcapable ships do not fuel the majority of poss directlythats assuming it only takes one jump to get to your pos what if you had to make 2 or 3 00 jumps over the amount of time such a trip can take the security situation can drastically change or a hostile could easily just cynojumpbridge their own stuff to you if they see a cyno set up your cyno will not disappear after you jump in so theyll know where to find you and decloak you
spoken like someone who doesnt understand that first and foremost we are playing a game we are not playing a bookno its not youre asking for guerilla warfare to be a forceful solution to a problem it never has been it has always been a political solution to a problem uboats did not delay dday by years it barely had any effect tonnage sunk not withstanding you have to look at percentages the french did not achieve any military victories that bled the germans dry ieds are entirely a political consideration the fact that they are the number one killer doesnt matter the question is is it having a military impact the south vietnamese absolutely wanted unification its government didnt its people did intervention against somali pirates requires a un resolution before any member nations can take aggressive action without being provoked there is no resolutionand the problem is tiny anywayno that is insurgency they join or simply arein the case of iraq and south vietnam the civilian population the occupying force who lives and produces in the area is the civilian population of the area yes it does because if you dont all the fights happen when the defender is off line and arent actually fights but one side destroying all of the other sides infrastructure without recourseyou dont have to play for years to see results but you might have to play for months hell we have entire full commitment wars that last longer than that you expect that you should be able to do what hundreds of people cant in the same amount of timeguerrilla warfare being inherently an attack against the opponents will is locked in the time it takes to succeed by the will of those people you are attackinglook we are not playing a book we are playing a game games behave differently than how you want them to play out your narrative is not the only one there are other competing narratives i know it would be cool to be luke skywalker but everyone cant be luke even if everyone wants to be the end result if you make everyone luke is that no one has fun in eve we are all zbigniew and then we really can have fun
i wasnt discussing recourses to a siege thats a different topic entirely obviously those should include sending a fleet to break one up etc we were talking about refueling poses that are not under siege and the level of risk entailed in doing so you maintain that it is risky ive repeatedly asked how soi was stating pretty clearly i thought that i am in agreement with cat that the status quo is not good and that poses are unbalanced as they currently are fortunately the devs have already said repeatedly that they feel that this is true as welli was merely suggesting one way in which they could alter things to give them a bit of an achilles heel  that being make the logistics more vulnerable
no i understood what you wrote entirely with metagaming which a great many major alliances make extensive use of this is simply not true if npc corp alts are mining in empire they are not vulnerable to wardecs and are protected by concord suicide ganks are the only option to deal with them and those are limited particularly nowthe same is true for hauling in empireoh come now  anyone who touches off a cyno with a roving gang of reds in system deserves what they get simply sit in the pos or cloaked at a safespot and wait until they leavenothing in eve is entirely risk free no but we assume even the most basic competency the risk currently is vanishingly low
the entire thing is connected and keep in mind that i am keeping to cats original point that alliances need to have more vulnerable supply points in order to create some actual weaknesses for others to exploit and for they themselves to defendas such all cards are on the table including the entire pos system sovreignity the works leaving pos defense along and decoupling sov from them actually makes the problems worse unless the new sov relies upon some kind of logistics tail while creating something like what is used in fw might reduce blobs some alone it probably wont for the simple reason that fw has a lot of blobbage going onits all connected and talking about one aspect of it involves examining them all if you want to ensure success in the aim of change
perhaps not where they are not needed but if that is your point how is that relevant those ships are being used because its convenient in very safe areas threaten them and they dock up and jump ships take up the role until the threat ends a minor inconvenience at most in no way does this present any significant threat to the logistics taileven were you not to use the common practice of setting up a transfer pos at each jump system  and why wouldnt you the only thing you might bag would be a little cyno frigate worth next to nothing and its equally valueless alt so what entirely expendablethe jump ship will have warped off to a safe spot and cloaked up seconds after the cyno is lit and long before any response could be made to its presencehonestly im only making the reasonable assumption that long time players who can fly carriers et al know the basics of how to operate a ship in 00 if its a jump freighter it cant cloak obviously so it wouldnt be used in a region where the danger level is as high as you describe a carrier or rorqual does the job just fine in those casesand of course we havent even started discussing the use of covert ops cynos either
thank you for reinforcing my point take a look over there to the right all those links to eve fiction backstory etc etc the requirements for suspension of disbelief in any piece of speculative fiction in any media whether game book play movie or television show are all exactly the samein the real world i have several published game modules and articles i was a professional game writer for over a year the rules are exactly the same break them and you get moronic things like synnibar sigh well im not bothering to argue this any further at its clearly pointless you may think what you wish but i have dozens of books by competent historians in my library which disagree with you war is merely an extension of politics and intimately tied to economics many enemies are spent out of wars whether financially or through morale issues etc you may choose not to believe that i dont honestly much care but when you start claiming that activities which respectable historians describe as critical or significant are meaningless then discussion has become pointless your mind is made up no point in confusing you with facts
gentlemen you cant fight in here this is the war roomeve isnt perfect and never will be there are as many viewpoints on balance as their are pilots eve is also not rl its a simplified simulation of real world mechanics methods which have historically worked cannot always achieve the same success in this simpler settingi have slightly revised my standing on this issue i still believe it would be more interesting if declaring ownership of space were made harder ie removal of ice from empire but am forced to agree with goumindong that any changes which open the door for small gangs to affect sovereignty will break the ability of large groups to have lasting effect it was never my intention to devaluate strength in numbers merely to provide an opening for the small guywere left either with megalithic powers that become locked in conflicts which cannot be won gscoalition vs bob bob vs nc etc or a system where no 00 entity can claim sovereignty for very long before being torn down by the multitudes when you factor in that this is only a game and not something anyone should spend massive amounts of time on or be forced to be online when their enemies attack any changes to the system become somewhat unbearablethis game is too simple for a compromise between the two the mechanics are just too crude for the balance we attempt to create well see if ccp is able to manage some miracle solution in their sovereignty changes that we somehow missed if they manage to pull it off ill be impressed ive got the feeling theyve painted themselves into a corner in this area its just a game and while i did start this discussion please understand that i will be content to stay in lowsec and slug away at the targets therecheers
ahh yes the good old i wrote some stuff for some pen and paper rpgs therefore i know what i am talking about and you do not argumentmmos are not pen and paper rpgs the player interaction is significantly different especially in pvp mmos like eve hell its significantly different in pretty much any game with noncooperative actions pen and paper rpgs are about telling a story when i want to tell a story i go play dnd or wod when i want to push someones  in i play eveeg games that dont need suspension of disbeliefchess checkers chinese chess chinese checkers go any board game ever real time strategy games turn based strategy games first person shooters third person shooters shumps oh hell any shooting game ever if anyone made a second person shooter you wouldnt have to suspend disbelief for it racing gamesyoure wrong qedyes now youre getting somewhere unfortunately youre forgetting that there is a distinct difference between political will and military will youre asking for for military determination of an issue that has always been a political movement do you think that the usa would have any problems subduing iraq in the absence of political pressure to not simply wipe the place clean do you think that the usa would have any problems taking and holding key resources if it didnt have to deal with people asking why it was slaughtering civilians seriouslywell in eve we have the political will we slaughter civilians we simply dont give a  now you can make a difference you can do it already you can sap the economic ability of a populace of people its just difficult its always difficult there are aspects of the game that need changing because they promote stagnation but its not because we have to make room for the little guy militarily making room for the little guy militarily means that the big guy will drive a mac truck through the opening that or conflict will die down from mutual dont shoot me i dont shoot you understandings but that is unlikely since first strikes would negate your ability to fight back neither situation is good though
so what are they doing now fixing the vote
may i take a guessenjoying their weekend
did you give them permission to do that
now this is novel
if this was second life where you could marry some other stranger ingame and want to then change part of your name to match theirs then there might be some logic to thisbut this isnt so nah iz
because marriage is the only reason someone has taken on another name ever
if the old name and new name points to the same character on a search and also clearly states the former name in the character info then i support it

you are getting my support
this whole thread is junk across the board too many flaws to even support part of the original ideathumbs both of them way down
ive filed hundreds of petitions about macro miners and none of themnot oneever got banned when they switched from bs to barges they would get recycled but none i ever petitioned disappeared those that are still around are still mining or autopiloting freighters in npc corps as untouchable as they were 3 years agoi just gave upccp wont give us any tools wont name  shame them or make npc corps less lucrative for them i had to give up trying
make it easier to highsec gank again  seemed to see a lot less of them then then people got what they and and also got more macro miners honestly i dont care because i dont mine
heh the boldunderline parts sound like me i have been mining quite a bit of ice lately and i dont talk in local unless spoken to first but you can always convo me and i will reply and no cspa charges either but yeah i agree down with macrominers ab
mm miners should really die
yep ccp is allways looking into it but same macro characters are still mining even if you send few petition with screens and same macro lists everyone knows where are biggest group of macros its not so hard to find just most of ice belts near trade hubs everyone except ccp
i agree but i think the problem ccp has with macros that you can not be 100 sure if its a mm or not im a programmer and would say that i understand how macros generally work an easy way to stop the mm would be to add a random variable to the gui itself for example you have 2 options to undock from a station 1 the button in the lower left corner of the screen and 2 in the right click menu of the shipnow you could remove the one in the corner and randomize the position of the undock entry in the right click menu this way the macro has a hard time to work corrector randomize the pop up location of right click menu sometimes it could pop up on the left side of the mouse sometimes on the other the more you add of that small hardly noticeable random changes the harder it will be for the macro
nay its too practical this is generally not the philosophy of the great turning machine that is ccpi remember when eve use to lag horrendously off of millions of book marking backlogs imagine the devestation of millions of symultaneously queuing skills this is blasphemy i will not stand idley by whilst your band of hoodlems try and furthur degrade our lovely community into an unrecognizeable mess of lag and free democracy

not supportedas a nzer i have no issue when the dt occurs apart from the gripe that ausies get to go factionfficer hunting when the server restarts and im already off the sleepdt is unlikely to ever change as its based on the iceland timezone
do your research and check the forums before you make such foolish poststhis has been discussed againand againand againand once again the answer is nofer cryin out loud its just 1 measly houromgwthicantplayeveforanhourgo cry me a rivergo play wow for an hour then come back during dttt
see my post 5 above particularly the bit about post me a link i am not about to go searching through hundreds of thousands of threads that happen to include someone saying downtime
you got an hour of time to read the forums an hour of dt every nightdo it yourselfit will keep you busy  o p
that around 15001700 iceland and england too so if there is a problem and the dt is extended the ccp staff will work overtime to resolve it instead of doing it in regular working hoursso the cost is higher ccp should introduce a special overcharged subscription fee for anzac to cover for such a changeyou are the one starting the same argument for the thousand time but you dont even want to do a bit of work to see what where the arguments pro and against the other times it was shot downlazy
this has been raised intermittently for as long as ive been playing and was also discussed in my campaign thread six months ago my position hasnt really changed either it didnt bother me personally then and it doesnt bother me personally nowgo watch the fanfest 2008 presentation where they break down the player percentages from each country and youll see how many people youre proposing to negatively affect for the benefit of how many lessnot supportededit im a kiwi btwben
heh your proposed downtime is during the period that ive seen 35k players on so i doubt ccp would shut their servers down then oh yeah and right in the middle of my playing timethe only time that dt affects me is on weekends if im playing eve or i am not at work but this is not the case every single time as i dont play eve 237 i say keep dt as it is i dont know why ccp chose that time i would guess its when the server load is low and their staff are availableab
how did you forget about europe 
it is 11001200 in iceland and england ccp main offices are in reykjavik iceland and the server is in london england so starting dt at 1100 allow them to get at work at 800 do the preliminary work start the dt at 1100 and still go to eat at 13001330 even if there are troubles restarting the server unless there are big problems if there are big problems they still have time till 1700 to fix them without doing overtime and working 8 hours in a day so being still fully alert even at the end of the work time so essentially the time was chosen to get the best performance from ccp staff and the lower cost for the corp at the same time it is a part of the day where they will disturb the lowest number of costumers possible
dt on sisi many times was around 0100am gmt when ccp staff should sleep so its doable to do dt on tq in other part of the day or night
i live in argentina downtime for me is from 9am to 10 am if is not extended before was from 8 am to 9 am but the country change the time again and i have to wake up 7 am to change a skill in order to not loose 30 min of trianing lol leave it as it is is damm good go watch tv an hour or do something else
if you look at the server usage graphs at coldfront youll find that tq downtime is always at the best time already  when nobody is playing any other time of the day and at least someone is playing
dt is bad enough already dont suggest an even worse timethe problem is dt itself it should only really be necessary 12xweek
excellent idea well worth my support  
for ships that sit in space or in a pos as a extra measure of security right now its like having a car the everyone has the keys for or the ability to anchor them in space with a password you could still target and destroy them just not get in them
maybe if you allowed a skill to hack them but even then maybe besides if you dont trust those around you or in your own corp or alliance to be able to park them around your pos maybe you have bigger issues
while this isnt really a concern for the player base most people prob dont care it is a issue that ccp will need to get thier lawers to check for every geopolitical zone they serveif local anti gambling laws do not place a distinction between real assets and virtual assets in relation to gambling then ccp will be walking into a land mine of lawsuits and class actionsjust because some laws are ridiculous doesnt mean that there are not lawyers out there waiting to make a quick buck from exploiting themi wonder what the ausie player base would do if eve became r18 thier government would have no option but to block all access to it due to thier current policy of no r18 games
in the us the law effectively works out to be you cant legaly sign up for most online communities without a parrentguardian unless youre 13 or older if youre under 18 you probably still need a parent to be able to pay for iteve carries a t teen rating from the esrb the step above it is m mature which is 17 and older however rating enforcement is the responsability of the store selling you the game im also not sure how or if the rating enforcement is conducted for onlinedownloadable sales ive never seen any data about it selfpublished downloadable games often ignore the esrb alltogether and do not submit their games for ratings as it costs money to doas for the op before atari publishes eve for the retail boxes in march they may have to submit the game to the esrb again for rating no mater what however as has been pointed out there are a lot of t rated games that have gambling minigams and the like federal gambling regulations only apply if real money changes hands in second life the l to usd conversion is officialy sanctioned by the developer linden lab in eve that is not the case which is why youre not likely to see the feds knocking at ccp atlantas offices
so in a game setting that lets you kill thousands for ingame money where you buy cruise missiles for ingame money sell slaves for ingame money sell drugs for ingame money you are concerned that gambling for ingame money may get you or ccp in troublesnap out of it
tbh it will turn 18if people in australia for instance wanted to change santas hoo hoo hoo into something else because it sounds too much like     then this will be 18 
as long as its based on successful bug reports and not just all bug reports i can see medals working nicely for thisben
seriously ccp needs to take immediate action and lock this worthless thread it has no useful purpose and serves only to clutter the forums
they already have that its called the trash button and imagination
lol
that is not the point yamato trashing give you nothing  we shuld be able get something back if we fight agest drugs and fight npc who is trying too take freedom away
freeing slaves addicted to vitoc gets you just that nothing  what did you think that its all about unkeying the chain and send them on their way home while they praise your name
take the idea a bit further imaginestep one remove slaves from npc sell ordersstep two the introduction of planetary interaction allows pod pilots to set up structures to produce slaves step three previously mentioned structures can be destroyed and slaves can be handed over to be freed in planetary interaction structures built by the minnies they earn a bit of isk for every slave freedfun
id like that especially with that vitoc part you would not only have to liberate the slaves but also pay for healing their addiction or smth in return you would get bonuses to minnie standings and an occasional reward or it could be used for the forementioned planetary interaction mechnicid surely like that signed
you think this is a universe built around being a good guy and an upstanding citizen you get the satisfaction of a job well done if you roleplay enough to care about whether bits in a database are actually enslaved or intoxicating then surely you care about their freedom enough to do it out of the goodness of your heart
you could make it more like invention by having it use data cores minerals etc as well as the original object
id like to discuss this further there is a lot of potential here
it does not exist because it would unbalance the market in certain areas eg if you could take apart a control tower and get a pos bpc  they contain almost no mins at all  and selling for 300 mil would fly off the shelfs at a profit of 100000000there are various non seeded bpos that if reversable would cause all kinds of issues use it on a faction battleship  ect
common sense dictates that it wouldnt be made possible to reverse engineer things that do not have blueprints
i like the idea of using datacores to re items i also think that the base item you use should be used up i know in my original post i suggested that the percentage of getting your item back should go up as your re lvl increases but maybe the item should be used up completelyi also think that faction items shouldnt be allowed to be red except maybe for ammo which could help out those of us who live out in 00 and dont make often trips to hisecjust a thoughtsince the market thing was brought upi would like to suggest that the supporting science skill would be the same as invention but the skills need to be at lvl 4 for the required skills like laser science and nuclear science for instance what do you guys think
pos gunnery is continuing to be a logistical nightmare and detracting from gameplay seeing as most people have gunnery skills on their main character and the pos network is probably being run by an alliance logistic corp it means that everyone needs to be in one corporation in order to effectively defend space using pos gunners the solution to this problem will be the massive megacorp which is really a step backwards there should be an option to allow alliance members to use pos guns
i really would like to see this i dont have any pos but when we had one we encountered this problem which would have been very usefull they dont have to control like 5 guns but 2 guns would be good enough
indeed members of the same alliance if they have access to the pos should be able to use the defense arrays if they have the skills to do sodoing this on an allancewide scale however would be a double edged sword for example that annoying spy who sits at a pos and sets the guns to target the most indestructable or unstrikable of the enemy ships thus wasting their functionimo more than just 5 arrays should be controllable and that control should be removable at any time how would this function to keep multiple defenders from vying for control of the same arraysdefense arrays should be grouped by default when controlled by someone with the appropriate skills thus all of one weapon type all of one defensive array type webneutscram would be a single group unless specifically unlinked by the operatorcurrent defense mechanics and pos logistics all around are just nightmarish in complexity and need serious review as stated repeatedly during the previous csm cycle
well thats a problem on a corp level as well never actually happened to us though weve usually satisfied the problem of too many gunners by having whoever is leading the defence on ts yell loudly everyone not on the list im about to read out can just log the  offto be honest this idea is excellent i can understand the original ccp concept of it being a tactical issue that corps have a number of gunners in the right locations with preprepared bookmarks but with pos warfare being as it actually is having the ability to allow pos gunnery for all members of the alliance the same way as it is for entering the shield ie you either set them to all allow or make it password access
oh yes

hrmmmmmmmmmnoyou want a mothernaught there needs to be a highest pew pew ship class cannot just keep escalating until everyone is flying planetkillers
planet killers ftw it would bring a whole new meaning to planetary interaction p i think we should wait to see what the t3 ships will be like before proposing something like this maybe this mothership will be a viable option already placed into the game when t3 is released 
i hope you brought enough of that crazy stuff you are smoking for everyone
dont we have enough supercaps as it is
while i love the idea of a new capital gunboatmissile  to fill the lacking of real anti cap pvp given that dreds are ohh so passei dont think the mothernoughts are the answer id rather see a 125 x modifier added to the titans weapons and possible a tank bouns  since apparently now its confirmed we can destroy them with some nano hacs  and make use of an existing class
125 per level  625 overall 625 from seige module and an extra 375 for the minnie one too lol and double hardpoints 6 over 3 compared to dreadsso instead of doing around 6000 dps in a gank fit more like sixty thousand and it has double mobility advantage being able to move towertotower andor deseige to get remote repped within 5 minutes instead of 10 plus they have tank bonuses you couldnt have picked more mental stats if you had triedyou also didnt bother to state why the ships need to exist what role they fill apart from the obvious overpowered killer of all large ships and what balances them
i support this idea of using titans in this manner and modifying then to fill this role instead of creating a ter2 mothernoughti really like that word of the dreadnought class of ships but when i posted that idea it got shot down so i had to come back with something else and i takled it from another directionalsoi wouldnt go so far as to say we need these ships the fact of the matter is that blobs of dreads will get together to do the very same thing that this one ship would accomplished so instead of building and blobbing caps why not put the same amount of isk into one ship less ships less lag same niche as current dreads field with a sorta twist the 125 damage mod is there to make it so that this ship dose not need to siege do dreadnought damage the ability to fit a siege mod is up in the air but i would rather see one ship on the field doing the damage of 30 dreads with 100 support ships then the latter of 30 dreads with 200 support ccp can say lag is gone all they want its bull and we all know lag is still there and what causes it blobs of caps moar then any other form of ship in this gamecurrent ships like the dreadnought are alone in there class some can say that titans are the ter2 dread but thats bull carriers have mother ships as there ter2 and there nothing but 2 carriers welded together with the ability to field 3 times the fighters fit the ecm thing and fit the tri mod just like a standard carrier it is unfair that the carrier class gets to have a super cap class of its self and not the dreadnought class

still waiting for a reply
and it was you  you have a dread with 25 damage bonus at lvl 5  now take this one here you double its turrets and instead of 125 damage modifier from dreadnought lvl 5 you get 625 damage modifier from mothernaughtso you do 125 to 125 damage comparing the dread to the mothernaught and thus have 10 times the damage  whether that sieged dread was doing 5 or 6k the other one will do its 50k to 60k
this part you got right but you still need to go thru the math and post it if your going to try and convince anyone that you have a sound theory of the mechanics of the siege mod and were do you people get dreads that do 6000k dps because i want to buy one there is no dread currently in game that dose 6000 dps the most ive been able to pull out of a maxed toon with a pulse revy was 33kdpscurrent revy dps math with gun skills taken out of the mixdual giga pulse laser idamage modifier x6rate of fire 1181 secdamage modifier x6625x435963guns12528rate of fire 11812588575 secstock ship with seige mod and lvl5 dread skills dps 142363my amarr proposed ships math with gun skills taken outdual giga pulse laser idamage modifier x6rate of fire 1181 sec662543562531537596damgemax damage ammo30276damage6guns170735damage per volly or 14469dpsnow i hope this is the last time i have to say this no dread dose 6000dps out of the box and this flagshipmothernought would not even come close to doing 60k dps now i really would like to see or hear some constitutive augments about how else this ship might be able to be implemented because i firmly believe that dreads should get a super capital sized vessel to there ship classalso i do not feel that mother ships in any was have issues other then not being stronger then they are titans well i have mixed feelings about what needs to be done to titans but if this idea was implemented to the titan then i would make it my eve goal of getting onethe turrets on a titan never get used to any capacity and thats just want i feel needs changing the most
you seam to forgot that you are only allowed to launch 1 pos per system per day as a corp nad i think there is a limit of 5 per allianceso shortening the online times will not change posspammingbtw doing something else during onlining small modules like silos guns and so on which only take 510 minutes sounds easier then it isonlining silos again after emptying or fueling and then waiting 3 minutes before you can online the next one is just plain boring nothing elseyou cant do something in the 3 minutes cause then you have to be back againso a skill that reduces onlinetime by 10 per level would be really nice 
indeed pos logistics are just nightmarishly broken as it standsanchoring towers imo should not be reduced in time until they move soverignty mechanics away from them otherwise just faster tower spam but the ability to set up tower infrastructure should be made considerably fasterallowing a pilot to anchor as many structures as their anchoring skill allows for simultaneously
after the new patch  the curry gods were amazed to understand that curry is not a trade itemconsidering that curry is really a building block to the life force of everything that exists in eve they think its only right for it to be a trade item to give people a chance to acquire itcurry as a trade item would be a good prerequisite to full blown curry houses in station when we get to walk around themthe curry gods would like to propose for curry to be a usable modscript that for example can be use to upgrade a torpedo imagine the destruction a prawn phal torp can do that stuff can eat through anything plus has the bonus of making the victim taste bettercurried lovepalu

perhaps with ambulation seeing the ships in the same way you do without your ui up ctrltab style would be kinda nice  but ffs dont give them overviews in the station why dont you just give them an auto docking macro and a coloring book jeez make it easyer to hide in stations why dont you
while it would give players who wish to hide in a station an advantage i have to agree because it just makes sense even some of the ships have windowsmake it a tax to flight control or something that gives access to the overview for a few minuteseither way if somebody wants to hide fine you are still costing them time by keeping them pressed against the glass afraid
allowing you to see whats outside doesnt translate to you knowing who is out there first local needs to go in its current form then allow people to see shiptypes with no added info on who is flying it
a ship viewer would be nice maybe something we can buy as a placeable object to adorn our quarters bars and strip clubs  i would settle for a window as well 
your votes have been tallied and we are pleased to announce our newest list of delegates for the second council of stellar management who will represent you and what were the voting results point your browsers here for xhagens newest blog on the matter
247 less voters this time this whole affair needs more publicity speacially among newer playersand the results of csm actions needs to be more visible so people can see that the cms is actually usefuli wish a good term for all elected council members
i very nearly didnt vote as im not convinced the voter turnout will be any better than the 11 we got last time which is also why i havent run myself this timebut then i decided that would have been hypocritical so i voted omber on the basis of his concerns with the format of the csm itself many of which i too shareedit and because im sure he loves getting up at half past stupid to attend the meetingsben
judging from the amount of ustimezone candidates this time us eu guys will have to wake up really ty early this time
22 na 19 eu and 1 aus and i expect the eu candidates to do better than the na it might be enough to push it back to 1800 instead of 1600 but its not like na will ever push eu into waking up early since your tooearly is our toolate
with the wiki up well hopefully be able to run the meetings a bit more efficiently at least i hope we wont have those 5 hour monstersessions anymore
i voted for goumindong because i am a troll
i voted for darius because he ordered us to do it
my votes were for sale they went to the highest bidder so really i won
congratulations sean give em hell
fw is a very very tiny part of it forget kills in fw think bigger statistics achievements etc for everyone for everything
congratulation on 2nd csm ank 
the easiest way to solve this problem is to stop jet can mining
i have an ideato begin with dont change the current can flipping mechanicgive the orca well make this possible for any ship a tractor beam that works how i think a real tractor beam should you can bring stuff to you and you should be able to move stuff away from youthe game mechanic could be something simple such as a right click context menu item for locked targets that tell the tractor beam mod to move its currently actively tractored target to this target locationadd to that the ability for the orca to deployretrievetakegive from a secure freighter can in space like any other size canthose three things would provide a reasonable way to deal with ore thieves and provide incentive for empire miners to band together and make use of the orcanote if any of my peers deem this post to be off topic or trollish then complain through the proper channel and have it removed edited or otherwise dealt with properly
i dont understand the three words you are talking about i know ice mining but the angymonne phrase i did not understand could you please rephrase and clarifyi like this idea but i bet the canflippers dont that would be way too risky to flip cans if you could have a merc corp in fleet with you at a planet or moon in system and warp in and gank the flipper that would be so unfair for the griefer but as a miner i do like it i suppose you are right however with the current system in eve its the only way to transfer ore among people so i bet even goonswarms industrialists use jetcans when mining until ccp finds a valid way for miners to mine efficiently without the jetcan which is not intended for mining purposes people will use the jetcansi dont see how this benefits the solo mineralso a can has ownership so you cannot move another persons can with a tractor beam unless in fleetdont see what the tractor beam should do that would stop the griefers from flipping canslast but not least the people who get griefed by can flippers are usually new players to eve and do not have the skills or funds to fly an orca or even use a tractor beammaybe all this can flipping will solve itself ive heard rumours about mining will get some love in the next expansion something about mining will be in deadspaces that needs to be scanned out so the average joe can flipper will have a hard time to enter theese dead spaces or dungeons if you prefer

congratulations issler
now that there are two sets of results up it is simple to analyse a correlation between position on the ballot page and number of votes received then if there is its worth pursuing iirc from the 1st election there wasnt much correlation between the two
id like to slightly disagree here  ee can be about both telling a story and blowing the other guy up depending upon the circumstances and the person playing it hell for a number of people its about both at the same timeaside from that i have to say i mostly agree with your points though while one person or a small group of people should be able to have some local effect generally speaking they should not have a huge effect upon a group many times their size nor is it realistic to expect them to
eve may be whatever you make of it but that is a personal choice i can tell a story with chess if i really want to its more difficult but it can be donethe underlying system has nothing to do with story this is primarily different with a pen and paper rpg where the system is necessarily designed around being able to tell that story hell there is a person whose entire job it is to tell that storybut it is not so in eve
perhaps not for you and i believe thats the fundamental difference in the points of view i emphasize much more of the rpg part of the mmorpg you go in more for the strategy game aspectim still going to disagree with you  the reason i play eve is because of the universe the backstory etc not because i think its fun to fly around in a digital spaceship and shoot at just any old thing my character is particular about his targets has morals and ethics separate but similar to my own and so on perhaps it wouldnt bother you if ccp did something which utterly smashed suspension of disbelief like putting pink bunny ears on all spaceships permanently but it would ruin the game for mean extreme example to be sure but there you gowe shall have to agree to disagree
just because im bored waiting for my scans to finish ill pipe up in here f2f rpg systems are designed to constrict the player to tell their own story within preveiling ipeve and mmos in general is quite different by necessity it is designed as a framework for the players to build uponadaptdistort so they can tell their own story within the preveiling ipand it has to be this way because to run an mmo in the same way as you would run a f2f game would require perhaps about one gm per 10 playersso as such yes your both wrongthe underlying system has everything to do with the storyno how the story interacts with us isnt the point of the gameits all about us leading the way and the game following rather than the us following the game
perhaps so im not sure if youre right or not but thats a fascinating perspective
looking forward to the results coming out soontmwho is next up to bat
i too am waiting for the results
more support
maybe i am stupid or just fail at searching can you point me to the minutes you are talking about  thanks
you quoted me out of context i have no idea which minutes i was refering to
oh sorry  i thought youll get it  your replies to jinx barker always mention some meeting minutes that you are waiting to be published i had a look at all the mms in the csm section but none mention the dead horse topic in their agenda list
well itd be nice if the new council perhaps put this slightly differentlywe know that at some point pos models will get an upgrade as ccp slowly work through remodelling everything starting with ships and stations in trinity patch and moving onto gates in latestwe also know that pos mechanics are bugged and sov mechanics are unsatisfactory to the vast majority of playersthis suggestion or something similar could be woven into a wider much needed revamp of pos its the wider fixes that take the effort but need to be done anywayedit t3 ships would basically be exactly the same idea just with ships rather than pos structures
thats the best way to delay this even more pos and related game content are soooo unfinished it is a real pain at times however i guess you are right nothing but a complete revamp can help hereimagine ccp implements this all folks have to rearagne their poses   then they change sov mechanics and people have to tinker with things againi mean i understand their hesitation to implement this what i dont have an understanding for is the almost complete silence and ignorance
i think its more that the way its phrased in the minutes is as if it was tagged on the end of the meeting and dismissed out of hand by ccp
can you link me the meeting minutes where it is mentioned  thanks
46 0102070077 funky pos recommendation
aha  i wonder why we have a csm section of the web with meeting minutes when they release this in a forum thread anyway they will need to rework pos mechanics sooner or later and the graphics are no that much a work as they managed to rework almost everything in the prior expansions

new csms time to get another review of this subject
ya ccp isnt going to listenwhen they have their mind set on a nerf no amount of thread whorage will stop it yes they might tweak it but im even beginning to doubt thatpulsesblasterstorpsauto for bs weaponspulsesautosblastershams for your bccruiser weaponsyes even with the web nerfs
quoted for complete ignorance and incompetence dearie dearie me thats painfully wrong
it has been a while since qr released and in spite of the backlash from the missile nerf i have yet to see an official response from ccp actually i havent seen a single response at all which leads me to believe ccp thinks their broken game mechanics arent a problem or they dont actually read their forumsif you have no intention of fixing this game imbalance will you at least let us know it will help missile users to make intelligent decisions about what to train for next
i agree with this however do not make it back to what it was like just make them more useful they are already nefd in gamgs due to flight time nso maybe increase thati have no idea tho its not my job my job is to notice problems
the way they were before was perfectly fine and reasonable scale back the nano nerf was an incredible overkill and rollback the missile changes and youll have a good game again

not spamming just putting the topic up this problem must be solved once for all like the last reply say there are diferent ways to do itthere was an idea of the afk notification after the mouse is inactive for 10 min ice belt macro minning would be solved in some cases when they dont do the mining whit the mackpls think in something for god sake we are not asking nothing new just a problem solvedi saw all the fanfest videos and not even 1 time they mention the macrominers
after watching a friend run a macro on a different game i feel this would not work as most macros are capable of moving a mouse also alot of ppl me included run mining ships on a second char minimized behind their mission  pvp  whatever character and as far as i know this is legalunfortunately there is really nothing you can do that will hit macro miners without hitting alt miners as wellmacros and farmers are something to be expected in any mmorpg there is almost no way around it i produce more minerals reprocessing stuff from my missions than i do from my hulk anyways so  at the mission loot and drone loot in particular before you worry about a much smaller problem
keep in mind your standings factor into the reprocessingrefinement process before you start pointing fingersnot everyone has high standings
haha you suck at real life
if the no mans land between highsec and lowsec were true then how come there are highsec to nullsec systems i dont think that rp reason is validi support this
edited corrected null tracking penaltydue to a number of compounding factors large and medium blasters have been rendered almost totally ineffective in qra short list of some of the factors contributing to their ineffectivenessincreased agility of all ships allows for higher base transversal at tighter orbits than ever beforeweb effectiveness reduced by a factor of four increasing relative transverse by over 400blasters are forced to operate at extremely close range forcing blaster pilots to give up any sort of advantage they have of reducing relative transversal by maintaining slightly longer ranges 1014kmnull ammunition long range blaster ammo has a 25 tracking penalty negating any sort of transversal advantage attained through operating at longer rangesonly one blaster ship hyperion has enough mids to fit a second web and due to its lack of a tracking bonus still cant hit a double webbed bc that orbits at blaster optimal 2500m for a max skilled t2 ion fitbattleships are not the only ships affected all cruisers and battle cruisers are affected as well as the optimal range of medium blasters is severely truncated compared to that of large blasters and the increase in tracking of medium blasters doesnt compensate for the loss of optimal and hence the increased relative transverse velocity of a webbed targetthe issue here isnt about not hitting frigs or afs or inties with your bs sized guns its about not being able to effectively hit targets of the same size or maybe one class smaller at all once they attain a tight orbit around your ship no limiting transversal velocity isnt an answer to this problem most blaster ships simply dont have the agility to out fly an opposing ship due to speed and agility limitations imposed by armor plates and rigsfurther more blasters do not do enough damage relative to all other weapons the concept is for blaster ships to do massive amounts of damage once theyre in range and hopefully theyll still be alive after burning up almost all their cap and using up almost all their armor to get into range and actually start fightingright now most other weapon systems can achieve as good or better performance over a much wider range of distances than blasters can particularly when factoring in comparable tanks for pvp fit ships improve blasters
arf new csm provokes spurt of people bringing up issues the last one ignored in the hope of change how foolishly optimisticnevertheless agreed
ive been beating the dead horse about stupid t2 ammo nerfs for over a year now and no responseyes null is useless no matter its size void isnt much better t2 missiles are slightly more used now javelin mostly but still the nerfs obviate any and all bonuses to the point that t1 base is betterive never used blasters because of the freakish short range but i understand perfectly how you feel and i support some drastic fixes to the heavy handed quantum fail changes
the way i figured if a bunch of morons are bringing up useless self serving garbage issues i might as well post something worthwhile in the off chance it might make a difference
i see you are still campaigning for this to be corrected good
i just use fed navy antimatter id like to see the t2 ammo fixed a bit but i really dont have a problem in pvp with my blaster ships in fact my more recent kills were with a taranis with light neutrons today i tried out my deimos against other cruisers and did just fine winning most duels with my corpmates only against a couple different hacs did i have any trouble but thats more by racial design than a failing of blaster trackingsorry folks im a diehard blasterboat pilot but i dont seem to have these problems
probably has something to do with the fact that youre not using larger ships in my op i clearly stated that the issue is with larger ships and larger guns not smaller onesanother point to clarify i never under any circumstances use t2 ammo ever its horrible and its going to stay that way for a long while until ccp scraps it of fixes it with faction leadiridiumwhatever you can get nearly the same range as null and similar damage without the tracking penalty and nobody in their right mind will use voidthe above isnt to be construed as hey just use faction leadiridium ammo your problems are solved the only ammunition suitable for use in blasters against like sized targets is antimatter and lots of it
blasters are useless atm
deff time for a gall buff
love it
this one has my vote
nice idea
tush could create a new item called fittings container in which you put your setup modules rclick on the mod and fit to active ship1
lets hope the new csm make an issue of this p
on the topic of database stressthis would be no different from selecting a bunch of unpackaged modules right clicking and choosing fit to active ship which has the effect of fitting your ship all at once and is usually low on lagthe disadvantage of what you can already do is that modules must already be unpackaged ie seperate stacks so you still have to browse your hangar to find the ones you want
i said that i would be posting this here after the election is over and as such am doing so the original features and ideas post can be found hereintroductionone of the largest failures in eve is that there is no system by which constant effort is required to stay ahead of the game in production once you have researched your blueprints and set up an invention cycle you can pretty much just sit back and produce research is a one time thing with no progressioni think that its time we change this so that producers need to continually research to stay ahead of the game so that those that get to the top first get a significant advantage over others and then can fight to stay at that top spoti feel that i have designed a way to do that which will not produce significant extra database load as can be expected in other solutionstypical problemsfirst i want to talk about typical problems that occur with an expanding research system that is a system that does not have an end point these two problems are expanding database load and an increase difference between new and old players the main problem that has to be solved when you have a research system is that the number of items produced will expand continually as people make modifications the database needs to have an entry for each unique item and item type as this progresses the amount of entries in the database expands at the very least linearly with research this is unacceptable for a game whose primary asset is its database the expansion of items that then become obsoleted would produce an increasing load for no discernible advantagethe secondary problem is that new players must progress up the same research tree this leaves them always behind the older players in both research and often times combat this is unacceptable in a game that has been designed to protect against hegemonies of the rich and old at some point there needs to be a limit to the advantage that old players gain over new ones a lot of old players feel like they are entitled to this advantage but said entitlement ruins games in the long run as no new players join the fray you need to guard against an increasing gulf between the players while still having a continued fight for production advantagewe solve these with assimilation assimilation assimilation for us is basically that as technology advances the newer advances eventually get incorporated into the current systems this is the system by which we can solve the problems talked about above rather than continually progressing the old modules we simulate this by regressing the newly researched modules as the quota of highest level of researched blueprint is finished being researched all highly researched items and blueprints regress one meta level this occurs until they are tech 2 items and blueprints at which point full assimilation has occurredthe fight to research the highest level item will eventually bump everything down a tier this means that if you get a high quality blueprint you will not be able to rest on your laurels if you do someone else will research the blueprints up and then bump yours down a notch as well with items if they are also on the meta level dropping then there is a use it or lose it value to these items if you do not use the items then they will regress towards basic tech 2 modules as people do research in the area this is obviously not good and provides more incentive to get your but out and use that advantage while you still have it
establishing a baselinewhen doing the above we will have to establish a baseline where the assimilation ends and everything is normalized this is your baseline where everyone is more or less equal at the moment the baseline is tech 1 but this produces typically too large a differentiation between a tech 1 fit and tech 2 fit its currently 20 if we start modules at tech 2 and keep going above that into tech 34 and 5 we will have a 35 difference between a full tech 1 and tech 2 fit clearly this is unacceptable if we do not advance above tech 2 then we will be replacing the entire mechanism by which people produce items as well we would need to change every single item currently in the database why would we need to do this because if we are changing the meta value of items as people continue to research then we will have instances where someone logs on after a downtime in space where his modules do not fit as the decrease in meta level has increased the modules fitting because of this if items themselves are going to be reduced in meta level then we would have to redo the fittings of all items something that is not ideal and doesnt advance the game at alli think tech 2 is a good level at which we can stabilize with named items used mainly for refining specialized fits that need more space and when people need to fit very cheaply to facilitate this we will have to remove all requirements to use tech 2 items there would be no point at which players would be unable to reach the baseline as well this would mean that all generally used items would be player produced which would move us closer to a full player economy one of the design goals of the gamemoving on upok so now we have our baseline tech 2 items then we have to have a method make the new items as well as a design regarding how good these new items are going to be the design regarding the method is the first thing to discuss as there are many ways to do the design but the method is the easiestexplorers find sites which produce item xitem x  tech 2 blueprint copy  time  research agent  tech 3 blueprint originalitem x  tech 3 blueprint copy  time  research agent  tech 4 blueprint originalitem x  tech 4 blueprint copy  time  research agent  tech 5 blueprint original once some number of tech 5 bpos of the designated typedetermined by what the price levels people want to do probably around 50200 bpos of any type have been created then assimilation occurs the tech 5 bpos become tech 4 the tech 4 bpos become tech 3 and the tech 3 become new tech 2 bpos this would kick out all jobs in production including research jobs when it occurred and would take place at downtime this is to ensure that the turnover time on the items is long enough to be valuable tech 3 items would require level 1 in the relevant skill to use tech 4 would require level 3 and tech 5 would require level 5
branches or pipesideally you would want a branching research structure but this might introduce too many database entries each branching research structure would increase one secondary aspect of the attribute and increase the meta level as it made the bp the second option is a linear upgrade path with only one way to upgrade an item per path and each subsequent item is a strictly better version of the one before itideally to me a linear path is going to look something like thistech 3  tech 2 item stats  special secondary attribute overloading bonus or secondary bonustech 4  tech 3 item stats  overloading heat reduction or secondary bonustech 5  tech 4 item stats  secondary module bonusie a bonus to using some other modulebut just what types of stats the items get is pretty mutable ideally they would not have many primary stat bonuses 5 better heat sinks and 5 more dps on guns really starts to add up and ideally you want these to be small bonuses not necessary bonuses eg tech 3 webs could add an inertia bonus when overloading and then the tech 5 bonus could give scramblersdisruptors an extra pointfrom 1 point to 2 or 2 points to 3 lasers could increase the targets signature radius and autocannons might reduce agility ie add lots of cool stuff that happens when you overloadbranching while it would be very cool means a huge amount of database expansion which is likely to not be good tldrwhat is it1 research produces new and better modules andor ships tech 3 tech 4 and tech 52 research requires new items found in exploration in continuous amounts3 research produces a tech 3 then tech 4 then tech 5 bp in that order blueprints are originals4 only a limited number of blueprints can be created5 when the last blueprint is created of a given type for tech 5 all of the tech 5 blueprints become tech 4 blueprints all of the tech 4 blueprints become tech 3 blueprints all of the tech 3 blueprints become tech 2 blueprints this happens at downtime 6 tech 2 becomes the new baseline and all requirements to use tech 2 items are removed7 tech 35 items typically do not have primary attribute bonuses but do have really cool bonuses dealing with overloading andor giving bonuses to other fitted modules8 optional when blueprints drop down a tech level all items also drop down that tech level this means that players have to use those high quality items or lose them they cant stock up just as producers cant rest on their laurels once they researched the highest level itemwhy do itto ensure that competition is continual in eve that no producers can rest on their laurels and that there is no end game for production you need to keep working to stay on top
dear vuk reading your impressive opening pitch reminded me of something i suggested to my corp a few weeks ago about supercaps ive brushed it up a little and posted it below some ideas and suggestions for making motherships and titans more appropriate to the game mothership that lives up to its namekey points numbers slightly adjustable by race  4990m3 drone bay cannot carry fighters but retains the ability to deploy up to 20 drones  60 native resists across the board to shield hull and armour  equipped with a capital push jump portalhas a native capability using the capital navigation window that allows it to jump 1 frigate sized ship to any non cyno jammed system within its maximum jump distance dictated by jdc which can then scout light a cyno for it to jump through to or surprise tackle a ship etc etc 10 minute cooldown frigate will appear 10km away from a random stargate in the system 50000m3 cargo bay 20000000m3 ship maintenance bay sub capitals onlywith enough space for around 40 battleships or over 700 frigates the mothership can support an extended fleet  mini stationnative docking with space for up to 100 pilots their view is either station style or they can switch to an outside view of the mom they are in and they can chose when to undock cloning repair fitting and insurance services jump clone capable  1400000m3 corp hangarcontinuing the moving station theme the mothership has abilities for those docked to access shared corporation hangars as well as limited personal hangar space  full controlthe pilot of the mothership will have full control over the resources within it able to dictate how much corp hangar space is assigned to corps himself individuals etc the pilot has the ability to move take view all items and ships in the mom similar to station security windows as well as ejecting any pilotship at any time the people docked in the mom are the ships fighters it is no longer a ship that you can take into combat solo it has no mega dps of its own other than smartbombs and standard drones it can fit remote rep triage neuts remote ecm tackle etc with bonuses for ecm and repair drones  can fit cloaking device but has a fixed 10 minute cooldown if you uncloak or are decloaked you cannot recloak for 10 mins decloaking also starts a 10 minute aggression timer so logging off and on wont help a forward mini base ship if you let one of these into your home constellation you have a thorn in your side that just wont quit hurting until you find and kill it when it is killed everything and everyone that was in the ship is lost clones are destroyed live or offline pilots are podded to their med clone or corp hq if the med clone is the mom and everything inside the ship is lost additional insurance on ships will pay out as normal but to the last pilot of the ship if they were the insurer

hate to tell you but ccp have said they docking inside capital ships wont happeni did like some of your proposed changes to moms though
do you have a link for that would be interesting to understand the reasoning behind it never say never i say 
honestly cant remember who of the devs posted it and in what threadbut part of the reason for it was the problems it would cause if the titanmom would get a ctd while he had shipsplayers inside him
heh yeah i thought about that i guess if the pilot ctds the players in the ship get a 15 minute downtime style timer till the ship disappears they undock log out or the pilot comes back if they dont log off or undock or if someone logs on into an offline mothership they get the mothership station graphics but all they can do is chat in corpalliance chat in channels or jump clone out basically doing everything but using the station services or undocking same i guess goes for the titan
earning sp by actually playing the gamemy opinions and percieved problemsccps pov on ingame interaction for training skills is boring and unsatisfying ccp thinks that simply logging in and changing skills is sufficient skill training progressionnot everyone plays eve for the same reason and for some simply progressing is the endgame for this playstyle gaining more and more isk may not be stimulating enough these people want to experience eve fly more ships fly ships better or try out the different activities that eve has to offerplayers should be encouraged but not required to play eve in order to progress and gaining more and more isk isnt necessarily considered progress for instance ive got more isk than ill ever need for what i can currently do in eve progress for me is waiting for my skills to allow me to do more or different things in eve the only way i can achieve this is through skill training my logging into eve and actually playing the game brings me no progress thus the only progress that encourages me to log into eve is by skill trainingi am all for the skill queue idea but i fear it is not enough by itself sure logging in simply to skill train is boring and dull but at least it got me to log in while waiting to meet certain requirements to fly that ship or whatever eve activity with a skill queue there would be nothing encouraging me to even login in order to progress unless ccp made actually playing eve a means of progressgoalsto have an additional way for players to gain skillpoints in eve by actually playing the gameto not remove nerf or in anyway alter the current skill training system but to introduce an additional source of sp accrualrough ideaplayers accumulate potential at a rate of 11440 every minute of every day until their potential pool is full at 100 at the rate of 11440 per minute 1day  100 potentialyou can then earn sp by doing ingame actions until your potential pool is emptymaximum potential pool i leave out as any value you or i provide would be arbitrary should be decided by ccp what total  of sp should be earned by playing the game compared to normal skill trainingpotential pool is limited this way to prevent too much sp coming from playing the gameim keeping this the core of the idea and not including how the sp be spent as i cannot think of a slamdunk winner way with which to spend it the challenges listed would need to be solved by ccppictures are worth a wall of textplease visit your user settings to reenable images
challenge how to spend the spthe challenge is then how do your spend said earned sp in the example provided that 5 sp can only be applied to those skills involved youd essentially need to track every source of sp earned as individual sp token objects and then spend them individually or you could just pick a skill and select to spend all available sp tokens there are major flaws in sp tracking and player confusion involved in this virtual pool approach it could be great if there were a simple way to manage the spanother approach that would still reward the skills related to the rewarded activity would be to not pool up the earned sp but to simply have the player select a skill in which to funnel earned sp into then if the reward of the activity completed allows your selected skill to be rewarded the sp is funneled into that skill otherwise no sp is rewardedyet another much simpler idea for sp rewarding would be to simply store all of the earned sp into a pool that the player can then spend on any skill this would by far be the simplest to implement and possibly the fairest although not quite as neato or roleplayish as imagining the character gaining sp through putting those skills to usechallenge rewarding actionsthe rewarded actions would need to be indisputableunexploitable measures of accomplishment activating modules and going afk or something similar must not be rewardednot every accomplishment may be rewardable as i dont pretend to know of every playstyle in eve the major ones are rewardable however ship combat resulting in a kill production resulting in a shipmodulecharge mining asteroids resulting in ore in your cargohold finding scan results 00 starbase logistical stuff i dont know so much about though plus they are corpalliance level so rewarding that is a can of wormsdespite the potential shortcomings of the idea i believe that earning additional sp by actually playing the game is a good one please support
way to ruin the original concept of eve no
i just want to make it clear that this is an idea for additional sp earnings not removal or nerfing of the current skill training system
gb2wow
erm no
absolutely notthis has been one of the key features of the game since its conception students or other people with excess time on their hands arent able to powerlevel themselves ahead at a rate not attainable by the rest of us this should never be changedcaptain thunk
lol drake unfortuneately i have to agree with the nay sayers i think this grinding idea would ruin eve
well clearly this proposal will flop so whatev  iti play daoc gw and eve and i wont deny i played wowi like eves skill training its like wows rest xp or daocs freelevel a way for casual players to invest less time into the game over a longer period of time and achieve the same resultsand i like that eve is for the casual side dont get me wrong i wouldnt play this damn game if it werentbuuut eventually you are going to play the game a little bit and its more fun when that time is rewarded even casual gamers invest time into gamesor dont tell me none of you have ever felt like youve just been logging in to skill train at times pnow that this has already clearly flopped which im used to cause i suck at conveying what is in my head id just like to say that what i had in mind was extremely casual were talking like a powerhour of gamingthe potential pool like a rest xp bar that takes a day to fill up with x amount of spbut could take like a mission or 2 to exhausted or produce a spaceships however that works or scan out a site or mine 1 beltmy idea wasnt to encourage poopsocking but just a little sumin sumin to reward people for actually playing eve now and thenor hell maybe the potential pool could have built up over a whole week and you could spend sunday playing and feel more rewarded for playingnow that thats out  you guys for calling me a wowtard go  yourselves that hurt my feelings
 op
o7
i used to play wow  but then i found the amazingly sexy graphics of eve and enjoyed the almost nonexsistance of millions of little kids asking me for gold every 5 minutes  i would like to see a skill queue and maybe another learning skill i hate odd numbers so a new learning skill would bring it up to 12  and i will be honest sometimes i do feel like i am just loggin on to change skills but i find myself signing on more for keeping up with my corpalliance mates and making sure they are all doing good  that is enough of a reward for me i know a whole lot of sappy crap but they are all good people p i feel you on the posting in assmebly hall thing i dont think i have had an idea yet that has had alot of support andor interest  i will keep trying though cheers mate and fly safeedit i am totally giving you an a for the graphics i like pictures that go with ideas
i have to concur same thing herea when i log on the teamwork of working with my incognito corp soon to be restarted is thrilling coordinating working hard to finish tough missionsetcetc when you play solo casually you wont last long in this game unless your motivation is driven hard by persistenceb posting in assembly hall and just shotgunning ideas really bugs me and im starting to troll a bit too much these days but honestly its so obvious you didnt even bother to researchso sorry if you took offense to that but at least bother to clean up your foul mouth and put more effort into your ideaseven i try to come up with ideas but most of them i delete myself because i realize that theres consequences down the line that would make the game worse off than it istry tackling the wardec problem and youll catch on realll quick like
i drew a picture that alone is reason enough for ccp to implement my idea by noon tomorrow afiakbut seriously i close most of the post i begin to write where im trying to be taken seriously all ideas have potential flaws most ideas can be flawed in the details hell a good bit of the ideas that i am against have great potential if executed flawlesslyi actually did think about this one quite a bit and recognize there are many ways it could hurt or ruin eve if the details arent implemented well but if done just right people wouldnt feel they need to log in to advance yet be pleasantly rewarded with a little extra when they doits all about the details much like speed tanking good idea tons of potential failure to be too strong or too weak but if done just right then its both balanced and still worthwhile
grinding sucks bad this would introduce grinding to eve therefore its bad
ingame actions used to generate sp for skills directly related to that action mining for example would boost your mining skill  it was removed because it was being exploited
wait i can level up my gunnery skills by shooting asteroids for hours on end win go back to ultima online
i have the same memories the question is how was it being exploited and is that exploit still achievable or stoppable eg macroing mwd onoff would have worked to get mwd skill but have ccp improved their capturing of macroers and therefore its not valid anymorethat should be answered before rejecting it out of hand rejecting it on principle is a whole other matter 
i wasnt rejecting it for the exploit reason  i was just pointing out that this system used to exist in eveas for capturing the macro onoff thing  i doubt ccps ability to do so considering its a fairly subtle manipulation
yus please
a good idea but imagine the amount of coding and extra db load to make this happen by giving everyone 7 wallets you are talking about adding over based on the q1 economic report 3 million new wallets to the game the overhead of all that is probably why ccp will never do it there are only about 40000 corps so thats a much more manageable number i support this but im not holding my breath that theyll ever do it
i like the idea
i like this idea also bcause we have such a high technology in eve and cant build ships that dont have a steady run of ammo system every halfbrained engineer would look for a steady going fire in a warshipi even would go further and make it possible to give the weapons a ammo mixture designed by players ie emp emp fusion emp  so u can use 2 ammotypes without reloading
the only problem i see is the potential to aquire a gtc with ingame isk but if you actually look at the gtc system you do not actually buy gametime you exchange isk for someone elses game time eve is stll and will always be a oneway money sinkthe only way to make money off eve is to sell isk to an isk selling site and thats illegal in the first place actually if this went down i think your macro farmers who sell isk wouldnt just be in violation of the eula they would be in violation of international money laundering laws whch would make them vulnerable to arrestwait a minutegive me gambling yesterday damnit i wanted it yesterday
forget gambling making it 18 all those exotic dancers
btw is it allowed to bump reasonable topics in csm forumsintention is to move this one back from page two to page oneif not sorry too late now
medals yeah thats a good ideaisk ships and items nah i dont like a meta aspect of a game giving you an advantage like that to be fairly honestgame time a week of gametime if your bug report results in a new defect being opened or resolves one i think thats quite reasonablestore credits seems like a good idea both from an incentives perspective and a business perspective i can support thati think this is a very good issue i will look to raise this as an issue as soon as possible is there more ideas for how it could be done i think the above ideas are quite good really but the more ideas we have the better chance ccp rolls with it
i agree personally on the meta rewards we all saw how that went over when ccp gave out faction fitted moms for getting a lot of referrals i just listed them as ideas for discussioncsm rep taking up my cause 4tw
the standings system is on the face of it a quick and easy way to tell friend from foe and mark other players in spacehowever it is too simple for the complexities of eve politics and has a number of major shortcomings that can range from inconveniencing and wasting players time to major friendly fire incidents and serious loss of ships and equipmenti would ask anyone who wishes ccp to seriously reexamine the system with a view to solving a range of problems to support this threadbelow are the three main areas of play where standings are a serious problem
editformattingor removal overviewthe states filer in overview has a series of check boxes which you use to indicate who you want to appear on overview with regard to standings unfortunately these check boxes work on the basis that every ship and wreck is on the overview by default when you unckeck a box any ship that fulfills that property is taken off overview even if it fulfills other checkboxes that are checkedso for example say i set a corp that i dont like to 10 that corp then declares war on my corp that corp has a pilot with ve sec status and a bounty on him and he warps to the gate i am atif i have no states bar the pilot is at war with your corpalliance checked then i will not see the enemy pilot on overview as far as overview is concerned i havent checked to see pilots with ve sec status and this pilot has ve sec status so despite setting overview to what i would logically assume to be correct to see war targets only i in fact will not see my war target until i add pilots with ve sec status horrible standings and bountiesthis means i effectively have to turn on every state check every box except what i dont want to see any of that usually boils down to only having pilot is in my fleetcorpalliacehas good standings turned offthe side effect is that pilots who im not at war with but who still have ve sec status or have bounties or have horrible standings show up or if i turn them off i run the risk of having war targets that dont show up on overviewthis somewhat defeats the point of the overview filters especially if im in high sec at war and start seeing other corps who i have ve standings with but am not at war with on my overviewthe reason for doing it in this manner is that it is efficient the client as soon as it gets a false against any one of the checks for that ship against your overview settings can say that ship will definitely not appear on overview and forget about it however it shouldnt be too much to ask that all ships be default to off overview and put on the overview when they satisfy just one of the check boxes
noninheritance of alliance standings to corp structuresthe problem is that in overviews and in local corps inherit their alliances standings whilst corp structures things like outposts and pos dontfor example say we have person a who has ve standings with an alliance b but not with a corp c where corp c is in alliance b now say that a pos owned by corp c is set to shoot everything that doesnt have ve standings not blue shoot it nbsi for shortperson a will now be shot at by the pos belonging to corp c despite the fact that corp c members see person a as blue their pos doesntthis is a bigger problem for alliances managing their outposts to prevent enemies from having safe haven in an alliances outposts they may set outposts so to deny docking to anyone with standings below a certain value or more commonly only let allies and those with ve standings dockhowever since corp structures such as outposts dont inherit alliance standings it means that every corp that owns an outpost has to maunally set their standings rather than just use alliance standings if an alliance has a lot of standings this represents duplicate work for corporations to each make their own standings list match that of the alliance and can take a very long time not to mention that the separate standings lists can mean inconsistencies occur over time as allies are dropped or new ones made and enemies come and gosome alliances get round this by having a single corp that manages all the outposts however this in itself has lots of problems aside from increasing the potential for spies to cause damage across all outposts an alliance owns rather than just a few by getting into the outpost holding corp it means that there is no pride or sense of achievement to individual corps who may have worked hard to build or conquer said outpost disadvantaging alliances who opt for corp level management of outposts rather than alliance wide ownership  operation schemesthe whole thing can be rather embarrasing when allies whove been brought in to fight for your side cant dock or access fittings and repair shop because there are no directors of the corp owning the outpost online and the outposts dont inherit alliance standings
standings slot limitcurrently there is a limit of 300 standings slots for each alliance whilst no problem for most combatitive alliances who operate the afforementioned nbsi system where most enemies will be neutral and not require a standings slot it can be a problem for those who run the alternative not red dont shoot nrds systemthe nature of the nrds system means that every enemy has to be set red and usually fast to avoid people not realising someone is hostile or an enemy until they are being attacked as the natural assumption is that a neutral is not hostile until proven otherwiseover the 5 years eve has been live many alliances running nrds have found that the number of reds they have aquired has more than exceeded the 300 standings slot limitthis causes problems as it means a lot of time has to be spent deciding which hostile corps are old and have disbanded or moved onto other areas and can have their standings slot freed up for some more immediate threat even though they are still hostiles  enemiesof course this is a problem if said enemies who have been some other part of the eve universe come back at which point it will not be immediately obvious that is to say the standings system then cant be relied on and so becomes less and less usefulmy own alliance have actually implemented a database of all hostiles over 800 and have to use a combination of alliance standings and an ingame front end ui to ascertain if others are friend or foethe issue is compounded by enemies who persistantly corp hop or who reside in npc corps and really require a personal red standingand the whole thing isnt helped by the fact that for the system to work everyone who is part of the system has to follow the same list of reds have the same standings that means duplicate standings changing for lots of corps and alliances not to mention the problems with outposts as detailed earlierthe point is 300 is no longer an arbitrarily high enough number that no one will ever reach it and players are already having to find work arounds to make their chosen legalstandings system work
incidentally this topic was raised at the last csm and i belive got a positive response from both forums and ccpnow we have a new csm council thought it a good idea to raise it again since it hasnt been actioned
me signs the third part of it whole heartedly
me signs all 3 ideas
i agree with this post and hope this issue will be addressed during this council term
agreed

give us more colors for the 100 through 100 standings spectrum allow corps to check a box use alliance standings for posstationsetc sometimes you dont want to use alliance standings and while i personally feel nrds is fail and theyre the only ones who have issues with the 300 limit go ahead and increase it why not
great little ships to have on youre side looks cool toothey require allot of skills to be able to fly well but comeon lets face it there just overpowerdfalcons are usually unable to be scouted thus leaving the fleetcommander clueless that his most important ships in his fleet will be put out of actionthis allready makes them far better than the other 3 races in terms of reconscouple this with the fact they jam at 200km makes them almost inpossibly to kill with a close range tanking fleetthey werent too much of an issue when everyone was nanoing fast around the place as they would be quickly tackled and put out of action  this is no moreas an fc id quite honestly say id rather a mothership decloaked ontop of us than a falcon uncloaked 200km awayas i said there excellent ships that require skill and skills to fly  however they just need to be taken inline with the other recons of its classrooks scorps and other jamming ships are not quite as nasty you usually kno what your going in for with these before a fightfalcons range bonus should be removed  or a similar nerf to that effecttho this is just myside of a storry  as a falcon pilot myselfwhat you guys thinkcrax mcgee
sorry falcons are not brokenthe rapier has been hamstrung but it is still not broken the pilgrim has recieved a massive viability boost and the lachesis is pain on steroidsif you cant deal with the enemy falcons bring your own or fit eccm works rather well even against max skilled falcon pilots or even gasp projected eccm that works even better
would you like cheese with your whine o this is too biased i think you should rethink your proposal
no sir i dont like it
i wholeheartedly agree this thread is terriblebut zany selfreferential trolling aside this board is an official voting forum and is all too frequently cluttered up with worthless drivel its in serious need of more attentive moderation old issue threads that have been voted on need to be moved to some sort of archive troll threads need to be locked voting needs to be separated from discussion threads currently on csm agendas need some glueand im sure a whole host of other things that have been asked for again and again and im putting my thumb up for them again
agreed
i agree this thread is pointless and therefore there is no reason to support it
how about burn the slaves and free the drugs instead
alternatively use the cosmos agents which are currently used for handing in pirate tags eg hand over slaves to republic agents for standings increase
i say we should be able to use those slaves and make them work for their freedom by decreasing shipmodule build times and then we can use the drugs at the raves we will have when wis is released cheers
why do they invite the csm to island right after the election and not at the end of the working periodwouldnt the csm be better prepaired they have what now a month there are holidays in between to get all the proposals together and worked outim not sure thats the best way any clarification on this
mainly so that the csm can get to know each other its just like how many high schools here in denmark take all the new students out for a trip somewhere to kinda throw them togetherit makes for a relationship in the long run imo
well is pretty the same like in every job they present you the workin group so u can know them and have a good start or something like thatmeet the new baby hamsters lol
well if thats the only reason i think its not a good enough oneyou have to ask yourself what you want from the rlmeeting in iceland are you going there just to meet and have a good time getting to know eachother or are you there to work propose ideas discuss concepts with the devs in detailif its the latter then a meeting at the end of the working period would be more apropriate in my opinionsure to be fair 2 meetings would be needed one at the beginning and end of each period but as thats not possible i would choose one at the end
last time we came up with a fine list of issues and we had some very good discussionswhatever seem to be the issue i sure cant see it you seem to make assumptions that in 12 months the csm cant produce any worthwhile issues that justifies going to iceland i beg to differ entirely
well its your 2nd time now in csm right tell me there was no progression in the group during this 6 months in how they work together resolve issues compromise there is your differenceat the end of such a working period of 6 months i just think taking from my experience that the group would do better in front of the devs presenting themselves and the issues as onebut ok its just my opinion and it will change nothing so i will let it go i just wanted to know if there was a reason but there seems to be none
i didnt really think about this 2 well cd
youre an idiot
this is not secondlife yet go out and earn your isk like everyone else
this idea is horrible like the us bailout plans
wthare you insane
i think you need to share whatever it is you are smoking with the rest of us pretty please with a cherry on top
yes plz

it has already been said by a dev in a thread that it is coming back and if you would have played on sisi you would know that the monitor is working there
one major content expansion to eveonlinestill no such thing as a drone implanthmmmmmmmmno release of faction drones except for the gal type even thought the region was opened up about 2 years agono faction ship with a drone based weapons systemonly 3 modules that affect drones and even those have no t2 versionsas has been stated before maybe ccp really does hate drones
clickythought it was a good idea and should be brought here to catch a dev attention
why should falcons be changed what evidence do you have to support the assertion that there is in fact a falcon problem why are falcons overpowered but rooks arent considering they both have the same ecm characteristicsfurthermore this is a perfect example of how not to write up a csm proposal
falcons are balanced very well leave them beat best they can solo an industrial their role is support and they fill that role well there is no need to dumb them down just to suit folks unable to deal with them flown by enemiesoh well you can hire your own falcon pilotor heck even a blackbird i had one bb pilot actually jam my max skilled falcon three times in a single engagement and then again in a subsequent engagement needless to say i was duely impressed unfortunately that bb was the only ship that survived on his side despite my inability to jam his fleet
100 chance to disable 1 hac with 1 module on falcon is fine then   dampener should set your lock range to 1km then tracking distruptor should vut yyoutr optima land fall of by 99 target painter should increse sig by 1000000xweb should reduce speed to 0  to make all ewar even in campare of ecm
sounds like you got real unlucky also if you make those changes make ecm work 100 of the time and then itll be balancedtry not to exaggerate when you make claims
its exactly because they have the same ecm characteristics that they are a problem one can cloak and the other cannot but they both have the exact same utility as a ship otherwiseif i took a zealot gave it another high slot and gave it a cloak bonus and called it a justicar it would be impossible to say that this was balanced with the zealotgiven that the falcon can cloak and warp cloaked it must pay for this ability in some way in order to be balanced it does not therefore is not balancedgranted the other thing you could do would be to buff the rookscorpion and blackbird but i do not think that is a good idea
the rapier and the huginn share the exact same ewar bonuses is the rapier overpowered because it can warp cloakedindeed it would be impossible luckily the falcon has fewer high slots and loses out on a damage bonus for the cloak bonus in this hypothetical example would a cloaking zealot that loses a bonus and has fewer turrets than the regular zealot be balanceableit loses out on a high slot three launcher hardpoints and a damage bonusit does you just dont think its enough given that three of the four sets of racial recons share the same bonuses for their racial ewar between the force and combat recons why is the falcon the only one which is overpowerednote that i have no characters which can fly falcons and i dont necessarily believe the current state of affairs is acceptable but in order for me to support a nerf you will have to come up with a stronger case
it pays for that ability in the fact that it has low hp and most pilots fit ewarsensor boosters in their mids which means there is no room for a boosterpassive or active hardeners it also pays by requiring high skills to fly it to max effectiveness caldari recons are very specialized at what they do and they do it well you dont see anyone getting solo kills in a falconrookrecons as a whole are very balanced if you dont like falcons fit sensor boosters or have a falcon in your gang to jam the falcon simple if that does not work sniper ships could possibly solve this issue as i hear a rohk can swing out to 200 km where most falcons sit i cant even fly a falcon
they are not nearly the same the rapier and huginn have secondary characteristics which are actually importantdamagethat being said huginns are generally considered to be inferior to rapiers for this reason saying that damage is important on a falcon or rook is ignorant and laughable saying it is important on a huginn or lachesis is less so
you cannot do this if you want to have a balanced system the system that you designed after the scripting changes has excluded any type of bonus increasing solution from working even small tweaks to the boost bonus on your celestis hulls will break rsds in the other way by making them too strong you need to fundamentally look at what you screwed up in the formula and fix itegcurrently you can get 67531 damps on a damping ship with all bonuses if you change the bonus on the celestis hull from 5 to 6 you go from 67531 top damp to 70221 this is a 10 increase in dampingif you change the bonus from 5 to 75 you take your top damp from 67531 to 74273 which is a 26 increase in damping strengthbut wait it gets worse if you dont have an eos with you and you arent rigged you go from 5313 to 58433 when you have max skills which is a trivial amountyou have set up a system where any bonus that you apply to the ship which is not pitiful when you have max skills but no rigs or an eos to be ridiculously overpowered when you do in order to make using a celestis hull a strong ewar platform without rigs and an eos you would have to change the bonus from 5 to 10 but doing so when you had an eos and were rigged would take your final damp to 81 per damp a number which had previously been deemed unacceptable the situation gets even worse when youre dealing with people who do not have maxed skills because each and every bonus over the last gets progressively stronger and its only possible for 2 or 3 of the bonuses to come from module type attributes which means that stacking penalties simply will not have much of an effectyou have to change the way that the bonuses stack with each other in order to get back to your solution i wrote a bit about it hereread it and dont do ed things
arrg it didnt use my default character that is me
i agree that gal ewar needs a major look at it
this issue has already been accepted by the csm and is being looked at i posted this because i do not feel that the answer that ccp gave gave any indication that either side really knew what was going on
well the stupid solution would be to buff the bonus to 10125 and then nerf the eos into the ground that would be completely stupid of course but considering the eos isnt that popular right now im almost of the opinion that they should do that just so that thered be some useful damp boats at all they could later just scrap information warfare alltogether and come up with something better
i would really like it if they changed bonus calculation back to how it was and then put info links back up to 25such a unbonused ship would perform similarly to a bonused ship if they were flying with an eos
yeah supported poss need a lot of updates and changes to them and this would be a nice one to add

the easiest way to solve this is to redo the making of a war dec mutual mechanic i think when you make a wardec mutual the war should last forever unless one side asks to surrender and the other side acceptsthat way when you war dec there is always a risk the otherside make it mutual and you find you are unable to back out until they let youcurrently the only consequence to war deccing a corp is the loss of 1mil isk which is hardly anything to most players especially if you just use alts for your war dec grief corp and have your mission running main safely tucked away in a friendly corner of 00 or in npc corp missioning awayedit apparently it is 2mil isk now to wardec according to one of the above posters
1 if you read hte post it says in a gank fit a gank moros easily puts out 6000 dps that isnt a practical posshooting fit but it is about the maximal you can get out of it at lowcost 3x ss mfs seige ions dread 5 cap gun 5 if that is possible which it is right now on tq and your ship does ten times that which it does it can get 60k dps and you beleive thats balanced2 sorry to be rude but are you having a laugh or just being malicious when you post misleading and wrong numbers there are no gunnery skills included in your numbersadd 10 for gunnery 5 25 for cap gun 5 20 for rapid firing 5 and 15 for surgical strikethen you misquote the highest damage ammo which does 1104 damage not 96 and assume that people with seveneight lowslots to play with will fit 0 damage modsits absurd that you have the barefaced cheek to accuse me of failing math by the way maths is a plural but i dont suggest you go retake english class when youre deliberately misleading what your crazy ship can dobe honest your ship is capable of doing the dps of at least ten dreadnaughts when combined with the ability to seige twice as fast it means three of them thats right three pilots could do the job of sixty dreads in getting all the towers in a system reinforced incredibly quickly plus they tank harder which combined with 5 minute seige means in a carrier blob theyre almost unkillable
moved to features  ideas
if you wish to make the clam of dps out put i will ask you to please submit accurate mathematical equations to prove your theory in this calmed area of dps small technicality what i should have said was high damage t1 ammo i ask you again to please take the time to prove me wrong with detailed mathematical equations of how you think this ship is doing what you say it dose other wise you have no foundation to make these accusations i fixed the spelling for you and then i ask you how you can assert that the flagship class dreadnought can do 10 times the dps with what ive asked for 3 times in this post further more i want to know now by your account a flag ship that supposedly dose 10 times the dps of a dread times 3 ships dose the job of dreads i may not be the best at english but i can do 3 times 10 next
1 no youre doing it wrong you have managed to do 3 times ten but forgotten to divide it by 05 seeing as your flagship does siege cycles twice as fast as well as doing 10x the dpssixty dreads  two groups of 30 going around killing poses every ten minutes minimum time  1 siege cycle assume a group of 30 equivalent to the three flagships i stated can single cycle a towersay you have ten towers in a system thirty dreads can kill them in 100 minutes if a flagship is ten dreads and it does five minute cycles three of them can in 50 minutes do all ten poses that is twice as fast as the 30 dreads  or as fast as sixty doing two towers at a time ie 3 of your ships  sixty dreads at tower killing 5 minute cycles  double the amount of dreads needed to keep up this isnt difficult2 mathsi got a quote of 6000 from eft but i can easily do the same right here from scratchwith max skills on a revelation fitted with 3 navy heat sinks quite cheap a dual giga pulse has a damage mod of 121 and a rof of 48s121725 877 an increase of 625 on 100 base877  1104 navyblood mf xl available on jita market  9684  3 guns  29054 damage  48 rof  6053 raw dps oh and plus 300 from 5 t2 gardes or ogres none of this is a crazy fitting the giga pulses actually have an optimal of 25k which means if you want you can hug the shield and hit a tower with these guns easily of course if you expect enemy action fitting longerranged guns and sitting back a bit might be a better idea but the option is there the rev can do more than 6000 dpsyour amarr flagship6053  125 remove revelation bonus  4825  625 add flagship damage bonus level 5  30265 thirty thousand two hundred and sixty five dps and thats with three guns your flagship has six giving a grand total of 60530 dps at a usable optimal with 4 remaining lows a resist bonus 3 rigs and a seige mod for tank  in this gank fit you can go tankier if you want ofcthese are all accurate numbers as far as i am aware certainly the eft numbers for damage mod and rof for my moros match those exactly given in game i see no reason why the ones for a revelation quoted above would be any different
actually i dont have to  its great that we can finally settle the part where you agree that the above imaginery ship is doing 10 times the damage of its dread counterpart well it would be awesome if you would start to use damage mods maybe faction ammo and gosh more gunnery skills than just mothernaught v in your calculation i agree too lazy to do the math homework in detail but adding skills and damage mods i get a duration of 48 damage mod 1115 damage mod times three per gun so 3345 and using a 105 damage faction crystal which throws your numbers off by the factor of about 456k dps is thus achieved 6k may be if you go higher faction crystals or more faction heat sinks
well seeing as you have posted what it would take to get that kind of dps out of this proposed ship type then i will concede that it is possible to get 6000dps out of a maxed skilled faction fitted dread with faction ammoi will say on the other hand that i could not see a fleet commander ever letting there dreads fit to get that kind of range but as ive said as you have now pointed outit is possible to get 6000 raw dpsnow i will shift the argument that you are making that 3 flag ships would be able to siege a hole system 2 times faster then 30 dreads could and with 3 flag ships doing short range max skilled damage you could rf not kill a large tower in 5mins and then move onto the next towernow the question we need to ask our selfs is would we rather have 3 super dreads or 60 other dreadshes another way to look at it do we want more capitals or less capitals also when it comes to risk vs reward 10 dreads is worth 1619bils with fits and all that good stuff thats how much i want these ship class to cost so theres no more or less isk going into your investment then with a fleet of 30 dreads and dont start telling me that they would never die and they cant be killed it would be a massive risk to use these ships but maybe with these kind of bonus we would see people using them mother ships and titans can be killed and massive isk loss and so would these ships so that can be used as a argument against this propsal
fewer capitals incidentally this proposal is antithetical to that ideal the only thing this proposal will introduce is a new class of capital or supercapital as the case may be you will end up with a handful of people in a fleet with theseand everyone else who can fly a dread in a regular dreadnought this is because there is no reason not to bring more if three mothernoughts can rf a large faction tower in 5 minutes three mothernoughts and a fleet of regular dreads will reinforce it in less than 5 minutesthe only thing you are contributing to by introducing a capital that is better is the proliferation of said capitalscoincidentally i cant help but notice that massive morsus mihi underneath your name every time you try to resurrect this terrible topic it makes me wonder if perhaps there isnt some sort of ulterior motive behind these requests of course im sure you are completely impartial and the massive benefits one of these would provide to an alliance defending its territory are not in any way an incentive to continue making posts about it
so ether way with or with out this ship in the game there will still be massive capital blobs and introducing this ship would do nothing to hurt or help the current situation the only other thing it would do is make a large target with a 20bill kill mail waiting to happen why is that a bad thing again wouldnt you like to kill one of thesewith proliferation of said ship there comes mineral use and more isk to miners and drone ratters driving mineral cost up which is good for the none capital player or all players of that baseyes i am a member of that alliance and this is a terrible topic with all people have to say is negative things likecorrection we are no longer under attack from bob please read here for further information about bobs full withdraw from there max campaign but as you said this topic has nothing to do with that and this would be an offensive ship cant really see how you would defend with this type of ship good defense is a good offensebtw i have always loved you sig dianeces no matter what may be above it
no it wont be a case of 3 mothernuaughts or sixty dreads those pilots wont go away it would be 3 mothernaughts and 57 carriers ready to rep them as soon as they drop out of seige if theyre fired upon its just senseless capital proliferation without any downside except cost and as weve seen with titan proliferation thats hardly a downside to anyone who actually uses capital ships
alright so im now left wondering that every one in this thread would like to see titans and moms and hell for that matter all capital ships removed from that game that is a really sad thought because even with the short amount of time i get to us caps i love them to death now maybe i can spin this another way if not to build a whole new super mothernought then why not take this and glue it to a titan would you guys rather see a dd or a super tower killerand please dont go on about how you all hate caps so much thats all i hear in the back of my head when i read your arguments and if you must i really want you to explain in detail why you all hate caps so much and saying that to many people have to many and its not fare to younger player base is not a argument this game has been based on how fast you can skill up and build for the biggest pew pew ship with the highest stats and dps and then go kill something at least thats what ccp has been doing look at the speed nerf this is the game we play and caps are hear to stay now just because you all could never afford this ship or would never fly it even if you could is no reason to shoot it down its a dam good idea and ill be honest i do not want to fly a titan but its were im heading because i cant see any reason to fly a motnership i would rather sit in space in my mothernought for the rest of my eve playing career then in a titan unless these things are added to the titan when the dd gets taken away
so basically you want to deal concentrated dddamounts of damage the dreadnaughts have siege modules and a 5 damage mod per level iirc125and half the cycle timeand supercap so immune to ecmwhy not just put siege modules on titans then
this is brilliant you start by putting words in everyone elses mouths all i hear when you say x is y then you challenge everyone to defend their viewpoint on y its genius if i were to say all i hear when you post is how much you like to murder children try and defend that horrible viewpoint you freak it wouldnt exactly go down very wellif you want an honest answer to your daft question  nobody here proposed removing capital ships from the game however plenty of people myself included think having the biggest capital fleet should not be the qualifier for dominating the alliance scene but great tactics using a rounded balance of all ship sizes and classes a maxedout veteran player like myself should have a reason to choose flying a frigate or dictor just as much as a carrier wheras if i was currently involved in the alliance endgame i really would have to spend a lot of time in a dread its not that bad though  there is a need for bs fleets and support at the moment but moving further towards capships online is a bad bad idea titans and motherships in their original form were the perfect examples of this  barely any counters obsoleting smaller ships and basically stupid for game balance proposing a new level of super dreads above dreadnaughts is just essentially an isk sink for the biggest alliances so they can dominate anyone who hasnt bothered or is slightly poorer for six to twelve months until everyone has the same and then wed be ready for you to propose supertitanmothernaughts with 8 turrets and 250 bonus per level why is it a damn good idea what does it add to the game apart from a really huge ship with guns which sounds fun except there already is that the dreadnaught even if there is actually a reason for it which there isnt how is it balanced its not just that its better than a dread in every way  so is a mothership to a carrier but not by a factor of ten the mom does 2x the no of fighters which is the secondary function of ac arrier  the primary ie the remote repping is just the same this means that mom proliferation isnt insane because you dont need them to compete  carriers will in general do and you need lots so carriers make sense this proposed ship does ten times the gun damage which is the primary function of dreads theres no reason not to fly it
cough cough in the line of what i expected1st csm turnout 11082nd csm turnout 861 2229conclusion most players are either not interested or consider csm irrelevant
you can actually posit quite a few conclusions from that all of which would be reaching as you have no idea why people dont vote by no means am i insinuating that people are indeed engaged really but merely pointing out that the conclusion youve come to is not one you could have reasonably reached its stated as fact with no basis
since everyone who voted in the election is using the internet and eveonlines forums a straight up online forum poll system would be a better representation of the playerbasean ingame poll would be ideal or combination of forum poll ingame poll and newsletter poll by account of coursei am always sceptical of putting people into unnecessary positions of authority review of the first csms early sessions is a prime example of power abuse kicking people from a chat channel resubmitting the same issues in a different wrapper uneven time investment in issue discussionand consider all of the technical challenges that exist for managing issues their status and their importance its a full time job dont misunderstand im not advocating csm by saying its a full time job csm being a full time job is exactly why players shouldnt be performing the duty this effects who is willing to participate in the csm and lets face it the leftovers from the first csm that made it into the second csm are either attention primadonnas view it as an internship for ccp or comboand it sucks cause you only get to vote for candidates id much rather they have screw the csm vote for player polling option to vote for buuut instead i had to vote for a representative and he didnt make it so i have no representation but to post my opinion and hope that these asshats respect or care despite my not liking them cause i sure as hell wont be kissing any assfayke edit internally handled polls are also better cause you can crossreference the players relevance to the questionsay you have a question dealing with alliance management and you have 3000 opinions to view well itd be useful to find the relevance of the opinion is this player currently affected by or has ever previously been effected by alliance management does he have the skills to potentially be effected by alliance management oh only 10 of those voters have any experience with it lets filter out the other 90 and see what the relevant votes and points are aboutand then you pay an unbiased analyst to read the forums and collect the coherent and well presented arguments find interesting statistics in the poll voting and present the findings ccp
22 is a fact which is a direct consequence of people not voting and since this voting takes place by net over many days you cant refer to attendancy issues either players dont vote either because they are not interested for a wide range of reasons
people dont vote for all kinds of reason and yes most of those reasons we can ignore but your still faulty in presenting only 2 conclusions as to why they didnt vote you either unaware or deliberatly ignoring an obvious 3rd conclusion they are simple confused about what they are voting for in those circumstances the natural action is inaction i think a very strong argument can be made that ccp and the csm have not done enough to educate the majority of the player base who dont haunt the forum boards who dont go to the eve website and who simply log on and play a gamethen there is the 4th conclusion and i think youll find that most people dont vote b ecause of this they dont see the need for the csm or anything similar to it that could replace it many many people work on the adage if it aint broke dont fix it and i strongly suspect that for the silent majority of nonforum going memebers of the playerbase they are perfectly happy with the way is run and the direction it is going inthat is not to say they are correct or incorrect its just their opinion as your is yours and mine is mine
i capiscid the first time you wrote the exact same thing nothing about the content of my post has been altered by your restatement of the same the poster above me has quite clearly laid out 2 further possibilities and there are yet more beyond that you are still reaching and are still not in a position to come to the conclusions you have i can only assume youre making these attributions in cause for dramatic effect
i voted but to be blunt im cynical about the effect the csm is able to have for one simple reason skill queueinguniversally popular amongst players supported by every member of the first csm and not every member of the second item one on the agenda of the first meeting in iceland there will never be another requested feature with so much community supportunderstand im not cynical because the feature wasnt implemented im cynical because ccp were not moved to talk about the issue there was no feedback no discussion no response for the entire term of the first csmi dont expect ccp to implement or even want to implement every change requested by the csm but at a minimum i would hope that the csm had the ability to throw a spotlight on an issue and have ccp take it seriously as a result i dont believe thats been the case so far
as long as there are enough people giving them money ccp can do anything they wantthey openly taunt joke about their players complaining on the forums and its easy enough to play the cool rockstar dev that doesnt care as long as people are payingwhen eve gets competition if eve gets competition theyll have to step their game up and listen to their customers cause income wont be guaranteed then
i do not support skill queuing depending on how it gets implemented if it does ccp did have a discussion with the csm regarding this the results of which are off the record they did listen however and a dialogue was had sorry to burst your bubble
what the happy little world in which it seemed like ccp blew you off if they took the issue seriously and talked about it thats a good thing an off the record discussions better than no discusison at allmy cynicism is based on whats on the record which is kind of all i have to go on  if youre discussing the major stuff behind closed doors then people like me are going to continue to get the impression that youre being ignored since we dont get to hear about the stuff you dont talk about
i understand implicitly dude and i apologize for coming across as snide i have the memory of a goldfish and had assumed this information had been presented somewhere assume that any of the items that have been voted yes by the council have been discussed with ccp if you havent gotten a result then theres a reason for it either its still being hashed out off the record or its been pushed off to the second council
so much for transparency
the lad has a point i mean i think most of us can understand that some conversations with ccp may have to be off the record for buisness reasons but at least tell us when your having the discussion and a broad reason why it has to be off the record
it seems that immediately after the election results were announced the goons war deced my alliance not sure how much fun the hundred or so care bears that make up beep are going to be to fight seems pretty pettysighissler

u mad no relation to darius johnson tbone johnson 2nd best johnsonalso why do you sign your posts we can see your name to the left
buy american for gods sake
well you see good sir we are members of great comedy and for some reason you being wardeced has already applied this though the post you have made here 
so as a recently elected csm member what do you plan on doing about it
goons
oh nooos goons
might i suggest teaming up with bob for the goal of total goonie destruction
this must be some form of mistake i will have heads on a platter when next i convene my supreme council
war eternal and glorious
sorry but once we realized honda had spread this far into space this was our only option to save general motors and ford from needing some sort of huge space bailout

maximum killdeath ratioplease visit your user settings to reenable images
as a ceo i plan to do what we do everytime we are war deced try not to do anything stupid fight when we can and mostly know it will pass in timeissler
in other words hide in a station and encourage your members to play something else in the meantime while there is hostiles in the area
ah so thats why two of the csm are in npc corps
in other words sitting in the station docked the whole time while smacking your campers in local and making whine threads on eveo about how unfair the wardec mechanism is
expected nothing elsesad to see proven that a group is as intelligent as its dumbest membertsuki
goons were gonna dec cva when i got more votes than darius in the last election but they were too scaredtrue story
i would be scared as well tbfh
cva actually paid us 2b isk not to dec them perhaps theres a lesson to be learned here
yes wardecs are dumb
no im not whining about the realities of eve we arent encouraging members to play other games as for camping in stations not planning any of that eitherid be curious to understand the position of the goon member darious recently elected to the csm as to whether this is how you start out to create a harmonious csmissler
seriously dont start blurring ingame and out of game actionsits kinda ridiculous to assume that people who have ingame wardislikes cannot work together on the csm hell even jade and i didnt kill each other if you really feel that goons deccing you is gonna affect your judgement on the csm then perhaps you shouldnt have stood
a war dec issued inside game on the day the csm results are announced by ccp out of game is not a blurring of inout of game actions oh i forgot this is just a silly coincidence my apologiesmy official congratulations issler
i dont see csm as out of game since the whole point of the csm is what eve is in gamethis wont affect my csm performance more likely to give it a greatrt focus reminding me of what so many small corporations face every dayissler
every day they log into eve online as long as theyre playing the game they are subject to the harsh realities contained within this is as it should be
ok so clearly you are all for the war dec would you at least admit that this was a result of the csm electionissler
im all for every war dec why should it have anything to do with the csm election ill have to take this up in the council of elders but i believe ill find that it has more to do with your alliance name than anything else
there is no reason that our alliance would be in a conflict with the goons we arent even active in the same areas there have been no acts of aggression and there is no history of bad blood heck tada o was once a part of the goons and left in good standingthis is directly related to the csm elections i dont know if it was vindictive or an attempt at extortion but either way it will failissler
you will give me your votes or i will call forth a mighty space army
big strong wow war
looking forward to sum good fights  pew pew
cant wait to kill you guys thanks for the opp i guess you guys take the opposition party thing pretty literally
i know at other mmo developer studios the gms are not allowed to play a leadership role in guilds or alliances i think that makes a lot of since as far as playing it safe is concerned remember eq when certain gms were found to be guild masters those guilds were automatically suspected of having an unfair advantage knowing all of the secrets behind the scenes knowledge and how can you prove you havent lead your guild based on insider knowledgeoh and grats darius
what are your opinions on the state of sov warfare and does moon mining need to be revisited againits a harder to draw a line like that in eve since several aspects of the game are closed off depending on how trusted you are in something like eq a guild can be transparent from top to bottom because there are no highvalue loose assets no dirty secrets no logistics no micromanagement just to keep the water running etcthat doesnt really change the damage that internal misconduct can cause either you certainly dont need to have a leadership role to spawn items abuse glitches provide intel etcas a contrast guild wars is completely transparent about developer membership in the game the only restriction is automatic disqualification from events there isnt really anything wrong with transparency the problem is misconduct and not restricting the ways of perpetrating it
congratz on your second term
glad to see you elected and you did even better than last time hope you will be able to help push this game towards more of your stated goals
congratulations ank my alt  voted for you cause your a real girl i kid i kid good job last season good luck next season

the result is that i didnt win but i will keep this promise
congratz mr chairman is good to have vets sharing same passion as voices in the council
congratulations vuk i did not vote for you btw on the basis of your statement about 00 being the endgame while it is an endgame possibility it is not for everyone i had been a 00 denizen from early on in my eve career and while i had a great time there the hassle involved in staying there is too much for a casual player like myself whos wife and kids are nowhere near as understanding as yours all the problems you mentioned about 00 are true and they do need work and the attention of ccpi hope as chairman when guiding these issues please keep in mind those of us who pretty much have had it with 00 as a home and still like to enjoy the other things the eve has to offer faction warfare has promise for example but its prenere has made most people say whats the point ccp views it a a stepping stone to 00 whereas i see it a break from 00 more combat unitl recently less hassle good luck
thanks shayne and thanks to everybody who voted for me im extremely surprised that i managed to get that many votes this time it made me extremely happy
grats mateits good to see you get back in for a 2nd termgoing for el presidante this time

im a nobody forum  in a 10man corp and i got just about 300 votes and respect from a lot of people who actually won of course thats still a loss but its a loss i can build on on top of that im a political geek whod run to catch a bus i think its safe to say ill be around next time unless rl throws a serious curveball

signing in support of name changesthere must be some way to balance it so that you can change your name without letting scammers and can flippers hidemaybe make it a one time one shot deal for people who really want it changed
increase the cost each time you do it
i like the idea of the the two types of special ammo t2 or faction having extra effects on targetas in conflag emits an emp burst which slightly hinders cap recharge on target or something like thatkinetic ammos might cause a small amount of damage to automatically bleed down to the next protective layerhail might damage target speed or somethingvoid could add heat damage to target modules
imo all faction ammo should be removed from the lp stores and the penalties removed from t2 ammo all the penalties no more tracking cap speed etcand t2 ammo needs to be head and shoulders above t1 it has been nerfed so many times that its now useless and t1 equipped ships are now able to come very close to t2 performance without the massive skillpoint investment of t2 modulesfaction ammo needs to be very good and very rare why not change all those t1 loot drops to some racial faction ammo make gallente navy bss drop a few thousand fed navy antimatter l rounds every once in a while make faction ammo more common than it used to be three years ago but not what it is nowcurrent price for fed navy am l is 900 iskunit 10k units at that price void is offered at 200 iskunit and 5k units at that price either way the faction ammo is so cheap theres no reason not to use it hell my gun repair costs are usually way more than my ammo costs or what i make in loot these days when i have to overheat my guns to break some stupid triple rep rigged exile booster overheated dominix tank
signed
just double or triple the lp  isk cost for faction ammo in the lp storesand then remove the pointless nerfs on some of the t2 ammos some t2 ammo has a nerf that doesnt affect the ammo much at all barrage for example affects tracking but it is long range ammo where tracking counts for considerably less than short hail shouldve been tracking nerfed like void
great idea i support it will talk to ankh and bunyip both of them fellow csms nowbumping your own thread is uncool tho ask your friends to do it for you
i like this idea
there are lots of faction ships of all sizes but no faction based drone shipdrones only have 3 modules sub capital 4 counting the capital module that affect droneswhile there are a lot of different types of drones most ships can use them as effectively as dedicated drone shipsand all the different variations of drones webber sd energy neut ect have such severe stacking penalties that using them is a waste ecm drones are the only exception to this rule and every ship including caldari can use them as effectively as any dedicated drone boat more so in that they use drones to supplement their normal weapons system while dedicated drone ships have to sacrifice damage to gain utilitythere are implants for almost everything from bpo research to exploration and of course the dozens for each weapons system but not one for drones and while ccp has actually acknowledged this and said they will do something about it someday it just doesnt seem to be happeningthe drone regions were created and faction drones were promised but only the gal version have been released they are rare as hens teeth cost an arm and a leg in rare components to make where are the min amarr and cal faction versionsoverall drones are not high on the priority list but when was the last time they got real lovingwhere are the drone ships that enhance something other then damage shield and armor maybe a bonus to webber drone str sensor dampening or energy neut str lower sig radius something to make a dedicated drone ship want to use anything other then damage drones yet not one faction ship for dronerswhere are the implants to better control drones better tracking lower sig radius greater control range or even as mentioned above something to make the use of noncombat drones an option outside ecmswhere are the modules the enhance drone use allowing your drones to slowly regen armor to use noncombat drones better somethingpersonally i would love to see something done to expand the role of dedicated drone ships and i understand that by adding to general drone effectiveness you really give a boost to all ships using drones but ignoring them is not the way to gothey are the only weapons system that can be destroyed crying cause you have to change your fit to actually combat drones is really not worth crying about drone ships are not all powerful as to use noncombat drones we have to give up damagecould some attention be paid to this weapons systemcould some promises be kept about releasing the rest of the faction droneshow about differant bonuses to dedicated drone ships outside of a bonus to damage shield and armor or their droneshow about some implants for drone use seeing as how most weapons systems have 38 dedicated to themwhat about a faction ship or two based around drones and their usehow about restrict some types of drones to being used by only dedicated drone boatsor just tell us you want them to be support systems only and some of us who are dedicated to our drones can start down and differant trainging pathas it stands now there are many of us training our drone skills in hopes that someday you might show them lovestupid i know given that drones are the least developed system in the game and yet the easiest to diablethank you for your time

sorry hit the enter typing the title and posted a blanksupported
signeddrones in general need to be looked at and especially drone ships vexordomi etc while they are pretty good at their role they are not true dedicated drone ships i see a dedicated drone ship have minimalzero turret slots instead replaced by utility slots and a biggerbetter drone bonus for the skillsa few other things worth mentioning thats relevant here first off no t2 drone modules every other weapon system has t2 stuff so why not drones coming straight from point one faction drone modules shadow serpentis and gallente navy drone modules from faction spawnslp store mentioned before no drone implants at all although ccp highlighted they are possibly thinking about making some  check this link for more info and put your ideas forward improved and augmented drones plain rubbish only the gallente drones are available extremely difficult to get and overall not worth it over normal t2 drones how about empire faction drones with slight damagehpetc buff from lp store maxe xrun bpc perhaps make the improved and augmented more powerful than what they are now if they are to be kept that rare  so long as other races ones come out otherwise make them more available direct drone damage modules we have ones that improve drone control range speed and tracking but no damage how about a low slot module like mag stabs bcus etc that increase all drones damage faction variants would be good here too better drone rigs mainly drone damage rigs that arent sentry damage rigs fighters in general only 2 skills 1 if you dont have gallente carrier with thanatos and 1 module that affects these can we get more modules for them make the other drone skills useful to fighters t2 fighters the list goes ononce tech3 comes out i really really hope we can make ourselves a proper dedicated drone ship with for example bonuses to just drone stuff if we want to eg gallente battleship bonus  same as dominix drone bonus and whatever skill to fly t3 ship either the same bonus or things like better hpspeed etc of course i would love to have a dedicated ship with a monster drone damage bonus minimoros anyone  while foregoing guns etcthat is all
im not a heavy drone user but i agree 100  drones seem to have been forgotten but they are effective weapon systemsyes the faction drones need to have a higher concentration of drops for all 4 racial typesyes there needs to be at least one faction drone boat granted no npc uses drones but

big fat signednot to derail the thread or anything but can we make sure any awesome new drone ships dont use the dominix model its quite possibly the worst in eve
i am mainly a missile user but i do love my t2 mediums 
agreed
in light of the recent qr changes to missiles the only reasonable solution i can really come up with for making the raven caracal and cerberus and probably the faction variants more balanced is to remove 1 turret high slot and add 1 midslot this would allow them to still fit the same amout of missiles but they would lose 1 high slot that would be used for something else and adds 1 midslot that could be used for a web or target painteri am not suggesting this for either the drake or the marauder because they would be over powered with themthe raven already has 2 high slots that are different to its primary weapon which is missiles compared with the mega which has only 1leave the current missile changes in place no one can complain that we wouldnt be giving anything up for an extra midslot it would also mean one less slot for a raven to have a cloak put in so a raven cloaker would be sacrificing more to fit that cloaki know im going to probably get hate posts but it is really the only alternative that i can think of that will give something up for something in return and would be taking something away from raven and cerb mission pilots while giving something to pvp pilotsi would also like to sugest a change to reduce power grid or cpu and perhaps a reduction bonus for a target painter as that is more in line with missiles which would only allow a painter to be fitted to the midslots with the current shield tanking ability instead of a shield web scrambler or other modthere may be other missile ships that need it flame away
get the missles back to what they weresome s at ccp needs to get fired for this stupid nerfsome people do use missles for pvp
not signed  i was smacking the snot out of an amarr bc today with my raven and torps he had to flee after my second volley hit him as he was nearly out of armorcan you say target painter learn to adapt please  oh and t2 drones do a fine job on cruisers
considering that i do missions 90 of the time thankx to my lack of time and ability to coordinate real fights with my teammates i have a job and school i would love to have my cruise missiles work like they used toofix it
the missile change is awesomethe free meal ticket is gone now all you ravennoobs out thereim going to go kill more ravens with a pair of assault frigates now
signedplease fix this along with some other things that make absolutely no sense in this quantum fail expansion
they need to be tweaked a bit more
are yopu for real 2 years into missiles rightclick train are u serious look at the heading of this thread it has against missile nerf for a reason if you support the missile nerf be quiet and post your support under a suitably named thread thank you
people will whine favoritism once more or simply whine about not being able to join eventsor simply try to kill them in order to grief the event from happeningits still a cool idea and it should be aimed at rpg community to help them with their immersion

a a person who has experience gming i can undertsand the need for some events to fall outside the player areas in order to advance a needed plot element in a specific direction however at the same time this mut be balanced with player interaction in order to keep the players involved in a living story ccp really does need to bring some of these news stories to life
signed to an excellently prepared proposalback in these times i was young  and followed events on the news only 
supporting this very much we need real events in eve that shake the playerbase to its core
cooland so what i saythats actually all part and parcel of the whole thing and simply adds to the experiencesome are happy some are not as long as it isnt the same ones everytime  which is definatly doableccp just needs to somehow find the guts they used to have to deal with the whines and what not or rather ignore as most often would be called for
meh i like cheap ships and isotopes and dont mine so i will have to go with rational self interest and say no
signed op could not have put it any better than that
after looking at all the varying posts concerning macros i have come to this conclusion there are mainly two people who are using this idea as an attack on miners 1st group is pirates over time they have noticed a decreased population of easy targets in their territorya result of low sec ore being devalued and the ease of finding and killing miners with scanners and warp scramblers they are calling for a relaxing of concord influence on higher regions in order to combat the socalled macro problem let them police high sector  haha so funny they will get rid of these macro miners they also want to eliminate the protection of npc corporations so they can wardec and kill their ships and make them quit if possible but for any small corporation a wardec can easily mean the end of that corporation when you have no recourse but to stay in your local station then there is the 2nd group which are older miners who have seen a decrease in their profit margins over the years they have played so they are doing what they can to combat the source ie eliminate any and all competition by any means usually competition is some particular racialethnic group which is very similiar to the idea such and such group is taking our jobs prices of lots of stuff have gone down simply because more people are playing this game and better mining ships and skills of courseaddressing pinchonsitas case1 they go to a randomor not belt  why not just say they go to a belt and dont all miners do this the rest of it just sounds like a lazysemi afk minercase2they are 23h 365 days of the year on   wow do you really watch them all day long and if you really do have the stamina to watch someone for all day long does that make you a macro as well assuming there is actually someone who mines all day long well there are some crazy people out there who go without sleep for many days and when they do sleep they only sleep a few hours convos offmaybe they dont want to talk to people maybe they are shy maybe they are obsessed with mining maybe they are tired of getting smack talked by someone there is alot of that going around in this game they dont talk in localerr who is there to talk to anyways for being around 20k people online at once i tend to only see around 110 or less actually in the chat channels i think a good amount people who play this game just simply have no desire to talk to others mining can be relaxing if done by yourself maybe thats just their play style allways minning ice or common oresounds like about all high sector ore to me ie mining everyone in high sector mining ore must be a macro miner according to that logiccase3why would you mine ice in anything other than a mack isnt that what macks are designed for or is the 100 just for nothing maybe they use a mack is because its more profitable hulk is not really designed for ice cargo space only really important if you are semiafk miner not a dedicated one sounds to me like some miners took your spot and you want them to leave and they wont so that really annoys you and since cpp wont get rid of them for you you decided to complain in the forumscase4 so what if they orbit the asteriod whats that prove they could just as easily approach it or get to a certain distance and stop there and begin mining oh and the price of tritanium is going up up and away where are these macro miners when you need them4 cases there is allways some common things1 maybe they dont want to talk to people cpp put that option in there for a reason certainly not to help macro miners flourishthey have a character limit hmm not very nice
2 shield booster on hmm sounds smart to me why wouldnt any miner in area where rats appear not have a shield booster if they cant fit one on set drones outnot all ships can tank ranks maybe they want the bounty for killing the rats and setting drones out is an easylazy way to go about protecting oneself or getting the bounty its funny another post ive read said you could indentify macros by the fact they dont set their drones out as the hulk gets attacked by rats and by putting drones out proves they arent a macrominer jeez make up your mind people kill the rats or not and as for the hulk pilots ive heard rats are too weak to do any serious damage so drones out or not what difference does it make3dont reply in local  maybe they dont even have it in view or even realize someone is even trying to talk and maybe they are just ignoring you i remember one time i was trying to mine in low sec didnt have local on got warp scrambled by some pirates tried to run then tried to get local back on in an attempt to save my life but i was already dead and podded and back in my cloning station before i could manage it whats even sadder is when i did the calcuation for the value of mining kernite i realized it was more profitable just to mine veldsar and use those profits to buy whatever minerals i need to build the thing i wanted to build im not sure on the profitability of ice but currently veldsar is the valuable ore if you want miners to go back to low sec maybe take veldsar out of high sec from a profit standpoint its more of a low sec ore than any ore out there4 when i mine its usually the same spot people are creatures of habit sometimes asteriods arent there which is kinda annoying because i have to find a different spot do they repeatedly go to the same spot over and over with no asteriods there if they do id like to see that then again could be a real person doing that many hallucinating asteriods from lack of sleep drugs or whatever they takingdoing that allows them to keep coming back to those asteriods over and over drugs can make you do some real stupid stuff have you been to a mental hospital lately i hear some of the people there are actually run by macros which is why all current medication is incapable of curing their obsessive compulsivehallucinatory behavior if anyone actually has any of this problems and is offended by this comment it was only a joke and hopefully will be taken as such5 you really timing these guys wow you must be bored mining cycles are pretty regular once your cargo bay fills up you have to do something with it if you are actually paying attention to your mining it can become like clockwork maybe even set your watch to it heh maybe they time when their cargo bay is going to be filled go afk then come back exactly at the time they know it is going to be full even before computers and television there were people who lived very predicatable lives with very repetitive behavior that you could set your watch tothe explaination1 mouse recorder hmm pretty neat trick maybe you could teach me but anyways with the way eve is lag bugs weird stuff i doubt that would work for very longallways the same whit a exact ammount of time in the same placesounds like 99 of miners to me maybe even sounds like you either they go to random place or they go to same place and you say both are macros  contradiction maybe or maybe also where they go to proves nothing2 ui macroshow does that work err idk there are alot of people who are always on that doesnt make them macros that just makes them fans of eve alot of people log back in after downtime are they all macros sounds like you dont like people who mine for too long because you dont have the time or the stamina or desire to do the same so you want cpp to get rid of that kind of behavior warp to diff belts or notincludes all miners
exact ammount of time in a beltany dedicated miner likely falls into this category then you go on to contradict yourself by saying that sometimes its not an exact amount of time but it actually varies hmm sounding more human as you continue ie your argument is falling apartthen we get to the real reason  money some group of people is cutting down on your profit margin and i bet its some racial group you feel that is doing itconvo himthat proves nothing is it me or does noone ever think to mail a person if they have convo off and arent paying to local which i doubt many people actually pay attention to local local is dead unless you are in jita and jita is mainly just some people trying to scam you into paying more for an item than its worth oh and its also possible they dont speak english and since most people speak that language they see no reason to have convo on so they replied to you but they still probably a macro basically you seem to have your mind already made up beforehand that they are a macro try convoing the head of bob or goon and if they ignore you they must be macros as well heheoh and the funny names hmm how funny like from another country funny or like a random ordering of letters if another country funny then i think you are just being racist macros mining in groups hmm neat trick wonder how they manage that sounds difficult enough just to do for a normal player much less creating a macro to do it i wonder if macros really do exist its like everyone sees bigfoot and nobody can provide me any scientific evidence of the real bigfootmaybe cpp isnt banning them is because they have no real evidence that such person is really a macro and besides cpp is a business they want to make money and as long as that person isnt effecting their profit margins i doubt they care calling a person a macro user reminds me when people used to call people witches people they didnt like which resulted in that person being drowned hung burned at the stake etc usually because one person didnt like another person because they thought they were different etc maybe cpp doesnt want to take your word for it and not let peoples biases effect how they run their gamehighsec gankarghh im sure pirates would love thatand also for those people who want to shame others firstly maybe you are wrong and secondly if you really want to shame someone why not put your own reputation on the line instead of cpps just create a website of people you think are macrominers and you can have your friends help youhonestly in alot of games ive heard of socalled macro users but never really see them its supposed this big problem but i guess apparently no game company has found an effective solution against them otherwise all companies would have followed suit making macros must require some sort of programming expertise which means only a few people could make them so unless somebody is just offering a free download of a macro i doubt many are actually using themto conclude ive only been playing this game for like a month so what do i know and yes im currently in an npc corp i was briefly in a small corp24 peopleand it got wardecced and i also got kicked out another small corp tried to recruit me he didnt want to let me join immediately so he invited me to the corp chat channel they had he did that for a few days and then he just i guess forgot about me well the corp got wardecced and they were all were getting massacred anyways so it wouldnt have been all that fun getting killed and losing 5m for dieing and getting podded actually now it would be around like 13m now i have better modules and better implants and if i died id be stuck mining in a bantam again cringesso unless some scientific way exists of proving someone is or isnt a macrominer then im against banning a person based on someones opinion
geeze anarichtype much its like the great wall of text i will however agree that you have some good points if i am mining for some strange reason i am usually doing something else while i am mining like surfing the net or something but i do think ccp needs to try and find a way to make it more difficult for people to use macrosit would be cool if the eve client would scan for running macro programs however i dont think that would be very welcome by the general population
i would really like a skill queue i see so many short skills and want to have them train overnight etc
comon  skill queue now 
signing this great suggestion
yes plz plz plz im in the military and go on deployments where there is no internet and cant have a friend update my skills cause its against the eula so im a 5 12 year char with 44 mil sps 
well said
who needed ghost training and who needs a skill queue eve is a game which continues in rl even if it is just on you to adjust your appointments or skill plan to get it done righti do not commit to this boohay
i endorse said product andor service
hi guys
it also allows you to negate that traversal easier you dont have to stand still during a fight you knowyou know that autocannons have even shorter optimal do youthere are also other types of ammo than amnull has only got 25 tracking penalty and it also gives you extra falloff so you now have 25 times longer optimal range over am plus 30 more falloff id say its a fair tradealso every other turret race uses long range ammo sacrificing damage and trackingfull skilled ion optimal is 38 km with am ammo and then you have 10km of falloff lets say that half of it is usable range so this still puts you at almost 9 km range no wonder that a bc can outtrack you if you insist on fighting in such close rangeand which ships dont use plates and armor rigs these dayson bs level raven rokh mealstrom scorpionany othertwo out of those 4 are among the least agile ships in game rokh and meal scorpion is going to be far away in most cases anyway so that leaves the ravenwhich is usually shield rigged andor shield extended so it improves your tracking bigger signature like compared to autocannonsso maybe its not a problem of blasters not doing enough damage but lasers doing too muchonly if you buff large projectiles first and buff them a lot
mothering signed
using null 203 dps leaves blasters with still lesser optimal range than lasers multifrequency or torps and doing significantly less damage with an extra tracking penalty if the range and damage were the same i would concede the megathrons tracking bonus outweighs thati do agree autocannons need work at the bare minimum projectile ammo needs to be brought inline with lasers and hybrids
this isnt a thread focused on projectiles if you want one go start your own instead of trolling minethat being said my acs work great and they dont use massive amounts the equivalent of having several neutralizers pointed at your ship cap like my blasters doand my acs have plenty of falloff to be workable far past where my blasters can hit i should know i use the same gunsi also corrected my tracking penalty figure for null i was thinking of void when i typed it
you were saying that blaster arent good enough compared to other weapons systems which i countered with examples of projectilesalso full rack of neutrons using am uses less cap than a single t1 large neut pointed at youand when using null you also have quite a lot of optimal and falloff to work intorps also require a tp to get full potential or at least a mwd running on the target which after the nano nerf isnt required so much and their damage is severely reduced by target staying at speedso that leaves us with lasers being too good not blasters being too bad
ccp makes me cry with all the damn nerfs to anything thats anygood
signed i did tons of testing on sisi pre patch and found all of this to be true i recently sold off all of my blaster ships i tried to use them after patch but the one and only instance where they actually performed well was when several corp mates had the target webbed even in my deimos i was unable to trap cruisers the pilot simply put me on orbit and almost all my damage was negated t2 ammo for blasters hasnt been viable solution for a long time especially since lp stores came into being when a blaster ship commits to a target it is putting itself in danger cuz it is within web scram etc range it is a very narrow operating envelope right now it is impossible to achieve the damage blasters are known for the only easy fix i can see to this is adding a role bonus to webs for ships that are designed to be used as blaster boats

for 500 mil ship i support giving black ops a fuel bay t2 resistances and slightly increasing its jump range lets say to 3lymy comment on this jump range boost that its not going to make black ops more competitive with capital ships with jump range of 565 ly but only more usable and useful
i find that the war dec system in eve is a joke all that happens is people leave a alt in the corp and jump ship to a newb corp where they cant be attacked also you get 3 year old mission running carebears being 100 safe cos you cant attack them at all by any means now ie lofty gangs etc ccp need to add a new set of npc corps which can be war decced say for example you get asked to leave the current invicible newb corps after 68 months and get moved to one of these war deccable npc corps which forces you to either join a player corp or create one where you can be war decced etc tbh i expect a load of moans from these types of people  they tend to just sit on forums and mission run all day but chnages need to be made people who sit in newb corps trading in freigthers mission running etc need to not be 100 safe its unfair and wrecks the essence of eve and mocks the war dec system
agreed been saying this for 3 years too but ccp strictly stands by the antieve style of playcorp jumpingwar declaration flags should persist per pilot following them into whatever corp they jump to for the pilot alone but new corp can support the pilot with the appropriate aggression flags for the duration of that war cycle the same should go for corps jumping alliancesnpc homesteadersnewb schools shoul automatically shift all pilots to their appropriate npc corp after 6 months npc corps should instil heavy taxes over timealsonewb schools  level 13 missions only l3 agents quality max  0 no mining barges no industrial capital shipsnpc corps  all agents max qualty  0 no exhumers or industrial caps freighter jf orca but can be trained 10 tax on all transactions market mission refine  escrow per month in corpthese changes wont kill the game for any of the players currently hiding in npc corps as it will create hundreds of new small corps  alliances that can easly skate under the worst war dec everything radar of empire pvpers but it will force the elements that everybody hates farmersmacrominers out of npc protection where they can be hunted properly
facepalmhere we go again
this has always been a good idea imo new players should be allowed to insure their ships for 6 months and stay in the noob npc corp for the same amount of time after which they are moved to a veteran npc corp that is continually involved in factional warfare
for yea nano nerf boo whinersif any of you had played for any amount of time you would know that the nano nerf isnt a nerf never used to be able to make cruisers 8000 msjust a return to common sense
boo whiners does that include all the whiners that did not have cheese to their nanos are overpoweredomgwtfbbq1111oneoneonewhine
having the support of maybe 3k players with a player base of around 250k doesnt mean you have the support of the while forum just means you have the support of all the forum si for one support the the nano nerf if you have to use speed and kiddy type play style to win a fight i feel sorry for you stop your ship and slug it out like a man
signedthis isnt a nano nerf its a nano change if you read what nanofibers do they dont say anything about giving a speed bonus make the nano nerf an actual nerf meaning reduction warp disruptors disrupt navigation systems that allow you to pinpoint a warp exit point therefore making it impossible to warp mwds do not require pinpointing but they give a massive speed boost i dont see why warp jammers should disable a speed boost module nerf the nanos and maybe nerf mwd speed boost but these changes just dont make any sense whatsoever i think a large portion of the playerbase wanted a nano nerf but is all this really necessary
uhh im not playing eve if i log on just to change skill market orders to me it only counts as playing if i leave the station that i was in i would really appreciate skill queue because it lets me plan them better there are also ppl who go on a trip somewhere without internet and they would be disadvantaged by a short queue
i agree its pass time for a skill queue changei had to do some serious work arounds at work just so i can connect reset my skill and logoffall for a skill queue and possible a web accessible interface to change skills on the fly without loading the clientside note  i also usually stay logged in when training a short skill just to save the hassle not playing just logged in

i would like to know if ccp will give us the option of mixing different racefaction modules i doubt it since it would be an insane load on the server but if it was possible i think it would really add to the eve experiance and further ccps goal of more player generated contenti wonder if ccp could put together a combinations program that would take all of the modules and find all of the different combinations and store them on the server it may help reduce lag if ccp does let us mix modules since the server would already know all the ship combinationsjust a thought
hmm sounds like frigs would be a great way to start this action dont think a frig is going to make the game totally unbalanced  maybe start w 1 frig that you can customize for each race  emm and skillset  have to be frig 5  have to be frig construction 5 mm let see race specific rank 5 science skill to 5 too 
its five sections and five options within each section hence the 3125 combinations from what was said there will be race specific graphics meaning were getting at least 12500 new pieces of art  more if npcs start showing up in their own versionsship sizes shown varied tremendously dependent upon what options were usedwith all of that arriving in march id imagine its unlikely theyll be extending it to give additional options any time soon besides  the various bits of tech has to be found first 
this is most true i will have to train up on my explo skills so i can go find a wormhole to barrel down into  maybe the modular ships will be classlesssince as you mentioned the sizes of the ships varied depending on which modules you havenow i am even more curious to see how ccp will do thisi think i am more excited about the modular ships then i am for walking in stations 
this issue hurts 
after reading all the whines about csm again i think people would be much happier if the csm was disbandedthought same happened when the battlegrounds were implemented and that made people sad panda now it seems they have adoptedbut this is the 2nd csm and people still whine so it makes clear that there is only one possible solution to disband obviously corrupted csmpeople do know what is best for them
the zoo called they want there bananas backme thumbs downme reports spammer
people will always whine about things its a fact of life however i believe that the csm is doing more good for our community then it is hurting it they do practically shove our good ideas down the devs throat which is somehow twistedly satisfying in short not supporting
hello stari like the base idea making the ships less of an omgwtfbbqpwn ship and more of a mobile deployment and outpost if the devs could work around the problem with ctd and such it would be an excellent ideathe reason it isnt like this now is the coding and if that changes i see no reason this couldnt be implemented with the smaller drone bays where would all the fighters be
hey bunyip thats the point of the mothership redesign the fighters are in the sma docked in the station they are the players of the alliancecorp of the pilot those who chose to fly around with him who are able to jumpdeath clone into him at his hour of need if he gets tackled in a safe spot and is miles away from anywhere as long as he thought ahead and had a load of ships left in his bay by folks he has a valid defensive force that can come to his aid if he has no friends didnt plan ahead and fill his ship with ships or simply doesnt see the attack afk ftl then he has to rely on up to 199 ogre iis sentry drones or pure luck eve 00 pvp is all about the multiplayer after all
tbh i had on mind bit different direction tho you have some good ideas as i said this is very touchy issue and requires lot of inputsi will post some of my ideas in next week or two after csm starts working
this is exactly the kind of zomgwtfUFFFDberpwnmobilestationthingy i would lika motherships and titans to becomeabout not launching fighters from the ms though maybe docked plots could launch fihgters from it like the 20 guns on the titanhate to say it though if this was implemented they would have to remove every single mstitan ingame and reinturdouce the new ones with twice the price tag or ask all mstitan owners if they whant to pay for it again to not have theirs removed lol
fighters are overpowered i like the idea but its better to have people undocking to put their ships in harms way than sitting inside the super tank putting more dps down right now this mothership as a solo boat is about as powerful as 4 insanely tanked rr domis with eccm and good drone skills relatively harmless against most fleets with docked pilots with ships its a mobile pain wagon like youve never seen before  yes thats an interesting point why would the new ones be more expensive though theyre not exactly cheap to build as it is they could just replace them with the new design if they wanted to bump up the cost what they could do is either add a temporary reprocess function to the capital ship maintenance bay to allow you to turn them into their base components you lose the rigs but get the huge amount of components it took to build them back to put toward the newer ship
okay then by the same logic theres no problem scheduling it for 9 pm gmt then youd really know why id kinda like to see it changed will do and thanks  this is exactly the sort of info i was hoping forgood pointnope simply dont have the time to wade through quintillions of forum posts for something that may or may not be there a decent frickin search function for the forums would be excellent in any event youre the one saying this has been done to death before the onus is on you to demonstrate youre correctthanks all for contributing this is definitely shaping up as a nohoper and im fine with that accusations of dimwittery notwithstanding gotta love the driveby lol u r stoopid remarks the fine art of debate at its best ill look at those figures from fanfest and then probably come back here and officially deepsix this
yep this is one dead dodocame across this before i found that fanfest presentation but it was enough to determine thatusa 373 of subscriberseur 415 defining europe as including russiaaus 31oth 110so even if only 10 of the europe subscribers were online in the 15001700 gmt space the only time that looked remotely viable then every single australian player would need to be online to have a hope of making it a fair swap even then it would be annoying 4 of the player base to make the 3 that are australian players happy this is nothing like a convincing casei concede damn you world dont expect me to come and fight for you in the next war
eve already is one big grindfest
ok ill be that guy i like this idea so long as the bonus is kept very small why wouldnt actually using an object make the learning curve faster ccp and players keep saying they want there to be some difference between playing and not playing well here would be one example
holy  a supporter you must be my alt
facepalm
im support this with the new system while you active and currently training example a weapon skill what you use atm ratting or pvp the skill training should go a little bit faster so you want to get bs lvl5 set training and go out ratting or pvp training wont be 30day it will be 25
i like the idea if it maybe gives a bonus like a 1 implant or so so nothing bigit would be good for new players so they see a sense in theyr first weeks of playing while skilling frigs to 5 or mining barge to 5 or soatm there is no big thing during this time they cant make big money or so they simply wait for the next skill
stop whining and just go play wow
your mother says hi
ideagb2eq because even the wow players think your idea sucks
youre fat like scarlet
you just lost every bit of respect you had in this channeli think its time you moved on and left before you turn it into crime and punishment spam thread and get yourself banned from the boards
no wayeve is a special due to a number of reasons and the skill training process is a very big part in it do not waste it its balanced and working fine
i agree with these ideas
about one third of the worlds flags are tricolor and half of them assymetric there are a lot of small nationality based corps in game who would like to express this in the decorations they are creating for their members besides tricolor and assymetric badges do look cool unfortunately when designing the ribbon part of the medals all patterns you can chose from are symmetric along their longer vertical axis which makes it impossible to design proper tricolor ribbons with one color on one side another color in the middle and a third on the other side i think this request is not very difficult to fulfill all that needs to be done here is adding a few more patterns to the ribbon customization list patterns which have a stripe on either the left side or the right side the current color selection and pattern layering mechanisms would allow the medal designers to use these new patterns to create proper tricolor ribbons
while the idea might have merit i dont agree with your justification rl world flags
scagga you are from the uk you cannot understand that part  but even if you do not really agree with the justification the concept of tricolor badges could still be something you support i mean tricolor looks quite alright
of course i cant understand that parti just didnt think this would be the first item youd write up as a proposal on the assembly hall it probably would look quite alright but that imo is not a good enough justification for the csm to spend time on it could you justify it in objective terms as to why it is worth the time to deliberate escalate and put into action
scagga dude bitter muchseriously lighten upthis is a place to give ideas and suggestions and its an bloody good ideais it earth shattering no is it something that deals with the largest issues on the table nobut its something good and a boon to those who want to give a mission badge as opposed to a medal of honor so long as they are not as expensive maybe half the price tag and make them generic enough to be not so fancyand yes i think this is a good ideaeven if its overshadowed with other issues all good ideas should be given there fair shot
no to any more ability to shove your rl nationality andor religion in someones face via corp emblems
a medal is not something you shove in anyones face it is something ceos give their members as a token of acknowledgment for their deeds it is pretty well hidden in the decoration tab i mean you have to click 4 times to get to the medal itself it is not like if i would ask for the ability to color my ship redwhitegreen a lot of corps have been using all kinds of design guides to provide a uniform look for their appearance on forums and ingame assymetric ribbons are definitely something that would allow a better implementation of these design guide for the corporation medals
ERROR
imo they need a vast increase in the number of art objects available for corporate logos as well as the badges considering how much stuff theyre going to implement with their secondlife project stumbulation then it would only be logical enabling 3d objects as a part of the corporate labelling and badging would also be appropriate
counties colors aside i would like to see more patterns added to the ribbon list including assymetric patterns i have been designing a few medals for my corp and wish i had the option i would also like to see more items to make the medal out of maybe some jolly rogers skulls larger swords single crossed and otherwise maybe even some more colors to choose from but one thing at a time 
well i dont think i have to say much more than my country has a tricolor flag
please boost merc mining
drone alloys and mission loots takes away from real miners they have to train 15 mill sp and then work for peanuts simply because everyone else can do what took them a couple years with just 2 mill spmining should be a profession not an afk option let the resources be extracted by real prospectors let minining asteroids appear in random places and not available for macro minersand still supporting
people like you that fecking dont stop whining about this or that ruin this gameall the nerfs ccp introduced are messing up this gameonly good thing ccp can do is unnerf all their nerfs
mmm funny  i have had several falcons wtf bbqd um i would say if your having so much success vs players w your falcon that you need to step it up a notch and fight some good pvpers also i have been able to drive off falcons plenty of times  and lastly one should always plan on having a falcon counter in fleets
falcon got 100 chance to remove 1 hac from fight with 1 module is this balanced 
yes it is as when you fit eccm you prolly wont get jammed at allso basically its all about your fittingsone mod to jamone mod to counter itseems very fair to me
yep one mod to lower change to aprox 60  lag  locking time mhm about 3 sec to shoot at thing   12 shoots per minute
as i said im not botherd about rooks scorps cause we can fit agianst them we do fit eccm but i wouldnt like to waste a mid slot on everyone of my ships just incase a falcon shows up eccm is not 100 effective and if the enemy shows up with 2 or more falcons it still closses down our fleetif im in a 10man fleet and a falcon appears from no where and jams half our 10man fleet its like half my fleet not being able to jump into the fight in the 1st placeyou guys are the whiners who say there balanced there just not they need sorted
says the pot calling the kettle blackstop your griping seriously they probably had some additional skills you didnt have or theyor anyone that fell to the attack
as annoying as he can be the guy above is rightfalcons are not broken theyre doing exactly what they were intended to dowhat were they intended to doshut down half of your 10 man fleet yes exactly that it is their sole function and they can do nothing other than that one function just as effectively as a single lachesis can prevent them from locking beyond their own shadow or a pilgrim can drop their guns down to effectively zero rangethe fact that the pilgrim can also neut as effecitvely as a bs or that a lach can shut your mwd down from 20 or so km forces these ships to balance one of their ew functions in favor of anotherthe falcon has no secondary ewar capability they just jam they do it well and from decent range which is their sole capacity thus they are balanced in lacking the second ew function likewise with the rook ability to damage a wet paper sack or tank or deploy drones
i support this a players skills should always count no matter where you refine
signed
i find it odd it does not work like this now
there isnt any thing concrete available which notifies a corporation directors when someone leave the corporation i think it could easily be handled in eve and it should have been there just like new players application comes to recruit him into corp there should be some sort of notification that xxx player left your corpi personally think this will help a lot to lots of players specially players managing corporations
please consider a new ship for the next release orca ii ore compression fittings5 high slots5 middle slots3 low slots3 rig slotscapacities slightly larger than orca i but well below rorqadditional skillsmining director ivastrogeology vcommand ships idid i say ore compression that would make this ship something to die forjmhothanksfly safe
i bit early yet for a t2 variantore compression 1 slot would be quite handyenough hangar capacity to store at least 2x bs would be better yetoh and t2 only get 2 rig slots
so dont make it a t2 variant there are 3 levels of t1 ships in most factions and classes we only are asking for two levels here as the ii would have ore compression could live with 2 rig slots as long as we can have ore compressionagree the ii should have increased capacities all around not sure if storing other ships besides barges and exhumers would keep it as an industrialjmhothanksfly safe
is it just me or are people trying to make the orca into an roqual sp a bit too earlyits supposed to be a compromise with some bonuses
currently the orca is your jackofalltrades ship and does pretty much all of its roles commendably well that is except for mining fleet support lolit can haul mass quantities it can haul fitted ships a bunch of em if theyre frig sized it can tractor from insane ranges making it an excellent wreck scooper tooreally there doesnt need to be additional tiers of the thing its ace as it is all id want is more maneuverabilityspeed 2x bs in the hangar bay or an equivalent number of smaller ships and enough cargo to haul around a general freight cans worth of stuffnote anyone know just exactly how much one of these things can actually haul when its been max cargo fitted
so csm guys i post this above text in features and ideas discussion thread on the forum discussion but im pretty sure that you have more power face to ccp to make changes or improvements on the game my suggestion is as followit is funny to be pos gunner but it would be a lot more if you could incorporated the kill perform by pos gunner on somekind of killmail that could be used by most killboard on the netit would be funny to see how much damage a pos could perform on a large combat fleet that is trying to get tower in reinforcedso pos gunner would it be nice to be rocognized on kill board at least you will have skilled gunner for an other reason than just help your corp gazgal jin
any other comments suggestions
you would have to be smoking something to think ccp would actually consider giving isk to players they hardly replace ships when losing them was ccps fault i am with you on the life is busy thing because it is i dont have time to sit and run missions all day i do however live in 00 and making isk isnt to bad and certainly isnt boring bagging 1 mil isk per bs rat keeps me happy and i get to watch pretty explosions  not to mention the occasional pvp op with my alliance i dont make tons of iskies but its enough to keep losing ships doing stuff i enjoy ccp wont even give players incentives to report macro miners eula violations etc even if we did like the idea ccp would never go for it
so wait till rl is not busy good for you that you have a life go live it and come to eve when that gets boring
oh wow you win dude dumbest idea of the year that is not a jokea member of the collective making this post ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
looks like someone who wants the easy button  if eve were easy we wouldnt have the hi caliber players we do it would be full of morons and non performers
like the millions of little kids in wow contionuously asking for gold except it would be worse here since everyone knows you have iskies
i will be on this oneexpect it to be raised on the second council meeting i could use some info tho what exactly you would like to use this tool for i used to use it to check the number of blocking calls to determine how far i am from having the grid sufficiently loaded to enter a fleet fight any other uses give me hints so i can write a nice proposal
supportedbut not as the annoying little info box unless you really need all of that extraneous infoinstead use that little bar of dead space along the bottom of the window where the time is displayed on my system that does me little good its always below the edge of the monitor but to have that always viewable without being another ui item to deal with would be far better
per the latest patch notes this function is being returned on nov27 thanksgiving day patch for those of us in the us
there is something wrong with you if you need to hold on to those killmails i support ccp in deleting the mails there are no reason why to keep them in your in box like those people who dont ever delete an evemail there is something really wrong with you
i applaud ccp in their decision to castrate all you killmail epeen waversall us corpse epeen wavers fart in your general direction
bumping just for the sake of ironyright after i catch that snipe for thanksgiving feastrightthanks for the heads up wranglerhappy thanksgiving to the americanshappy find a reason to celebrate to the rest of ya
hehe yea ditto only thing i would say is maybe have a mod for longer range tp effectiveness
you didnt care about painters sucking before misile nerf didnt you d
hehrooks are generally considered to be inferior to the falcon that being said you didnt answer my question is the rapier overpowered because it shares ewar bonuses with the huginn and can warp cloakedi never said damage was important i did however point out that your assertion that the falcon loses nothing in exchange for its ability to cloak was erroneous
rooks and falcons obviously suck because they cant wtfpwn things like every other recon hth
seriously that isnt a joke you seriously think that
yes i truly believe the ellipsis is a legitimate punctuation mark
according to most english handbooks ellipsis are shrug
a falcon cant shoot its way out of a wet paper sack it cant fit drones to chase away pesky inties if it cant jam them it maneuvers like a slug making it ideal sniper bait and dies amazingly swiftly to a salvo or twoso the falcon sacrafices any ability to actually do anything other than the one thing it does and does well jamdarn near every other cloaking recon can actually kill something if they choose wisely
145 racial jammer strenght vs 14 hac sensor strenght are you serious that im unlucky d
yes there is instead of having 10 dreads you need only one and then you can have 9 carriers and or mother ships i feel that dreads do not do the amount a damage they should do it takes 2 and half hours in siege to take down a large towerplus it would be fun to fly and i know tons of people would be like omg i wish i could buy one of those i feel it would fill the same role as a mother ship is to a carrierhow much more can a mother ship rep over a carrier when in tri mode
no thats a reason to fly it i asked what reasons there are not to fly it what reasons are there to disadvantage this ship in other words what balances it as for dreads not doing the damage they should do what why not back that up with more than a feeling they already do more more than double than any other single ship in the game they already are used easily even by smaller organisations in enough numbers to singlecycle a large control tower 10 minutes these are two good reasons why they do plenty enough dps what reasons are there to make a bigger better one other than it gives another thing to train for because where does that stop do you make another one after that and another and another how big is big enough why isnt the dreadnaught big enoughas for the same role as a mothership is to a carrier what role there is no role motherships are a bit useless since they got balanced they cost 20x a carrier for ten more fighters and ew immunity thats not a role thats just a bigger version ccp have said that theyd love to make them something unique and interesting and special but havent defined that yet zero motherships and carriers have the same bonuses to remote reps the same ability to fit triage mods and while they have better cap its not enough to be running lots of extra reps alone let alone in triage they have one more highslot but also the ability to fit two more modules remote ecm burst and clone bay plus people are more likely to fit more smartbombs and a cloak as protecting your 20bn toy is a fairly high priority
i think you best ansured this question your self by sayingmother ships do not risk using the tri mode because it increases the likelihood of the ship getting ganked 20bills down the drain 14 in minerals so if any one wanted to use a siege mod on a flagship then it would greatly increases the likelihood of that said ship getting ganked im willing to take out the 50 reduction timer if thats the only other thing that your really bothered by nowbut the 125 damage bonus is there because i feel the ship should put out the amount of two dread with out having to siege thus making it harder to kill  but costing 2530bills to build a ship that dose 2 times the dread damage with out siege is a little much just for that little plusso how about that if the 50 reduction was taken out would that make you happy or just start going on about trashing it from another angleop revised
oh no why combat pilots get all the love
so instead of presenting a reason for this shortsighted atrocity of yours to exist you turn the tables around accuse us of things we didnt say and now we are to jump the hoop you made upwhat you proposed is a ship that for all intents und purposes counts as 10 other ships without any downside to it why would anyone want to have such a ship in existence if as you say a tower siege lasts for more then 2UFFFD hours  only guessing of how many dreads you are talking about then wheres the good deal to have it last 15 minutes instead on top of it  at the moment you need a certain manpower to fulfill the purpose of a cap fleet operation  with your thing you have the same means as said cap fleet operation with suddenly lots of cap pilots to spare for example you could have your 10 dreads in one ship and 9 carriers to remote rep the hell out of it and each otherthe game we play has some sort of balance to it the one you are dreaming of has less so
i dont believe thats true this ship has even more risk of loss then a mother ship or a titan because it would be stuck in place for 10mins thats what gets dreads killed in most capital engagementsso planting your 3000000000000isk bulls eye in the sand yelling at people to come kill it thats completely unfair and unkill able i think not isk vs reward
ccp wont add any kind of cap sized combat ships stop losing ur time
isk vs reward is a player demand not a ship design philosophyanyway you make the usual assumption that something worth xy isk should balance out something else thats xy isk or that something that costs 10x xy should be far better than xy in itselfthe truth is col that if this atrocity of yours was to be implemented it would replace one dread in manpower but 10 dreads in firepower so you would have for example  take 10 players to get the damage of 10 dreads and maybe 9 carriers worth of remote reps you wonder whether id stick to the sand hell yeah  two of those are a cap fleet all by themselves the peeps formerly known as dread fleet are either landscape now or remote repping the real damage dealerdont forget  this thing would pop other dreads fastbtw we are still waiting for the why of this ship  and no wouldnt it be awesome to doesnt count
so your argument is that because seige mode is dangerous people wont risk using it then why have any seige mode on it at all double dread damage with no seige tank but ability to warp at least starts to approach balanceyou keep on avoiding the questionwhat is it for other than having a big ship dreads are big ships why isnt it big enough
a you admit there yourself that this ship would be grander than a titan what ccp have stated will be the biggest ship theyll implement in the gameb you contradict yourself there you gave it a 50 reduction in siege module cycle time 10 min  50 of 10 min  10  5  5 minutesand seeing that this thing is huge has a siege module all of them iirc have lvl bonuses on resistances and that the nine nowfree cap pilots will undoubtably be flying remoterepping carriers  it may not be invincible but its gonna be damn ing closealso im beginning to suspect this idea was put up as an excuse to argue with ppl  annoy ppl 
this is very true but can also be said about the tri mod for carriers why have the ablity to fit it if the risk is to high at least this ship will have a little more incentive to fit because of the higher dps output over a dread risk vs reward its our choice whether to fit one or not but at least we would be able to chosewell why do we have a mother ship class of carrier what purpose does a mother ship serve that a carrier could not other then being a larger ship that can not dock but is immune to all forms of electronic warfare whether you hate the mother ship class or not you must see that there is a missing ship class when it comes to dreadnoughts please read all op revisions before posting your thoughts and ideas about this ship thank youthis is not an argument this is a discussion brtween members trying to hammer out details about a proposed missing ship class in the dreadnought under score if you feel annoyed but reading this thread then feel free to not post or read at all
both dread and carriers fit siegetriage modules the only difference is that siege module provides such immense boost to firepower using any other module instead of it just stupid sometimes fc on the spot decides not to go in siege for whatever reason my point is not fitting siege module when you can and have free slot for it is not an option its idiocy that monstrosity of yours will always fit it and may or may not use it just as dread because mothership can provide several functions that are not fit for lesser class cloning bay remote ecm burst furthermore ccp themself claimed on several occasions that they are not satisfied with motherships just as bigger carriers your ship is just dread on crack nothing morehe obviously did inconsistencies in your proposal and other statements are obviousedit so at least you removed 50 timer reduction i missed it too nvm guess why is everybody hammering it it has more than 12 times firepower of a dread 2 times if you comparing it nonsieged vs sieged dread not mentioning ewar immunity lol no siege penalties omg lol and ability to be remote repped roflmaoedit typos dread  dead
it was off the record because it wasnt officially on the agenda at that point in time when it is officially on the agenda it will be on the record and you will have the complete details of the discussion
look you have used an off the record conversations that we cant independantly verify as proof of ccps actions and then you tell us that we cant be told about off the record conversations untilif they becomes on the recordplease do yourself and the rest of the csm a favour and before posting pause think and triple check your facts because when one member of the csm posts it reflects on the rest of the csm and the whole csm structure is already under a sustained attack by naysayers and forum bullies remember the old saying  please dont feed the trollsedit okay before the wrong end of the stick gets grasped as a csm your post carry a presumed weight of authority with the playerbase irregardless of any lack or substance of real authority sadly and quite stupidly we expect people who put themselves forward for election to be whiter than white and to never put a foot wrong i doubt that i could personally live upto such high standards and i also doubt anyone will give you the benefit of the doubt when you prove to be human and screw up such is the life of an elected official  even in an internet starship game
cough
well that among other thingsfact of the matter is that if ccp was genuinely interested about players opinions all the pr stunt would be relegated to the second stage provided they give priority to substance over form and appearancesi mean come on i could ask one of my programmers to design a polling system based on a postgresql db model and a rockstable codechargegenerated web app in a halfday and ccp cant come with a thingy like that in what  5 years  and we are talking about an investment of less than 300  but yeah its way more efficient to put a bunch of peeps in a chat room to talk for ages about who does what when where how trips to iceland and all that sh while at the end accomplishing a poor record of representative objectivity since most of us simply cant be neutral even if we tryuseless crappola imho
actually i responded to a specific example that was given a gentleman specifically said item x wasnt being discussed i merely responded to say it had not every conversation that is had needs to be published if you dont believe a conversation occurred then thats your bag im not going to lose any sleep over it thanks for the advice though
guysget realthis whole csm farse was just another ccps way of trying to limit whines on forumsthey know that 30 page topics with opposing oppinions to what ccp is doing arent a good showoff how they dont listen to playerbasethey managed to get 25 of whines into other section under idea that things are getting done and that we will forget about them sooner or latercsm thingy is just another crowd manipulation tool from ccp to keep us more calm about stupid changes or stupid nerfs of strange bugs or whatever they are not capable of repairing or using more brains to come out with some better solutions nanonerf for instance broke more things that it fixedi voted in first csm mandate then i kept eye closely which things and what stuff is going to change with representative body between us and ccpwellnothing changedsothis time i just didnt botherand all those vote for your csm today commercials were pretty annoying
actually if ccp had balls it wouldnt have been hard to add as poll option something in the line of i vote against the csm then maybe we would have achieved a much better turnout but with probably the opposite results than those expected by csm supporters
a lot of validity to the comments and concerns voiced in this thread all i can add is i really will try to make my participation in the csm something positive for the pilots of evei cant say yet is that is possible but i will make my best effortissler
ladies and other creaturesyou can have fun killing each other in game but please no trolling or taunting on these forums dont want to have to dust off my lock link ya know 
you know what it is truly that is represented by this case is that regardless of the fact that this is a game or that you are ingame or out of game is not really the point regardless of the fact however stupid it may be the goon alliance has openly declared war upon the honda accord regardless of their motives or because of elections i am brought to the same conclusion of real life and that is 2 thingswar and politics go hand in hand war and peace go hand in hand for that i believe that both these points are valid to the goon alliance still regardless of why or not it has been declared simply knowing as to why it has been declared would be nice but unfortunatly rests upon the commanders of the goon alliance to tell us there reasons for declaring war or not i still hope and believe that there can be a peaceful resolution to this situation but i will make my self perfectly clear in real life i am a soldier i do not back down from anyone i dont care weither i die or weither or not i live i serve my country the same applies for me in eve i am still a soldier and i will not back down from anyone regardless of the outcome harassing and insighting weakness upon others is in itself a sign of fear of conflict and being a coward those who do not insight these kinds of weaknesses do not openly mock others for what or who they are they simply enact upon their orders with this said i will humbly ask once that those from goonswarm stop predicting what we may do because if this is your accurate prediction of what we are doing your intelligence divisions are clearly not doing their job properlystill upon this i will ask that the leaders of goonswarm listen to common reason and as i see it there is no true reason why war should have erupted other then to whet the appitite of those who hunger for battleja hardertadakatsuobata corporationthe honda accord
as an rl space general i accept your challenge sir the gauntlet has been thrown this assault on my space character cannot be countenanced
this made my brain bleed where can i send my doctors bill
can we make sure to take a break from thisd on turkey day or at least invite some of you by we make some awsome turkey
i dont even read darius posts anymore but you should see the way they play out in my head
congratulations to everyone who ran and to those who won i look forward to seeing the csm in action
quote while allowing for a seperateplease go write separate 100 times in the blackboard sir
well firstly i think were pretty intimately aware of how difficult it is to fight alliances that are taking advantage of insider information having fought 2 killing one of them the real problem with what youre asking is that im not a gm ccp has never given us any insider knowledge which could be exploited we have high level conversations where were typically not aware of what the finished product will look like apart from that the items that we do have knowledge of you have knowledge of as well via the meeting minutes really theres been nothing that could have been exploited apart from that i simply wouldnt do it but i dont expect you to take me at my word on that thanks for the congratulations
thanks guys for all the congratulations votes and support its going to be another fun ride
was replying to the guy talking about devs shouldnt be able to play eve
im pretty good with context
wait im lost i thought you were defending the csms position as alliance leaders of which i wasnt talking aboutwhatevs who gives a  grats on your reelection
nvm misreadanyway i still get 250dps and 300 volley with my ishkur and my skills so i dont think they are kinda underpowered just a little more dronespace for spare drones would be cooland a third med slot for those afs who only have 2  or one  med slots is definitely needed
this should be about frigs in generali dont know what is trying to be achieved by giving frigs so few slots but it results in them sucking at everything except for tacklingdoesnt matter what they do to afs cause cruisers are better cheaper and insurable
this post is severely outdated with the mass changes for afs and needs to be reanalyzed and rewritten
this would become a nonissue if ccp would make a 15km3 or larger secure can noone really cares about compression its all about having a large enough can to mine into solo the current largest at 5000m3 just isnt large enough
congratulations issler glad to see youre entering the csm with such an auspicious vote count
666you made a pact with the devil to get in right pjkscongrats
easily knowing what someones name used to be would be the only way id support name changes even then i dont like it and im fairly sure ccp wont either
thisin addition what about linking the name to the corp history also have you thought about what will happen when old names will become available again
i completely disapprove of this proposal
makes all tracking agents and forms of pilot intel uselessstupid idea
you mean using buddylists and local for intel rather than what it was intended forintel is intel even without names visible anywhere
no i mean creating lists of corp members within a corp and listing their prefered ships and fitouts areas they are active and then using locator agents to monitor their movementsim talking real intelnow stop trash talking my trash talking your suppositions are just lazy and not very intelligent
id certainly like the idea to change my name so long as theres an aka tag attached and that all records of the past name update automatically to the new onei can imagine the server load that would causeid also like to be able to change corp names without disbandingreforming the corp currently i run one of the oldest corps in eve and want to maintain the employment recordage of the corp but its name is no longer particularly pertinent oh and the idiotic name thats screwing up my browser settings cut the idiots name in half or ban him
i would like the idea of allowing name changes as long as your character sheet lists known aliases and locator agents are able to locate people using their former names you would have to give every character a hidden unique identifier and change a few bits of code to not break buddy lists etcemployment history should never be in scope for anything like this nor standings
i already petitionedmore petitions  faster nerfageahhh hes been removed not changed or cut short hes been removed entirely ccp does listen to kof a few petitions at least
i support this feature
maybe some time limit to be associated with the characters former name this way when you buy a new character anyone who is obsessed with tracking it can and can see that the name was changedand for those whom insist it makes scammers easy to hide what do you do hunt them down why dont they just create a new character on their accountand you should check the support this feature check box
tripling the cost of faction ammo wouldnt even put a dent in my pvp costs at all and im sick of people with t1 guns and faction ammo nearly equaling the output of my t2 guns

this one is going with me to iceland
how sir what changes are you going to put forward or are you just going to point out how t2 just does not work under the current mechanic and leave it up to ccp to figure outin my following posts i will put forward an idea on how t2 ammo could be brought into line without making it overly powerful compared to standard t1 but keep it from being wholly overshadowed by faction
threadnaughtfing ccp  half an hour typing a post and poof stupid authentication screen wipes it
idiot authentication should remember your input when it decides to dump you back to the login screenanyway changes to t2 should be at a minimum a  remove all nerfs that affect the ship as a whole speed cap regen ect and limit any nerfs to a per weapon only caseb  reduce existing nerfs by 5075 or eliminate them altogether current faction ammo does more and has no nerfssince t2 do not require any skills to use allow all pos sentry systems to use t2 ammochange t2 missiles rage  increased rof no damage bonus 50 flight timefury  damage bonus identical flight time as t1precision  increased velocity explosion velocity  radius no damage bonus reduced flight time to equal t1 rangejavelin  50 flight time 50 velocitytorpedo explosion radius  velocity for all types needs adjustment to make them bs weapons again  with quantum fail their damage has been reduced against bs considerably making them only capable as anticapital weapons
signed because of the ew part i do not think that drone damage should be increased tho so if it was up to me i would add hardwirings but not those for rof and base damage

i brought up drone implants the last time and we still havent seen any of that in the gameso unless tusko insists on having this issue ill bring it up
i would not priorize drone ships atm a drone boat can switch weapon size and dmg type in fight  in fact qr stealth boosted drone boats just look at those threads like my bigbutt ship cannot hit afterburning whatsever with ultralarge gunsmissiles a droneboat user can effectively hit all sizes of ships while gunmissile guys are stuck to same size and bigger targets drone boats are so cool now  what i mean is not a general critics i love some of your ideas but i would not implement them until somekind of natural balance is established in current combat system
that would be interesting supported
trust me they lose the total cool thing once they get destroyed and you are left without any dps doesnt sound cool now do they missile launchers do they same thing and you cant destroy them and they always hitthere are tons of things for missile usersum drones are a primary weapons system and they are part of the current combat system which btw works pretty well now lets try not to continue treating them as secondary and start treating them as a primary weapons system that many players have great interest in
supporting the drone cause
signed totaly agree with your points of view

missile nerf is very harsh ccp nerfed missiles to appease the people who were crying because of speed nerf and in doing that totally ignored the missile users and completely obliterated it they need to look at it again and correct the blunder they have done
signedin pvp missiles were underpowered before and this patch has made it worse the irony of having to beg to have them go back to a previously underpowered state is rather disconcerting
some of the best fun i had in eve came as a result of the efforts of the old event team we mostly make our own fun in eve but a little bit of well thought out interaction can be a massive catalystinvolvement in storyline adds value to gameplay in ways that simplistic npc ai and simplistic players to be harsh cannot hope to compete with
this would get my support as long as these events happen on weekends or during the us tz one of the problems with the old events is that players in the western hemisphere could only read about them while still at workschool without any assurance that we have a chance of inclusion i dont really care if events come back
if someone saids somethign if ther eis such action that perosn or ppl use macros and they get fuked uppd i did check times when i see somoene that i think is macro minning so yea i did and not because im bored is because im tired of them
people who are unable to access the internet for periods of time due to work military commitments etcand if this gets implemented it doesnt mean you have to stop adjusting your appointments and skill plans
naaaowww please although i joined the game partly because i could train while not subscribedonline
i was wondering why we dont have salvage drones theyll be extremely usefull no
you can not force people to play the game the way you want them to you can only force them to stop playingccp is a business they exist to make money for their investors eve is just a means to that end forcing people to stop playing is not in their interest
while i can understand that avoiding wardeccing might be a bit easy it should only be changed when wardeccing system is changed because like it or not me gets his flameproof suit wardeccing is pay to grief atm for 2m a week you can harass a mining corp for as long as you want
this i support
how is anyone being forced to do anything
thisall your promoting with another one of these ridiculous proposals is a massive zerg of 1 man corps
all ccp need to do is create a 20 noob corp tax levelthey also have to ensure the level for non taxable earnings is set so that complete noobs wont be affected but older players running lvl3s and 4s and such will be inconveniancedthis incentivizes older players to move out of the noob corp so as to be able to earn in line with other players
you want to war dec players in noob corp whyto grif them why you have personal grudge against someone in noob corp suicide gank them and if you dont want to do that and still want to hurt them go get some fresh air outside and manage your personal vendetta elsewheresuggestion of taxing noob corp members if we do that can we also give them almost all other benefits of being in a corp like if someone stole from a containerwreck of a noob corp member other noob corp members can hunt the thief down and benefits like thatthing is if people are in noob corp long after the character creation  it could mean many things like player are being harassed by people like you and only option they have is take shelter in noob corp and by doing this they are loosing way too much like the benefits player corporation members have it could also be due to many other reasons so why not try to find out those reasons instead trying to make them leave the game and enjoy the game with all the player corporation members only while ccp is getting bankrupt due to all the canceled subscriptions
with two of the csm in noobcorps i dont think youll get anywhereas for the actual reasons why i oppose this idea you can look in one of the similar whine threads about this topicand wardecs are indeed a joke ccp called them paytogrief for a reason what exactly do you expect that happens if a band of pvpers decs a defenseless industrial corp and whats the point of deccing and ganking individual npc corp players with a blob its just senseless griefing and wont get my support
i personally dont want to wardec noobsi think there is a serious mechanic fault that lets griefers hide in untouchable organizations when real corp griefers can be wardecced and punished for being annoying
if i wanted to be in a player corp id be in one im a returning player i could go back to my old one the people i gave my old characters to offered to return them but thats not what i want out of the game right now ill join a player corp or start a oneman when i reach the point where i want to do something that the existing restrictions on npc corps dont permit
im not saying that there arent griefers and macroers in npc corps as thats obvious what i am saying is that players should be able to play this game the way they want to even if it means soloive played the corpalliance game and its not for me the politics and wardecs are a headache to an industrialist i dont think a 5 or so tax is going too far but 20 taxes pleaseif you dont like players being in npc corps give them a reason why your corp is superior to npc corps if this idea is implemented well wind up with a ton of oneperson corps and a ton of lost subscriptions from ccp to go along with it
i disagreeplayers who find themselves capped in npc corps not booted out just capped will eventaully get fed up with the cap and move outward to progress upward from skilllimited learning corps to earningslimited npc corps to unlimited uncapped player corpsso what if we get a zerg swarm of 1 man corps the game can handle it youll also get zerg swarms of 1 man alliances so be it put minimum starting membership numbers on alliances to limit the number of zergling alliancesim not saying kick them out nor am i saying make them wardeclarable just give them incentives to expand or disincentives to stay currently there are none none at all whatsoever yeah so they cant erect a pos in empire wow big deal thats pretty much itand your classic macro farmers wont leave making it easier for ccp to find out who they are and deal with them macro farmers in pc corps can simply be declared against just make sure the flag sticks to them otherwise theyll jump corps every 48 hours 101st anyone to avoid any and all combat
well its say it all really doesnt it the two csm members complaining are carebears let me guess you fly round in freigthers or a golem and laugh as all the people who want to kill you kicking  overtaxing noob corps wont mean for the mission bears that they instantly get war decced it means people have a chance of war deccing them it ruins the whole war dec system when people can shift into noob corps to hide why should mission runners be 100 tbh i wish the max quality of agents in high sec would be 0 generally to force people out of high sec kinda like roid types try but failto doi admit i war dec mission runner to kill them but why the hell shouldnt i be allowed to im only one man i war dec 15 man corps so in theory they shoudl easily be able to kill meits just the fact there scraed they might loose theirs iskiesif you dont want to do this then bring back the lofy mechanics its unfair that these guys are 100 and spend all there eve life in these corps while piracy in low sec isnt great
as originally posted herethe current situation currently several roleplaying channels exist within eve that act as a bar famous example the last gate a gym a club and many more places that borrow themselves well to social interaction the problem with ambulation the idea seems to be that these can be converted into 3d environments footage of fanfest shows us a bar for example this means that if someone wants to visit a place they have to be at the location which just might be on the other side of the cluster or worse faction warface  sec status means you no longer can go to your favorite places not to mention that certain stations will be very crowded jita anyone while others will be very quiet this practically forces anyone that currently runs a channel to move to some trade hub or other popular systemthe solution the roleplaying community of eve seems to agree on the existance of holoprojectors a holoprojector is a device that is installed at the destination which you can connect to from a remote location and projects a 3d holo of yourself that can walk around and see things from first person view others can see your holo and interact with it in a limited way ways of implementationowners of a bar corp office ect can purchase this device and install it upon which the service becomes availableholoprojectors are a station service this may require you having been at the station before just as with clonesthe interfaceplayers can connect to a holoprojector from their pod additionally also the captain quarters through the computer present there while the user interface is visibly everywhere it would not make sense that you can control a holo while randomly standing in another station hall not to mention all the spaced out pilots would look really awkward this defeats the whole purpose of the suggestion as wellwhen a player connects he loses the view of where he originally is so be careful in space and takes over control of the projection in game mechanic terms this would be zoning into another area and applying the holo graphics transparence and such and limiting the interaction to walkingspeaking could perhaps play the minigames as holo too having a drink however wont be possible
supporting myself of course
or just use a chat channelif youre too lazy to go somewhere why should that be promotedshouldnt rp be serious business
this isnt just about rp it is about making sure all stations will have people in them certainly if this becomes a station service think of the benefits for your own alliance for example you can have the ceos and directors of various corps gather in one station through this and have a meeting in style rather than a boring old group chat
stations will have npcs in themif you weant to reap the advantage of hanging out with your friends in avatar you have to pay the cost of actually getting off your ass and going theirambulation is not designed so that people who never undock can play second life in eveits a social tool that is to work with the res tof the gameso you want to get to that high stakes poker game in lowsec youd best move fast and avoid the piratesreally worried about not being able to make corp parties have a corp party jump clone ready at the bar you useits brilliant the way it is being planned right now and diluting it with mediocrity is not a positive move for iti do not think ccp should waste hundreds of man hours programming holoprojectors and how they work because players are too lazy to fly their spaceship in an internet spaceship gamemake sense
i think that this is something that the developers should consider for the mid to long term development of the eve world outside our shipsim actually not too fussed about the roleplaying angle as it goes i just think that its a general point that ambulation will be a lot more useful if people that cant physically be at a place can still interact with the players that can say your corporation are gathering in the corp office in pator but youre still stuck over in some obscure hole like 9uy4h and cant get over there you still want to be able to be involved somehow some kind of flickery low res holographic projection would be excellent help me obi wan etc
you have a point jahret khan but not entirely holos should indeed be limited in what they can do to promote moving around but saying jump clones is the solution is not entirely correct this means that youd have to give all your clones implants and can only move back after 24 hours which means you are actually limiting social interaction rather than promoting italso i am suggesting this now because the dev team can easily plan it in who knows maybe they already got something similar planned or maybe even better it never hurts to ask and not trying is always losing
another more real problem with holo projecting is stress loading on the ambulation serverthe system as you explain it allows all 40000 people online to holo themselves into jita at oncemass swarming and crashing these servers becomes too logistically easysure they could impose player limits ons tation ambulation but do you really want to be excluded from the party because theres too many people in the stationwouldnt you rather just fly there and be guarenteed a place in the fun
if 40000 people are going to fly to the station then the system is going to crash as well so that doesnt always guarantee a place in the fun sounds like a good security measure though to limit the amount of holo connections if only to motivate people to go to the station so they wont have to fight over a holo place
perhaps just have an interbus depot on the station whereby you can ambulate to it then take the bus to where you want to betravelling on the bus to somewhere then also becomes a game in itself perhaps others are also travelling and you can talk with them on the journeyespecially if theres a distinct route for the buses and you have to change at certain stations to get a bus to a specific destinationofc the bus would take time and isk and once you arrive you wont have a ship there so youd have to make the journey back before you could undock or do other nonambulatory stuff
as a note according to the first old designs the maximum amount of people at a specific room is limited as such the 40k people in a single bar isnt a realistic scenario and would be easy to implement in an incharacter way as well the maximum amount of connections to this augmented reality node have been reached youre 29876 in the queue please wait there might be other concerns though like blocking people from entering by remote connecting to the location though likely it couldnt block people in if every place has access to the elevators assumed quick transport system around the stationalso there could be optional connection fees also explaining incharacter why people would want to invest to a holoprojector in their establishment of course if the same module is available for corp offices it could have other uses like having all the people in the same room for viewing tactical maps or then the tactical map should be synced across different offices andor inspace map views
im heavily in favor of this especially the as a station service option as it would allow people to go to a remote station and move around the whole station saying oh ambulation only exists to promote offship interaction for people who go to the station and invest in jump clones if you really care actually would end up meaning empty stationsits a vicious circle really in order to walk around a station youll have to press a button or something to get out of your ship and walk around if theres no one in the station wherever that may be save the very rare occasion well then you just wont press that button if we allow some sort of mechanism for people to ambulate in other stations than the one they are in whether it be via special ambulation clones or interbus or holoprojectors then more people will ambulate sure there will obviously end up being hub stations that have lots of ambulation action and others which do not at least though the stations with action will have lots of itseriously think about it if ambulation is tied to the station youre docked in how many people will be in your station i hang out in airkio a lot its not an empty system by a long shot at the same time judging by the number of people in it the stations wont be jumping if you hang out somewhere in low sec or syndicate or any of the bazillion places where youre likely to be the only one in system too bad sure jita will be hopping think about the people it will be hopping with though youll ambulate into a bar only to see navy vexor 80m  seling cheep isk  orestes modified jock strap 800mobo is that what you want ambulation to be like
this is an entirely different solution but one i could also find myself in favor off has its own pros and cons as long as something is done i will be happy maybe you should throw this one up in a different thread and see how popular it isalso very good point there shinto even with an access list on a bar that is going to become a problem isk sellers also spring to mind xx
agreedthere are so many stations that no one will be able to assemble at just oneholoprojectors should enable a distant character to project themselves to a remote location but they can only interract with the other people at that location they cant work the market or contract systems from their remote locationyes they could just use a chat channel or voice and they will but for the visual imersion some may want to be there and remote projection is the only viable path to that
i agree from early on a concern that ccp must be aware of but hasnt talked about at all is that you are going to have a lot of empty stations eve populous though it seems just doesnt have the sort of numbers that would be needed to populate these hang out except in specific mostly high security systemsthis also promotes the entire famenotoriety aspect that the single server architecture is so good at creating making your place interesting enough to become famous wont help if noone will visit it and notice for people with somewhat limited play time particularly they are not going to want to take the time to travel to a location to hang out when they could much more easily use a chat channel interesting and compelling though interaction via actual 3d avatars might be it just wouldnt be worth the time investmentit would be a shame if something like this wasnt included as it is a significant part of eve is waiting  but it is usually waiting in a specific place for a specific thing to happen the start of the next op the fleet being ready to move the invention job coming off the line ambulation is an ideal way to make that down time interesting by giving you something to fill it with turning what was previously a flaw into one of eves strengths however it become untenable if you cant snap right back to the spaceship side when and where you need toso make it limited sure but put it in so that we dont have a hideous mess in jita and a forsaken  if pretty  wasteland everywhere else
youre kidding right i mean you seriously enjoy that style of play no strategy no interaction just click orbit turn on guns sit back and watch do you realize that that style of play is exactly like playing fscking pokemon oh look at the lvl 30 vexor i have i just ran into a lvl 29 stabber vexor i choose you walks away while they are fighting comes back  youre vexor has evolved into a megathron logs off thinking about how awesome a pilot he isffs man if youre going to play a game fscking play it get yourself into a prepatch nano ship now go out there and try to not get blown up try to last 1 day i think youll find out that it wasnt the speed that kept us alive it was us interacting with our ship paying attention 100 of the time knowing exactly what our job was within the fleet and the communications between your fellow nano pilots in the gang im not saying i disagree 100 with the nano nerf being able to build a 25 kms vagabond was a bit excessive but then again we spent billions to make that happen what ccp has done has completely shut down any sort of speed build and thus shut down any sort of strategy beyond you stand here you stand here now start shooting blob moar this also means the fun part of eve is also gone if i wanted to play pokemon i would have played pokemon
supported  only thing i would change is the irreversible stuff to be located right at the bottom
this would be an easy win change to make a big improvementdoesnt alter the fact that they need to really sit down and rethink the ui from first principles
full support on this
also add another confirmation menu for trash it like for quitting corps
i really like the idea of something like a researchable techtree in evei dont like your idea of ressetting everything when a defined amount is researched thats unfair why should my work be ressetet when i spent lots of time to get there and others should get the same for doing nothinganother idea could be that the techtree is like skills with a maximum level so new coorperation could get closer to the level of the advanced corpsand make technologie sellable so they can get it by buyingsorry for bad english
while a tech tree is nice one of the goals that i was looking at was to never have the competition stop when you own a moon anyone can come and knock your tower over you need to continually be ready to defend your moonbut pvp mechanics dont work in production and research blueprints and materials are safely locked away in stations such once someone sets up their research chain or acquires a t2 bpo there is no way to knock down and take their efficiencyresearch typically fills this position where people are always making better stuff but if we do this then we have a number of problems as we go up in module tech levels the first is that we can create a bunch of useless junk that clutters up eve the second is that either newer players and producers can never catch up or research stops and you fall into the old no competition problem all of these are bad if newer players can never catch up then we have instituted a hegemony of the rich and old if research stops and we fall into the same problem we had before we didnt meet the goal of being able to research your way to a competitive advantagethis is why the regression has to occur ideally on all tech 5 4 and 3 modules and blueprints its to ensure that there is always competition for the highest quality modules
1 for periodically resetting research ladder
a way to detect cloaked ships without destroying cloaking completely
recently i thought of a different suggestion which i wrote up elsewhere basically give standard cloaks cap usage give stealthbombers bonuses to avoid this the cap usage is proportion to the ships sig radius cap recharge stops when you cloak
i disagree the problem isnt people cloaking its people being able to check local all the time remove local and this whouldnt be a problem as a pilgrim whould ruin that raven pilots day
i dont support this idea but perhaps some sort of cloaking sensor array could be developed for poss that would give a general idea of where a cloaked ship might be in a system like around the moon of the 7th planet something that allows people to find the afk player but doesnt make it easy my idea if you are online but afk you should have some risk just as if you are sleeping in a park in nyc with money hanging out of your pocket
same old same oldcovops cloak  completely cloakedimproved t2  sigres reduced to 05 ship is not visibly removed from space if youre close enough to see it you can move toward it bear in mind that a bs is difficult to see at 40km but its not on your overview until decloakedstandard t1  sigres reduced to 05  10 dependant upon meta level ship not visibly removed from space only overviewships designed for stealth bombers covops recons black ops blockade runners would always be fully cloaked regardless
this is bull
lol someone has delusions that mss are solopwnmobiles theyre not trust mealso isnt allowing them to carry hundreds of pilots a little stupid think how big theyd have to be lol
and what happens to everybody insidedocked within these mobile stations when the mothershiptitian pilots logs off
read up ive explained it in an earlier thread youll be safe but stranded in the station unable to do anything but chat do contracts play with the local market skills based change skills or jc outyou wont be able to do anything with ships undock or anything with station services aside from jump cloning out if you are in the ship when the pilot ctds or logs unless hes aggressedyoull get a 1015m downtime style counter where you can do pretty much anything as if the pilot was there including undocking docking etc but after the 15 mins is up the ship disappears and youll either be stuck outside or in
i like this idea
signed this would be awesome
more corp divisions aswell
good idea
i like this idea it is a space ship what sense does it make to be able to password a gsc and not a ship
makes perfect sense thumbs up
use a station or put a password on your pos or get a pos hanger or dont leave ships in spacenay
of course it does because everybody knows captain kirk evacuates the entire ship and crew every time they have an away mission
because of the use of 3rd world workers its almost impossible to knock out rmt in a game from that end since those countries dont have the legal infrastructure needed to support the game companyso maybe its time to go after the other end of rmting their websites you cant buy isk if you cant get on the sellers websitenow whats the most effective way of knocking a site off the net ddoswhat does a good ddos need thousands tens of thousands of host computers connected to a central server to receive commandswhat does eve consist of a central server with thousands tens of thousands of client computers connected to it at all hours of the dayjust include a tickbox in the options that states i wish to partake in the active defence of eve against rmt offenders and away you go
facepalmanyway good luck taking ebay down by using ddos
dos attacks are illegal you do not know what sites you are taking down exactly as you kill the server not the site besides those guys could just ddos back i really dont wanna see that happening not supported
so is rmteye for an eye
im no expert but arent those dos attacks illegal in terms of laws enforced by government agents while rmt is only illegal compared to the games eula

no its not 
there has been a lot of discussion in general forums about this lately  the current state of low security space and changes that might be made to fix itthe basic problem that most of us see is that lowsec does not offer an even minimally linear relationship between risk and reward just as it is possible to make a decent living in highsec for very little risk and an excellent living ratting in nullsec for substantially more risk discussions of 00 carebearing aside it should be possible to make a substantial amount of isk in lowsecfixes that have been suggested not merely for the purpose of km whoring higher bounty rats at least bs sized not as much as in 00 of coursebetter ore although still not as good as 00 quality oremoving agents to lowsec primarily higher quality level 4 agentsfix fw plexing while perhaps not making lowsec more profitable it would certainly make fw about something which would be goodi am fully onboard with the first two and would consider supporting the third of course it is unreasonable to expect ccp to alienate so much of their playerbase by moving those agents so that doesnt have to be on the tableone thing i am very interested in is the thing on the drawing board called viceroyalties if this was implemented correctly so as not to draw on the static pos style sovereignty warfare of 00 it would have great potential of course to make lowsec more profitable for yourself through being a viceroy there has to be profit in the first place please dont flame me for simply wanting more targets im not a pirate although i have been simply for the reason that piracy in lowsec isnt piracy its pvp thats not the point the point is that lowsec has potential to be a place free from 00 drama and gatecamps be the last bastion of solo pvp and still be a place where one can turn a tidy profit i would appreciate it if the csm could at least put this on ccps radar and make noise about at least one character being interested in the viceroy system
not a bad ideaalso not badagent quality is already based about sec status of a system so just by going into low sec their quality is improved really what they should do is improve on l5 make them more lucrative than l4 missions while doing them in a gang while also making sure to promote doing them in a gangbeing in groups makes people feel safermeh i like the plexes as they are they act more like a beacon where you can find some fightsshould also look at vastly expanding the amount of research invention and copying slots in low sec this would promote people going out into low sec as there is a lot of demand for that and you can do most of it in small ships that can get past gate camps which will make people of course not be so damn scared of low sec all the time
i am also concerned about lowsec and see the logic behind your proposal but i see problems here i am afraid that your proposed changes would not bring more people to lowsec it would just create wealthier low sec piratescarebears you have been referring to the reward  risk forumla right now this formula for low sec is way off i consider lowsec to be more dangerous for the individual than null sec because they are not among friends and reward is lower than in nullsec so in order to bring the equation right by improving the reward i think reward would need to be improved so drastically that it would kip the balance of the game completely to compensate for the riskyness of low sec rewards would need to exceed those of 00 which would be just not right i think reducing the risks of entering low sec is the part of the equation we should take a look at maybe also boost rewards but its the risk part that ruins low sec for almost everyone trying to make a living there right now
the key to making lowsec easy is having friednsthe game needs to promote group activities in lowsecmaking lvl5s more lucrative is a good startincreasing station facility availability is also good as lowsec production can make a killingbelt ratting and minerals are fine as they aremaybe more high end lowsec exploration sites would help too
the difficulty with low sec is that its too dangerous for what you get most folks realize that low sec is for all intents and purposes more dangerous than null sec simply because in null sec youre functioning in a poorish player operated variant of empireone of the cautions to buffing low sec without some mechanism to prevent it is that if low sec becomes too lucrative the 00 empires will simply move in on the areas nearest their space and push the pirates out or absorb them while they wont be able to claim sovreignty theres nothing stopping them parking a fleet in there and running an nbsi program as long as they do it with low security standing toonsif the viceroy system comes into play ccp will have to be careful or all the viceroys will be alliance leaders or officersone thing that might be desireable is to come up with a way to make lowsec a place for corporations to reside in empire you have a lot of solo toons and some new corps doing missioning etc in low sec you can move your corp in to some marginal space and set up those things youll eventually need to move out into 00 without being an existing alliance lackey perhaps several corps who were successful in low sec could form an alliance and then move out into 00 to either stretch their wings and claim their own area or as allies of an existing alliancethere would also need to be room and opportunities for the small gang and solo pirates and pirate corps in low secjust an idea making things more moneyed isnt going to bring many folks down from high sec youre more likely to get an alliance fleet and a bunch of dead pirates as the space falls to some null sec power and can never be taken away save by some other null sec alliance force
as you said yourself the riskreward is off the way to make the riskreward better is to increase the rewardsif you increase the rewards more people will come how many more people i dont know but it will be more peopleif you want to move people into 00 and lowsec we need to drastically increase the amount of production resources that can be harvested in both areas on a personal and immediate levelhopefully sometime in the week i will get a chance to post some things regarding lowsec missions and a general issue of 00 wealth but he is right more rewards  more people
agreed
when you research a bpo in eve there are two features designed to stop abuse at public labs1 no multirun jobs can take more than 30 days2 if a job is canceled the slot stays busy for the original duration of the jobthese two measures are very good and practical for public labs in stations however a mobile lab or anchorable factory should not have these options forced on them since they are corporate property if i want to do a multirun job that takes 60 days or 90 days i should be able to so moreover if i want to cancel a job i should be able to use that slot immediately right now i have to unanchor and then reanchor the structure to do soi would like to suggest making the maximum multirun job duration something that can be set by the ceo or director in addition i would also like to see the availability of a slot after cancellation something that can be set by the corporation
i like the 30 day job limit imo i like the idea of a corp slot opening as soon as the job is cancelled but it should be logged who cancelled the jobwhat i dont like is the fact that you have to shuffle stuff all over the place to use themimo the control tower should store all of the materials used by its anchored structures and they should have a large storage capacity for goods all of the structures should draw from this resource pool and dump products back into itlook at a standard lab 2 invention slots can you imagine the hair pulling when youre inventing at a pos or the manufacturing array thank god they have more than 1 build slot now ammo manufacturing arrays ship arrays drone arrays gasp thats a lot of needless logistic lunacygive towerssmall  500k m3 material storagemedium  1m m3large  2m m3faction  25 to 50also when the tower goes boom it drops its storage just like freighters do goods are dumped to a single static hangar such as deliveries and then go to loot
the entire concept that the drone regions is based on is horribly flawed drones need to drop something unique and useful to the game advanced drone parts for awesome t3 drones but all minerals dropped from killing targets needs to be removed from the game regardless of securityno more base t1 loot in missions named only and reduced named drops drones need to drop something else again advanced drone parts similar to salvage used to create new types of dronesminerals need to come from mining wtf is the point of people mining when their efforts can be equaled or exceeded by others with no mining skillsequipment what so ever
exumer 5 with all the t2 crystals but not deep core mining is about 5 millions sp what are the other 10 millions sp
damn my 4 votes didnt go in vain 
give drones bounties tags or perhaps more of those drone parts to build the customized drones from i have always understood these are underused and very expensive
lachesis does what now you seriously believe thatlachesis damps have an optimal of 45km  when you damp anything with it you get d by drones when you damp multiple ships you get d harderffs the falcon has three ewar bonuses to the arazulachesis oneas it is the arazulachesis arent good for anything they can webscram someone but dont have the scan resolution of a interceptor or the tank of a heavy interdictor they get a 25 bonus to hybrid damage but  nothing add 25 is still nothing and on a good day using 3 phased muon sensor damps with signal suppression v and 2 inverted signal field projecters you can do what a falcon can do with one ecm module of course five seconds later youll get d by drones unlike the falcon which is sitting 200km awayyeah f thatill agree the falcon isnt broken the day my arazu can shut down half your 10 man fleet you want the secondary ewar capability  you can have it take the dps with it  its freeend rant
falcons are overpowered  if you dont prepare for them there are plenty of modules and ships that can mitigate or eliminate a hostile falcons effectiveness but most pilots refuse to use them you cant consider a ship overpowered if there is a valid counter to it saying that falcons are overpowered when you dont use eccm makes as much sense as saying that interceptors are overpowered when you dont use webs or warp scramblers
falcon should be left alone1 eccm needs to be made more applicable you get nothing from fitting eccm except a little bit of protection against falconseccm should literally be a 1 fit autojamfree mod per jammer 1eccm neutralizes 1 jammer 2 arazu  sensor damps cant operate at real distances often needing to be 50km or so from your target 1 sensor damp really cant mess up a person unlike a falcon who with faction jammers can really ruin your daythe counter to sensor damps being sensor boosters which are fairly commonsensor damps simply need to get a 1 locked target effect per damp this would better cause issue3 curse often not being able to use heavy mods and due to the nos nerf you have a real problem fighting against cap boosters which are fit to the majority of pvpperhaps giving a fitting bonus to curse so it has the option to fit 12 heavy neutnos4 rapier ya lets nerf this minnie scum dont know anything and cant do anythingeditwhy is scum word filtered
i think you should just shut up seriously shut upyou have said nothing that hasnt been whined about answered and argued to death youre a worthless troll deliberately posting flamebaittldr shut up
oh look yet another person who believe that the way to fix his broken ship is to break everyone elseswhy would you think that why are you one of those people who when they injure themselves makes theself feel better by hurting someone else too rather than being more careful what is wrong with youwait dont tell me i dont want to know you should just shut up as well
falcon got 100 chance to remove 1 hac from fight with 1 module is this balanced not true i prefer to use range rigs  1600mm rt so i cannot jam a hac with 100 probability signal dispersion v facts with a racial jammer i have a probability of about 78 to jam an noneccm ishtar up to 198km with rigs  ecm range skill at ivso either you whine about falcons with 100 probability of jamming an noneccm hac or you whine about 200km jamming falcons
i will quote myself
read it again champ then show me which part of my post is about changing the falcon in any way mhmm you failif you hadnt noticed im asking for changes to the arazulachesis to bring those ships up to the level of a falcon take away the hybrid damage and give me sensor damp optimal range instead note im not asking for more damp strength im asking for the ability to damp someone from a longer rangeoh and one last thing read more carefully next time dont put words in my mouth and dont flame
theres something in thisespecially the range and the ineffectiveness of eccmadded there prevailance in gangs of all sizes is stunning
dont you think thats a little high
nooooohaving run into lachesisarazu fleets back when damps could shut essentially any target down to sub10km lock range i can say i was more than pleased that they got dampeddid they get damped too much im willing to conceed that perhaps they did you dont see them in massive mobs any more but then you also dont see damps on everything either which you did for quite some time when they were the uber fotm module likewise only ecm specialized ships bother with them anymore typicallyalso ecm works better from range than close a mechanic i dont fully understand i attribute this to the sensor strength falloff calculation similar to the one that scan probes usefalcons are force multipliers theyre not a foce unto themselves unlike the amarrminmatar recons and yes the noncloaking gal recon as well the gallente needs to be brought up to viability rather than neutering the caldariever faced a scramming damping lach with a short range ship theyre pretty painful in solo engagements even if they only plink you  being nibbled to death is still dead yes drones do them a lot of hurt but they likewise cause problems for minamarr all of these ships can engage you the falcon simply can notas the csm guy said falcons cannot win a fight alone
dont you think thats a little high basically thinking about ecm jam probablity is reduced to personal feelings we all know arguments from both sides and although we know those arguments everybody feels right in his view no i do not feel 78 is high considering that this typical hac is not hardened against ecm imagine attacking a ship with a resistance hole to your ammunition type your attack will hurt him a lotadd a eccm and the probability drops down to about 39 thats a sensor strength of a average recon ship every time a recon ship with little amount of dps attacks me in my falcon i run i run because i know i have a 60 probability of missing a jam cycle
pimping my idea ittthe ideaswitch the falcons optimal bonus for a falloff bonus this means that jamming chance will decrease as the falcon gets further and further away from the target creating a risk vs reward tradeoff the falcon pilot would have to pick between being closer and jamming more or being safer at distance and failing more cyclesthis is only for the falcon not the rookthe bonuses caldari cruiser skill bonus 10 reduction in ecm target jammer capacitor use and 96 to 100 reduction in cloaking device cpu use per levelrecon ships skill bonus 20 bonus to ecm target jammer strength and 60 bonus to ecm target jammer falloff range per levelnot ideal to move the cloak bonus onto the cruiser but better than putting the ecm strength bonus on there imo this will also mean that its easy for all falcons to fit probes take that as you willthe numbers all jam  chances are done using 1220313 strength racials despite the fact that fittings would probably change im just too lazy to figure out what the new strength would be edited the numbers this is taking the 60 per level falloff but accurately calculated i have no idea what rita zechs is on about in this post so im just gonna round down to 1 before running falloff calcs which means  100kmhyperion  439 iv  452 vthorax  673   693 tristan  828  852  150kmhyperion  267  296 thorax  410  454 tristan  503  558  200kmhyperion  162  194 thorax  249  298tristan  306  366for reference jam chances in optimal 81km for racials look like this hyperion  531 thorax  814 tristan  100these new numbers look low to me anyone else want to comment the edits
any changes that pushes a falcon into anyones engagement envelope  removing the ship from use period just like the fate of the arazulachesis currently and with web changes has pushed the use of rapiershuginn down considerablyif you want to shoehorn them into the sub100km envelope they should be considerably tougher than they are currently likewise for the lacharaz  rapier theyre paper tigers that make a deimos look solid if you want to force them into the hac roles make them as tough as hacs

not against submarines nofof and defenders need to be fixed in a big waydefenders need to provide a defense screen currently they cant hit anything thats fired within 40km simply because of the way they work you cant fit very many in any sort of launcher that can make use of them rocket launchers hold like 10fixshrink defenders to the size of rocketsgive them rocket velocity and direct impact flight mechanics rather than the flyby and 1 second redirect to hit the targetdont reduce their damage however due to their rof even with rocket launchers they really dont do a lot to incoming dps especially from multiple attackersfof missiles  currently theyre one big jokefix increase fof damage by 2550 above targeted because youre spamming these things and theres no way to focus on a single target except in a solo situation and then theyll go after drones too remove the max range on them currently 80ish with cruise removing the max range can also be a viable counter to the current whinetarget the falcon or other potent ewar boatsimo fofs should target priority objects affecting the launching ship ewar and if none go off after random hostiles

dont have exact numbers no eft at work but ran them yesterday but with industrial command ships v 2x t2 cargo optimization rigs  1 t1 cargo optimization rig and 2x t2 expanded cargoholds its just a hair over 100k m3 using 3 t1 cargo optimization rigs instead of t2 gives somewhere around 97k m3
op also state why its needed i think its not needed its enough what we have jmho thanksfly safe
so you want rorqualrorqual has ore compression and can go everywhere but high sec while high sec has no need for ore compression
i give up because you have consistently failed to come up with a single reason why the ship should exist the argument that its missing because presumably there needs to be a tier 2 ship in all classes is utter junk plenty of ship classes dont have more than one ship in them  freighters titans logistics hictors dictors destroyers marauders black ops jump freighters the list goes onsecondly you try and pass this off as a real reason by saying well otherwise why do motherships exist ive already adressed this point there is no reason for motherships at the moment they dont do anything special ccp have said that they want them to have a real role and are looking into it why on earth would they want to make the same mistake twice in introducing a ship that has no role differentiation from the smaller alternative but is an incredibly overpowered version of it which is then inevitably nerfed which is exactly what happened with mothershipsim not going to bother asking you again what the role of the ship is if you are going to try and claim nonsense like its a missing ship it just exists in your head in fantasy land
so you want me to say what kill towers and capitals that is a given and yes its the same a dreads but way more risk and power with that riskthis game is a fantasy land one were you cant kill my dreams but my dreams can very much kill youi just had to say it
hmm i dont think u can do anything in this wayits still ccps look onto u guys and what they should do with ideas u supportedand its not like u can demand from ccp anything and tbh i dont think they give a fck if anybody from csm would sign in resignation in case chosen thing doesnt go throughlike i said just another crowd control toolccp never got any intentions on listening to our ideas be it directly expressed in suggestions forum or via csm support but they managed to get some of those whines into readable topics and into some queue with big large maybe we will listen if u get enough supporters stamp onto itgood example was that thread about against nano nerf and whine from bellum about blasters beeing useless now
why not give the new csm a chance to prove themselves before spouting such counterproductivity
because it threatens those who want to return to the he who whines loudest and longest wins all days in the mistaken belief that that is actually how it worked before
im just curious  some of you opposing the csm what exactly did you expect from them theyre not magicians theyre not fullon ccp employees ccp hasnt ceded decision making power to them those of you whining about the nano nerf for example  do you seriously think things like balance issues should be put to a vote thatd just split the camp in two between i fly a nano ship and i got killed by a nano ship neither of which have any real relevance to the issue and how it affects the vision of the game ccp has there are some things that are just going to be beyond the players control and new balance changes are one of them now if the changes have been in play for a while and serious issues develop then bring those issues to attention and you might have some success i look at the csm this way  at absolute worst theyre changing nothing and its all a waste of time but really whose time is being wasted ccps time theyre running the csm again so clearly they feel its worthwhile the candidates time there were several candidates who have run again so clearly to them its worthwhile now at best the csm is capable of bringing ideas to ccp that they may not have thought of  thousands of heads are better than the few they have there and its natural that the players will think of things that ccp just may not have even considered whether the ideas are accepted or rejected its a good thing that theyre even being heardsorry for this wall of text but its just so silly to see strong opposition to such a harmless conceptjust because your pet idea isnt being pushed through doesnt mean nobodys listening
me watches and listensgood to see an old corpie on eveoin the mean time you can vist my blog
its good to see you working on your ideas  i look forward to them turning into proposals the areas they are addressing are quite important
warning long long verbose post and i cant be asked to spell check or check grammer neither endwarningthe 2nd poll will define the irrelevance of the csmperhaps not in fact i doubt that even the 3rd 4th or even 23rd poll will define the csmnow before we start and while the trolls are still hopefully reading i believe the csm is a good thing a very good thing i just think its implementation was misjudgedccps attempt to bring the players voice to the table via a democratically elected panel is revolutionary but is doomed to irrelavence as no revolution gave birth to iti feel and im sure youll all argue with me at length there are two problems standing between the csm and its defining moment but before we get into that the first question should be why does it need a defining monmentdemocracy in all its varied guises and shapes has always been a solution to a problem and not a solution to every problem and that problem has always been  being uncomfortable forget the right to free speech forget the right to selfdetermination for get human rights and justice the main and in a lot of cases the only concern for most people is simply is their life comfortable or not give someone enough food shelter recreation and the slightest glimmer of being able to fullfil their material dreams and you can have any form of government you wantso typically democratic insitutes evolve because enough people are uncomfortable with their lives to over turn the exsisting order i cannot personally think of a single instance of a dictatorship sponsaniously standing down in favour of a democracy in all case either internal or external focres are applied to remove the old problem internal pressure being prefferable as when democracy is externally forced upon a regieme it often leads to failure if you want examples just turn on any news channelthis application of force and from now on i will only be talking about internal forces not external foces are galvenised by a defining moment a moment that brings unity and resolve of purpose without this catalyst the odds arnt in your favour as a side note these defining moments which bring a nation together are also temporay if you dont believe me look at election turnouts for almost any 1st world nation and you will see a steady decline in voter turn out since the time the ability to vote was wonyou will probably argue that eve has had that defining moment youll say something about alligations of gms aiding certain alliances etc etc etc but in doing so youll be ignoring one main fact that incident did not make the playerbase of eve any less comfortable than they already were it was a scandal and a disgrace but more importantly it only eaffected a small but vocal minority of the player base youll no doubt agrue how it affected everyone but the reality of the situation is that if the majority of the player base beileve that what they can see harms themso no defining moment has occured and we have a csm structure waiting to rise to the occasion when it happens and it will
my second point follows on from an observation in my first point only what you can see can harm you or inversley what you cannot see cannot harm you so the second major stumbling block to csm relavence is visibility to the playerbaseat the moment the csm has only really two ways to communicate with the playerbase en masse either by the forums which is a two way procress with the csm and the players being able to communicate with each other or the web page a one way process realistically information can only be distributed via it this i suspect is a major barrier to the csm being able to communicate in a meaningful way with the playerbasei strongly suggest that the majoirty of the playerbase if not the vast majority have not been to the forums and those who have have read enough never to return i would also suggest that the number of players using the webpage on a regular basis is very small as wellagain im sure figures can be provided and explain as to why this is not the case although most of these figures will range from the down right wrong to the wildly innacuratetherefore for the csm to become relavent and i use that term loosely to the vast majority of the playerbase the csm itself must break the stranglehold the forums has on its operation the how and why i leave to well meaning people with even more time on theor hands than ionce these two problems are over come the csm will come into its own and have an opportunity to shine bright in the lives of the playerbase until then they will toil on under near constant and unwarrented attack doing the best they are able to do with the limited authority they have
well after the last csm took credit for the suicide ganking nerf id say at absolute worst they will be listened to and we can look forward to such excellent ideas as bunyips alliance deployable gate guns in 00
bhutan did in 2003 iirc
i cant really disagree that this is how the first csm worked but were working to change that ive already implemented a channel where i can answer any questionsreview ideas on forumshear new ideas i cant guarantee that the other candidates will join me on the channel but the csm is still a diamond in the rough being refined and improvedfyi the channel is called csm chat feel free to join it and address any issues you feel deserve it to me and perhaps my other candidates its up to them the csm does have some minor power but we need your input on ideas and other issues before they can be institutedtldr dont throw us out yet let us prove our capabilities to you as we refine who and what the csm is and its relation to the playerbase
ccp is attempting to promote within eve a soupeddown version of representative democracy limited to consultative views when and where it pleases them which in turn is just a mass delusion deflecting the impact that eve login polls could induceim not against the csm because it exists if folks have enough free time to spend like that its certainly none of my business to tell them if what theyre doing is a futile exercise or not im against the csm as concept aiming supposedly at bringing ccp closer to the players opinions on a variety of issues its pr plain and simple since there are much more cheaper and efficient methods suitable to provide extremely precise results and on a much wider statistical basebut the problem for ccp is that integrating login polls would create a relatively factual and documented set of data about the majoritary opinions of players on the issues at hand and they would run into trouble as soon players would significantly diverge on a given point from ccps position what would they do  release the data without taking into account these opinions later on would sunk their image release the data and later on take into account these opinions would create a precedent where players would expect said degree of compliance on every major issue perform the poll and not release the data would induce suspicion etcthats why you folks get the csm its a convenient solution when you dont really care interested players get the illusion that they can somehow influence the game by conveying some opinions and ccp reserves the right to care about the csm like the socks of their office cleaner grandmathere are plenty of consultative commissions in rl either in private or government spheres unfortunately in most cases these commissions are just a waste of time and resources anyone thinking on problems without enjoying the tiniest shadow of executive authority or guarantee that his opinions will be considered is as efficient in the achievement of a concrete solution than a guy making crosswords when pooing you may have fun at it but thats it
one can argue that about any major implementation of democracy but then i also tend to beileve that centralized democracies are the route of all evil but hey thats just meignoring the faults with the system i cant enirely agree with you here i believe that the csm is a compromise between the two interests i find it hard to believe that ccp are capable of so cold cynical and ultimatly logical thinking as to purely create the csm for pr purposes as any company capable of think in such ruthless terms would at least be able to release a bug free game couldnt agree more but then were talking about a buisness not a government and at the end of the day ccp has to do whats best for ccp not the player base although bare in mind that there interests are not always mutally exclusivebut once the system is in place it can be altered potentially for the better and lets face it the old adage is true there are no guarantees in life as someone very intelligent to me once said  it is easier to change something from within than to do from without
issler i understand your angst in this situation ccp has said that wardecs are essentially a paytogrief system and i concur with that judgementas a csm delegate it falls to us to tell ccp our ideas on how to improve this broken system goons will be goons that is inevitable now you know one of the reasons i remain in an npc corp
the only thing broken about the wardec system is that people like you can dodge it by staying in a npc corp

i just do not like bunyp
my vote went to the previous csm member who i felt did the best job of all of themi felt it important that said person remain on the csm to give it continuity
voted darius because the csm needs reps that are in the middle of the real 00 game good to see that at least he and vuk lao got on the council also voted sophie daigneau with hope that the csm can have real industrialist reps with a sensible perspective on the game as a whole and not just carebears that want to avoid any and all danger and risk that add industrialist to their name
not even 2 pages failalso if i make this 2 pages i fail
the numbers speak for themselvescongratz
what a joke
better luck next year ex
i have to say you are the only reason i bothered to vote its my patriotic duty to eve to give my vote to anyone but you the day ccp takes your ideas seriously is the day this game will die for the simple fact that wow already has the carebear market cornered and a toothless eve will be a playerless evei saw one of your videos you seem to take credit for every single change ccp has made impressive makes you wonder what ccps devs are doing what with you designing their entire game and all hmmthat said the im a girl who plays your computer game and im not that ugly has always been a certain winner in the mmo world and i dont see this principle faltering any time soon sadly enough
i dislike you
i dont know the slotbonus changes are not affected and frankly i still think the idea of making them heavy tacklers is a nice idea they dont necessarily need it as much now though
we dont need secure cans that large there needs to be some risk to miners as they have it far too easy anywayall secure cans should be hackable even if it took 60mins or longer to hack with little chance of succeedingcan flipping is fine as it is
since jetcans never was intended for mining and the secure cans are close to useless for miners then there is a real need for larger secure cans i can agree with you that mining shouldnt be without risk and the idea of a hackable secure can is fine i dont think miners have it easier than mission runners far from it infact the easiest isk maker in eve is running level 4 missions in empire space actually many mission runners are able to generate as much minerals by reprocessing loot as a skilled miner mining oremining in eve is broken and need to be fixed or atleast get some love and as far as ive heard ccp got some ideas for the mining profession so there is hope
unlucky scagga you deserved it more than a few of the people on there

absolutely agreed there is no reason whatsoever for me to use any form of conflagration ammo over say amarr navy multifrequency nerfs on t2 ammo need serious reduction to their penalties i dont want to see nerfs on faction ammo though just fix t2 damage ammo ffsamarr navy multifrequency l323 em damage23 thermal damage50 to optimal1m isk per crystallimited useconflagration l28 em damage28 thermal damage50 to optimal05 tracking multiplier25 capacitor need648k isk per crystallimited usemultifrequency l28 em damage20 thermal damage50 to optimal200k per crystalunlimited usedue to the severe tracking penalty and the cap usage penalty and we all know lasers drink cap like a hummer drinks petrol there simply is no reason to use the limited 3x more expensive t2 damage ammo over even its cheap unlimited t1 equivalent ps agreeing with mirrorgod from a while back leave scorch the hell aloneedit fyi domain region prices used lowest sell order
yeah the above example is a perfect one of how fked up t2 ammo isthe conflag crystal has 3 nerfs 1 of which stacks per weapon and does less damage than the completely nerfless faction multi and have you seen what dark blood multi does omfgremove all nerfs from t2 period end of statement faction is better and nerf free okay leave it that way leave it better than t2 but remove all the nerfsmgs da man he bought a ton of scorch off me at cost a while back

supported 100 drones are awesome give us m0aredit navy issue dominix too pls in deimos camosecond edit forgot to bloody tick
signed this is something that i have wanted the last four years
while the other representatives have already stated an interest in these issues id just like to support the option myself i fly drones often and theyre a weapon system that has been ignored except in the case of rampant nerfs for far too long
i object if theres going to be a navy dominix it should be black like the megathron navy issue speaking of navy domis wasnt there some reward for a tournament or something like it a good while back where the reward was originally a navy dominix but they swapped the reward at the end who knowsanyway even though ive signed i do hope well see changes when t3 ships come out and all manner of new stuff comes out in next big expansion next year would be a good time to add things like this i can see people hating them for the lag they make but they are easily destroyed and need constant replacements so any new modules to boost them would be great to make them a proper primary weapon systemps  drones are still stupid even after their so called memory upgrade as it was called
the gallente election event which they wouldnt let me run as a candidate for was supposed to award navy domis but we got navy throns instead i was not happysupporting this too tho as i am a rabid domi pilot
we want moar drone love
yes more love for the drones would be nice
so what ccp think actually about this concerns are you satisfied with the nerf and think that its all balanced now or there s still someone out there who pay attention on what ppl moans about
disagree with the nano nerf even with the missile rebalance is no longer possible to speed tank missile ships nearly as effectively you wanted a nano nerf missiles needed balancing too you cant have your cake and eat it if you wish to shoot at a smaller class use the approapriate t2 ammouse dronesget out there and play the game then report back
hmm seems like you didnt read or understand anything from what is written on those 15 pages we were saying that we were not able to hit targets of our size with max dmg  bs vs bs or bc vs bc etc even not only equal sizes but we even do crap dmg to moving targets bigger then our ships size this is with maxed missile and spaceship command and i already reported back if you go a few pages above now you go play the game with what i play with and report back
i think the changes are fine the missile nerf was needed given the way speed was nerfed i have an alt who runs missions in a raven and i cant say they are more difficult now this thing about doing max damage to ships of the same class in a turret based ship the only way i do max damage is if they are sitting still which should hold true for missile users and does hold true under the current nerf
i have been playing for approx 4 year almost solely pvp most kills with blasters and drones but also use lasers and misslesi sign this petition as the nerf was completely wrong and made a whole weapon category useless
yea sounds boring and tedious beyond measure alot in this game needs automation which would greatly increase the enjoyment of the game but i guess that is the price you pay for one of the biggest money making devices in the game
agreedpos managment is a chore that i would not wish on the most dedicated mineranchoring anything once the tower is in place and online should be defined by the characters anchoring skill or starbase management skill or something you can anchor or unanchor one item per level of skill subsequently the supporting skill would reduce onlining timealso introduce fuel rod blueprints 1 for each race each run of the blueprint would produce a fuel rod for 24 hours of a standard pos and reduce the size of the fuel load by no more than 10 you will still need to bring the consumables for powergrid cpu load and starbase charters but the raw fuel needs to be made a whole heck of a lot more logistic friendlyoh and for the love of jove make enriched uranium fit into cans i hate nothing worse than trying to lay aside my next durations fuel in a can only to be told that i cant fit my uranium into it
i understand that ccp intends to make drastic changes to the entire soverignty mechanic but until then dont decrease tower anchoring time just increase the number of items that can be anchored at a time once its in placeonce sov 4 has been achieved limit the possiblity of anchoring towers to corps with 1 to the soverign allianceif two forces are at war or have negative political standings increase anchoring time for the faction that has the weaker nonexistant soverignty status and put up a beacon in local that lets everyone know whats going down for the soverign alliance only
pos deployment we hates it yespreciousbuilding on the idea of predeploying a posposinaboxyou basically get out into space and prefit the pos selecting from a list of possible towers and structures note that this requires no actual items once you have your pos design all set out you complete it and receive something like a bpc or reaction lets call it the deployment plan or dp you then take the pos tower out and anchoronline it as normal then drop all of the modules for it into a new storage space along with the dp then hit the deploy button on the pos and watch all your pretty structures appear and begin anchoring and onlining one at a time once done you can recover the dp from the tower and reuse it as much as you likenote that you cannot make an impossible dp such as a small tower with 50 large guns cpu and pg requirements will be checked during dp creation
add a tax to anyone in an npc corp starting at zero and slowing growing to a maximum of 25 as a function of their age in eve something like1 month 53 month 106 month 151 year 202 years 25as long as the wardec system is so called pay to attack npc corps should be pay to be safe
currently it is too cheap to wardec a corp 12m a weekbasically free even a starting account can make that for that price a pirate or pvp veteran corp can cost industrialminingnewbsmall corp millions to billions maybe if it was raised to more like 20m a week or maybe 100m a week its just too cheap you force people into corporations they are going to quit some dont like the politics of corps or being bossed around by another as far as macros and farmers you wont be able to force them out all they need to do is create another account and they could also still hide under a large alliance the people you really are going to hurt are the nonpvp types and the new players and seriously at 6 months you dont have good enough skills to handle yourself out in the wild against people with 3 years worth of skills piracy is dead because there is no profit in low sec it has the same value as high sec or less but with all the risk of 0 sec veldsar is worth more per m3 than kernite and all other highlow sec ores and there isnt sufficient bonus in mission value for doing low sec agents plus low sec doesnt have the sweet ores moons etc of 0 sec seriously if you want to go fight someone go to 0 sec and stop complaining
unless they enjoy chatting with random people in the npc corpyes you just war dec each macro pilot individually because each pilot is in its own corp
too true too true but finding 5 separate corps mining into 1 jetcan scooped by an orca in a 6th corp would scream im a macro perhaps ccp might get off its ass and take a look follow their transactionsand i can make back my 2m wardec fee by popping just one of those macks or just sit my alt in their system so that their macro keeps them docked while i go to workimo they need to bring back the joining a gang with a warred party makes you open to attack hole that lofty screwed up so brilliantly that way when the orca tractors i can shoot it
1 taxation of a npc corp  stupidwhy isk is too easy to make and the worst case scenario is you lose your playerbase not to mention your bloody idea is biased and completely based on the fact you seek 247 pvping and wardecs up the wazoo2 wardecs are too cheap  factits too easy to form a corp mind your own damn business some hot shot corp sees 3 of your members flying battleships for the first time they get wardecedgriefed all in the name of fun but no one ever thinks of the other side and they call this  its a sandbox deal with it well sorry to say most players dont think that way3 this thread  stupidrepeatsorry do a search youll see this is the 1000th time its been askedall result in a nowin situationthe solution is lies in wardecing itself not the corpsi have no problem with wardecingmy biggest problem is theres nothing to stop the wardecs from being stackedrepeatedand dumped on for the most utterly stupid ideas on the planet other than smack talk or something rationaland what is the most frequent suggestions made1 you poor baby go join a bigger corpcounter well gee so no more new corps being made so much for new stuff in eve2 hire a merc corpcounter got the money for that we just started3 ditch your corp and leave an altcounter thats even worse4 go to 00 spacecounter you just bankrupted us thanks we can go to 00 on nothingso yes thats just the tip of the iceberg of reasons carebear or notyou guys need to find a middle ground or you will never get anywhereyes there are exploits but punishing npc corps is completely wrongyou need to fix the wardec system and how it functionsand you can forget attacking the macro problem i dont care how you spin it you will always make them stronger or short change the legitimate guysstart thinking 100 steps ahead of your short sightednessput yourself in the shoes of the individual your affecting before you go off on some wild harebrained idea
actualy with rest of csm not in noobcorps and few of us mentioning this particular issue in our campaign presentations this issue will be aproached but very carefully we need to fix current wardec system without allowing more griefing of noobies but to prevent people hiding in npc corps for eternity diversity we have atm in csm is great for issues like this when thoughts are drasticly divided needless to say that is allowing us to look at both sides of the medal and to aproach problem from every possible aspect
all this complaining about the war declaration system is bunk just an empty excuse not to join the game as it was intendednoobcorps were never intended to be the ultmate umbrella of immunity same for npc corps its a place to start offering immunity at a heavy cost for a limited period of time pretty much every game system solo or multi have a starting zone but to get very far in the game you have to leave the starting zonenpc corps offer the same immunity at a similar cost while youre looking for a new team or making a team of your own even if its an army of onecurrently war declaration is far from easy nor is it fast hah you guys saying its fast are a joke its 48 hours minimum to initiate a war obviously youve never declared one or paid for one on your own or hired a merc corppossible changes to the war declaration system like whatlast year i mentioned that we already have an existing system that could be modified to make war far more dynamic the contract system turn war into a contract with counteroffers and other requirements that when met end the war in 30 minutes rather than 24 hours currently any diplomacy has to be conducted on the metagame levelmake it more expensive no my gods youve already limited the number of wars one can have by exponential costs thanks bunches privateers and it takes 48 hours to get one going and if your target doesnt want to fight they dont have to they sit in station log or move often times a war corp wont see a single member of a 200 man corp until 10 minutes after it lapses or the targets just jump corpthat is a design that needs changing with any other changes to warfare corp jumping to escape wars needs to cease often times nuubcorps are wardecced by mercs because one of their nitwits smacktalks or steals and that nitwit jumps leaving the rest of the corp to deal with their actionsanother reason people who do war want people in declarable corporations is smacktalk and thieves hiding under the protection of npc corp skirts there is currently no way to deal with them having a nuubspy in an npc corp scouting you at a gate is bad enough since you cant get rid of them but someone that hides in an npc corp and smacktalks all day long is downright annoying for anyone outside of 00 and yes i reside in 00 i have fought wars in all security levels even fwthere are many reasons players want npc corps capped many want them outright declarable and there are no valid counter arguments to let them stay there without paying a cost for the immunity which is what they now enjoy
npc taxes arent the solution  that ultimately just becomes a way to pay to avoid a large part of the game dealing with other player corps honestly theres no reason why anyone older than a few months should need to be in an undeccable corp if you cant find anyone to run with at all in that time then somethings pretty much wrong with you not the game the only support i see for the issue is generally from the same type of people who dont want to deal with the risk of playing the game itll be a glorious day when those types of opinions are just ignored completely
fully in support of this given the general consensus in the rp community
im down with this because its better than retooling the jump clone system to accomodate barhopping
this is a bit of a difficult idea  it has the potential to be used as an intel tool as you can find out whos in a station remotelyits also antiimmersive which i am surprised that the role players would be for not signed
not at all an intel tool if it doesnt give you access to the stations roster o docked pilots maybe if they happen to be hnging out in the same bar as youi would argue as a long time rper it would be more immersive it would make sense that in eve they would have developed an advanced telepresence ability
face it man if you knew how to fight you wouldnt say this crap thanks for the free bump though i love it when tards learn to type you make all of mm look like a bunch of smack tards when i know they have people that know how to fight in nanos which was a skill fighting them was a skill flying interceptors was a skill earning the isk was a skill and having the balls to fly that much isk in something that could die with one error or lag spike is gone from eve this is just part of the bigger overall overhaul to the combat system the changes suck the design direction sucks and ccp continues to put a lot off effort in things that the players dont care about sure glad my subs are all canceled few more days left good time to try some other games anyway cheers
though it may be too late i cast my vote against these changes i feel just violated after the change too far too much too quickly just no
gotta love the fact that it has gone to over 70 pages and they just dont give a 
your right with a finit techtree there will be a point with no competition but the skilltree is finit too and there is always competition but when the system is resetet periodicaly then there is no improvementand what sense did research make without improvementand why should we clutter the database with lots of useless stuff we have t1 t1 metas and t2 atm and in around 3 months maybe t3 thats a lot to research we dont need new things industrie has other mechanics than pvp there counts isk and workforce the right wordso maybe obtaining a new tech should be really hard and there the competition can startmaybe an example on how to get a technologieyou and your corp have a bpo for a standart missile launcher ok now you need a skilled player scintist the bpo and maybe some of those t1 standart launchers and research can start maybe you can put in more scintists more bpos and more itemsso we have the isk and workforce mechanismafter some time and with a bit of luck maybe more than invention or less your corp gets the standart missile launcher technologiemaybe this can work as a bpo in every of you corp offices but cannot be stolen nor destroyedthen you can do standart mepe research with itor you can make a copybpo from it and sell it on the market so they would be stealable toook now your corp decides to make the next step and wants to research the meta 1 t1 standart launcher it requires the knowlege of the t1 standart launcher maybe some of the itemsoptional and a skilled scintist or moremaybe some other technologie too like gurista understanding heat controll whatever hope its understoodable what i want to say like i said make the techtree like the skilltree and let it take lots of time to gain new techlevels but also make technologie sellable so newer players can compete with isk and workforce with the older onesso basic technologies will be availabe to the newer players for a cheap price whats nearly like a reset maybe think about civilization or so and theyr techtrade
the difference is that there is a clear mechanic by which people can fight in space there is not such a mechanic by which people can fight for technological advantageeg lets say an alliance produces the first tech 5 bp after a reset that alliance would have the amount of research time it takes to produce tech 5 items producing and owning the only tech 5 items in the game if it took 1 month to research a tech 5 bpo then the things that they can do with this are impressive they could use the technological advantage to give them an edge in the war producing the items for their pilots and their pilots only they could sell the items at a large profit they could support the side of a conflict or induce people into conflict in trade for these itemsbut then why is there no improvement because constant improvement makes the game bad for the majority of the people in the end we have to remember that this is a game with ideally an expanding userbase we want people to come and stay and if they get here and the old guard are constantly increasing their skills and item quality then they wont want to stick around anyone who stops playing for a bit will lose competitive advantage and be unable to ever regain it this is a bad thing for the gamewhat sense does it make well as technology progresses the advances that are pioneered are eventually merged into the baseline performance that everyone sees what was expensive yesterday is cheap today what was extraordinary yesterday is commonplace today however we have already figured that we cannot just advance everything to infinity by the previous paragraphs such we have to find a way to simulate this constant advancement without actually doing it we simulate it by regressing the items and saying that the technological advancements have been assimilated into the norm now they offer no specific advantage over the baseline and because of that they have the same statistics
while your idea is interesting it has some huge flaws first off the database would have to expand dynamically in order to accommodate all the various tech levels of goods ccp has already said with ship customization that they refuse to do thissecond itd make the monopolies and starting character difference much more dynamic than it already is monopolies in any economic structure is a recipe for disaster and separating the veteran characters from the newer ones will not bode well for this gamesorry but i cant support this option
uhh are we reading the same proposal because in the first freaking post i list your two complaints as the biggest problems that need to be worked around and then spend the next two discussing how you do thatthis specifically lists a dynamically expanding database entry system as unfeasible and works to get around itthis specifically creates a system which limits starting character differences towards old characters the monopolies it creates are all temporary and not long lasting this nearly perfectly follows the model of patentswith regards to the second issue of monopolies1 monopolies in any economic structure are not a recipe for disaster in fact they are a necessary component for research and creative production to take place i assume you have never heard of a patent or copyright a copyright is an enforced monopoly on an piece of text it exists because if the person who creates the text cannot be ensured they can control it then they will never get paid a patent is an enforced monopoly on a methodtechnically a method of doing something it means that no one else can use your method until the patent ends this is in place because otherwise no one could make anything new without anyone else ripping it off and not having to pay the cost of research1 games are not perfectly competitive markets they are not constrained by the same laws that constrain real economies and the actions that a game company can take are not similar to the actions that a government can takein shorti am left wondering whether or not you actually read the proposal
my carrier can be a lovely solo pwn mobile ive never flown a nyx in combat but i cant imagine it being anything but better than a thanny except slower to lock but with double or so the dps w00t as for the size have you seen how big they are at the moment  for rp accuracy theyd probably need to be a big bigger but bear in mind youd never fit a domi inside a thanatos or a nyx for that matter its too fat innit so either theres a compression metric or ccp dont care too much about that sort of accuracy
sup
what rocket said flying a mom is tantamount to holding a sign up with kill me written in big neon lettersthey need either a complete role change to make them actually useful in fleets cos newsflash they aint or a serious buff in respect to dmg output and tanking ability
a massive increase to mothership ship maintenance bay to allow them to carry around a small fleet is a no brainer and should be included as a buff even if nothing else you propose changes
this is a good option but what about those of us who are csm delegates and have alts such as myself if we would be set to our csm delegate name or have the account name with the small csm delegate logo id be all for this
how about setting the forum system to only allow the highest sp character in the account to post usually the main granted the loophole is that someone can setup a forum alt account but on the flip side they will have to pay for that privilege
well i like this idea its not a new idea but its an important ideathe problem really comes down how ccp wrote the forum ccp now refuses to make major changes to the forum until they get around to doing a new onebut i think its important to push for a new forum and for this kind of functionality the first csm was asked at our last meeting with ccp what we thought were the single most important issue i think its he forum im sorry to say the current one stinkswe need a new forum and we need to get rid of alt posting its long due
terrible ideastealth nerf versus alt scams alt spies and alt activities in generalimplementing an ignore button is a better idea to let each user filter out the noncontributors and blatant alts they dont want to read
this either implies your guilty of said actions or your paranoid o have something to hide
oh noezouted as bobaltspythats why this idea sucks 
it would not affect eve at all just the forums your evil alting ways would be perfectly safe
grinding for reward i think its already in the gamegrind for loyalty points  moneygeargrind for sec status  cops dont shoot at you  get to be a nasty pirate guilt free for 15 minutes till it drops back below 5grind for isk  factiont2 rig fittednavy issue ships that look great on our kill mailsgrind for status  access to agentsprice discountsrpi think the real reason this keeps popping up every 6 months or so is because some people just cant get over the fact that they will never catch the oldest players in terms of spits not fair sure but eve wasnt ever about things being fair which makes it all the more interesting
agreed no skill grind please isk macros are bad enough without seeing buffbots as well
daily quests are bad
thanks for the laugh op
whati do not think sonot supported
because i havent seen any good arguments against thisyeah give me carkeys bleep bleep and make those lights flash too
ccp or representativetopic severe interference while running private missionsproblemwhen running missions i and others are being interfered with by real playerssome players are becoming a nuisance and will cause the mission to fail by repeated harassementim referring to the vandalistic individuals camping out in the mission locations some even hint to extort isk to let you complete one instance in particular i am running a storyline mission and am being prevented to complete it short of bringing in a militia of my own to combat real opponents the intruder asked for 60 million isk to let me complete  in normal gameplay i would say he needs commended for his crafty strategy but to trap people in missions he should not be allowed to abuse the gaming system his profile mentions the trap and even brags about itdiscussionsome argue that an open universe is what eve is all about i agree totally in normal gameplay eve is the best game out there for economics both financial and strategic but in missions i strongly disagree that this open universe concept applies as its more like player against environment the typical scenario i use to explain this is as follows  ask yourself when running a storyline mission does it sound correct to be ganked by 5 real players what part of the intended story was that you will have a hard time convincing me that being ganked by 5 real players is a part of the kiddnappers strike mission by the way ccp did a great job writing the mission if others were prevented from messing it up the mission was well balanced with my skills until these 5 players interferred the last round of harrasment cost me one awesome maelstrom plus about 300 million or morein lost augmentations and ship equipment i would not mind the loss if it had been in pvp where i accepted the risk openlyproposalmy proposal is to create instances where the person granted the mission and his chosen fleet can compete with the intended opponents  npc players onlyi love to fight real people but not while in missions please i am trying hard to raise faction standing and i want focus on that while running these missions that entail many hours and a great deal of dedication to complete this concept is the same as concord policing in high secplease dont get me wrong  ccp has done a wonderful job with this game genius in fact i merely bring this subject to attention so that the game may be more enjoyable and fairthank youzeur femmefataleceo  zeur ethereal group
no instances neversorry
if no instances for missions then offer another solution pleasethis is a critical flaw
hello zeurwhile in games like world of grindcraft you can have instances barring the doors to the dungeon etc in eve were in space even though we have deadspace we can still warp to beacons and suchi know what youre talking about regarding mission invaders and thats why i created one possible solution linked in my signature while i have no problems with people invading your space there should be a way to defend against them and that is part of my ideaif you dont like the interference just move to a different agent there are many agents out there and while you might take a small hit to your income in a lowerquality agent youll get the peace of mind that comes with a greatly reduced chance of invaders
hey bunyipthanks for your mature responseproblem is i find all higher level agents tend to drag me into low sec where the problems occur correct me if im wrong here as i havent been to all corners of the universe yetdont get me wrong i love to fight pvp and that is what im skilling up for its just when im in mission mode im in mission mode ya know will look at your suggestion linkthanks againzffps  im not a wow fan either yak
solution  get friends
whats next allowing gankers to camp mission areas frequented by rookiesi swear no one thinks of anything beyond pvp freedom 247
no please no instancesbut some way to defend yourself as bunyip suggested would be good people shouldnt have the ability to camp missions but should still be able to probe you out and warp to you then if you gank me on a mission you shouldve worked for it imoab
absolutely not supported as it would destroy an essential characteristic of eve
you have ways to defend yourself watch scanner stay aligned refuse lowsec missions be extra vigilant with scanner watching if you move around unalignedits pretty much impossible to catch a lowsec mission runner whos on the ball
thanks for all of your replies and thoughtsi believe khan has the best answer interimis anyone trustworthy willing to fleet up and assist in completion of this missionor could you refer me to a protection companyi pay a handsome rewardplease let me know if you have information as my mission counter is tickingbest regardszff

giving out medals  not a terrible ideagiving out commodities with an in game value  terrible idea and just asking for a t20 scandalor you could always click the volunteer panel on the elft and apply for the bughuntersim sure they get rewards
last i checked volunteers dont get anythingits to prevent any unbalanced effects or conspiracys with the benefitstatus of being in said program
are you confirming you are on the volunteer programme and speaking with absolute correctness
they got cool badges for fanfest just like the csm do i wouldnt be surprised if ccp paid their flight and hotel for fanfest as wellbut volunteers are volunteers if they got a medal it would out their mains that would get them removed form the bh program the issue here is that people dont tend to fill in bug reports bug hunters are there to try and reproduce the bug reports we do so the logic is kinda flawed
i like the idea of superficial rewards like medals or flags on your character or whatever but i dont like the idea of giving actual shipisk rewards etc the idea is to encourage people to actually report bugs not to get people to spam reports with the hopes of getting free stuff
seriously have you tried ratting in lowsec i have gave that up fast i just think that pve against npcs in the various levels of security space should scale with the risksec status of the system highsec as compared to lowsec is completely too profitable because the standard there is level 4 missions while missions in lowsec are too engaging to notice the pirate fleet warping up your assas for the proposed changes just making people richer i respectfully disagree there are no lowsec pveers now because there is no wealth to be had  you have to be rich before you can become richeryoure right about the real problem being the risk attendant to lowsec operation though even if lowsec rats and minerals were buffed considerably the risk would probably increase not decrease so i hope that once the viceroy system is implemented there will be a way of protecting your space against unwanted incursions as of now there is absolutely no way to operate safely
i support this issuemoar targets
yesmade millions then moved to nullsec and raked it in bigquitter
agreed the topic about poses is also very relevant and they should have a status inheritance from the controlling corporationwhile increasing the number of hostile corps might be a strain on the database we could have an option for people who hop corps to have it amber this pilot used to be part of a corp that you are hostile to another way to make this easier is to allow whole alliances to be set to negative standings instead of just the individual corps
somehow the idea is familiar to me small change  big improvement
yesid also like to see more base medals and more images to put on them such as stuff like a lion bear griffon book lotus and that sort of stuff as the medals are quite limited now and we got too many swords birds and laurels in there
signed ill add this to the list of changes i support from my website
hey if you say youve got a website link it ayall of you csm folks should have a way for us to carry on discourse on the subjects you support that is away from the confusion and flames of the forums somewhere where you can just merrily delete dissenting viewpoints or ban flamers  trolls
hmm sorry i really dont like the idea at all you are nerfing the ships that i fly as a pirate i fly often a cruiser or t2 frigate basicly i need a whole big ass gang just to get 1 target i get engaged by that navy wherever i attack my targetno i even prefere that sentries would kill a bs in a instand then nerfing all the ships where i am specialized in i wouldnt be able to kill a bloody frigate with my own frigate a cruiser wouldnt be able to do the job because they warp off way to fast anyway no no  nooo
so you want to make piracy in anything less than a hac impossiblestupid idea
assembly hall is the new caod
currently you can see a dev post or a gm post or a moderator post by the nicely colored bar in the forum listingccp please implement a color tag for csm posts so we know what posts theyre actually bothering to respond to i dont believe green is currently in use
supporting myself of course because the ccp web coders wont let me do it when i create this thread
that was one of our initial suggestions to ccp i can see that it was obviously left out do i think its a good idea yeahi will look to inform ccp that a green set of bars for csm posts but only in the csmrelated forums is something that would be lovely
i agree to this and think it could be used in the planetary interaction concept however the option to enslave should also be available for the amarr if the livestock become useful again as with planetary interaction this has a whole option available to it which i plan to describe on my webpage
the meeting in iceland is more than a chance to meet the other representatives and familiarize yourself with where they stand on key issues it also allows the developers to review the candidates whom the playerbase voted into officethis is also one of our only benefits for taking on the responsibility of being a delegate having it at the end would seem too much like a good job now get out of the way instancewhile the issues may be better developed over the time the players acted in the csm role it would nevertheless be counterproductive imho for those issues the delegates meet quite often to discuss ideas and debate about their practicalityeffect on the game
the ceo does not the directors
i never know ceo gets mail thanks for giving input thats even more simple for ccp to deliver it to directors level but almost all things that ceo can do directors can also do and ceo isnt online all the time plus many directors are recruitment heads and suffer greatly for not having this feature if directors get the application for entry into corporation then why not he should receive the resignation too
this is hilariousjust proves a lot of peoples concerns on the electionif goon cannot keep csm issues out of gamewould it stand to reason that they couldnt keep in game politics out of the csm
tadao
so for folks that have wondered not such a big deal we are enjoying blowing them upissler
in the end goonnoobs are nothing more then theyre name implies 
it hasnt failed has it you are here now whining like a lil baby about iti pity the peeps that voted you in as a csm
you know i didnt agree with much with darius in the last session of the csm but seriously this wardec mechanism as a pay to grief theme is terrible eves huge selling point is the freedom and consequence of actions in the single server environment and you cant really separate things off completely even csm reps deserve to have fun in game at the end of the day hell i wardecced the goons last session because darius annoyed me in council its just a thing you know
omg i agree with jade this is a weird feeling
voted for anybody other than goonas the recent activity on isslers corp and its postshowgoons cannot seperate csm and game play
the csms only purview is gameplay we play a video game you play it too
are you telling me its just a video game blasphemy
eve is far from a video game its an addictive substance that has weakened my will towards everything else in realitythe csm is concerned about gameplay but its also a group of real people interacting not just characters there should be some differentiation of fantasy and reality even in the csmoh and if it matters i voted for myself not very altruistic but i really believe in the things my candidate has to say
for me there was only really one optionlvvftw
i voted darius johnson due to his valuable experience as a returning council member his proven ability to get things done and his push for what i believe are positive changes for eve onlineissler
no miners in npc corps are almost risk free you cant war dec them you cant suicde gank them and if they are using secure containers you cant flip or steal from them mission runners in empire space are not risk free agent runners lose ships all the time you cant say the same for empire miners can you
mission runners in npc corps are also protected in the same way as miners you cant war dec them if mission runners pay attention and dont accept missions beyond their capabilities they shouldnt loose shipsunaware miners also lose ships to rats but its very rareits not true that you cant gank a miner in high sec space goonswarm made that clear for alot of miners with their jihad swarm operationdue to the restrictions for secure cans you cant really make a living mining with them since they need to be spaced a certain distance from other cans and ore it makes it very impractical when the cargospace m3 in the container is so small ofcourse you can use them and be pretty much risk free but your iskhour is so low that most people wont bother with it and do missions insteadive heard of people doing level 4 missions that simply warp into the missions in their marauder bs and perma tank the rats then put out their drones to take care of the rats while watching a movie on tv if that isnt easy isk i dont know what is
they shouldnt loose ships but they do loose shipsthat is very raresince the jihad swarm operation suicide ganking has been rendered near impossible by changes to concord response time and the whole security review suicide ganking simply isnt a viable operation anymorethat isnt risk free as there is always risk to your ship and you stand to loose a great deal if your marauders tank fails this is not easy isk
if you want to be safe from ore theft bring a hauler along alt account or friend whatever if youre not willing to do that deal with the risks bringing up the safety of mission runners is pointless as well since thats a whole other problem that needs a solution thatll bring it more in line with other moneymaking ways making mining safer in reaction to that is the exact opposite direction game changes should be going in this is eve online not world of starcraft
we need you to show your support for this
i think its a good ideai also think the buddy list should just be emptied whn the name is changed and then the character can tell anyone who they actually want to know their name that they haveare going to change it would make much more sense seeing as one of the reasons people change their names is to try and not be recognisedas for people saying about scammers and thieves abusing this feature surely the fact that you can already have 2 alts along with your main on a single account is more than enough for them to change their identity when they wantneed to the employment history could stay the same so if you knew of any events in other corps you would still be able to link them to the various corps and add 2 and 2all in all it has my support
its an interesting idea but the name is the main human identifier in eve what gains and loses reputation in the universe id definitely like to do this with 2 of my characters really crap names from other players in additions to other suggestions here the scam factor could be removed by only enable any character ie characterid to change name once ever only the name changes nothing else not id etc this way all the friends lists would be current flag the character id information with former nameas a side effect i can see the market for sold characters would become more popular as people could pick a new name for the character when they bought it and would presumably differentiate 2nd hand characters vs 3rd 4th etc characters
i think a good solution would be allow faction t2 ammo with stacked bonuses and penalties
i find it hilarious that already ship having primary weapon system something else than drones like missiles and has very limited drone bay still has to rely on drones providing significant amount of dps usually around 30 even on missileboatso no drones dont need boost they are already overpowered in so many waysif there would be any new additions to drones those should be very carefully nerfed accordingly to keep all that stuff in balance
i agree that drone dps is fine but all the other drone abilities need some love implants and tech 2 fittings would be nice too
i dont think their use should be enhanced in any way shape or form on none drone specialized ships personally i would limit their use a lot more for non drone dedicated ships but that is not the point of this threaddrones are now being used to fill gaps in ship balance for missile and gun boats but this everyone gets some method means those drone dedicated ships cant be augmented no new drone modules or implants can be added without boosting 80 of the ships out thereand i agree that on non dedicated drone boats they are just right in dps and such overpowered even but dont nerf the domi or myr cause you want to reign in the raven or thoraxfor the dedicated drone users and their drone specialized ships it means we get ignored cause our beloved drones have been pimped out onto almost every ship ever madebut just to clarify i am not asking for any added utility or whatever for non drone dedicated shipsi am asking for the same attention to be given to dedicated drone users that has been given to gun and missile users since day oneif it were up to me i would limit what drones could be used on gun and missile boats why should a caldari raven use ecm drones as well as a ship built around the use of all droneswhy do you have to nerf every other utility drone so bad that using them is stupid because they are allowed to be used by every ship with a big enough drone bayi am asking for ccp to make up their mind and show some love to us drone users not buff drones as a secondary weapons system for anyone elsethat is what has happened with every utility drone out there and look what you get they are worthless to use even on drone specd ships when was the last time you saw energy nuet drones being used how about td drones wellyou see tons of ecm drone used by non drone specialized ships why cause if my myr or domi uses 5 ecm drones of any size i will be blown to bits cause my major bonus is to drones and their damagepersonally i would double the drone control cost on non drone specd ships i would add bonuses to all the drones when used by a dedicated drone boat i would make their use of advanced drones on a raven or a typhoon difficult and basic so that the more complicated drone drones could be used by the ships that are built around them using them to fill a gap in ship design has screwed us if you add damage mods for normal drones you boost 80 of the ships in service not because no damage mod is needed but because drones are d out to every ship in the universe now daysbut this is not about thatit is about ccp realizing they need to pay attention to them and stop whoring them out fix it so that if you boost drone ships you dont end up boosting every ship in eve balance drones to work well on drone specd ships and give those who train for it fun and interesting toys that every other weapons system has had from the beginningdont get me wrong it is a big job ccp will have to make some changes in the basic use of drones by every ship in the game to begin adding drone based contentthere is a flaw in drone implementationit effects every drone capable ship in eve 80 ships in useand if it isnt addressed drones will fall into a addon role forever religated to a secondary role no new drones or implants or mods will be successfully introduced they will become ho humi would prefer that doesnt happen
so neededgallente navy ogresgallente navy gardesdominix navy issuerogue drones dominix
i wouldnt say drones are overpowered seeing as how easily they are destroyed forgotten and left behind requiring very good skills in a proper drone ship or as close to one as we have now  domivexor etc to do any meaningful damage to the target of course when you add 5 drones from each person then we start to see a difference but even then nondrone ships dont really contribute to the damage seeing as how their damage comes from missilesgunswhateverthe only real boost drones had if you can call it that when the ships speed were reduced allowing drones to actually hit their intended targets light drones are now more dangerous to things like inties etc as stated drone damage is ok right now but still not a primary weapon and we do need new drone modules as well as t2 modules listed earlier as well as the implantsas for new drones better rogue drone drones the augmented and improved for all the races as well as things like andb praetor gnss ogres cndg wasps and rfd berserkers as well as the smaller drones and sentry

this is probably already mentioned but want to note it into this threadhave training to a specific certificate so you just select training for the certificate all skills on the certificate are trained and balanced it by having a tradeoff of cycletraining the prerequisite skills by cycle training the skills i mean train all prereqs level 1 then all level 2 etc so nothing gets to the prereq required level until all other required skills are at the prereq required level 1then its not useful for training level 5 skills repeatedly but is useful for training where you have lots of short skill changes or inconvenient ones
3 year old player should have found joincreate new corp button already im pretty sad for them who havent pso definetly supporting the basic idea and tax for npc corps oh yeah baby
or you have no interest in others just like kewl internet spaceshipsccp im pretty sure are aware of this issue maybe theyve even heard of it before this thread not sure how much action your going to get out of them since they are a business and this just might affect their bottom line as there are a bunch of people apparently enough to complain about that dont want to play this way im just sayinak
whaa people dont want to pay this game to be my targets2 thread number 1 million care to give any reason to support your argument beside but changes need to be made a totally unsubstantiated argument based on your gaming preferences
pvp pilot anyone starting combat with another pilot not allowed to get any mission as they are clearly homicidal psychopaths in eve not rlthese change wont kill the game for any of the pvp players as they will easily create pve alt to accept the mission that will be done by the pvp main see how your logic can be used for really stupid arguments like yours
wrong as usual stonedit scream we are all the property of 1 player or even we were a industrial corp but after the last wardec we decided to split 6 ways to make life more difficult for the grieferscurious as several different dev have stated more than once that avoiding war dec moving in npc corps is a intended game mechanic
alas the war dec system is broken beyond repair esp high sec wars but it certainly needs looking at fees need to be higher for sure the reason it is broken is that eve is full of pvpers who mostly have got either carebear alts or alts as scouts and haulers in non aligned corps earning them there isk and giving intel and logistics so while the pvpers make war they are free to also keep operating earning isk with alts i guess the war system can only work if it is corps fighting over resources or something tangible and not just for the fight ie the corps need to be balanced encompasing all types of playstyle miners industiralists traders  misionrunners and the pvpers all in together in the same corp which would be impossable to do as everyones alt charactors and 2nd accounts etc would need to be placed in the same corp and people would just hate that  me incl risk and reward and all that because there is no risk to the pvp corp as they get a fight which is what they want but their carebear alts get all the reward with no risk as they get buisness as usual anyway i do beleive the npc corps should get taxed and makes sense to say after 3 months it is set at an average player corp rate which i guess is 10
so people allowed to play eve are only those that can dedicate at least an average of 3 hours day to it are willing to wake at strange hours for the mandatory corp ops and so onnpc corps are good for players with limited time you get to find a lot of people on line to cooperate and chat without the need to guarantee your presence and availability for tomorrow ops or the defence of the corporate assetswhen i run my npc corp alts i speak and sometime collaborate with people that is going to bed while i am doing breakfast before going to work but if for some day or week i dont log in nothing negative will happen to them or me because of my absence those alts in the npc corp have no reason or need to be in a player corporation what they do has no need for a corporation support so why i should limit them because you cant find enough member for your corporation or enough targets the only way to cure the problem is to get better player run corporations not worse npc corporation i have seen my share of player corporations and most ceo are only serf serving interested in aggrandizing themselves and bossing over other players some corp has a good leadership both competent and not sel centered those corps have success the other see the players leaving for the npc corps
thisi once told a corpmate all i was really after was people to talk to in corp chat and occasionally mine with an npc corp provides the former better than most player corps but doesnt the latter criminal flagging doesnt carry over even to other gang members since i havent trained mining past rank 1 on this character the mining thing isnt a big deal yetyes running a corpguildclan in an mmo requires real world skills not entirely the ones a real business calls for but close the most effective mmo ceo types ive dealt with have been people who are lower or middle management in real life generally in industries that have a fair amount of turnover
your getting warmer folks but you got one major problem your attacking human nature and greednot an easy thing to fix and most dont give a damni agree tho better player owned corps who do more team work and less frakking around
yea lets just make up complete nonsense instead of coming with actual arguments that will work most corps do not require you to play or log on at certain times certainly not high sec corps and you always have the option of making your own corp complete bs it has nothing to do with corp leadership and everything to do with beeing immune to attacks in high sec thats why many people in good corps in high sec and 00 keep their alts in a npc corp to separate their isk makinghauling chars from their pvp chars etc
no change is necessary for this stuffthey should simply have a graduated tax for newb corps with failwarfare npc corps negatedif you make 50mil an hour and ur in a newb corp 10 tax going to the newb corp is fineif you make 5mil an hour  1 tax is fineyou are paying for your safetythe exception obviously is trading and such which isnt taxed by corp tax
and this is the one thing that always destroys this argumentno one  especially ccp wants to see an even larger number of 1 man corpsif you try to stop people jumping into npc corps they will simply make 1 man corps and do the same thing and as stated before the thing you guys are complaining about is an intended game mechanic ccp has stated so in dozens of places using alts as spies and to escape paytogrief was intended
says the pot calling the kettle black
its not unianimously supported mr yatta
yep seems there is a group all for and a group all against while i know you cant please everyone with every new thing you implement i see this suggestion more and more as a work in progress and food for thought about which impact ambulation will have on roleplay of course ambulation is for everyone to enjoy so it should be tailored so it is an enjoyable addition for each play style it was also not my intention to speak on behalf of the entire roleplaying community that would be rather naive of me sorry if it seemed like that
i think the funniest thing about this expansion is its not an expansion its just a patch of nerfs and a ship or two coming back to this after 8 months its a tad disheartening im not the type of guy who will take a punch if i can just step to the side and punch back thats why nanoships fit me so well well this has really killed most of the fun in the game for me i might have to think again about staying
with the recent nerf bat to the face of the stealth bombers i for one demand the ability to warp while cloak to put this class of ship in line with recon and black ops ships ccp you owe us sb pilots some freaking slack of this magnitude
bah bombs just dont work as intended you might as well strap a jacket of c4 on and scream viva amarr as you drive into the enemy line end result is pretty much the samesb are not viable in their role any longer theyre hardly a threat to even a basic fit riftergive them the ability to fit cov ops cloaksgive them the ability to passive target while cloaked at 10 their max uncloaked scan resincrease their cruise missile bonuses to a 250 explosion radius and 250 explosion velocty remove the range and damage bonusesreduce bombs to cost lest per run than the ship launching themand another great role for them anticovert warfare enable a cloaked covert ops the ability to find other cloaked ships with their onboard scanner they would of course then have to chase it down to decloak it but only while they are cloaked and are subsequently decloaked themselves
i actually like that idea its not giving them too much because you are only given a range for the cloaked ships hmm thinking about it again im not sure this would allow a sb to find a cloaked ships range then have normal ships warp to them at that range still might not be too much
i agree with making bombs less expensive however i do not think the vulnerability while deploying should be removed once a bomber drops a bomb it should be a sitting duck if it didnt come with supportsupporting because bombs still need to be looked at
no it would apply to the game as well thieving and stealing are part of eve implementing this idea would make it harder to dounsupport
another approach would be to only enable posting to the forum from the character with the most skill points on any account that would force players to use the voice of their most important character by skill investmentironically that would mean i cant post with this character but at the same time i could shuffle my other characters off the account if its really so important to me to post with this character i could live with that for better quality forums and less trolls and shas anyone noticed an improvement in caod posting since the requirement to have at least 10 people in your corporation was introduced
letUFFFDs try
uh where do you get that idea fromthe boards and the game are completely independent of each other they just happen to share the same account systemyou could just as easily severe the 2 of them and have them tied to the primary account like your username or whatever name you wish to don for that mainthe problem is this post with your main crap that goes on with all the alts upon alts upon altsparanoid much peoplex o d
no this would encourage macroing and grinding which are already too constant part of this game and should be get rid of in my opinionpoint of eve is not to gather most of skillpoints as fast as possible so you could oneshotkill all other players in game too bad theres already too much that also
whoa i must be getting tired theres no way a thread this silly could exist
me vote against op idea
current method good
i think this would be great for doing batches of t2 production from invention to the sale of the final product i was complaining about the current deficiency of the wallet and its lack of divisions to my roomate the other daythe ability to automatically calculate expenses and credits would be a major improvement
really good idea
simple but very nice idea
what about having an actual bank where you could put your money in that earned interest make is like a real savings accountthen it would be more obvious for players what they were doing wouldnt require additional clutter of the player ui and youd get the bonus of interestthe simple reason not to do this is it already exists eve bank
this is a complete rehash of the previous 426 threads about either subject created in the last 365 days and as such contains no new ideas or proposals but does allow me to pass myself of as a devout eve purist who has wholeheartedly dedicated his forum life to attacking those who refuse to play the way eve was intended to be played and by that i mean how i say you should play the game upto and including such a time that it leads to the downfall of eve at which point i will blame the carebearsyes i am aware that this is a troll but please prove to me how this idea is any different from all the other idea thread which propose the same solutions to one or two of the games least important problems which ccp has stated it is already looking into so your solutions are doubly redundant over and over and over again each time get voted down or drowned out with logical argument
absolutely brillianti stand in awe of your scintillating intellectak
yes lets force everyone to play the game the way you think it isgreat ideafacepalm
hello alli was just wondering what you all would think about the possibility of introducing multiple undock points as seen in this traileri believe that by introducing multiple undock points stations will feel busier this would also reduce the congestion around undock points
yesstop ignoring thisdoooo ittttsigned
actually im somewhat in favor of instancing not for the everyday humdrum missions but instances dedicated to new in depth epic fleet missions
me vote against instancing
only if the rewards of those missions cant be removed from the instance
another reason people move out of lowsec its far too easy for someone to wander in and rip the mission group to ribbons and no matter how many friends you bring they will bring moreim all for the ability to lock the gates so long as the hunters do have some complicated skill intensive process to get in skill intensive to reduce the number of throwaway alts used solely for that purposeor have the mission rats cycle to new arrivals so the pirates dont have tens of rats on their sideno closed instancing however no need we have plenty of spaceanother alternative method is to move the missions in lowsec beyond 25au from the system center this will force mission pirates to use lowstrength long range probes and more time to find their target currently many missions are within areas that can be scanned by an exploration probe with its x1000 scan strength
thishowever moving missions farther out could be a problem with running out of cap to warpbut thats minor compared to the problem of mission ganking
what private missions are no private missions in eve you must be mistaken you can scan down anyone in a mission thusly its public missionoh and before you whine about me being a pirate or something my sec status is 59 and faction standing above 95 im a carebearas opposed to you have to do your missions in these missions hubs if they steal mission completion items id just petition it and keep bothering the gms until they fix the issue perhaps declining the mission without loss ive yet to have someone scan me down and ive done a ton of missions the issue clearly here is you being in motsu or dodixieno never at no time dont hold your breath forget it nevermore not at all not ever not in any way not in the least not on your life not under any condition no way in hell should we ever get instances
one of the great things about eve is that there is no instancing instancing is really a bad idea as stated above the adapt or die scenarios described above are really where the solution lies maybe youre highlighting a larger problem though  why are so many people joining eve to play mmos mmo solo is it just that elite was a brilliant game concept and needs a chat client to go with it
lowsec is underutilized omfg your kiddingwhy is lowsec underutilizedbecause there is nothing to do in lowsec that cannot be done as well in high sec and safer or nosec and safer except piratingpvping easier than hisec  and dont have to deal wbubbles from 00  and thats just not drawing the people in is itif the only thing better about lowsec is the ability to pvp then thats who its going to attract which seems to have limited the base so to speakhow to attract other types of playersonly one way  designimplement changes that make doing something in lowsec better  easier  more lucrative than doing the same thing in hisec or 00ideascorporations  that are headquartered in lowsec get a 25 bonus to taxed income not out of the players pockets just added for all income generated in a system of 4 security or lowermining  capturable mining belts different ores defendabledeployable bunkers to mine a belt frommissioning  i have no clue how to fix this  pve ships are just shiney targets for pvp fitted ships and pvp fitted ships dont pve very wellinvention  maybe a new type of complex mad scientist complex  first person that finds it can research or produce 3 or 5 or 10 or 50 blueprints at 50 increased level this would draw people out with nice loot toomanufacturing  npc stations give a discount on manufacturing done on their stations because of players bringing business out to the hinterlands npc stations not collecting taxes on new corps formed to manufacture items in low sect2t3 production pluses in low  sec absolutely have the right idea here man  lowsec your home away from 00hisec spacei do think that with wormholes ccp may be bringing some of these changes about well have to wait and seeakedited for spellinggrammer and to show support
i do not believe the prospect of wealth is enough to overcome player hesitation of entering low sec i do not believe this is an issue of reward at all but rather an issue of disproportionate riskthis may be an issue where eves open pvp may be too open for its own good but thats just my opinion
its exactly the same whether its because its too dangerous or not rewarding enough it still comes down to risk vs reward there are two solutions to that making it safer and making it more rewarding i dont really see how making it safer is an option aside from the players working together so that leaves you with upping the rewardswhat is needed is for the rewards to become significant enough for a corp to move to low sec as a whole which would in turn make it a safer place having friendlies in localas with 00 though low sec should not be a place for players with no interest in pvp there just has to be something worth fighting for low sec ores need a significant boost high sec missioning needs a nerf im sorry but the income from a well trained l4 mission runner is completely ridiculous for the zero risk they put themselves at low sec exploration is already profitable but giving it a boost wouldnt do any harm low sec rats are fine as they are it can provide a good income to new players who are willing to take the risks it shouldnt be a considerable income for any experienced playerso yes supported but not your proposal in its entirity
surely at least all the corporation logos should be available as part of the medal designs as well i mean medals are generally for a service provided to the corp kinda thing
this issue somehow improves the game for the majority of players after all the campaigning on much more urgent and serious matters this is the first issue you deem important for the players of eve hells teetharithron
sounds good
i would like to see the morphite replace by equal value of tritanium at the ccp standard price ie trit is 2 this would allow drones to still be valuable and not nerf drone space it would also lower the mining value of veldspar in empire
in last expansion the drone droppings got nerfed by like 33 from lvl 4 missions
i still say it would be an interesting idea
just goto venal seems like its pretty quiet right now there you lose the ability to stop others from docking and messing with your marketif you cant see the difference between outpost vs titan vs unique tournament trophy why botherso what happens when you have a griefer alliance all they do is go around to capture outposts give them to the enemy andthen move on then like all outposts eventually become npc stations
interesting idea and would need to be balanced by being able to capturetake over npc stations from npcs as well from an rp perspective couldnt an npc faction simply take over the outpost if they wanted it maybe something to organise via eventspersonally id like to see all npc stations have the behaviour of outposts so that you can actually disable services on npc stations dofc the time to repair would be pretty short when all the guristas healing carriers showed up
hadnt thought of that then again it is low sec and not no sec if you dont want concord to be coming down on you goto actual 00 so you can operate solo in small shipsif the change means im protected from frigs and similar from attacking me i then have to only worry about hacs or larger i can count on my escape time and disappear before being targetted this would be a good increase in security that might be plenty to actually get miners and mission runners into low sec
so you wouldnt mind the sentries be increased 10x the dps 3500 dps aka 100 no gatecampsthatd make traveling through low sec very easy but not doing anything in low sec

sigh goonswarm peeing about again wardeccing is paytogrief atm simply because the system cannot handle super alliances like bob or the goons id say that wardeccing in highsec space should be still allowed but at a much higher cost than it is now as well as making sure that sec status is still hit for the pvping
i say this without a trace of ironygo play world of warcraftevery time someone like you posts it just really strikes me that this isnt the game for you things like the wardec system and never being truly safe arent little fringe features added theyre core values the fact that people like you can play the game not like these features and then actively try to change them is pretty disgusting
see this this is the dumbest thing ive ever read about internet spaceshipswe get wardeced more than anyone else in the entire game hope this helps
theres a difference though we like it

so yeah ive been spotting the same tendencieshabitsbehaviorisms throughout nearly all mmos and thought it would be interesting to post them here enjoytop 10 mmo golden rulesor a checklist for developers to consider1 if there is the possibility for abuse or exploitation ingame players will always find it and abuse the hell out of it to its fullest extent2 players will always look for ways to cheat whether it be through ingame mechanics third party software or by some other method3 when given the choice players will always choose the path of least resistance the fastest easiest cheapest and laziest route to their end goals4 content is only as good as how the playerbase perceives it to be developers could pour their hearts and souls developing content for years but its nothing more than dog poo if the players dont like it5 never ignore the player concerns when content is in development sure a few whiners and complainers will surface but the playerbase as a whole wields a strong understanding of the game sometimes the devs cant see the forest through the trees6 trolling and bad player behavior is contagious especially when little or no action is taken against them some players genuinely find joy through ruining the fun for others its vitally important to both recognize this sort of behavior and take appropriate and timely actions against it spare the rod and spoil the child7 if you promise something to the playerbase then you darn well better honor that promise time tables may fluctuate but promises are promises players dont forget and they never miss an opportunity to remind us all8 the vocal minority that populate mmos may be the minority but they hold a very strong social influence over the silent majority often the vocal player opinions translate and imprint onto the silent players9 like it or not minmaxing is here to stay in the mmo genre those who minmax are often at the top of the food chain and those who wish to stay competitive or alive must also follow this path10 always stick to your policy guns if its against the rules for some players it must be universal amongst all players alternatively if some players are allowed to do x then all players must be allowed to playing favorites and granting special privileges will always cause drama
these are taken from raph kosters website and i believe these are valid for evemacroing botting and automationno matter what you do someone is going to automate the process of playing your worldcorollarylooking at what parts of your game players tend to automate is a good way to determine which parts of the game are tedious andor not funownership is keyyou have to give players a sense of ownership in the game this is what will make them stayit is a barrier to departure social bonds are not enough because good social bonds extend outside the game instead it is context if they can build their own buildings build a character own possessions hold down a job feel a sense of responsibility to something that cannot be removed from the gamethen you have ownershipif your game is narrow it will failyour game design must be expansive even the coolest game mechanic becomes tiresome after a time you have to supply alternate ways of playing or alternate ways of experiencing the world otherwise the players will go to another world where they can have new experiences this means new additions or better yet completely different subgames embedded in the actual gameis it a gameits a service not a game its a world not a game its a community not a game anyone who says its just a game is missing the point

 or add nerfs to faction to bring it in line with t2 as far as utility
t2 ammo needs a revision since the introduction of faction ammoalso why not make the faction ammo lp reward a limited run bpc
i dont think that there is a problem in tech 2 ammo becoming less available than faction ammo and less usefulin general tech 2 ammos have a detrimental effect on gulf between new and old players short range faction ammos allow at least in some instances for that gap to be reducedthat is a good thing not a bad thing
alliances shouldnt become self sufficient but youre right on in that atm there is nothing for industrialists to do with the space alliances hold aside from mine or moon minei honestly wouldnt care if they were massive isk sinks and gave nothing back but id love to help create and manage npc colonies in my alliances space

ccp should never operate big changes more than 10 in any attribute its a game supposed to have a evolutive story line how could someone enjoy the coherent storyline if technology can have unevolutions a piece of tech that gives you 16 a boost of something should never be changed to give you 10 after some day or missiles with an explosition effect should not have that effect hardly changedthis makes the proposal of a persistent universe with a coherent story line totally crap how could people be confident in cpp adminstration why should i think in eve universe as a thing where should i make plans to my character  the plann can be at any time invalidate   if some tech got to much power the right way to rebalance is launch countertech to deal it the situation just like in real world an army dont ask another to reduce effectiveness of their weapons they develop new counterweaponssorry if servers are not able to deal with speed its an internal problem should never had come to users to rebalance speed why not some kind of device to deal with this why not an implant disruptor which disable some implants in user or a better web  to deal with missiles doing damage to frigs why not a new hardener that works better againt missiles some kind of flare like in real life or eletronic guidance disruptor that reduces precision of missiles or even turn frig more resitive to missiles is more accepteable that turn missiles less effective observe that the result are the same but those option doesnt break the feel of continuity in eve universein my point of view ccp got hardly unimaginative in this patch loosing player base confidence by complete lack of imagination on how to deal with the speed problemhaving in mind the absence of imagination should be better to rollback this patch and rethink the role product what are you selling an story line consistent playing experience or just new models and nice images to see can we invest our time doing plans or is it better to stop to do that at this point what skill plan users should do that will not be invalidated in near future can we have the nice feeling of rock solid commitment from you or its just an investment from our part without commitement from youthats why im signing this petition its not a question only on nerf of missiles
look i can adapt just like others ive now found that my t1 cruise do far more damage against all ship classes than my t2s which i guess saves me isk on not buying so much t2 ammo any more the most frustrating thing is they say it will work the same against the same class which is still not true the t1 cruise do almost 100hp better per missile than the t2s against bss the only exception ive found so far is zor in l4 damsel in distress where my t2s finally hit like they should and of course structures my drones still chew cruise and smaller class ships the only thing im upset on is the fact that i spent time training for t2 cruise missiles that are now for the most part completely useless look on the bright side at least cruise missile specialization doesnt affect damage but launcher rate of fire so at least all is not lostanyway signed maybe not to be returned to previous state but reviewed for functionality
signed after coming back from a 4 month deployment and not knowing that qr had come out log in to take my raven out for a quick lvl 4 to get back into the game and i couldnt hit the cruisers cause they were moving too fast is just plain annoying i agree that some changed had to be made to missiles but after what you did to my torps and making them only go 30km killing all other missiles is just plain torture

raise cpuadd capital cruise launchers to complement torp launchersmake capital cruisetorp launchers follow the pattern of noncapitalnaglfar can suddenly pack highest or near highest close range dps with largest falloff traditional advantage of mini closerange gear giving them the best engagement capability at nonsniping ranges ie we cynod right on top of a cap blobalso by reducing the need for sensor boosters etc for hitting sniping range midslots can be focused on tank save one low for backup sensor array or just a pdu or cap gear for extra tankpulse revelation is soso and blaster moros is merely theoretical without a very good cyno opportunity close range phoenix would be quite a bit better off currently there is no launcher to differentiate phoenix loadoutspheonix gets a faster main capital weapon easing the pain of slow citadel torps and still has dumb citadel torps for hotdrop ambushing at close range to balance the dps if its going to come out too high do some pg tweaking on citadel launchers such that the phoenix comes up about 5 short and can sacrifice a damage mod for a pdu and get a little bit more tanking as wellwith the naglfar capital cruisearty would just be a pg swap for capital torpacs leaving it with enough grid for either setup having the extra cpu given back by cruise launchers would also help with the extra cpu required by arties so itd be a tight but doable fit in either stancefinally the mini hull with split weapons would actually have some versatility that isnt codeword for suboptimal easier requirements of capital cruise launchers and added cpu would take away the fitting pain for longrange setups close range setup would have lots of falloff to minimize impact of being out of optimal allowing it to have consistent superior closerange dps to any other dread capless weaponry leaves it with full cap for burst tanking into the loving arms of carriersi would fly that naglfar it would still be subpar in longrange setups but not ridiculous like it is it would in return rock more than any other dread in closerange hotdrops
alliance hangars as an extra layer above corp hangars yes
iirc in the 1st csm meeting ccp said there was a technical limitation in the architecture of playercorpalliance and hangar code that would require a major rewritewhat is the major thing you want to solve with this would it be satisfied by having market orders restricted to alliance only or a faster way to make alliance only contracts
i would love to share with the forum members here with ways we use to detect macrominers but unfortunately if i did i would be foolish since the macrominers would then be alerted to our tactics what i will say is that some of the observations of macros mentioned in this thread would not be atypical of their behaviour ccp are not going to ban the macro miners since this is a notable amount of revenue for them when replying to your petitions i would imagine some of them must feel guilty if they believe that you have caught a genuine macro miner and they cant take action due to the criteria they use in the procedure for removing a macro account
what about the rest of eve non miners that benifit from macro minners because of macro minners i get cheaper ships and moduals so from my perspectinve they are greatmanufacturures will build at what ever margin they see fit if ore goes up then shipsmoduals go up does not really effect them either waybut for us generaly players that dont mine macro minners are a good thing purly isk wise removing macro miners may help your walet but it will certainly hurt mine so i see it as a bad thing keep macro miners ingame
they are paying subscription to ccpwhy would ccp ban them i mean theyd lose money
i can certainly understand how a lot of players see this as a nonissue or see it as an excuse for the pew pewer to propose solutions which are thinely veiled attacks on carebearsi can just about see how some people think that its not reali would ask people to have a look at this its a short and interesting read which neither preaches nor condems but it will educate you about a large part of this issue
no dedicated miners do not do the exact same things over and over wout fail and you know it people have timed these guys down to the second and your going to make an excuse for it folks this is the shotgun defence measure you throw tons of st around and see if anything sticksexcuse me mr macromining lawyer alt  you failakbye the way  the above link 
thanks because i link like a noob sadlyan interview with an exgoldfarm operator
nice article regardless of the working conditions of rmtmacrofarmers the reality is that its bad for eve at the end of the day the only reason they do it is because its a rl profitable exercise so got any suggestions for making it not profitable in rl i would have thought introducing plex would help make it a less interesting exercise or do plex just make it easier to  legitimately  by selling plex ingame for rl currencyactually for a stream of conciousness maybe thats why they cant leave a station  because if they did they could be jettisoned and collected with no log of the event maybe ccp are watching afterall

might as wellwho was it that said you should not be in such short range and use blasterswhich bs fight doesnt happen nose to nose yada yda acs suck etcthey have twice the tracking and tempestshield buffer3gyros in lows can output the same damage as mega the only difference being that it can hit things and doesnt even need a web to do it
so what
could always force players in npc corps to have rookie chat permanently open
1  i support this after 6 of 8 months people should be moved up one corp level2  ccp stands by this antieve style of play i mean ccp bloody invented it thats just a silly statement3  somehow i dont think your concern about the macro minersisk farmers is your primary motivation only circumstance i dont support this is for military people being deployed somewhere they dont have internet accessakedit  actually  after reading the thread and many of the responses im removing my thumbs up
this
at this rate we will have ambulation before we get our implants back
they were never ingame though were they at least not tqyou couldnt ever get them from lp stores you couldnt put them on market nor contractsso really the question would be an introduction of the implants to the game perhaps i could have my drone implants before invention
i good pilot can narrow the cone down to range and direction if the cloaker is sitting still the one hunting them can just drive right up to them and decloak them bothalso a cloaked ship should be able to see an em fringe around other cloaked ships like their own cloaking effect the pilot would actually have to see this fringe by looking obviously it would take a keen eyed pilot to pick out the enemy cloaker at much beyond 10km and even at 3km it would be a challenge
and what happens if you have two characters on the same account and they did different things i have to give up my high sec research business that i get via the forums because i want to post with my 00 character what if i have two rp characters i can sell stuff ingame on an alt but i cant on the forums that is not balancedalso if i can make an alt to spy scout steal scam and am allowed to do anything in eve that other people can then i sure as hell should be allowed to post in the forums like everyone else i can play each character as a separate entity if i wanted to and i dont see why that should be destroyed because an alt owned you verbally in a thread what you are suggesting is altoppression and we will not stand for it if you feel a post is trolling then report it ive reported rant threads and they have gotten locked if you are tired of seeing oneliners and stuff well then just dont read the forums because guess what every forum in the universe is like this
dont even need character portraits as has been pointed out forums are mostly seperate from the game so maybe people could use whatever avatar they liked even  upload onepeople using forums for ingame services can always direct ingame mailcontact to the correct character via their post
the sooner the forums are brought under any sort of control the betteri dare say that the forums put off an many new players if not more than the steep learning curve ccp keep going on about which wouldnt be bad if they were putting off the 12 yr immature oh arnt i cool i can swear in public gamers but sadly its forum trolls and bashers that show these players they have a home where they can feel loved and encouragedalthough lets be honest how many of us have though about reply to this thread with an alt stating something like people should be forced to troll on the forums because it will improve the population of the forums and bring the forums into line with the original ethos behind the forums and if the sensible polite and considerate forum posters leave because of it all the better 
a potential issue with ambulation is the lack of people in most stations in another thread people mention the use of holograms to be placesan alternative suggestion is then to perhaps just have an interbus depot on the station whereby you can ambulate to it then take the bus to where you want to betravelling on the bus to somewhere then also becomes a game in itself perhaps others are also travelling and you can talk with them on the journeyespecially if theres a distinct route for the buses and you have to change at certain stations to get a bus to a specific destinationofc the bus would take time and isk and once you arrive you wont have a ship there so youd have to make the journey back before you could undock or do other nonambulatory stuffproblems then of devaluing jump clones and tactical uses of the interbussome of these problems have been discussedso an interbus would allow people to travel to ambulate in a selection of other places which might help with there being few people in many stations
yes as posted before medo it
ya this would be a nice idea could also be used to confuse people who station camp go in one hole out the otheredit i feel dumb forgot to support a great idea
yeah if anyone has watched the nuubship swarm in the eve hell video they know just how messed up ship stacking at the undock point isthe 15 degree variance is good but there needs to be a larger exit area and there needs to be a limited docking area too its insane seeing a ship sitting 60km away from the undock port dockthe docking collision bubble should only be like 10 to 20km radius centered on the one or several undocking ports not the entire damn station
okay ill open the bad box once moresomeone step up and define why instances are so bad for missionsis it just the competitive issue or zff
jason edwardsjump to reyi run missions  youll see what i mean
because it violates the whole point of the game and why it is different from all other mmorpgsi will quoteim not sure what to say here eve is based on human interaction you do not want any eve is not predictable you want it to be predictable you want a grind fest that you can play by yourself you are in luck as there are plenty of mmorpgs that cater to you seriously the pve is  in eve i have no idea what you are doing still playing if you want to solo grind missions
lets change the name of the game to pirates onlineand remove mission completely from the gamehell force everyone into corps and force them to pvp 247facepalm
aye vaal you misssed my pointi want to sometimes be alone to sharpen my axeat other times i want to come out and play with the kiddiesbut i surely dont want a party in my house 24x7
pirates online oh snap you mean potbs pirates of the burning seas  yeah that game will be gone in a year or two because of what you kinda outlined eves been around a lot longer because they have the mix about right  hisec is mostly safe lowsec is mostly lawless and 00 has only as many rules as the players enforce no one is forcing you into lowsec or 00ummm scratches head  missions are only a couple of years old in eve be carefull what you ask for they were placed in the game after it had been released for a couple years they can be removedas for forcing people into corps im not for that yet not supporting this measureak
thanks for all the support its good to know that the pirates arent the only group interested in lowsec though if these changes go through i may have to reconsider piracy as a profession
outpost upgrades are terriblethe problem lies in what they offer vs their price it is fine that they are so expensive but what they give for your money is pitiful rantconsider the minmatar refinery outpost say you upgrade it to tier 2 adding 2 levels of one upgrade and one level of another the total cost will be 10bil for the platforms plus 3bil for 2 basic and 1 normal upgrade 13bil overalllets say we get a refinery upgrade one level from 35 to 40 and two factory plant upgrades giving us a whole 8 yes eight factory slots extra giving 10 overallnow consider that you can get the same benefits from erecting a pos and using mods on that material multiplier aside for a fraction of the cost and you need pos anyway to claim sov and hold your outpostnow consider that an npc station might have 50 refinery 40 factory slots and 20 of each lab slot as well as 15 officesnow consider that if you upgraded two outposts in such a way then for the same amount it cost you could build an entire new outpostso its no wonder alliances make the judgement that until every system they own has an outpost outpost upgrades just arent worth it beyond tier 1 add to the fact youll never beat npc stations and the whole thing becomes pointlesswho in their right mind is going to pay 25bil to get a whole 3 extra factory slots in a minmatar outpost if you get just the 1st tier upgradesrantpoint is outpost upgrades either need buffing or to be made cheaper or no one will ever get them especially above foundation lvl
arent the upgrades permanent though you only can damage them into disabling the dealyou go from no refinery to 30 base or 50 if u started with minnie outpost thats pretty good in my booksthe real reason they arent gone beyond tier 1 is because they are conquerable you can drop 15bil into upgrades and next week lose docking rights to the outpost 15bil lost pretty muchthough ya factory slots and offices upgrades do seem to need a bit of a boost
isnt it a balance issue because its cheaper to get more services by dropping another outpost than to upgrade an existing one so as a large 00 alliance youre going to keep dropping outposts rather than upgrade existing ones this can be perceived as bad 00 becomes full of outposts or good 00 has so many outposts lots of little alliances can get a foothold depending on your perspective
im a new player to eve who has over the last 68 months made a lot of progress with my skillsthe orca has filled a niche for the industrial pilots and credit to ccp for deliveringnow for us more pvp inclined how about us getting a ship midway towards a carriersomething similar to the orca or even a military version of the orcasomething drone based perhapsit would provide corps a cheaper alternative to carriers and moms but would also help people who are new to the game to remain intrested
military version of a orca umm like a command ship maybe 
helloit happens often that players post things in channels unintendedeg you want to type something in the calculator and accidentallypost it in an intel channel or you want to post in fleet channelbut focus was on local in the heat of battle etciUFFFDd like to see the option to lock a channel so its read onlyand doesnt get focus thanks
two things protect ones character first the ship secondly the pod once your pod has been destroyed you end up in a station effectively podless in ones clone hopefully an uptodate one the loss of a ship can be quite high but the loss of ones pod and thus current body can be much higher due to loss of implants and potentially even skillpoints first all pods are the same  boring second if your ship is destroyed you are practically guaranteed to get podded if in low00 sec third pods have low hp low resists low cap easily warp scrambled slow a death trap in low sec00 sec a market currently exists for these items even though noone has yet to suggest the idea logically they should exist if pods exists at all some may think this is a carebear attitude but is really a balance issue pods are of no danger to anyone and of no value to anyone except a collector or a bounty counterof corpses if you think about it pods are really like small ships that get ejected when the main one gets blown up for a dread owner to pop out a pod with the same attributes as frigate owner is ridiculous with this idea implemented we can finally see all the carebears and other such high sec players finally moving towards low sec and 00 creating new targets for the pirates and mega alliances everyone is happyedited adding spaces to create paragraphs
paragraphs please and thank you got about 1 paragraph through this and quit reading
no need to be a douche about his formatting just because you have a crap attention span doesnt mean you have to take it out on the intelligent people cruising these forumsthat said i would have more to say to the op if there was any content to his post at all i assume these upgradable pods would have attributes like higher lol even higher agility smaller sig radius or even extra warp points an interesting idea to be sureof course there is no good reason to be podded in lowsec except for serious lag and making pods invulnerable to warp disruption fields might make them overpowered
got your pod ganked recentlypersonally if they speak english and have half a brain these days i dont mind either or id be a hypocrite with my spellinggrammer  o pop  noand its not that its a bad idea its just that the only time you see a pod is when you get your ship destroyedand half the time they are too small to be even noticedbut too much fluff  o pand upgrading them would be a waste as they are nigh dang near hard to catch
yes i have been podded recently and every time my ship is destroyed by a player it has been podded and it was destroyed within a second or two after my ship was destroyed they warpscrammed my pod and proceeded to instapop it as far as spotting a pod its easy just look at the overview after the 1st time though i used an alternate to go moving around lowsec00 sec 1st time i got killed was by a pirate gang im not talking about making pods completely invunerable just slightly decreasing the odds from 99 chance to get podded to maybe something around 3050 chance to get podded no content to my post  wow this game is remarkable notorious for having alot of rude people exactly what content are you looking for but then again you speak from a pirates viewpoint and you love to pod people  im sure oh and not sure what op means you say dang near hard to catch but i get caught every time ive been playing a month and have gotten podded 34 times basically any time i ventured into 4 or below space for more than a few minutes i tried to warp away every time but it was a pointless exercise seriously though why do most people not go to lowsec00 sec or if they do they are in a jump clone getting podded is a high probability and peoples behavior shows it it took me 2 weeks of mining for many hours a day to buy my current implants and ship fittings not going to risk my main when im guaranteed to get podkilled in low00 sec i could have easily suggested getting rid of the act of pod killing altogether but i didntand the pods dont have to be drastically different just enough to give people a chance to survive increase the population of people in low00 sec is that such a bad ideal i thought this is what piratespvpers wanted seriously though pirates and carebears and pvpers what would make this idea acceptable to you
theres no reason you should be getting podded unless youre stuck in a bubble as soon as you know your ship is going to die you should have something selected and be mashing the warp button pods literally instawarp and it takes at least a second or two to lock you even for a frigate
i propose that ccp implements a second option in the clear cache option that actually doesnt you know clear all your freeking settingsahem that is all
this and one further proviso that you can utilise copy slots at a lab within an alliance provided those labs are setup to accept alliance jobs cancellation logging also to be applied to this
we have combat logswe have transaction logswe have escrow logswhy cant we have invention logs only a few fields are neededt1 bpt2 item producedmeta level of t1 itemmeta level of decryptorsuccessfailthe more invention jobs that fall under identical criteria are totaled as two stacks sucfail and the differance averaged to give us a true indication of how well our invention processes are doingive seen some return consistent failure rates using meta3 and 4 items but are on the mark when using no items at all one module returns 231 with meta 4 31 with meta 3 and 4871 without items at all this averaged on 1000 total attempts 320320360 lucky on that module the meta items were very inexpensivethis will also help the heavy end inventors discover bugs such as the one that i pointed out above
i ran a lvl 4 q 13 mission agent the other day and got a chump little drone mission just because i was boredtotal number of ships destroyed 90all frigscruisers5 drops total about 50m3 best mineral gained was mexallonless than 20 salvage parts totalsooooo how is this breaking 00 highend mining my single hulk pilot can bring in more isk in 5 minutes in 00 than i did for that entire mission loot and salvage about 40 minutes total workin a skiff he can make considerably more but hauling that stuff is such a chore i just gave up on itreally ccp should just do one of the followingoption 1  increase rat bounties across the board and remove all drops salvage only give drones bounties add metaitem blueprints as possible loot officers drop higher end meta bpsoption 2  remove all bounties and force ratters to loot  salvage to make their isk turn everyone into miners even if theyre mining with tachyon beams this will not continually inject isk into the game from ratting the only new isk will be generated by by gasp mission rewards
i like this idea  anything that can get rid of them other than nanosnipping shipsthose who like to fight facetoface on the gate have no chance agianst falcons

generally a good post but only really valid for the younguns age is wonderful in that regard you usually dont mind taking the time to do a thing properlythose weak of mind andor young yes i have never nor will i ever consciously exploit a bug i do report holes i find though games for me is a way to stimulate my mind real life has enough of the cheatingdodging for it to be of much use to me for recreational purposesno argument so far i think ccp has been a bang up job overall on these points carrier and thorax changes were scrapped due to feedback and the world we play in is growing nicely when it comes to stuff to do human behaviourpsychology is hard to beat down if you regulate too much people will leave if too little you get chaos find the middle ground and allow users to block people they find offensive same as we have ingamewhy spend 3 hours on a job when you can do it in 30 minutes by tweaking time is everything to me and wasting it gives me mental rashes like you wouldnt believe minmax itself is not an issue mankind did not survive this long by ignoring efficiency the problems start when a specific minmax becomes so prevalent for any given activity nos uberspeed ecm domis speed tanking missions etc that it skews everything else ie unbalancesack have to cut it short too many thoughts for my own good summation good post but hardly a revelation since we are talking about the single most vindictive spiteful egotistical and violent creature ever to grace the planet earth
the issue i wish to raiseremoval of t1 meta 0 loot from npcs
since the thread is lockedremoval of t1 meta 0 loot from npcs will have a net negative or no effect for meta 0 producers as proposed in the thread any increase in higher meta item drops will produce a reduction in price of those items since meta 0 items are substitutes for named items and since named items are higher quality than meta 0 items it will be even harder to be a tech 1 producer after your proposed change
goumindong ive refined the idea on my webpage to what i think is a workable mechanic in it the chance of meta 1 items dropping isnt changed but a 10 bonus to bounty is applied to compensate for the lost mineralsitemsthis will enhance t1 meta 0 item manufacture as its currently subsumed almost completely except with items with no meta such as ammo and ships by item drops in npcs the cost to destroy an npc is extremely small then reselling the item on the market means that the manufacturerwannabe makes almost no effort to create the itemitems and resell themas a missionrunner i can make more minerals from missioning than mining and that doesnt include the salvagebountiesmission rewardsetc this is a broken mechanic and needs fixed desperatelythis will also have the net effect of making mining more used to be joined with future topics of improving mining in general overall this idea will only serve to expand the game and not penalize as you might think
im going to be laying down the framework for an investigation into t2 turret ammo especially considering the changes done to missile t2 ammo after the patchrelevant threadim sure the ccp is aware of this issue so it would be helpful if we could have the relevant balance dev available at the meeting for live qa
that is great this is the place where we discuss things not your website if you want to enter into the record things from your website do it first before you expect anyone to know what you are suggestingthis is not true it is not a broken mechanic since the barrier to entry for missions is so much more than mining similarly there is more risk involved and a higher amount of time needed for production
