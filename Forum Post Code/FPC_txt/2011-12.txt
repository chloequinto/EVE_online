i will admit that i like the extra layer of complexity that booster sps can provide what if they said boosters basically provide a mechanical means to what a crew could provide so you could buy crew members for your sp according to the different bonuses links give the minmatar crew would give the bonuses of the skirmish warfare links a different crew member would be required for each bonus and you could only have that type of crew working together you dont need to have the whole crew though just for the bonuses you want also since the crew members provide the bonus that you otherwise get from the boosters you cant add them together ts way people like me and others who hate the idea of dragging an alt around everywhere could simply by crew members wch provide the same bonuses the crew members would of course cost isk i suppose you could set up academies or sometng on planets through pi in order to train them to different levels you could keep your t3 alts as long as others who dont want alts can still compete edit crew members would be destroyed or drop just like other modules in your spmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
proposal quit wning and just play the game
posting a bad idea again and again doesnt make it any better it just shows how bad the idea really is
how about unlink plex from everything aurumcharacter transferetc and remove them from market ccp has done nothing but interfere and screw with game time stop linking it to crap
i would think it should be missile boat who says the 3ed ship should be rails the rule was broken to start with because for bcs caldari have the ferox already which is basically a rail version of the drakefurthermore caldari are missile specialist yes they should have gun options but most ships should be missiles the 23 ratio should be maintained in any class of shipsmost of all it is redundant bcs use the same skill if for some reason you have large hybrids and bc skill trained you can always use the gallente ship for nearly the same effect as the talos
guess you make a point it all depends on what ccp intends if missiles are the primary or secondary weapon of caldari shipsbut having two large hybrid ships for bcs is redundant if you have bc to 4 and large hybrids to 4 your about as skilled in using either racial ship gallente and caldari both tier 3 bcs which are glass cannons so most bonuses are the same along with fitting many may opt for the most minimal of tank
l2fit real weapons you caldari slime
caldari missles and hybridsnot the other way around mate other wise youd have two races with the same primary weapons systems which would be awkward and unbalanced
you already have the drake as a missile throwerand for pvp you really need a good pvp battlecruiser that can do long range instant damage
you do reliase caldari and gallante are from the same solar system right the caldrai were a part of the gallante federation so of course there main weapons are hybrids
every race uses multiple weapons systems some even use both armor and shield tanking caldari have plenty of very very good missile ships and now they have a viable hybrid boat stop crying and train for the rest of your races weapons its your or your corpies fault for putting yourselves in a limited number of shipsalso i like how you say the oracle is meant to use beams caldari tears best tears
i said lasers didnt specify which and i clearly stated multiple times that i have a good understanding that each race uses multiple weapons systems i have good skills in just about everything i can fly 3 races command ships every cruiser every bc with weapons every battle ship excepting t2 on some of them i am quite well rounded and with my corpies some of them are new kinda hard to get leet skills in everything without sucking in everything so they tend to train for the primary weapon groups for their race as it opens up the most ships for the least amount of training and to doggy dogwoofwoof they may be from the same solar system but they have radically different view points on just about everything  i mean obviously caldari are meant to armor tank since theyre from the same system as gallente right point still stands every major weapons system except missiles had a new ship released caldari is and always has been primarily missile based and this new addition skews the balance between hybrid and missile bcs there are now 4 hybrid bcs while only one missile bc
actually if you really want to get technical caldrai were fighter based
proof or it didnt happen p
the caldari hoped their small fast oneman fighters would run circles around the gallente ships from
touche my friend which brings me to the question of why do drones and unmanned fighters suck so bad with caldari judging from the lore it should be caldari with the drones and fighters and gallente with the big slow raven type ships p
amarr have missile ships why wasnt their tier 3 battlecruiser missile based ccp i demand missiles for thisgallente are known for drones ccp drones for tier 3 bcseriously dude stop crying about this its not that big a deal hybrid naga is a pretty cool boat tell your friends to stop being useless carebears and train something other than missile boats
in order to get the most out of their race caldari must train missiles and hybridsin order to get the most out of their race gallente must train drones and hybridsi dont see the problem here
your point is negated by the fact that amarrs primary weapon is lasers therefore thats what their t3 bc was seeing a trend here now quit throwing out stupid points that have nothing to do with the subject please oh and drones are also gallentes secondary weapon point negated yet again and useless carebears hardly i have at least three times your kills mate kinda negates your carebear argument there
no you specifically said beams and if you actually did have a good understanding of racial weapons systems then you wouldnt have made this topic caldari have 2 primary weapons so you cant only train one and expect to fly every new caldari ship right when it comes out sure hybrids sucked so its understandable that people wouldnt be inclined to train them over missiles but ccp stated that they would be getting some love even after crucibles initial launch that anyone didnt train them in anticipation of that especially if it is their own races weapons is their own faultbesides 8 torps would have either been totally useless or stupidly overpowered
edited by beams i meant lasers i apologize for being misleading they have a primary and a secondary all their combat ships have missile slots except the naga however not all of their ships have hybrid slots which makes hybrids the secondary weapon system due to missiles being the more prominent weapon system on caldari ships
im not even taking that reply seriously if you cant see why then there is no point wasting time here any longer
of course not it makes sense so im not going to reply to it good choice mate
i doesnt make sense because your post implies that ships with hybrid weapon bonuses are actually missile ships roughly half of caldari ships have missile bonuses while the other half have hybrid weapons ship bonuses determine what type of ship they are not their hardpoints
confirming the merlin harpy moa eagle ferox vulture and rokh have missile bonuses instead of hybrid bonusesseriously get over it half the caldari ships are hybrid boats specifically favoring railguns rather than blasters the naga fits in perfectly with that line of ships a corp mate has one and its one hell of a sniper bc in fact its a hell of a sniper overall it boasts very impressive dps at 60100km and i dont think the other tier 3s will be able to compete with it at those ranges you cant blame anyone but yourself for failing to realize that caldari are not just a missile race and never have been
three times my killsguess that makes my opinion uselessor it makes you a moron for thinking that mattersyou decidehint youre a moron
and which of these has a damageoutput higher than splashing water on enemiesor just buy a drake at least that doesnt look like a cheap knockoff of the megathron and rifter
you do realize that you called me a carebear so i responded with the fact that im sitting around 800 kills where as youre sitting around 200 which would make you a care bear as wellalso you do realize how stupid you are right you call me a carebear and i defend myself stating the amount of kills i have and you turn around and say that i am somehow saying that means your opinion doesnt matter i said nothing of the sort and you for some reason cant comprehend that i clearly said several times that hybrids are the secondary weapons system learn to read before you come in here and try to troll like youre johnny bad ass or something and its not one hell of a sniper ship honestly it rolls appx 600 dps with maxed out skills with decent tracking at 80km aint exactly amazing there as stated multiple times before i am not saying caldari do not use hybrids but all of those hybrids have missile slots the naga doesnt second point every other race got a new bc geared towards their main weapons system caldari did not i appreciate the bumps guys but at least try to throw out an argument that holds water rather then some half ass paraphrased excuse for an argument

first none of the tier 3 battlecruisers sport a second weapon system so the naga is in line with the rest of the tier 3 battlecruiserssecond the naga like the other tier 3 battlecruisers was built for pvp combat ccp also decided that it was a good idea to give the caldari a serious pvp ship because the ferox is woefully underpowered as both a railgun and blaster platform on the other hand the caldari have what many consider to be the best battlecruiser in the game the drake the drake is a solid performer as a missile launcher and mounts substantial damage and tanking advantages the big problem is that missile systems at range take too much time to reach their target so ccp gave caldari a really good railgun platform because it needed one you should be giggling with joy over the fact that it makes a pretty decent blaster platform tooso if you are upset that ccp actually gave you some real substantial pvp ship choices be my guest
double post
 returns with caldrai and gallante being form the same empire then points out caldrai used fighters meaning caldrai made gallantes 2nd weapon system then leaves 
last time i was on the test server i could fit a whole rack of torps on the nagai honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
they changed that about nov 14th on sisi
you know the fw theatre is pretty big there was a time when blobs ruled the pipes from tama to heyd but small fights could still be had in backwater systems that were too many jumps away for the blobs to bother with someday someday the blob will return oms and tama wont be nearly empty for many hours every day 60 man gallente militia fleets will blob 50 man caldari fleets in abune or sujarento and when it does the small gang fights will move out to the hinterlands  away from the blob odamia ashitsu vaarlen  these will be the new home of the small gang fights these will be the places where legends will be born where reputations will be made just like they used to be when the blobs ruled the pipes
i too share the same vision of lowsecs future and hope we will see a rebirth of faction warfare soonpersonally ive always said a blob is just what you call the enemy fleet when youre losing lets be honest eve will always have the element of outnumbering your opponent theres simply no way to remove that without ruining the sandboxfaction warfares strength in concept if not in execution is that it provides an arena that potentially encourages pvp on all scales i reject the idea that fw is only about small gang warfare blobs were indeed common back in the day when it was most funthe problem is that the scene keeps becoming less diverse as it ages there used to be the option to join the large battleship fleets but also elsewhere on a different front lines there would be roaming cruiser and frigate gangs you used to be able to have a choice where to go fight not be surprised when theres actually a fleet out and about there is still pvp around the clock but usually only in once place at one timethis is really an extension of the same set of problems nullsec faces  constant conflict needs a fat carrot to keep dangling in front of bloodthirsty pvpers there has to be something worth fighting for this is as critical for small gang or subcap fleet pvp gameplay as it is for the nullsec capital fleet sovereigntybased gameplay faction warfare held out remarkably long in terms of player interest before the only remaining players are those who are willing to fish for fights same as you would anywhere else it has great potential to provide the large scale blob fleets once again as well as maintain impactful opportunities for lower skilled pilots to assist in system takeovers as well we need to get the whole region hopping again like the golden days of faction warfare where being fresh and new was strong enough fuel to keep the machine goingfw is running out of gas its still loads of fun but its going to need a topup for it truly to become everything ccp intended it to be the players have done their part to keep the embers of fw and lowsec in general burning its time for the developers to stoke the fires once again with some muchneeded sovereignty impacts and plexing rewards
somewhat wh relatedrecalibrate dscan permanently so that it no longer needs to recalibrate while im looking for targets
i was curious about this process and have a few questions if you donUFFFDt mindthere are a lot of good discussions surrounding both topics within this thread and others do you read and take note of other thread contenti understand a lot of what you may champion on our behalf will be down to your own logic and preferences but will you highlight the UFFFDlittle thingsUFFFD that the csm will be taking to ccp or is ccp expected to monitor this thread and prepare to discuss relevant pointsdo you all have personal lists or is there a more generic agenda of items worked out for the csm as a wholei ask these questions only in the hope of understanding how best to develop and present ideas that may gain the support of the csmthank you for your time in managing this process
may look into this in the future killmails you should certainly get
you dont want to disallow it being activated while under duress otherwise a griefer could lock you down away from a gatestation and give you no option but to turn off eve and quit for the night it needs to be allowed under all circumstances as a last resort option to get away from someone who is holding you in place for an extended period of timeespecially with the aggression change where your ship doesnt vanish from space until it dies or all aggression stops for 15 minutes

so you want epeen booster and a punishment for the people who scuttle their ships  even though scuttling is as old as sailing itself1 void insurance2  get together with the killboard designers and have them introduce a dummy entry specifically designed to ridiculemock selfdestructeessince we are not playing on the high seas we cant really add a diving occupation to investigate what is left after a scuttling so without foreknowledge of a ships contents prior to scuttling there is no way to do it in eve without violating a time honoured tradition  a way to add it partially without said violation is to generate a mail for the ship owner  he can then chose to share it sell it or try to forget itin short epeen stroking should be a bannable offence  no soup for you
putting aside my distaste for pls meta gaming and the reason for this thread is because a wn nyx self destructed and denied them a kill the other day the sd should include the players who agressed since the last session change the timer though i do not feel should be extendedself destruction should deny the loot drop at the expense of insurance

generating a killmail for a self destruct is ridiculous if you cant kill the ship you dont deserve the mail make variable selfdestruct timers based on ship size or something but no mails
this is a non issue no person will reach the limitno one spends long in every system
dude 13000 bookmarks are more than enoughgeez you rarely leave highsec why the heck do you need 22000 bookmarks what percentage of those are in lownullsec concordfree space where you know bookmarks are actually usefultheres being paranoid and then theres being paranoid overly much i have zero bookmarks in highsec i have about 1500 in lownullsec no one is stalking you seamus other than newbs who watch your awesome tutorial videos i doubt many people even know who you are i have some actual enemies and ive yet to be ganked or even had a gank attempt on any of my ships in highsec and i autopilot a lot through high security space if i dont need 17000 highsec bookmarks im estimating the proportion of your 22000 bookmarks that are highsec bookmarks you certainly dont start pruning when you get a collection of 13000 lownullsec bookmarks then you can start a thread poopooing the limit
i have quite a lot of bookmarks and i get a lag spike when opening my people and places hate to think what 13000 or higher would do13000 is fine and only extreme situations would call for more and then you could use an alt really its a none issuedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
how many gates are there how many stations how many systems i can think of at least two bookmarks worth having for each of thosethe op has the right idea set up containers and store some of those bookmarks youre not going to accidentally end up on the other side of the galaxy without warning enough to go change out a few bookmarks although i think you should be able to drop them into your places without consuming the item making management and duplication a lot less tedious
how many systems are actually worth bookmarking even in nullsec if youre deep within your own alliances territory theres little point in bookmarking most if any of those systemsapparently only one person has reached the 13000 limit actually he blew past it since he has 22000 bookmarks since theres only one thread concerning the limit
im in favor of making bookmark management less tediouseven as i type this im still shoving bookmarks into containers in a station its a bit slow though since i can only move 5 at a time and every 5 bookmarks needed 30 seconds to move when i started though its down to about 25 seconds nowi started this thread knowing that im an unusual case but if i really do have more unique bookmarks than any other single capsuleer in new eden then that means im the first or top at something in all of eve online ill take that as a personal accomplishment survivor of teskanen fan of john rourke i have video tutorials for eve online on my youtube channel
why do you think there is less risk doing an incursion in low sec than in sov null sec it would seem to me that low sec and npc null sec would be the most risky places to do incursions deep in sov null sec would have much less riskmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
assuming you a have access to that region and b can secure it against every hostile frigate that enters the area
it has to do with ratting bots being more profitable than incursions
bots are active in places other then nullsec
im not sure i follow you we seem to agree that difficulty securing a space against potential hostiles is an important factor in risk while running incursions it is much harderimpossible to secure npc null sec and low sec than sov null sec do you agreemake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i think its a matter of perspective were disagreeing on sov null sec is easier to secure then npclow for running incursions assuming you hold sov in the first place i think youd agree that showing up to someone elses sov space with your pve fleet to run incursions qualifies as risky right and thats one of the main reasons high sec incursions are so much more popular then other kinds  highsec runners have their pick of all hisec incursions while sov holding players have to hope that a null incursion spawns in a region they own and have any hope of securingas for running incursions in them were debating different shades of black here since any lownpcsov incursion golden fleet can be broken with a cloaky prober with a cyno
yes i agree it is easier if you own sov there its not easier if you dont as to whether the pay is out of line i think there is a easy way to tell where are incursion run most often and the quickest if they are run more often in sov null sec than in low sec or npc null sec then we can assume they are better risk reward or vice versamake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
this and in general removal of microtransactions altogether heres some stuff i wrote on the matter i personally think they ought to remove the nex store and it should be noted that if ccp starts using convinence microtransactions they may very well face another uprising and one that is worse than it was beforedont you dare ccp

it appears with the patch an lopsided change has occured to the api statistics for wormhole space jumps were removedso i suggest all wormhole statistics be fixed entirely it is simply unbalanced for the defenders living in the hole to have the npc kill statistics publically broadcasted much the same way for attackers had it unbalanced that their statistics were publically broadcastit also makes no sense from a rp point of view as there is not great overlord watching over wspace like concord does in kspace the mysterious entity that records npc kills but not wormhole jumps shouldnt exist
1fix them all
sure why not this will make wormholes even more dark and mysterious 3on another side it would be nice to easily tell what the wormholes bonus are without having to learn them by heart it should be in the info tab of the system
agree
so should all statistics be removed including jumps or only npc kills
just look at the system background thats all you needand i approve of this
i wish nda was information was not talked about or at least was the exception rather than the rule here are the problems1 its unclear how alliance leaders that are on the csm dont get an advantage from hearing what changes are being made in advance of the other players is there any clear guidlines on how the csm should act for example alliance leader csm hears super caps are being nerfed another leader in his alliance then tells him super caps are the  we are putting all our resources toward creating huge fleets of them how is the csm alliance leader supposed to respond is he to say well we discussed the future of supercaps at an nda meeting so i must recuse myself from any alliance decision making relating to supercaps its insider tradingok i agree that with any one thing this may not amount to much  just a slight advantage but when you add it all together anoms nerfedbuffed dreads nerfed buffed basically csm knows all the changes well in advance of other players 2 even if somehow csm can explain how the above does not give them an advantage it seems to me there is still the appearance of an advantage this appearance will lead more people to want to join the alliances where the leaders are in the know this also gives the alliances an advantage3 most importantly the nda and csm has just built a wall between players and ccp csm never really discusses much at all with the players on the forums and the conversations that do happen are often chilled by the csm worrying they will be anked for overstepping the nda basically csm has become the receptionist for ccp when players want to know something csm says UFFFDccp is unavailableUFFFD and when we ask them its always UFFFDwell we canUFFFDt really say what we know because of ndaUFFFD look at the UFFFDdiscussionUFFFD about the secret meetings with zulu really why csm at all zulu knew the players werenUFFFDt happy couldnUFFFDt zulu himself told the players ccp is reworking things and he will let us know why did he need csm to tell us that with new emphasis on nda the csm has become pretty silly if ccp wants csm to be a focus group to run ideas by then fine but donUFFFDt claim csm is representing views of the players when the players arenUFFFDt even privy to the issues discussed ccp has bought some good will with the players they no longer need csm to be a buffer csm should be able to come back from a meeting and tell players about everything they discussed sure some ideas will be howlers but thatUFFFDs not the end of the world so for these reasons i think the nda discussions should be scrapped and if ccp isnUFFFDt willing to discuss things with the players that should include the players on the csm short of that there should be precious little that is bound by the nda otherwise csm is really just acting like a receptionistwall between players and ccpbtw i do not mean to suggest anyone on the csm did anything wrong with any nda information i donUFFFDt pretend to know one way or another but until i understand what sort of guidelines are followed when it comes to how they deal with nda information its hard to see that their alliances are not reaping benefits make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
so i really like the new but used to be old ship trails but they disappear when you zoom out too much i was in a big fleet fight this morning and even zoomed in i could only see my own ship trail and whichever poor sucker i was orbiting at 500 everyone else in the massive blob was too far away to see engine trailsnow based on the recent incarna complaints people will pitch a fit if this game will not run on their ibm aptiva 2168 but for the rest of us id be nice if you could zoom out and see everyones ship trails just glancing at the battlefield you could see the momentum of battle and tell where everyone is drifting to go play old homeworld 2 for a bit to see what i mean the ship trails could not only look good but be a little informativebut to accommodate everyones computers well probably need a sliding scale of ship trailstrails off for everyone who got this game in 2004 and refuses to let the man tell them when to get a new graphics cardlow basically engine trails look the same as they do now if you can handle crucible now you can handle it on lowmedium most of the engine trails are clearly visible and you can tell how a fleet is flying just based on a screenshot the game looks like homeworldhigh space is a giant streaky mess it looks like the flying spaghetti monster got blitzed on jagerbombs decided to paint himself blue and do some freestyle breakdancing outside the amamake in gatei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
i like the idea in general but there may be some resource constraints that make it hard to do i shall inquire
i was afraid of that but hopefully all of the processing that goes into making ship trails happens entirely on the clients side then the only limitation on ship trails would be how awesome your pc wasi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
yes just for that reason let it be ccp
ok rather than imposing artificial limits on peoples behavior limiting the amount of systems an alliance can claim or the amount of blues they can have lets look at the what motivates people to form these giant power blocks and see if we can take away the things that motivate people to create a universe that we dont like huge nap fests giant blob warfarethe reason for this is that people will try to get round whatever rules you put in place take a look at the practice of can flipping its a bit of a mechanics exploit but it exists for the simple reason that people like shooting at other people and theyll navigate around the aggression rules to do what they wanted to do to begin witheven if what i say after this point is completely wrong i still think we should work on the motivation of large blobs forming rather than the means by which they formso why do big power blocks exist or rather why do people feel the need to form themwell so far i have come up with two reasons off the top of my head and i think we can work on one of themthe first reason is that blobs win and if you have a blob harassing you the way to beat it is with a bigger blob having 100 noobs in you fleet flying drakes is useful but having 1000 noobs in drakes is even better i dont know if this concept will ever go away so i am just going to ignore that elephant in the room for now granted getting rid of jump bridges would really hinder someones ability to batphone a blob inthe second reason i think is the presence of rare valuable and monopolizable resources that only an alliance can hold tech moons in particular and for the most part these are resources that your average grunt will not care aboutso as an example ask yourself how much space in jumps do you need to enjoy the game how many jumps would you go from your home station on a daily basis to rat or mine in how many jumps would you go to buy something expensive or large like a new ship or a faction module and how many jumps would you go to start roamingi dont know about you but i would say id be willing to 3 jumps to run a haven every day this is about the size of an alliances home pocket id go 10 jumps to the local market hub to drag an expensive cta battleship or logi back home all by myself and id like my roams to start at most 20 jumps from home try throwing up a roaming fleet advert in alliance and tell people that the first fleet destination is 30 jumps out before you are going to start looking for targets see how many people join your fleetso if the average nullsec pilot would probably prefer to live their life in under 20 jumps why do they have a sea of blues wrapping around most of nullsec and in addition to the ability to batphone a blob i would guess that its the alliance as an entity is motivated to spread across space so it can take and hold as many rare and valuable resources as it can this most obvious example of this i can think of is rare moon goo although i was impressed with the whole gellente ice interdictioni could be completely wrong here but what do you guys think would happen to large alliances if tech moons were more common and drove down the moon goo price or if the refined products of tech moons could also be produced by pii honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
nononolisten limits of this nature are dumb and they will just be worked around by making alt alliances and dont come here and tell me you want to limit the alliances we can make and limit how many blues an alliance or corp can havemeh i think youll find that modifying space itself will be more work than its worthi think youll find that what needs to be done isnt anywhere close to what youre thinking what needs to be done is make sov descriptive rather than prescriptive and activitybased want to hold a region  you use it when someone lives in a space and has system control most of the time its theirs the instant they move on and someone else actually starts using it its theirslimits pfwah

1 buff truesec there are so many 01 systems and very few 08  092 bring back sov upgrades but increase the difficulties of the levels while weighing the benefits3 require upkeep of these systems and prevent this sort of minimal occupation consecutie systems should be claimed and in order to upgrade some systems they need to have control of the systems around it 4 there needs to be the ability to put more than one station per system with established sov an alliance should be able to put manned destructible sentries on stations and gates 5 high end ore should deplete and fluctuate remove moon minerals completely and slap the goo on comets the comets move slow enough to where once found they can be mined for several months6 remove belts completely why even have them just have them spawn on d scan randomly every day the fact that systems have 515 belts on average is just dumb anyway do this everywhere and make mining interesting7 change loot tables abcs should be profitable to mine in null speaking of which does anyone even use a rorqual for mining ops anymore something changed when i first started it was desired to do mining ops for ark or bistot

this thread perfectly exemplifies whats wrong with the gmsas long as the issues were easy scripted responses the gms were all over itas soon as things got hard with specific criticisms and issues theyre nowhere to be found
since dictor bubbles now cause agression on deployment if your ship is destroyed in the dictors bubble regardless of warp initiation the dictor pilot should be on the kmif you force a 70m uninsurable paperthin ship to go down every time it wants to do its job it should get some credit for being a heroedit this goes for blues too so if the dictor pilot is freaking genius and bubbles his own fleet in a massacre its well known whos it was
japaneese players are rightfully  worried about the use of nexon in april ccp seems shortsighted on it from both security and trust issues with them
damn i was about to say that i just bought skyrim and battlefield 3 which look really nice on pc and it would be great if eve kept up with current graphics new directx is pretty awesomei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
the point i was originaly trying to get to was that the simple client and full client like there was be for would be great as graphics dont matter to me over game play all the people i know put the client on basic graphics anyways so and hide brackets etc anyways so the option to have a basic client would be great and keep the option of having full blown graphics for the carebears out there watch me get flaimed by the retqards that prefer to have graphics over game play hell bet they only have the graphics set hiogh cos there sat in a belt anyways o well signing off now bored of this subject as it only a suggestion in the first place

they are not used solo there is no reason to think they are used by small groups more than large groups the proposal just makes it so you do not need to multibox an alt t3 with gang links to be competitive but like i said before if there were a way to give the bonuses and allow others who do not want to multibox alts a way to be competitive i wouldnt mind so muchi will admit that i like the extra layer of complexity that booster ships can provide what if they said boosters basically provide a mechanical means to what a crew could provide so you could buy crew members for your ship according to the different bonuses links give the minmatar crew would give the bonuses of the skirmish warfare links a different crew member would be required for each bonus and you could only have that type of crew working together you dont need to have the whole crew though just for the bonuses you want also since the crew members provide the bonus that you otherwise get from the boosters you cant add them together this way people like me and others who hate the idea of dragging an alt around everywhere could simply by crew members which provide the same bonuses the crew members would of course cost isk i suppose you could set up academies or something on planets through pi in order to train them to different levels you could keep your t3 alts as long as others who dont want alts can still compete crew members would be destroyed or drop just like other modules in your shipmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
its a curious question  why do learning implants exist how can their continued existence be justified you need them to train your hyperoptimized perwill skillplan as fast as possible sure but why should you need them to begin withlet me begin by highlighting the problems with learning implantsthey discourage people from playing eve youre still paying your subscription sure but youre not playing the game you dont want to jump to your emptycombat clone and lose a day of optimal training so you can have some fun and then have to jump back to your training clone the next day this affects nullsec especially wormhole players doubly so  losing your ship in a bubble is a surefire way to get podded people in empire still have a better chance of warping their pods out of harms way and thus have no qualms about running missions or otherwise flying in space with their implants unless of course they are at war that however is not our playstyle they are seeded exclusively through lp stores rather than being made ingame entirely characters that need pirate faction implants for any reason supercapital pilots with slavenomad sets freighterjf pilots with nomads etc are essentially stuck with 3s but this isnt about pirate implants so what im proposing is removing learning implants entirely there is just no need for them add 5 base points to every attribute remove learning bonuses from all other implants and set all base attributes to 22 points its trivial leave the cerebral accelerator implant as is  25 effective base points for all attributes for the month isnt quite gamebreaking a refund plan would not even need to be considered  those who had 5 sets will still have the same bonus those who had 4 sets will have a better bonus and it doesnt put anyone at a disadvantageits a simple change it doesnt throw anything out of balance and it just makes sense why the hell not its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
posters attitude is typical of high sec carebears like him the point of learning implants is to give an advantage to people who dont die and create a greater death penalty for people who die and are bad at pvp this is something he might find exciting and intriguing if he were to join an actual corp and move to 00 which i recommend for him
supported
i support this idea
mumble leak 54225 pm sverige pahis wow is that test guy  or trolling54227 pm sverige pahis idgi
you cant explain that
learning implants are exactly like the old learning skills they provide strong motivation to avoid playing the game an effect which has a particularly strong effect on newbiesget rid of learning implants add more combat implants
i couldnt even put a number on the amount of times i have seen people say i would come but i have 15 hrs left on my clone  learning implants are an unnecessary shackle
learning implants jumpclone timers and learning stats are just arbitrary barriers to funpointless and redundant
this is faife and he is posting
goddamn learning implants
maybe if they put in some posting implants
to hell with it plus rep for everyone hereexcept faife  that guy
wat gud is lurnin anyway
remove attributes remove implants remove remapsall skill learning multipliers can remain the same on skills but the basic 1x skill is a fixed time all other skills work as a multiple of the fixed timethis doesnt remove customization it simply removes arbitrary barriers for fun
i have first hand experience with thismy own brother started playing eve recently yesterday i asked if he wanted go along with me on a 2 man roam to be my tacklebro he didnt want to go because he would have to travel 40 jumps to get to where i was and he would have to podjump to get there quickly wiping out his 3s i gave himinstead he logged off and played some starcraftthis is a bad thing for eve
as the main implant importer and seller for test i can do nothing but support this despite what it would mean for my business venturesi have first hand experience in not undocking which led me to not actually playing for my first six months since a friend gave me my first 5s he thought he was doing me a favour but it nearly made me one less player instead
while were on the subject can you bring me a few sets of 3 perception and willpower implants to nakah you can just open a tab for me tia
this is just a nullbear whine bubbles are dangerous you lose your implants working as intended
dont worry were spreading the joy with carebears now
lets have more combat implants instead more implants that actually affect the game
your links are broken 
cripes i dont know if youre a troll or merely an idiot1 i dont personally care about losing implants i can easily replace them and i routinely fly around with 4 sets dont care to train cybernetics v  hell people routinely fly around with combat implants aversion to loss isnt the point behind this thread its an issue that affects newbies with limited sources of income2 this isnt even about losing implants its about sorry guys i jumped back to my empire 5 clone so i cant play eve online with you and seriously what the hell is the point of learning implants3 nullsec and wormhole residents are at a serious disadvantage over those in highsec or even lowsec who are virtually immune to losing pods if they are paying attention and fairly quick on the warp out button you can comfortably do things in empire with your implants  nobody would say the same about nullsectake your nullbear bullshit elsewhere thanks its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
yeah i fixed them eveo forums seems to turn an  into an amp when redirecting
oh noez you can gank naked pods
do you not understand that we are proposing additional implants to exist simply not learning ones i think you need an implant in real life
cant take the heat dont go into the kitchen
losing three billion in implants in 10 spaceworking as intendededit whoops forgot my smugglasses
just ignore the altposting threadshitters and this discussion will be dandy its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
yes certain implants should be more special to others learning is sacred and should not be lost just because i choose to live in null i want the benefits of null but not consequences
post from your main and ill play ball until then nope its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
here i thought i established that one need not live in null to suffer these particular consequencesselective bias is the best kind of bias
its this mentality that everyone in nullsec mines and run sanctums 237 in cynojammed systems with 250km of bubbles on every gate its ultimately misguided but hilarious in any case its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
pod ganking thrashers are test reimbursable now cd
learning implants discourage playing the game having fun and instead turn it into a paint drying simulator where players are discouraged from going out on that enjoyable destroyer op because noo my 5s
this reminds me of an old thread that had a fairly interesting proposal on how to fix this problem the idea was more or less to have learning boosters that temporarily maybe 24h give you a boost in an attribute each taking a different booster slot each giving a bonus in a different attribute coming in different grades ranging from 1 boosts to 5 boosts these implants would not stack with implants so if you already have implants the boosters wouldnt do anything unless the booster effect is higher than the implants so if you have 3 implants and inject a 4 booster you will have a 4 bonus for the duration of the boosteri personally liked this idea since it mean that i for a small cost can pvp without losing training time and not having to risk my learning implants while at the same time having the drawback that i would have to spend some extra isk each time i want to pvp
why are people so desperate to cling to the restrictions that learning attributes and implants give us
i like the learning booster replacement a lot
supportedlearning implants are definitely a barrier to flying in space ive seen it a thousand times ive even done it myself when i was a newbie and iskpoorwhile youre at it get rid of neural remaps i dont want to hear i cant train up battlecruisersbattleshipswhatever for another x months because i am on my superoptimized intmem map for intmem support skills ever again theres a lot of newbies denying themselves fun ships to fly because theyre obsessed with optimized training times but thats another issue
hell while were at it lets take out the learning queuelearning skills are optional
i kept trying to rationalise keeping learning implants but not sure if i can however i think i have come to the conclusion that it is not the learning implants that are the barrier as in my high sec clone i have more combat implants that are just as expensive that i would also not want to risk losingi would rather shorten the jump clone timer to say 12hrs that said i still think that the combat implants are more interesting to use and so would probably still support the proposal
typing a lot of words doesnt make this idea any less terribleyou should feel ashamed for posting this and subjecting us to your foolishness i suggest you edit this thread and change it to a formal apology to everyone that comes here and who may have read this atrocious ideai will be waiting i expect this done in no more than 24 hours from the time of my posting
actually i said tell your carebear corpmates to train something elseit seems as though you are mildly insecure though i offer therapy sessions if youd like drop a 50 mil downpayment in my wallet and we can get started immediately
the whole take too much time only counts for the first volley typically takes 10 seconds max to hit the target from range and then its rof from there on out so its not as huge of an issue as people make it it makes a pretty good blaster boat with pretty much no tank so it makes a fairly bad blaster boat overall you can have 1200 dps on a ship but if you die within 5 seconds it isnt gonna do ya much as far as having a real pvp ship choice if i want to use the new tier 3 i have to go to one of the other races or stick with my drakes ill probably keep to my drakes since its extremely effective pvp wise i just wish ccp had actually given caldari a good ship rather then a talos disguised as a caldari ship
what if the talos is actually a naga disguised as a gallante ship
less the case ya but by the way have you read the lore drones are the main gallente weapon system though ccp hates on drones normaly more then missiles though both got poked in the eye this timebut ya hybirds are still crap drones and missiles are the best thing going for gallente and caldari ships
personally i view drones as more of an auxiliary weapons system rather then a main one since pretty much every one uses drones i just dont like the lack of love for missiles ptheir biggest drawback is simply that it takes time for the first volley to hit after that its the exact same as a hybrid weapon and for those 57 seconds people hate on missiles it just doesnt make much sense p
miniers involvement in fwthe faction warfare missions when i played were quick and fast played one person in a speed tanker and the other in a dps ships like a stealth bomber with a targeting lasercould there be a mission or even strong hold that would only let a procure through fit and fit an ice harvester on to grab npc ice to be completed for missionthe value of the mission would be higher than most as it required an escort of a non cloakable shipit only has 1 high fitted with an ice harvester a set amount of time has to be sent ice mining  maybe 2 blocks  the ship wont have much of a tank on it so the rate guarding the belt may be a problemit make the mission of escort the diplomat the procurer and his papers npc ice a style of mission not seen in fwgrant you there are short cuts like take powler to local station fit ship do mission return to station with ice package ship and return home with ore in powler but at the belt the guarding of the procurer would be interestingnpcs effected by fw immersionwould be interesting for stations in fw space to close their doors to the opposing faction players there would be some stations in the opposing space as they were loyal to the race they belong to ie quafe belongs to gellentie on those station the faction npc would park out there to blockade these stationnew missions would go up for faction capsuliers to ferry goods to these station other wise docking fees or some negative effects happen to these station happen as they begin to starveui instruction whats this buttoncan we put a UFFFDwhats thisUFFFD or putting a question mark next to the UFFFDpin this windowUFFFD button on the top right corner of the different ui windows pressing it would load the in game browser to a eve wiki page describing user interfaces purpose features and instruction possibly pointing to a you tube video tutorial to be used in a regular browser some windows would be good to start would bethe new personal assets window with its new increase functionalityoverview windowstart map
some kind of rebalancing has to happen between sleeper salvage drops and t3 buildingthe fact is nanoribbons are the only valuable salvage bc of various bottlenecks to the point that all other salvage is often not even worth carrying around because there is so much of it on the market comparatively a while ago on the old forums there was a long discussion in either markets or sciind about exactly why this is true and why it is as bad as it is but it would be nice if salvage was more balanced also it would lower the cost of t3s so more people can have fun with them
i would like to see a hide and seek level in low sec so i can spend time to hide from the casually roamer but makes me vulnerable to the pirate that hides in a system i set up ini would get a like to the features and idea area but the forums not allowing itallowing people to hide from local by detection inhibiting the local communication pylons 
there was a concern about hot drops and a proposal for whined up cyno effectshow about instead a a mass limit per second can be pushed though the bridge or cyno beacon and this limit lessens the longer the cyno is onthis would allow a wave of frigates though first to tackle cruisers to lock down battle ships to start the bs followed by the capitalswould push the need for frigs and the opportunity to reship when the carriers arrive
one of the things ill do this weekend is write up notes about the threadsi dont expect them to do it formally but some devs may do it informally csm meetings tend to be more highlevel than particular feature discussions but the lists are still helpful especially if a csm doesnt have direct experience with a particular aspect of the game and we can point the devs to the threadwe usually write up a shared document in etherpad for example to keep notesi try not to let my personal preferences influence me too much thats one reason i did the crowdsourcing
can anyone confirm this my first test of this was negative
thank you to you and any other csm members who are willing to learn about this part of the game in order to try to talk with ccp about it there have been so many threads over the years and often ideas are rejected but the thread is lost so the idea comes back again i made a post where i try to list several of the ideas that have been proposed and just give a brief explanation of the pro and con that people made for the idea for what its worth here is that post
thank you for your responsehere is another little thing that annoyed me last night i am a much more casual player than i used to be and although i have good standings with a lot of corps my standings with the militia are not quite as good even given how fruitful fw missions can be i do not real have the time to gain standings like i used to and gaining a tiny amount a couple of times a week is really not getting me very farto the point anyway apparently my own militia donUFFFDt like me enough to install a jump clone i would propose lower standings requirement for militia members to install jump clones in their own militia corp stations perhaps 3040 or something similari figure this would be a nice little benefit for those newer pilots to the militia and may make losec more accessible for newer pilots through the militia
you have my sword
my opinionvoid insurance a defeither same self destruct timer as now with killmail generation or variable sd timers and no killmail generation just my opinion
it makes sense that youd void insurance on selfdestruct it makes sense that youd not generate loot when you selfdestruct ive seen no justification in this thread other than its dumb for a self destruct to generate a kill mail for the attackerif you cant kill the ship before the timer then no km for you better selfdestructing ought to be like a giant smart bomb and damage everyone nearby if you can take down an aggressor with that last desperate act so much the betterbut it should generate a kill mail because its dumb that it does not is not a good reason
just a voice of consideration denying insurance payouts to selfdestructing ships has a very real effect on wormhole space sometimes selfdestructing isnt really voluntaryi generally agree with the thread otherwise
10
sounds goodccp do it
usally killing a super takes time and its effort as you need to plan before you go in for the kill its  if this kind of work doesnt provide any kind of trophy at all like a killmail no real man with a decent fit self destruct anyways die with pride

1it makes sense that sd timers have a direct relationship with a ships size

en lieu of a silly memeotherwise clever statementim just going to say space is not equal stop expecting it to be if you want better space then go take it else you need to accept that the fat girl you settled for will eventually age get wrinkly and likely get even fatter
true dat you force time dilation to take effect everytime you open people  places
you sir have won eve might as well quitcan i have your stuffwellyour nonbookmark stuff
edit because something went wrong with my postim afraid not if i quit eve then eve university is getting my stuff survivor of teskanen fan of john rourke i have video tutorials for eve online on my youtube channel
my client has an option to delete a bookmarkit is a clever little feature and it lowers the total number of bookmarks you have
i have somewhere north of 4000 and i add more every day
do you really want to know how bookmarks work from a technical standpoint badly they work badly
bumpedybump this topic is close to my heart
priority 2 should be boobiesas noted in my sig
two part proposal  add a module into the game that allows for a chance to deactivate a cloaking device eliminate the ability for people to frag warp a ship this is an exploit in my opinion and is abused on every ship type current state eveonline has to for lack of a better term become eve cloaksonline everyone flys ships that can cloak cloaks can be fitted on nearly any class of ship there needs to be a module that can counter act this effect in my opinion the anticloaking device would only be allowed to be fit on a light interdictor or heavy interdictor and would have the same penalty as the current warp disruption field generator module where a player would not be able to be remote repped or helped in anyway while the module is active
i agree with this and will add that i would also support another designated ship type whose designed purpose is for that anticloaking device
suggesting a solution for a problem or two that isnt there well i guess its about par for this forum
as you are too much of a coward to live in nullsec and too stupid to adapt so you decide to die and cry all i can recommend is you go back to highsec its called afk cloaking for a reason they are afk and if they aint whats the problem dont like having cloaked ships around your intel channelssystem security not up to scratchwell guess what thats your own fault cry more
look at thisbot they already have the modules in the game already there are modules for all other issues in the game why not a decloaking device
what is frag warping unfamiliar with the termalso no to a decloaker i like watching people dock up because a nonblue is in their system and yes i stay at the computer i do read a book though
fragwarping is using a noncovops cloak and a mwd to be able to warp as soon as you decloakif ccp considers this a bug being exploited they should patch itas for the ability to decloak ships just no there would no point in a cloaking device if every wormhole corp and nullsec alliance could just pull out the magic decloaker whenever they felt like it youre not talking about balance youre talking about nerfing it to near uselessness
not unless you make the range around 10km no falcon or other cloaky ship should be that close to a target while cloaked anyways its designed to aid you in decloaking a ship in your immediate vicinityccp does not consider the frag warping a bug and working as intended
it means you need to defrag your warp drive every 5000 lightyears or so otherwise you start leaving little bits of antimatter all over star systems and it just gets messy and cluttered not to mention the possible damage caused by said antimatter chunks if you hit one going at 10 au it could total your frig
oh look its this threadagainthere is nothing broken about cloaking mechanics other than your inability to comprehend and adequately counter them good day sir
again the circular nature of these forums is revealedthe mwd and cloak trick has been raised many many oh so many times and ccp has stated it is a valid tactic have a remote sebo alt on grid boosting your interceptors if someone escaping your gate camp is that much of a problem for youas to afk cloaking i suppose it can be annoying if your on the receiving end and are of a delicate disposition but with proper organisation it isnt a real problem
weve tried that
by making money shop mandatory by giving game advantage even with seemingly innocuous things like neural remaps and clone jumps youre asking the hell to break loose whoever in your management has the ridiculous idea that people will pay an arm and a leg to play a game need to sober before real damage is done and damage will not be done to playerbase which will leave for greener pastures be it wow or rift or swtor but ccppaying subscription and on top of it having mandatory microtransactions is unacceptable most posters in the thread share my sentiment im certain and i smell the rat now rmt is just for conveniences just like before was only for vanity stuff whats next i wonderand by the way get rid of aurum and make nex store stuff purchasable with plex directly if buying it for the isk makes your management uncomfortable though because these currencies are interchangeable nex items are available for isk more than one currency feels horribly contrived
this i am scared to death by ccp constantly bringing up microtransactions ccp used to pride itself on making a smart game that stood out yet every time i turn around they want to do what works for cookie cutter mmos that dont hang around for more than a couple years i know this thread isnt meant for ccp directly but could you guys on the csm try extremely hard to drive home the fact that eve is inherently not your run of the mill mmo and thus strategies meant for run of the mill mmos will probably not work for their product i feel like this was something they understood at some pointmore on topicvanity onlypreferably none at all
make a market where items will be selling by players for rm and cpp will have  from it is good idea better then microtransactionsbut iUFFFDm afraid something like this
dont let up on this vanity itself is a very dodgy and entirely subjective concept one mans vanity is another mans content and once you start imposing artificial dividers between grades of content you open a pandoras box that ruins the integrity of the sandbox we pay a sub we get eve online thats about as complicated as it needs to get screw nex and microtransactions and the horse they rode in on to be honestand the people in this thread still arguing that ccp need extra income do need to realize that things have changed in a pretty serious way this year allow me to explain with a friendly illustration ccp games is a successful professional father he manages to pay the bills and invest in the future of his only daughter eve eve is bright and original lovely to talk to and manages to impress everyone as shes growing up with her quirky independence and feisty joie de vivrethen a few years ago ccp games met a mascarawearing floozy with fake breasts and a penchant for dressing up her twin chihuahua muts in mink waistcoats the name of the floozy was world of darkness and almost immediately she started spending ccps money hard working successful ccp soon found itself pressed for cash as world of darkness wined and dined a succession of longhaired poetic emo types and slept late after drinking all his wine and eating his larder barethen even worse world of darkness brought her unlovable adolescent son from her first failed marrage dust 514 into the house playing loud industrial house music and snorting crystal meth at all hours of the night dust repeatedly broke all the furniture and invited thieves and pimps to squat on the living room floor and set up their mtnex rackets in the front garden because everyone else is doing itbetween them world and darkness and dust came close to bankrupting poor old ccp dad and while the goth harlot tapped his bank account for investments into the experimental work of internationallyreknowned fashion artistes monocle and 1000 jeans the horrible teenage stepson was trying to corrupt poor little eve into turning mt tricks on the street corner for small change to fund his meth habit because daddy needs your help with the bills those players who believe encouraging this situation is the right approach by finding excuses for mt are simply abusing poor eve and betraying the hard working professional dad while overlooking the real cause of the crisis an appalling girlfriend and her nasty teenage son so what happened this autumn is that some of ccp dads friends the good player base came round and talked things over some with baseball bats ccp woke up to the reality of the situation and threw world of darkness out on her skanky backside and hurled her suitcases out on the street dust 514 promised to clean up his act and is now on best behavior and eve can finally come out of her room again without being paraded in cheap tarty underwear for the mt meth addicts to ogle at ccp dad tearfully apologies to eve and promises never to get into bed with noxious slappers again in the futureso the morale of this story is that the biggest challenge to ccp dads income was resolved when the sluttysleeparound world of darkness got booted out on the street there is no longer any need to have eve turn mt tricks to pay the rent sure dust 514 is still living with us but he turns 16 next summer and will then need to get his own job and place and sink and swim on his owneve will keep growing and everyone is happythe end we dont need microtransactions in eve
agreeget rid of all statsi dont see concord out here collecting info so it has to go 
the contradictory factor in this post is astoundingyou support making wormholes more dark and mysterious yet you want more information on what wormhole bonus may be affecting a system i think you need to rethink that buddy
i completely disagree i disagree with the removal of the api data for wormholes and i object to removing any more data from themconsider what it takes to live in a wormhole there is no local there is no concord there is no market there is no moon mining no sovereignty no jump clones no static asteroid belts no ice fields no regularly spawning rats if youre podkilled you get ejected to kspace and have to wait until theres an opening that you can get back through you live under the constant threat of ambush and must pound dscan to have any degree of personal security its already incredibly challenging to make a life in that sandbox making it harder does not make it more mysterious it makes it more annoyingthe api data was a small advantage that could give a wormhole settler some idea of activity in the system it wasnt real time information jumps like kills show up up to an hour after the fact it takes resourcefulness and dedication to utilize the apiconcord doesnt watch over nulsec either so should the api data be removed there tooif you want an rp explanation try this jumping the vast distances of space has many subtle yet far reaching effects on spacetime technologies used by modern capsuleers allows them to roughly interpret these effects and estimate the number of jumps to or from a given system its not concord keeping track it is your ship detecting quantum particle spin aggregation through a eilfer matrix which we all know is standard issue in navigation computersdont make living in wormholes harder than it already is especially at the behest of wormhole tourists and gankers who already have enough advantages over the inhabitantsdo any of the people who 1d actually live in a wormhole
agree remove everything jumps npc kills ship kills pod kills though those last two will show up on killboards but that requires a bit more workwormholes should be the unknown they advertise themselves as
god forbid you actually have to face the unknown in unknown space
wormhole bonus is a static information jumps and kills are dynamic informationyou may see it as a contradiction but it actually makes perfect sense when you compare it to other bonusestake your ship would you prefer if the bonus were hidden and were only available on a website would this make it more mysterious no it doesnt it just makes it a hassle to remember all the bonus by heartsame thing with wormholes bonus it would be nice to have that information available in game right now what we have is a message for half a second after we jump saying your ships is being affect by the system  im not entirely sure what it says since i never get to read it all its easy to tell the wormhole bonus from the background though so bonus are not something hidden you only need to do a research on the web and connect the dots i would just like to have that information available in the gamein short wormhole bonus being unknown does not add to the mystery of the wormhole so its not a contradiction
its still information the lack of information would mean unknown the fact that information is provided means that is one less thing that is unknown the way it should have beenno static dump of the informationno ccp provided information on exactly numbers for what changes were madeimagine that all you received was a message weird effects on your ship and you could see some changes in space now it would be on the players to figure out what exactly is changed it would be on the players to face the unknown and possibly decipher itwould it be harder absolutely would players eventually compile the information into a database probablybut at least we would truly have to endure the unknown its easy mode right now
i realize that the words unknown and mysterious are frequently used when discussing wormholes but i think youre being too literal if you interpret those word as some kind of mandate wormholes are what ccp makes them to be and i think it is a bad idea to further limit a third of the systems in the game in pursuit of an adjectiveif the best argument for removing the api is because it increases ignorance then i dont see it as justified under the same argument one could crusade to make dscan useless in wormholes or to make static wormholes to go to random places or to make it impossible to tell how long a wormhole will stay open or how much mass it can take in the pursuit of i have no idea what is going on you could stop showing the names of anomalies and let the pilots roll the dice and see if they land on grid at a class 1 perimeter camp or a class 6 core bastion all of these examples make things more unknown and all of these ideas are dumbif you need a word to cling to try arcane or esoteric
why i would like to see this change is simplemissiles dont work verry good in space missiles depend on explosion force to do their damage but an explosion needs air to travel trough and in space there is no air for the explosion to travel trough the only damage a missile does do is the kinetic damage of the impact and em radiation damage from a certain nuclear payload heat damage and explosion damage is kind of rediculouseso would vote for some new weapon something like disruptorsthis is an energy beam that disrupts molecular bonds of the targets thus doing damage to itheat damage would work like a microwave disruptor beam agitating the molecules in the targetkinetic dmage would not be possible explosion dmage would be difficult  still thinking on that oneem damge would exist of a high radiation disruptor beamcaldari would be a heat and em damage race like amarrammo would exist of disruptor energy crystalsfix the missiles once and for all by getting them out of the game entirelyreplace all missile skills by disruptor skills of the same level
go away
but my immersion
1 explosive damage in eve comes from a big burst of subatomic particles headed at you not a wave of pressure go look at a proton smartbomb the reason that its called explosive damage is because of the fact its associated with nuclear warheads2 shrapnel still works in space we know that from space junk and micrometeroids irl that or you just drive a big fat ke penetrator straight into the target
i have two poses in hisec keep the defence modules turned off to save resources the fuel blocks will triple my lox burn rate and add 25 to my deo2 burn rate slight decreses in other items to not compensate for this also adds extra step of having to manufacture the fuel blocks and move them to the pos storagethanks for your consideration
supporting this because it benefits some lone hisec dude and his two little towers  everyone else who asked for this changenot really
awwwwww your personal high sec poss will no longer be profitablehow terrible working as intended get friendsalso an extra step thats absolutely great its one more step people can make money off of its also a step that enables pos logistics to be much easier
im gonna agree that the needs of your one man corp far outweigh the hassle that is fueling towers for the vast majority of tower fuelers aka the 00 alliances risk free play is what ccp is about so your proposal makes perfect sense we should enable play styles such as your where you only interact with others via the market if that counter doesnt tick over on your isk as fast as you want youd probably unsubscribe
admitting to giving the op the likenot because i agree though i saw how many the op had and laughedthen i felt bad negative kharma sucks so i likednowstop badposting
counter proposal stop trying to solo in a multiplayer gamealternatively biomass yourself vertisce  zero is not negative think you should have left well enough alone
go and do hisec incursions for wait didnt i already say this hisec is a massive isk faucet it needs a few extra sinks
there are tons of good information on dust514org scroll dow to the interview with halldor fannan
just sayingi think it would be epic to see the crapton of engine trails in warp from a fleet of 50 ships the engine trails should be visible as far as the eye can see behind you while in warp and disappear at the same speed you decelerate when you leave warp anybody else think this would be cool
prices of pi commodites have increased considerably since crucible introduced the tremendous increase in import and export taxes this runaway inflation will eventually affect many other aspects of everecommend the taxes be cut in half and the csm monitor the situation and be empowered to order adjustment in the rates as needed to keep the economy moving interesting how this issue follows rl developments with various economic situationsthis could be a quarterly review to startone other idea to mitigate would be to significantly increase the storage capacity of the control center perhaps to 50000 m3 this would allow a way to bypass taxes on the outbound launches and would reduce the amount of time needed to operate a pi complex would not solve the problem of import taxes but there are ways around thatthanks for reading  fly safe
this has to be a troll are you serious if the csm was able to adjust the taxes on high sec pi theyd increase them you know the csm is packed with 00 delegates right
not a troll simplt unaware of any 00 bias of csm thought they represented all of us with equal vigorso maybe plan b is best increase capacity of the control center
see this is why you dont sink sp into new features you dont know when ccp will remove that feature for everyone except 6 of the playerbase whose subscription they deem superior than yours for some reasonthis is why eve has 350k subs after 8 years half of them alts the other half bots
no
actually the best plan would probably be for you to think about the game in a holistic way rather than what impact any given chance has on your income then again you could just escape the bonds of empire and fly free in 00 space also you dont really know anything about economics so please dont try to pretend like an increase in pi costs via taxation is going to create runaway inflation its merely going to shift the market a bit in part because eve basically cant sustain a futures market due to trust issues theres not going to speculation driven spikes in commodities prices so equilibrium will be reestablished quickly where pi production is moved to places with lower taxes aka low sec or null secits almost like that was the intent of the change  to remove another zero risk isk faucet and move production of pi to places where players can interact with each other through space boat violence
no move to lowsec
go an d do hisec incursions for 10 minutes that should cover your months pi taxes
i thought this was going to be about scaling trails to the size of the engine theyre from because 
dependsi think making the trails too thick would look silly
ship trails add nothing to the game i would just as soon see them go away
you add nothing to eve i would just as soon see you go away
im concerned that player owned customs offices are being thought of as a means to drive conflict and encourage small gang work as it stands it really doesnt happen because right now there is no way to inerrupt productivity of a planet as it appears the resources keep being produced and piling up until the gantry is out of reinforced mode id like to make it more urgent to defend these structures by making it so that reinforcing the gantrycustoms office stops production planetside eg like in moon mining poses a pos in reinforced mode does not produce moon goo cpu based modules go offline so should pi structures alternatively perhaps make it so its possible to raid planetary resources when you reinforce the customs office what it boils down to is imo there should be consequences for owning more space than you can reasonably police right now there arent and thats a bit sad
regarding sov ive written another proposal for the csm that covers the issues with territorial warfare
the pay out for the hulk is in line with other ship of the tech 2 designtech2 ships are meant to be the lure for people to use and loose  higher reward  higher riskstick with the covetor if your hulk is getting shot as the insurance the same as the hulk but the price of the hull is 19 of the price
dont fly what you cant afford to lose
i totally agree that the wardec mechanism need to to be updated i think this is a good start i dont necessarily like the platform thing but i am not oppose to it either
bananaphone o
if you get past the ky and look at the idea objectively may not make sense for outlaw factions but would make sense for concord to jail hisec gankers for 24 hours
i aint going to space jail ysee
no they should be biomassed instead
you do realize you cant undock in anything other than a pod for 15 minutes after ganking someone in highsec or you get concorded again and that you can be podded by pretty much anyone
 shield sc still need higher shield regeneration per second because fleetlink bonuses just to remember when they get are getting bonuses they start it with extrashield damaged make each sc to use their race fighter bomber only with 10k dps20 fb
my counterproposal is to increase the turret slots and remove the missile slots and remove capital size missiles from the game problem solved now i can have a shieldtanking moros
or we could just add a launcher hardpoint to both the moros and the revelation and an additional launcher hardpoint to the nag problem solved the ccp way
greetingsthose of you who scan down explorations sites on a regular basis are aware that the best time to find them is immediately following downtime as this is when many of them spawn this is quite inconvenient for those of us who live in the us as downtime is between 3am6am and not the best eve playing timei would like to ask for a greater randomization in the timing of these spawns rather than a whole bunch appearing after downtime keep the number that spawn over the course of a day the same just spread it out better over the course of a day so there are some left by the time us evening rolls around no one should have an advantage based solely upon the timezone they dodont live inthanks
actually all of us who actually do exploration know that thats complete and utter crap sites respawn right after they despawnthread
im not talking about  gravimetricmagnetometric sites im talking null ded plexes come back when you learn something son
thats actually what i was talking about too all sites use the same respawning mechanic it would behoove you to learn what youre talking about before you start throwing around insults
having ran these sites for 4 months i know for a very solid fact that yes they are far more likely to spawn after downtime and much easier to find experience has very clearly shown me this if youre trolling then go find some other thread if you havent figured this out yet well go give it a try sometime the mechanics on this need to be fixed
sounds like youre suffering from proof of the null hypothesis the respawning mechanics are well known by most explorers if you choose to ignore the facts theres not much that can be done for youshrug to use a quote im fond of you cant argue with all the fools in the world its easier to let them have their way then trick them when theyre not paying attention though theres no tricking needed in this caseedit and sites are ever so slightly more likely to respawn at dt but only the 0000000001 of sites that dont get completed for 3 days will respawn then however the amount of sites who get left sitting there halfrun for three days is so small as to be completely and utterly insignificant
youre quite wrong actually and only making yourself look like an idiot by continuing to post like thissites will respawn at downtime only if their despawn timer has been started ie by going to the site this varies by site types but ultimately it means that when the timer is done and the site has still yet to be completed the site will respawn somewhere else following the next downtimethis is why we often see stock piles of sites in systems that are not visited these sites do not get their timer triggered and thus sit idle for days
i live in the us and i frequently find multiple ded 410s per hour
having run these sites for about 14 months i know for a very solid fact that youre wrongnext youre going to be saying that mnr got stealth nerfed with the latest patch or something
reduced jump clone timers would work in a pinch but in my opinion learning implants are dumb and well nobody has come forward with a reasonable objection to their removal just forum alts parroting risk risk risk crap its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i mean yes there should be increased risk in nullsec in relation to empire but being forced to keep implant clones in empire is more of a punishment than a consequenceedit i realize that mining barge insurance payouts matter a lot to a lot of people but really im bumping this its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i havent had a implant in for atleast 6 months now cant say i miss themalso have 2 clones with full plus 4s and assorted hardwirings havent used them in nearly 7 months
risk should only apply to ppl other than myself empire carebears should have their pimpboats ganked and lose everything they own thats fair risk but i should be able to get podded with zero loss in null bubble because im not a hypocrite like that
didnt i say to come back with your main its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
it does sound reasonable like thati personally like that dying and losing a pod is a big deal but if they replaced the learning attributes with more combat stats then there would still be a good reason to get implants
except you wont be as compelled to put combat implants in a pod thatll get bubbled oh wait thats the whole point  ensure your null podkill produce zero losswow is that way 
learning implants are just as bad as learning skills
supported although im not so keen on the idea of replacing them with slot 15 combat implants pirate sets excepted
people fly with hardwirings and pirate sets in nullsec all the timeand i wont be the first to point out the irony of talking about aversion to risk while posting from an npc corp forum alt its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i support this proposal and will be pushing it come wednesday in the meetingsbetter yet ill mention it over beer in islenskibarrin on tuesday before the summit thats how much i love you
naga should be missile boat imo but lets be honest it looks like eithera a carrierb a giant railgun
simple if caldari had too many missle boats already and not enough rail boatsthese new bcs are supposed to be the baby brothers to the associated t3 battleship class youre giving rokh pilots the finger
i can fix this entire thread for you with two sentencesnaga has been released and its a rail boat deal with it
i pushed for a torp naga until i realized that smartbombs would render them useless in the sacred purpose of murdering supercaps howeverthe naga is the only caldari rail platform with a damage bonus thats huge  caldari typically only get range and shield bonuses for rails the rail naga owns learn to love it
no they still change they all now have a similiar id in the same system most of the time after dt they are for exampleasd441 bsd441 csd441 and so on a new id that spawn like a k162 get an id that doesnt match that patternbut they all get other ids after downtime

it does seem weird that all of the other anoms were balanced buffed and all the drone regions got was a nerf
perhaps incentive todesire other space
maybe you should make a cartel on the minerals you get from the alloysbecause thats the real problem heredrone anoms arent a fixed isk give out like the others dont expect them to get buffed when the problem is the one your creatingyour suggestion is really dumb because what you want will increase the amount of minerals taht would be produced from drone anoms there by causing the price to fall on them there for once again causing the anom to not be as good as regular anoms not to mention this would wreck mineral prices
i never meant that to be a suggestion just the comment that they could double it and it still wouldnt pay out as much this was to put into perspective how lacking they are compared to the other sites the way i should have phrased it was they could double the value of these sites and it still wouldnt be the same there are a lot of ways they could adjust this value as i posted in another thread ill leave it up to ccp to balance it im only pointing out the problem sorry if i phrased that to make it sound like i thought it was a proper fixi dont think making a cartel out of the minerals is a proper solution either assuming that drone alloys are really what is ruining the mineral market im not certain they are or arent im not a market guy and for all the talk ive seen i have yet to see numbers thousands of pilots cant just sit on their minerals and hope that they double or more in value while they get no income not to mention how the market would get flooded once they reached a valuable level all this time hoping bots and other miners dont start making up the difference preventing prices from even getting that high income is necessary just like anywhere else in the game any problem we are creating is out of necessity we need isk our sites give minerals we turn minerals into isk and use that to pay sov bills fit our ships etcagain though im only pointing out the problem i really dont care how its corrected but seeing every region of eve get balanced and ccp not even commenting on when or if they will do something with the drone regions doesnt fill me with hope
old timers get sick of replying and fresh noobs come in its the nature of things
what ccp needs to be doing is attacting new subscribers so that they have more money coming in from their subscriptionbased economic model fortunately this new expansion seems to be working in this regard but we need to go further  get rid of the nex entirely
1 for the swordplay id love to see that happenit would be nice to have a few duel games that you could play in stations against other people for money and bragging rightsi imagine that there could be some interesting board games ala dejarik from st
this is a massive pun intended problem for wh dwellers please read
i propose that when characters eventually walk around stations there be an actual location station vaults where your inventory is stored in these vaults you will be able to see the items that you have there move the crates and pallets around and organize them as you see fit or have drones autoorganize it for you if you dont care you will be able to walk around in your warehouse get a conception of the volume your items take up and generally marvel at your growing hoard this is not a proposal to replace the inventory list by any means just to give that list more dimensionsfurther you could have to pay rent to stations for storage perhaps the station would charge more for larger andor more secure storage facilities if this is implemented i would recommend that whatever fees on basic unsecured storage be very minori would also suggest that players be able to try and hack their way into other peoples vaults once inside there could be a way for them to steal things reprogram forklift drones to move the goods to a waiting vehicle or transport tube there could be an array of security measures purchased by the owner automated defense guns detection grids etc put in place to protect the vault if you want to think ambitious some commodities like slaver hounds and militants would naturally serve as vault defense i would suggest that station security roving security drones cameras etc scale in accordance with the security status of the station the security patrols in the dark hallways of a losec station would be less frequent than the well lit halls of vaults in hisec one thing to consider is what happens to those who get caught death and a new medical clone seems relatively light punishment if you have a thief jumpclone can an owner insure versus theft could this lead to insurance fraud is that a bad thingthese additions would accomplish the following goals give players a greater feeling that things in their inventory actually exist they take up space and would be easy to see how much volume and quantity of something you have not just a number on a spreadsheet encourage hoarders to put items on the market rather than paying for storage indefinitely indulge those players that would enjoy being overly anal in organizing their gear facilitate player creation of station security theory people would talk about effective anti theft strategies and evaluate the various countermeasures usefulness thieves would film their crimes blog about their techniques and gloat about their biggest hauls offer a new challenge to capsuleers and possibly even introduce a whole new occupation of people specialize in station theft this could lead to a new type of mercenary who targets assets of corps and individuals more skills to learn hacking a station vault would require a whole new set of skills maybe thieving gearclothes would have to be bought with aur i appreciate your input this is a big can of worms and admittedly it is a huge pipe dream but what do you think
i like the new fuel block it will make my life a lot easier when refilling the fuel bay also if the price is good it means i wont have to constantly check for what is missing in the fuel bayif pos fuel becomes a widespread problem then im sure ccp will look into it until then if youre unable to pay the maintenance fee than find something else share a pos with a corp or a friend to cut down on cost theres always something else and worse case you just make less isk
i have multiple towers in hiseci prefer this new fuel block thing since i use allot less fuel compared to the old systemyou suck at mathkthanx
i would like to see few things changed  minimal representation of each major playstyles representatives  ie null hi low wh etc  players should be able to vote for more than one playstyles candidates for example being able to vote for null and wh representative  csm should have in game visibility  in game croudsourcing for example csm news on splash screen csm voting in game etc  csm should have tags on forum like gmdevsnow a little more explanation for 2 first pointsi represent few playstyles i like incursions and used to run missions every day at some point i used to live in 00 and would like to have many things in there reworked now i live in wh space and see all the things that need work in there tooso i would sleep better if i knew that csm have representative for each of those playstyles even one dedicated personcsm consist of what 10 delegates if i recall correctly lets say there are 7 major playstyles hi low null wh fw mining industry  those are just examples that can be totally difrent each playstyles have at least one delegate and 3 playstyles that are most common have second delegateeach delegate will be somehow either by ccp or by running candidate categorized to one playstyleeach player would be then able to vote in up to two three categoriesthis ofc have it drawbacs possibilities of gaming system and putting much more representatives by heavy organised entities goons eve uni etcjust food for discussionread and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
make sure that all or most aspectsareas of eve are represented  the travesty that is the current null council is bad for eve as whole
this thread is a good collection of tinfoil stuff im going to push minimum signatures requirementmore electoral visibilitystuff thats dead on arrivalsiloing proposalscoerced votingits important to allow people to not vote if they feel the csm is a sham i dont plan to vote for president in freedomland next november and if i was forced to id write in mickey mouse people shouldnt be required to validate a system they consider to be bullshit i suspect csm7 will see vastly increased turnout because despite a tiny vocal minority of the blind and deluded most players now realize how much power and influence a properlyled csm can wield they ran a lot of login ads for the csm6 election if you didnt notice them its not because ccp didnt try  its because people didnt think the csm mattered
i propose the following changes awakening in a clone incurs a negative effect called neurotransfer shock that lasts for a while you cannot undock with neurotransfer shock rp justification the doctors wont let you fly a starship in that state the med bay sells a service a drug that clears the effects of neurotransfer shock but this costs isk the amount of isk required scales with sp but remains constant after 546 million sp at 78 million isk equivalent to buying a clone grade pi you do not have to keep your clone up to date you cannot lose sp in this system you only pay to get back into action quick the duration of neurotransmitter shock also scales with sp and reaches a maximum of x 1 hour perhaps at 546 million sp the minimum is 10 minutes for very low sp players the way i see it there need not be the possibility of losing sp due to forgetfulness also clone costs for high sp players is too high it discourages them to to pvp in smaller ships or situations where there is substantial risk of podding i have come up with this system to address these two points numbers are pretty much arbitrarily chosen here to illustrate the idea
nope remember to keep your clone up to date
have warpgates with extra restrictions for ship type and ship amounts so only a set number of ships can enter like 1v1 and for teams have a set number of groups246 a channel in cq for spectators no rewards but have stat tracking no auto queue or teleport to arena you have to still fly to the system if your group disbands your warped out of the group arena have time limits 2030 mins after last activation
nowow is that way dont forget to biomass yourself on the way out
fixed the title for ya
supporting non blob pvp oh noez no one will join the blob anymore
ok if you want an arena set it upyou or any of us really dont need ccp to set this up for you you already have the tools you need to get this going 
thisread and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
cant there be something in eve that takes little to no effort would like to login do some pvp without it taking forever to find an even or better number fight also without having to join a corp and login everyday to get kills to be active
no
yeah your arena will take little to no effort  once set up of course theres also rvb
rvb is ok but not if u fly t3t2faction
lolrp you wouldnt see the trails behind you as your ship is traveling at ftl speed
yeah eve is sooo realistic
if you are going faster then light then the light will lag behind you and then create a trail
you do realise that im making more doing pi now after the tax increase than before right please qq more and quit because you cant do math right
one of the better proposals to come out of this has been that the tax might be reduced by a combination of skills and standings as the other in game isk sinks are i think that this is the best overall way that players might have their cake and eat it tooand while im making a killing on this i can see how it will be bad in the long run
 hamoiif you do your homework and follow the market price youll notice that the pi price have gone up in price to the point where its more profitable than before pos owners will be the one to swallow the cost and most of those belong to wealthy corp
the problem is that its driving the t2 market through the roof which damages the game in the long run by discouraging new players
since new players cant use most t2 modules to begin with this encourages the use of the meta named items more this will encourage the use of lower level meta items even more instead of their value being the scrap value of the minerals they contain they will be sold and used this is also desirable and encourages new players to fly what they can affordsince t2 prices are going to go through the roof as you say you mean that people owning towers will be better able to pay for the fuel with their profitsplease quit because you cant do math
im sorry did you just say someone knows nothing about economics in eve and then say that we dont get speculation spikes in eve
move to lowsecor do some diplomacy and get soem blues in lowsec who have pi officesor just pay the taxes if i am reading this correctly its 10 of market value before the market speculation price spike which by the way you guys caused by whining on these very forums so if you make a pi thing that costs 1000000 isk on market 10 of that is 100000 isk you still make 900000 iskhonestly this change is breathing life into lowsec which is amazing and id bet with your market speculation price spike even with the concord taxes you are probably making more profit per uniti honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
speaking as someone who is a well known authority on planets and space i would usually try to see the proposal from the ops point of view however i have found that it is impossible for myself to place my head up his bottom as wellas a result i will be unable to support his position on this subject and instead push for an increasing of the base rate of tax in high sec to 20 so to provide some incentive to utilize the low sec interbus custom office installationssir patrick moore cbe frs fras hon vice president of the royal astronomical society
or blow them up and build their ownbtw i was skeptical when he said he was an authority on planets and space until i saw his monocle thats all the proof i needi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
noless people doing pi  awesome for my profitsgrow some balls setup your own pocos in 00 or whs defend em and pay less tax for more isk
no the reasons people are complaining are good things move to lowsec and stop crying
more risk more reward no risk crappy reward the fundamental principle of eve
you know ive considered something similar i was imagining fighters and bombers to be the equivalent of battle pods if you are destroyed you jump into a medical clone just as if youd been podkilledi dont agree with your guidelines i see them as ultralight superfast frigatesit could be worthwhile to entertain the thought
whoah i hadnt even noticed that yeah thats a good point tooi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
you both are rightship trails dont add anything to the gamebut the other guy needs to go away because they are pretty cool
ccp is looking to get people out of high sec and frankly all the big sticksmall carrot approach currently being used does is play with the market and engender hard feelings at various times in the past ccp has mentioned the idea of coregency for corps of sufficent standing to claim a system in lowsec in the same manner that null sec alliances are able to claim space i feel that if this were implemented and were to include the ability to set up conquerable outposts in systems without stations this may be the answer theyre looking for
implants grant you bonuses some bonus learning speed others bonus combat stats simple as that the argument for removing attribute implants could also be applied to gunnerymissile hardwirings there is no difference eve is very much a game about choices you can learn faster or you can be cheaper or you can use piratefw implants for other bonuses but you must make a choice and thats important in games like eve the simple fact is you dont need implants at all to raise your skills it just takes slightly longer without them care to know what the difference between my 5 set and a 3 pirate implant set is on the 50d skills i train nowadays about 5 days 24 hours of being in the 3 combat implants isnt going to make more than maybe an hour or two difference on thatim ok with adjusting the clone jump timer hell im ok with setting it to a simple 30s session change timer but the attribute implants are nothing like the learning skills learning skills costed basically nothing and you didnt lose them when you got podded implants you do using implants even attribute ones is no different than slapping some faction gear on your ship other than its obviously strapped to your pod instead
hi this isnt about combat implants or hardwirings at all or about faction implant sets this is about learning implants exclusively its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
you arent planning to use hardwiring anyway but are unwilling to part with learning bonus stop believing in your own lies all you goon noobs want is to be able to get podded at zero loss
its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i mean lets face it goose99 you probably have never set foot in nullsec and youre one of those idiots who thinks that we mine and run sanctums in cynojammed systems with 80 t2 large anchored bubbles on every gate because thats what your friends who were in solarlegion renter corps tell you they did lmao its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
death 2 learning implants
you fail at reading comprehension please try again
reducing the jump clone timer or removing it out right has the same effect so vov youre just ramblingalthough i do fear that itd lead to strategic placement of jump clones and allow large alliances to essentially run multiple campaigns at once in opposite sides of the galaxy and be able to react far better to attacks on allies again in opposite sides of the galaxy have you considered that replacing learning implants with 5 to the base values of all five attributes is a better solution its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i plugged in 4s as soon as the lp store was introduced and the price fell to 20m kept right on pvping and living in nullsec the whole 4 yearsyeah ive lost a few sets but the overhead was more than acceptable for the reward if the horrible prospect of losing 36m isk worth or implants is keeping you from pvping now then removing implants wont stop you being a huge riskaverse baby youll just find some other reason
removing attribute implants means you can just self destruct your pod and instantly jump across eve as well the only practical difference here is changing the timer doesnt remove an important game element that said im completely fine with things the way they are in regards to implantsclone jumping and i think youll find that most others are as welland as has been stated if the thought of losing 50m isk in implants keeps you from pvping then im pretty sure you wouldnt risk that 60m isk drake either so yeah you arent going to pvp in this game no matter what i happens i think
attack the argument not the person
im not a riskaverse baby who is scared of losing implants hell i pvp with 4s and i have extra sets on hand i dont have an insane amount of isk but implants arent a dent on my wallet thats not the case for everyone though is itare you forgetting that the guy who gets podded has in 99 of cases lost his ship at some point prior popping someones faction cruiserhact3 inflicts a visible loss doesnt itits not about me wanting to skill faster its about a bad game mechanic its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
youre entitled to your opinion but i think its a good game mechanic you pay isk to train skills faster and risk losing that bonus if you engage in risky activities what is so wrong with that
you cant remove it completely that would screw things up hard but im in favor of instead of removing learning implants introduce the much discussed skill to reduce clone timer 12h per level should do the trick nicely
theyre a relic its basically the same thing as learning skills oblivious new players screw themselves over by not getting them as soon as possible its yet another mechanic that alienates them its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
there is no good argument in favour of 24 hour jump clone timers learning implants and arbitrary learning attributesid like to see someone from ccp defend having to stay a year remapped into charisma because you want to be an fc
yes learning implants suckwe need more combat more pirate implants perhaps some t3 implants
stopped playing eve because of learning implants 5 times in a row now i have two metal plates in my brain feels cold
heres an idea to kick around lets say that ccp decides not to remove learning implants from the game a very good probability how about charging a base isk amount to set the jumpclone timer to 0 it could be modified by the total levels of implants learning and combat implanted in your clone and perhaps additionally modified by the number of hours left before you could normally jumpclone againthis way if you had x number of hours left before you could jumpclone and something came up you would have the option to jumpclone immediatelythis does not solve the problem of the isk strapped pilots but it would promote flexibility and fun pvp in the game
i remember that thread and this idea is my favorite so far
near as can tell the jump clone timer is helpful for keeping folk from bouncing from one end of space to the other at will and with no consequences sort of like the old jump bridges come to think of it at least that was the argument made for nerfing them but anyways essentially the current system encourages players especially nullsec and lowsec residents to develop a home base because it prevents a nullsec resident from bouncing to highsec at will to grind isk then instantly jumping back to null for a fleet op or jump cloning for a fleet op in stain and then jumping back to geminate to run sanctums so currently jump cloning has moderate drawbacks and forces a player to weigh whether jump cloning is worth it or whether he should wait or find an alternate route for accomplishing what he wants removing the timer might lead more players to live in highsec and only jump clone up for major fleets reducing null population or it might not for those players who already have highsec alts grinding missions or incursions i do know that itd be nice to be able to hop down to highsec once in a while for pve without worrying about missing a fleet opalso not sure whether removing the learning implants is good or bad if only because they probably serve as a useful isk and lp sink the big issue with learning skills was that they 1 were functionally mandatory and 2 kept players from getting into ships and doing fun stuff early on because they felt compelled to train learning skills learning implants arent considered mandatory because their effects are relatively small to the point where players who actively pvp wont bother to inject implants into the game the training time for them is fairly short and the 1 to 3 implants are cheap enough that even active pvpers can afford to replace one or two of them while new players can probably save up enough to buy them without it significantly affecting their gameplay if at all at least i had no issue affording a full set of 3 implants when i started and a set of 4 implants was a nice goal once i got into a battleship those at risk of losing implants through pvp have to make a choice between faster training time or losing isk when podded but thats fairly similar to the effect learning implants had on new players even if older players should be able to balance cost and benefit better so i wouldnt consider it a terrible loss for the game if learning implants were removed if attributes are boosted as well then it would definitely be a minor benefit for those who actively pvp though doubt it would really affect newer players all that much removing attributes themselves sounds kind of messy and im not sure who it would really benefit if anyone new players already start off with a generic attribute distribution and so arent locked into anything nor does the game force a player to remap attributes this character spent two years with an even attribute distribution because i had no real idea what i would train even two months down the road and didnt want to be locked into a training plan even though others were training faster than this character i dont think attributes or remap timers really hurt me in any way or stopped me from having fun but maybe im just an oddball in general i like meaningful choice and it seems as though attributes and remaps provide that  a player who knows what he wants can remap and train for it quickly while a player who doesnt can stick with an even attribute distribution and train slightly slower but with the option of training for something else at any time
thats like sayin amarr has too many laser ships and not enough missile boats oo and the rokh itself is outmatched when compared to other ships of its variant dont get me wrong i still use it and love it but it just doesnt match up to the other tier 3 battleships
im just going to throw this out there its my opinion after looking at all four tier 3 bcs that the naga with its rails is in fact the best of them so quit your whining already
oh no now if you want to fly a caldari pve missile boat youre only limited to drakes ravens and tengus missiles are horrible for pvp so if you made the naga a missile boat its primary purpose would be for pve if you want to fly a pve missile boat use one of the above as any of them would be more effective at pveso if you made the naga as a missile boat it would be useless in pvp and outclassed by 3 other ships in pve essentially making it a useless noveltyits working as intended get over it move along with your life

shocked that after so many efforts by dozens of people ccp has still not done anything about thisif supercap logoff mechanics were broken and required fixing in the latest patch theres no reason the same shouldnt be said for selfdestruct 1

hardwiring implants have names that are not descriptive for examplezainou gnome kta10inherent implants noble zet330eifyr and co rogue ey1i propose to change their names using the following formatmanufacturer  effect generationtheir new names would bezainou  launcher cpu reduction mk 1inherent implants  hull hitpoints mk 4eifyr and co  afterburner duration mk 3the generation of an implant is determined as follows the weakest bonus is mk 1 the second weakest mk 2 and so on in this way we can immediately determine what an implant does and how strong it is without needing to check its description or attributes
this  just maybe the names need little more love than changing to effect name but current names just suckread and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
the mwd trick is imho pretty lame but i suspect ccp are letting it be because they cant fix it rather than because they dont want toas for general cloaking meh seems fine to me if you really need to kill stuff that badly litter the gatebubble with drones and hope you get lucky
this again reallycloaking is working as intended it is the most balanced mechanic in the game actuallywhile cloaked the pilot of a ship cannot do the following target engage utilize ewar get close to anything or risk being decloakedwhile afk the pilot of the ship cannot do the following anythingso what mechanic here is broken that needs to be addressed other than the fact that you may need to get psychatric help for your irrational fear of things that you cannot seei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
everyone uses a cloaking shiper whatit would be easier to list the ships that commonly use themcovert opsindustrials and other ships traveling not trying to get into fightswarp indicators or other ships that are background support shipsfitting them to any other ship gimps ganking and pve for lock times which are pretty important for the very fast and slow locking ships ever look to fittings for any commonly used pure fighting ship and notice the lack of them also the fact you have to use a highslot that could be used for a different utility or in the case of a perfect layout ship that has 8 weapon slots more guns also anything but covert ops cant warp and cloakcovert ups this does not apply they are also expensive tech 2 glass cannons tech 1 ships in the same weight class or higher class or tech 2 in the same that is pure fighter can beat them so if fighting them keep in mind that any ship fit with a cloak is gimped in either being a expensive glass canno covert ops or a different ship gimped in other ways
i dont think you understood what the op is qqing about my guess is hes more bothered by mwd tricking dominix pilots and the like than covert ops ships which is fair enough reallyalthough adding cloak jammers would really be too far cloaked t3s that can warp around swap subs and plex with impunity are somewhat annoying and i know where the op is coming from but without them lownull pve would be impossible outside of deep blue sov spacemaybe add cloak jammers but give cov ops cloaks immunity to them at least then the mwd trick would still work against most gatecamps and covert ops wouldnt be broken beyond repair
problem to the limited extent to which this pathetic excuse for a csm has achieved any tangible results they have represented their own selfish narrow interests to the detriment of the game they have no incentive to look out for the best interests of the game as csm v did or to act professionally as csm v did because their constituency is composed of a bunch of  neckbeardssolution 1 strengthen the eligibility requirements for the next csm election so that only active accounts that have been active for at least 6 months total are eligible to vote2 give each eligible account 1 vote that vote may be cast for or against any single candidate not bothany candidate with a negative vote total would not be eligible to serve on csm in any capacity that cycle
talking about theft and first person shooter mechanism in eve seems a bit premature your idea of thieving seems highly unfair though training a thieving skill and stealing peoples stuff like you do in skyrim simply doesnt work in eve the risk and potential of retaliation should be equal to the potential gain and to me your idea just sounds like a quick isk grab without risk you target a player thats offline and steal their assets without any chance of them fighting backthe idea of limited cargo is interesting though i know a lot of people hoard material to make a profit later on it would be interesting if stations had limited space and extra space had to be bought with iski mostly like the idea because its an isk sink and most of the time only the wealthy player have enough stuff to justify expanding the station cargo
i agree i know a few people who would go absolutely insane at the idea that anyone could steal their stuff perhaps though there is a way to balance the risk and potential for retaliation with the gain as you say oh and i wasnt thinking about this as turning into splinter cell i was imagining a minigame maybe similar to how they handled hacking in bioshock i dont really have a mental image in my head about what it looks like in the vault or how anything works beyond that pointis is totally broken or is there a way to make it fair and fun
no stealing in eve shouldnt be a mini game theres already other more appropriate ways of stealing from people you blow up their ship ninja salvage destroy their pos or scam them in some way those are appropriate ways of stealing in evestealing cargo and commandeering ships is the sort of things you can expect from dust 514 but it doesnt necessarily have a place in eve if there was a hacking minigame it should be kept to pve encounters
one perk came from incarna and development of1 better avatars able to repose them at moments noticei have had avatars from before the improvement that happened years before the incarna rerelease they were really bad compared to the new ones i spent 15 dollars for a one time change to avatar to the first improvement because the initial ones that were unchanging were that bad then incarna avatars came and for fweee at any time i could change it thats a big improvementthe big downfall was the lack of any player interaction during release and subsequent releases add to that the incarna part is really graphics intensive doing the single player game with a few rooms is overwhelming my cpu now add larger station environments multiple people yea no wonder it hit a rock wall even now months latter new expansion multiple races captain quarters are being released not the full or real incarnarelating to that axing went on with the clothing shop and world of darkness
i refuse to get excited about incarna until i can find the neutral market alt in my station kick open the door to his little apartment and shoot him directly in the faceccp if you make this happen i will buy all the mens precision boots you wanti honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
another thought to the world of darkness thing i think its good they stopped it but they can always try it again though i think the majority of the staff working on that are still around should refocus on the incarna game then after that is playable with multiple people then they can go expand on it same engine to the world of darkness thing maybe reusing the same backgrounds too i think cyberpunk citys and castles and landscape would all fit nicely inside of the mammoth sized stations lore and physics wise the stations are huge nearly deathstar scale being the size of 10 or 50 titans the space faring people including pod pilots are opulently wealthy to a scale unmatched by any king of a past era so they can recreate just about anything to a hearts content also reuse avatars and clothing human is human after all and vampires are basically altered humansgoing back to my experience navigating the single player game if the backgrounds are larger then one room really need lots of fast and very fast travel fast walking running airports have walkways and scooters going around elevators going multiple directions and railwaysanother thing to add sometime after a multiplier incarna not really super important as other things driving people to a social environment is a way to go to a personal assets warehouse and have other players be invited to go in too being able to see every item in the game with the scale of a person would be awesome not the most important thing but some down the road might need to have npcs on cranes moving the items around out of your hanger when you sell them and to access them for better viewing
ugh vampires are sooo 2010
 this  but id be going for the ladies boots
its way too early to talk about working on incarna again its development nearly destroyed eve dont expect to see any progress made on it in at least a year hopefully longer
have to agree with berendas  hopefully wis gets the same 18 months treatment they tried pulling with fis
1 it wasnt a good change though im glad ccp tweaked it to make it less bad
this item was once in the system but never implementedfor the miner who wants just a little moreccp chronotis commented on this item in april 2007link to chronotis reply
pity reply
well then i wont have to buy a nyx holding logoffski alt off the character bazaar thread on this forum all this change would really do is save me 5 bili honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
physically it looks like they can dock in stations but they should be 10 times the size of a regular carrier half the size of a titan hell i would think a carrier should be anywhere twice to 10 times its current size then scale the super even greatersuper caps are supercaps not everything needs to be able to dock in station but maybe a secure way of keeping in a pos should exist without the juggernaut of current pos corp roles and setting up personal ones
wield in what wayin game i think the alliance leaders who are also on csm will do better in general than those who are not on csm outside the game i think we saw people unsubscribing en mass that influenced ccpi think we saw csm often explain that they couldnt say much due to nda so players never really knew what was going onim not sure if you include my post in the collection of tinfoil but im sure even you could see that the nda was onerous this time around why not make it so the nda is the exception and not the rule that is make it so csm can discuss with the players they supposedly represent about what they discussed with ccp unless there is clear indication it is nda now it seems the other way around it seems you cant discuss anything with he players unless ccp says you can make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
tell that to vuk lau its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
ccp dictate ndas not the csm maybe you missed the blogs and posts where all the csms have said that they want to reduce the use of the ndabat  but theyre also unanimous that they need to be able to see information that really does need to be ndad in order to function
the one thing csm has been slacking on is ironically communication with the playerbase except for trebor and two step the csms rarely give input on discussions the forum especially ass hall which is supposed to be the official venue
good then csm seems to agree with me maybe that will be a topic of conversation to say ccp dictate ndas not the csm is irrelevant ccp dictates everything in game but this is a meeting between ccp and csm so csm could presumably discuss things that they want changed  liked the extremely overbearing nda cloud that looms over their communication with playersmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
we players have proven on more than one occasion that we dont behave well with foreknowledge of the eve universe in that light the use of the nda is more than acceptable very fine line between necessary information and encouraging insider trading
yeah this or introduce a max cap of total plex in an account say 10 per accountplex shouldnt be subject to massive market manipulation
botting is a seperate issue from rmt although many bots are run for rmt purposes many arentsupercapital construction and character sales are the two most obvious examples neither are botted both are well represented in the rmt market also high end deadspace mods from plexes are for sale
those are the crucial points couldnt have said it better
a complicated solution to implement to fix a perfectly fine game mechanic 1 to dont fix it if it aint broke
no dumb idea its already built into the game you just have to do it yourself
 this1 for combatting carebear laziness and consentual pvp attemptsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
no stop being a lazy anything worth doing is worth doing yourself andor right the first timewith that in mind set up your own ing arena and stop postingbut if you do decide to go to wow and biomass yourself on the way out make sure you give me your stuff i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
quoted for emphasis this is a sandbox mmo that means you can do this yourself if you want to break outside your self created restrictions
im going to swtor not wow my 4 lvl 80s got boring after a while why bio mass my self i have 3 months on my main and alt and 14 plexs but all i see my self doing for the next few months is skill training and posting i may do rvbsuicidegank or greif deck 
players can set up arenas and tournaments for no or high rewardsalso regulated by players in anyway they see fitif outside of corp do it in lowsec so concord does not intervenethe advantage and disadvantage of eve is that it is freeform game a player driven stimulation any game mechanic can be used to any end chaos is a star that points outward giving limitless freedom to orderone could set up a arena sounds like a cool idea have betting too
not possible under current game mechanics that does not allow it oh wait you know that already
currently wrecks all have the same amount of hit points and it is a very very small amount it makes no sense at all for a titan wreck or anything else massive to have the same tiny wreck that a frigate would have the ship is dead but the hull should not just vanish with one alpha shot from a frigate or a few warrior droneswhat i would like to propose for all wrecks is for them to have the same base stats as the ship without including any skillsso a taranis wreck would have 1858 ehp while a erebus wreck would have 2931086 ehp a vast difference and more realistic it would take on the same traits as an unpiloted ship with nothing fit on itsalvaging wrecks also seems unrealistic it seems fine if there is only one person salvaging a wreck but what about when say 50 people are trying to salvage a super carrier wreck from start to finish the entire wreck is salvaged in just a couple seconds and the entire salvage goes to one lucky guy that is ridiculous on several levels the larger the wreck the more salvage parts drop which is fine but the process to salvage a whole wreck should be relevant to the size of the wreck also all the salvage should not go to one lucky person like it was a lotterywhen a wreck is spawned the salvage parts are determined access difficulty is now changed to reduction in salvager cycle time one cycle from the salvager produces one unit of salvagesalvaging is now turned into an actual process of sifting through a wreck and pulling out the usable parts also the lottery feel is gone
first idea is bad  you just blew it up ie burned through all its structure hp so no there shouldnt be another thousand or million hp to burn though second idea  could be interesting
edited for correctionhow many eoss have you seen flying since the nerfbat hit the eosgiven that ccp are looking at the gallente balancing again i propose that they reconsider the unequaled nerf that the eos was subjected to some years ago bring the eos back to the battlefield
dear treboras you see in here there are more question marks than answers provided and they all circle around the center problem of informationcommunication to the community behind the status quo dust514 is supposed to be released this summer and it will be a first in the gaming world as two platforms interact together this is a major task going online with the next eve summer extension and might be underestimated by many even within ccp tecnically like content wisethe question of how those systems work together must be better explained and in detailfeatures should be introduced by devs on the forum to get sufficient feedback i will name here the example of occ orbital command center these occUFFFDs are supposed to be installed at planets as recently the pocoUFFFDs and serve as command center for merchUFFFDs ps3 but as i read there are attackable form players in space pc like pocoUFFFDs now how does that work together once d514 feature is in itUFFFDs final stage a dev blog should present this feature to gather additional player feedback i understand ccp donUFFFDt want to give the ahhhhhUFFFDwooow effect away but finding better and deeper informationUFFFDs abot the d514 development on a fan page rathere than on the official page is once again a short coming of public relations to a new type of interaction and first in the gaming industry by both the technical as the content aspect more transparency and a heighten effort to communicate with the player base dev blogs should be a priority question to the ccp management summer is just 67 month away to support the interested ps3 community to participate prior to the release of d514 there should be ways enabled presubscriptions which allows the ps3 community to access eve gate and this forum prior to the release of the game on their platform
at near light speed travel all the light in front of you would blue shift to gamma rays and you wouldnt be able to see it in fact it would fry youwhat needs fixing is trails from other ships you see warping in for some reason the graphical engine plots some swirly trails instead of straight ones matching the warpin trajectory im guessing its related to the same issue that makes ships warp in sideways ie not facing their direction of travel
also wtb economics clue
now with the destroyers buff there is no reason to do minors in anything other than thrashers although this request is not part of the op i do destroyers were not allowed in minors make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
once again let me ask why people are still clinging to the arbitrary restrictions on their fun
why do you cling on arbitrary entitlement of 5 while having fun or arbitrary zero loss when podded action and consequence wheres yourstrain without 5 problem solved what youre entitled to 5
why do you refuse to post with your main its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i wholeheartedly support this proposal it would be a hard decision if stats actually affected the game beyond skill training but they dont relegate the learning implants to the darkest pits of oblivion and add more boosting implants in their place yeah kids these days and their entitlement to play eve
risk vs reward is good but are attribute implants or attributes really necessary i would say anything that discourages activity should be removed encouraging more activity is a good thingthat way a person could train as fast regardless of implants so people might use some or none implantless body who cares ill train just as fasta person could use a 60 mil drake but what if they pvp in a much lighter ship due to lack of fundsgoing with that younger chars likely every skillpoint counts because they cant do as cool stuff otherwise be the pro with the tech 2 ship with the tech 2 fit for example me losing training time on my main doesnt mean as much being that i can do just about anything from fly a hulk to carrier and every racial bs and a slew of tech 2 ships if you reach a certain point as a established char you just try to think of long skills to train for obscure bonus that is not even necessary for yousame think with implants tens to hundred or so million is a portion of my wealth to the noob thats like everything anything encouraging more fights is a good thing more new people in the game people less hesitant in generalkeep clone costs still obviously maybe bump them up a bit to make up for people not spending isk on learning implants
i think the real damn problem is that it would take 375 years to train all skills to 5 which is ridiculously stupid skill training has been seriously flawed from the beginning it is horrendously slow and takes entirely too long eve isnt going to be around forever people or atleast not this incarnation of it it is almost nine years old i think at max training time of say 46 years is more in line with reality
no thanks its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
admittedly the removal of learning skills has made the implants nearly useless a full set of 4s has only knocked off 2 days off my current skill plan but the removal of both should by all reason be accompanied by faster training times say something close to what you would have gotten with all lss to 5 and a set of 5 implants to be fair
what
signed5 implants are much too expensive to be bothered with anyway
i like the ideait is a bit radical but it is simple simple things tend to work id like to apologize for the poor quality of the post above and sincerely hope you didnt waste your time reading it yes i do feel bad about it
i cant believe it a forumpost written by a member of goonswarm that i actually support not the member the content of the post and its actually something that everyone would benefit from whether they be new or old players
not supported but i would support eliminating the timer on samestation clone swaps
bampall amarrian drones have the same problems
i propose going a bit furtherem drones are made equal to explosive drones in everything except damage typekinetic drones are made equal to thermal drones in everything except damage typereasons beingwarrior iis dont need nerfing its the kinetic and em drones that need buffing kinetic drones currently have the intended dps but are underused as long as em and kinetic drones do inferior dps they will be underused
literally the first thing thats ever came out of your mouth i agree with
hi therei have posted this in the features and ideas discussion however no answer at all from a dev or someone that could explain if this would be possible or notin my mind this idea that i am going to propose would not be a hassle to maintain or get it to work since from what i know the shortcuts have been worked on before in the previous expansions and well hopefully scalable to other functionshowever if this would not be possible a short answer would be nice to hear or a long one if possible this is why i hope someone on the csm would like to have this feature heardlong story short make it possible to have a shortcut to tag objects and remove tags with a simple shortcut   or az and also a way to clear themthis would work so you have your own custom key that you can press and then select an object as you do today and then press a number or a alphabet key to tag that itemselect in overview or on screen  press shortcut  press z or 0 would then assign tag z or 0 on the selected object and also a shortcut if possible to clear a tagwould be perfect if you could assign it on a mouse button side buttons etcthe original post that i made

are you suggesting that the dscan be able to detect all ships at all ranges and just tell you that theyre too far away to get an exact distance i dont follow you here
no hes suggesting that offgrid items get sorted below ongrid ones when you sort your dscan by range descending
lay off the button the recalibrate message is usually a sign youve gotten too paranoid about spamming dscan
currently sd generates no record of the loss either for the pilot or the killerif you dont want to generate a mail for the killer then at the very least the pilot who self destructs should generate a personal api verified loss that shows his self as the player that landed the final blowwe dont care who gets the mail as long as some evidence of the pilots final minutes is generated
10
1 dumb ideaself destruct is a strategic option that denies loot denies intel on fittings pisses off killmail whores its hard to pull off since you need to judge the point of no return early enough to not die normally but late enough to have no chan
i disagree selfdestructing should be an option for denying the enemy information and loots it does require some skill to pull offabout all that i agree with in the op is denying the selfdestructor an insurance payout
information what the  are you on about theres no secret fittings on a super either standard fit maybe something pimp or fit which is only used by poor people either die with pride or be flamed for having fit and being stupid i dont care about the loot but the effort put into a supercapkill should atleast provide a killmail for the fc who managed to kill it
signeddont forget you shouldnt be able to sd any capital ships just because one tiny interceptor caught you on the gate and the enemy dont have enough dps
1 as well  ego is the source of pain
danthomir wrote denies intel on fittings because ship scanners are so hard to come by if i want to know what you fly a disposable alt in a frig with sebos and a scanner can get that intel in less than a second besides that id love to know just how much your lossmails say about you that you feel the need to protect that as intel ccp has said that killmails are a crucial part of the game enhancing them with implants on podmails whats more concord kills give killmails to the player if there is one that does the most damage i see no reason to do sd any differently
not really this is the current situation dreads in siege the fcs address book lights up with hostile supers all dreads initiate self destruct no actual threat to the dreads ever made it to system in time but about 35 of them exploded this actually happened yesterdaynyx tackled outside of a pos by 70 bs and some hics instantly initiated self destruct theres no way short of lagging a system out right now to generate a super killmail as they all simply start the self destruct timer the second they get tackled since they can no longer fend off tacklethere is no skill involved in anything i just described and there is also no record of the ships demise like i said we dont really need the mail but the loss should show at least on the pilot in questions combat record as a loss and api verifiable loss if its under fire at the time the api will record the damage its sustained in its final minutes from other players and or the loss of the ship in the case of the dreads that died they would simply show themselves on their own mail
i agree with no insurance but i disagree with the kill mail i prefer that people be allowed to give km lovers the birddestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
stoffer gets it wrong again no surpriseive lost rorqual and carrier killmails and ive never successfully avoided lossmails by selfdestructing the one time i tried in an orca i lost my pod for my troubles selfdestructs should not generate killmails scuttling a ship is a timehonored military tradition and eves version of it works just fine tyvmmags has it right no to insurance payout this isnt iceland after all where people routinely blow up their cars for the insurance payout but no killmail either
i am fairly new to eve  if it makes a difference to the devs or whatever this topic is the first i have read on the forums that has inspired me to actually participate i play this game with a small group of friends and thats how it will stay regardless of how impractical it may be in the game world  most of the game mechanics that punish the little guy make sense within the greater scope of eve and so although they might make my life difficult they also make sense and create the challenges inherent to eve that make it fun to playall that being said fix the fvcking bountiesthe fact that this idea in particular creates a profitable pursuit for small corps and gangs which the most ambitious and dedicated of your new players are going to be in should make it an easy sell on the flip every pirate dreams of being chased across the galaxy by bounty hunters thats like a thing which was obviously intended for eve but ended up being every grifters wet dream the system as it stands makes literally no sense i cant think of any other game mechanic that makes entirely no sense to me except this one the one that i would most like to make some sort of workable sense doesnt it makes more sense for me to just go gank not the sort of elegance i have come to like so much from this gameno new skills are needed and screw the insurance problems although of course they would pay the bounties and of course being a wanted criminal should affect your ability to get insurance the fact that it doesnt is also completely illogical but i digress this idea is ace whats the effing point of tier 3 hunterkillers like what we got with the expansion if there is no game mechanic that allows players to profit from going hunting whats the point of having criminals if you cant get paid to chase them wheres the bling i have to be a slimy scam artist to be legend in eve no epic criminals who escape capture for months years no good men with bad connections that can get the job done fail mani get miners or griefing miners or i go fight for the man in nullsec in some anonymous fleet wow epic or this basic spreadsheet payout scheme that makes the bounty office button in my station services into something that does something other than mock the reasons i started playing this game how about that for a reason to fix the effin bounties

i propose that a new type of bomb be created whose sole purpose is to destabilize wormholes the bombs would be fired just like existing bombs they would have no effect on anything that is not a wormhole they would either remove a fixed amount of mass from the wormholes max mass remove a variable amount of mass from the wormholes max mass reduce the wormholes mass by a percentage of its current mass allowance not the maximum halflife decaylike all bombs these would have enough volume to prohibit carrying too many 75m3 like all bombs they would be slow loading 135160 secs depending on the launcherto make them challenging to deploy the bombs could have a much smaller area of effect perhaps only 1k instead of 15k this would mean that you would have to be spot on with your accuracy or risk wasting the bomb to raise the bar on who can fire them these bombs could require a bomb launcher ii ie bomb deployment v a 4x skillto limit overproduction the bill of materials could be balanced in a way to make them cost prohibitive for generic circumstances blueprint originals may not be available or may exist in very low numbers other possible restrictions could be to confine their effectiveness only to the named side of the wormhole and say that it does nothing if fired at a k162 or perhaps there could be 2 different kinds of bombs one that only affects k162s and another that only affect named sides which means that you would have to stock both typesif implemented i recognize that this proposal would greatly change the dynamic of wspace i am dubious that this idea will get much traction at all but i thought that it would have the best chance if it was introduced along with a buffet of ways to restrain it i welcome your feedback
use an heavy interdictor if you want to close a wormhole you can basically press a button and gainlose a large amount of mass
or a battleship with a ton of armor platting stop the evemail spam
i would be for what was suggested in the above post the anticloaking device working on all cloaks other than ones with covops fitted meaning that the mwd cloak trick can be overcome in a sense leaving the ships that were designed to be cloaked alone
oh look its this thread againhowpathetically adorable
1cloaks shouldnt be able to permacamp anything fights are averted and it just infuriates the industrial players
sounds dumb enough for me to like it d 1edit you guys probably would like my proposal
not a great idea to be honest it may fix speed issues but creates incompatibilities when factoring in remote repping just get rid of speed penalties on armor tanking mods and then adjust ship speeds further as needed slow amarr ships if theyre too fast speed up gallente if theyre too slow
never not hull tank
haha as strange as it sounds i find this idea pretty amusing i have nothing against this proposal

i cant think of a way that an organised group of 20k players could possibly exploit a negative voting option
then they cant vote their own alliance candidate in which is worth it
math class timevoting for a candidate1 produces the same effect as negativevoting for his opponent  1so are you actually roleplaying an idiot
actually the ideas fixed the game do you play itgallente much

bitter sounds like it from your description of the constituency of the csm the pay their sub they play the game and they could be bothered to vote live with it please try and move past your prejudice against us null sec residentsthis csm has accomplished far more than previous csms who i might add were very hisec delegate heavy and are remembered mostly for the backstabbing and infighting good old fashioned eve values its true and not for any particular achievementno problem with that but please define active how does logging in once a week to update your pi compare to logging in almost every night to mission or pvpagain i have no real problem with this although i doubt it will have the effect you want as so few eve players actually bother with the voting process
damn double posts sorry
i think it wont matter what you do only some players want to be actively engaged in this process and with such a low subscription count for such a huge world you inevitably have a low amount of people being actively engaged in politics possible solutions  rewards for voting anyone who needs these rewards will most likely vote at random people who do not need rewards and are not interested will still not bother unless you can make a reasonable incentive to voting along with public thread based votes in which people must give a reason and limit corpalliance voting for their own members along with a way to nullify votes which are obviously only for a reward understandably another council would need to be set up to overview the voting procedure and nullify votes which are deemed invalid by a set of rules however this causes more complications such as that council favoring certain candidates or taking bribes not to nullify votes for certain people at any rate this is just another idea to add to the pile forced voting this would not work in my opinion people would just vote at random and it would create a breakdown of the political game as the people who actually care would not be taken seriously in addition to the idea of negative votes the ability to impeach or remove csm members by majority vote would be good i think in conjunction with the csm a judicial committee needs to be comprised of players to facilitate impeachment andor dissolutions of the csm
what are u whining about  have u actually played the game post crucible  csm6 is definately working as intended
clarification active just means an account thats been paid for either by subscription or plex or gtc to those who think it wouldnt make a difference lets try it then and find out i think youll be surprisedeve is supposed to be anyway a harsh but fair pvp sandbox gameits time to make csm elections a harsh but fair pvp sandbox gamelets move csm elections out of hisec and into nullsec where we can shoot back at the clowns running the circus no more docking games id like my vote to count and i have no idea who the next mynxee or teadaze is but i do know who the really awful members of csm are no more rigged elections with thousands of buddy program votesno more space politicians willing to alienate 90 of eve because they have 10 of eve in their pocketbtw the idea that this csm is responsible for ccps change of direction is laughable the summer of rage in conjunction with thousands unsubscribing did that theyre just trying to take credit for the movement they tried to diminish every chance they got

in other words you are eithera too obtuse to realize itb your supercap that you spent billions of isk on is no longer an i win buttonc a  bpersonally i am kinda voting for cbefore i respond to this i need proof thata you arent a  neckbeard yourself and arent just jealous that they got more popularity than you didb that what they did wasnt in the best interests of the gameso far all i can tell about you is that you must be someone who loves the nex store and prancing around in your quarters showing off your latest clothes while the mutlibillion isk supercap that you got through rmt sits in the background unable to mine asteroids any longerwhile i think you believe somehow that this would limit vote blocs it would not and it would likely alienate new players as wellso instead of voting for whom i want now you can censure my vote if you dont like it oh hell no i dont want some nex prancing supercap mining rmt using carebear having the ability to block my vote because they dont like it i know why im voting i dont know why you get to take it away
many of the militias have been crying out for more meaning in holding sov many rightfully feel that the whole war is nothing more than an arbitrary war dec everyone wants consequence to ownership so heres what i propose 1 switch faction ownership of stations in systems that are lost to enemy factions auga has for example a tribal liberation force station should the amarr invade and seize auga via plexing that station should be renamed 24th imperial crusade occupied logistics support or something along those lines the architecture of the station might or might not be flipped in accordance to ccps judgement on whether it would realistically be dismantled and replaced or simply occupied by enemy troops2 have enemy stations fire upon the opposing station much like gcc it currently makes no sense that i a soldier in the tribal liberation force can hang outside a station run by the 24th imperial crusade and while the capsuleers will fire away the station owners seemingly dont care this creates a safe zone for owners of a system and adds consequences to system loss docking  undocking games are really lame and this would quash station camps amongst the militias which noobs and vets alike hate and force the fighting back out into the plexes ccp designed for them that are now spawning round the clockall this requires is enabling a name change on stations and a gunson ai against enemy faction members two simple programming fixes much meaning and value to holding territory some militia advocates the banning of enemy docking at stations but this would unfairly punish the new players fw is designed to attract who would be deeply frustrated if they didnt personally have the ability to haul out and move their stuff safely if it were locked out of a station with station guns being the consequence they could still undock and warp away with a zmark if neededthought feedback support for this proposal i think this is a great bang for your buck fix that would have immediate ramifications and give militia members a reason to fight round the clock in defense of the systems they love
i support this changes and hans jagerblitzen faction warfare cause
thanks i appreciate it now admittedly my timing of this is a bit late as they are on the way to the summit but i wanted to throw it down here for the record if nothing else if feedback is positive maybe the next round of talks or the next csm can pick it up if it doesnt get brought up over the next few days i also dont know if the strict twoweek rule is still in effect regarding proposals i hope its still useful to the csm or ccp devs either way
i support these changes
hansi like it in general but in you dont explain what will happen to the agents 1 the agents for tribal liberation force stay in the station in auga even though it is now a 24th station or would 2they become inaccessible or 3 be replaced with agents for the 24thi think 2 or 3 would be a bit too harshperhaps we could have a system where the station guns will fire on the enemy if 1its your station and 2 you have sov if the enemy gains sov in that system the station guns will no longer fire but it will remain your station so the 24th station in huola would fire on minmatar if amarr keep sov however if minmatar gains sov there is no station gun firing also i have to say although i like the idea its very minorsuperficial and doesnt really address the substantive problems with fw plexing make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i agree with all of your proposals except for the docking rights faction warfare needs something that separates it from the rest of eve something that makes it unique but at the same time low sec specifically faction warfare should also incorporate the aspects of eve as a wholenow some people would say that not allowing people to dock in enemy stations is too much null sec but if docking rights shifted based on control of the system imagine the dynamic that would addlow sec staging grounds could be lost access to mission npcs could be lost guns in your own systems could turn against youthat to me seems like it would increase the need to plex offensively and defensivelyand since all militias have if they dont ccp needs to add them an fw station or two in high sec you can never completely lose access to missions you just have a lot less optionsbut since that would make only certain systems worth capturing add in a border check if you dont control an adjacent system you cant capture the current system if you lose control of all adjacent systems timers in the cut off system are halvedcongratulations you have just made an active battlefield with fronts strategic approaches placed hardships on your enemies by denying them their systems and pushed a majority of fighting into plexesgate guns however should never get involved in militia fights that would give defenders an unfair advantage gate camping is almost as bad as station campingfaction warfare becomes unique pvporiented missiondriven and yet is still something the casual and hardcore alike can participate in and all you need is a t1 frigate to get startedcouple that with my proposed changes to fw missioning and youve overhauled the entire system and made it something truly specialehedit and make sure to give a twoweek notice minimum before implementing the no docking in enemy stations rule it gives people time to move their stuff otherwise theyll have to invade or drop militia for a few days to get their trapped ships out edit 2 this would probably require a new militiaspecific channel for enemy activity alerts notification of systems when someone triggers a plex button something that people could close if they wanted to was a permanent channel so they could get back into it and probably shouldnt be allowed to talk in because it would get too spammy and people wouldnt notice alerts
this to me would be an acceptable solution to the agent issue that rightfully needs to be addressed admittedly that was an oversight i should have considered in my initial proposal ccp may have an even more elegant solution but in general station guns seem like an easytoimplement and yet impactful change that could push a lot of fighting out into the field where it belongsand yes this is absolutely a superficial change but at this point ccp seems to be pursuing the fixes and updates in order of hours needed to complete them meaning the easy stuff like this gets hit first and more sweeping overhauls get postponed till they can receive further attention because of that prioritization im trying to make sure as much of the lowhanging fruit is elevated to the csm level as quickly as possible because i really believe that even a handful of small updates like this will mean a lot to the players and keep them around and fighting and most importantly for ccps sake continuing their subscriptions
take back faction warfaresigned
i agree fw should be unique and separate from other forms of gameplay in eve and thats precisely why such heavy handed solutions like no docking at enemy stations should be avoided in my opinion this is coming purely from my experience with corpmates that despite all my warnings have sold everything rebought a personal fleet of ships out in nullsec and lost sovereignty only to limp home penniless without even a rifter to fly losing access to all of your stuffs is a major morale killer and one i fear new players wont be able to handle despite the fact that the militias are currently comprised of high skill point pvp enthusiasts faction warfare traditionally served and should continue to serve the newer players as well frankly id much rather my recruits and friends focus on learning to fight not learning to manage multiple hangars spread out to avoid a lockdown newer players focus on industry or pvp but not both so those delving into fw at a young age likely lack the transport needed to move groups of ships around and will fit and store ships one at a time most likely even now we face multiple front lines that are a half dozen systems apart so even existing militia vets can find themselves without the right ship close enough by to make it when a mate hollers for help i have concentrations of ships in at least 3 systems in lowsec and still shuffle them around to fit the varying activity in different systems adding a greater shuffle on top of this would even further cut into my pvp time which is precious to me i personally feel that faction warfare should be battlefocused with a minimal emphasis placed on the logistical support that becomes crucial to living out in nullsec or wormhole spaced i want mechanics that encourage more time fighting not more time resupplying removing docking rights and locking players out from their hardearned gear would indeed add consequence to the warzone but im afraid it would simply eat into time that could be spent out engaging in the almighty pew insteadthis is just my personal take though im certainly open to the consensus of the community should the majority disagree
ack another double post ccp lets get these errors taken care of forums kinda suck still
good idea should be fairly easy to implementside note related docking rights should never be removed in npc stations but what of changing what can be done once inside  increase service fees or even prohibit use of services entirely in enemy occupied space alternative option is to add a 34x multiplier to redock timer in hostile space  not sure if it is separate from aggression timer though and gate jumping should not be hindered so might not be possible off hand oh please he only started championing fw recently while some us have been at it since the war was just a few months old  just sayin
i can only advocate for and organize feedback for the gameplay that i know and ive been a militia pilot since i started playing the game 2 years ago i completely respect the fact that there are others that have been fighting long before me and yes my real push for change has come in the last 6 months especially i wouldnt have bothered before that being a new enough player to not feel like i had an informed enough opinion to make a differencethe recent change in direction for ccp and the increased focus on flying in space improvements gives me hope that a window has finally opened up for us to make a serious bid to improve faction warfare and i have no problem being a vocal repetitive outspoken supporter for the community and the game play feature that i love regardless of my character age ive seen a lot of scattered posts throughout the forums over the last couple of years that never gained much traction so im trying to capitalize on ccps recent willingness to be more receptive to player feedback and organize the feedback into something more digestible and manageable so we can finally see some real change i really believe the plexing timer fix is just the tip of the iceberg should we keep this up i cant do it alone though im only one man i need everyones expert advice and hirana yours is greatly appreciated
keep in mind that plexing as it currently works is pretty much a pve grind so imo it is a good we are not required to plex at this point also keep in mind there are very few roleplayers in fw so if one side is winning and therefore gets large advantages pilots will just join that side there are a few stations in high sec but very few typically people do missions by gathering allot of them and then running them after they travel i think completely shutting these down would be an advantage that would indeed make people choose to join the winning side if they combined your idea with some mechanics that made it harder to capture more and more enemy systems eg the losing side was allowed to bring larger ships into smaller plexes i think we could have more dire consequences but until then i think consequences that are clear but not huge are in order hans proposal is really trying to walk that fine line of making things have some impact but not so much that every new player will just join the winning side this is something that would truly improve fw plexing it has been proposed for years however there used to be allot of carebears like ank who did fw and they liked to run the plexes without any pvp so the idea didnt get too far i think the latest proposal that incorporates this idea is in my signature give it a like if you like itmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
not to sound petty hans but did you overlook the part where docking rights was tied to sovereignty you dont lose access completely only until you can retake the system or leave fw temporarily if you cant wait to get your ships backplus it would stimulate the faction economy by making militia lps more valuable and it gives capturing and defending plexes a purpose people would come out in droves to repel invaders if the caldari were taking plexes in heydalso if plex timers were dynamically linked to the number of people with a limit it would make smallgang warfare more common or more the point imagine if a plex took 60 minutes to capture solo 30 minutes if you had 3 people 15 minutes if you had 6 within range of the button those numbers are purely arbitrary but what they accomplish is not now one person has less of a chance to flip a system in a day and having 60 people in one plex gives no more benefit than 6faction warfare is teeming with possibilities that i dont even think ccp has even begun to scratch the surfacethis is their opportunity to create a whole new type of pvp in the game that already has the greatest pvp of any mmoi really wish they would grasp that fact and run with it
if this change were combined with my proposed change to fw missions it would be of limited to little benefit for people to switch sides also some people love an underdog challenge good fight being outnumbered etc so you might have people switch to the losing side as wellwhich is why we need ccp to give plexing a meaningful purpose so that it is just as important to capture plexes as it is to defend them when it has no purpose and no value it will be done by only those that want to no one felt the need to plex so it became a pve grindmake them strategic objectives that impact the map in some way and every member of faction warfare will have a vested interest in participating change the missions too and even the stealthbombing carebears will have to join in or lose some incomeeve isnt supposed to be easy and signing up to be at war with half of the factions in the universe damn sure should be harder than normal eve
by making it so every pilot counts we can spread out the blobs if you capture plexes faster by blobbing up then this will be just like null sec if pilots are better used by spreading them out then blobbing wont work its clear you understand this when you say 60 piolots gives no more benefit than 6 however when you have 3 pilots able to capture plexes faster than one pilot then you will find that the larger side will just win the side with fewer active pilots will not be able to spread out and capture plexes because their solo pilots and smaller fleets will take too long to capture plexes the larger side will always have time to come with their numbers i couldnt agree more fw should be the place for frequent quality small scale pvp ccp should focus on making that so make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
thanks hwong but no i wasnt overlooking the part about docking rights and sovereignty i understand everyones stuff would be intact until they regained system control im just remembering back my early days where it was simplest to manage by having a stack of ships in a common friendly militia home base for us it was auga 3rd that also had some market function making it easy to be prepared for a fight at all times if i had suddenly been locked out of all my ships and i was still in the stages of learning how to make a decent isk income to replace them all i would have been deeply frustrated by not being able to access my hardearned shipseven if i knew i could get them back eventually not having any ships to use in the meantime which id need to help my friends regain sov would have killed my interest in staying in faction warfare i would have left and not returned until i could afford to spread dozens of ships in every system as a precaution having pilots leave and rejoin faction warfare constantly just to move ships seems like a waste of time and breaks immersion everyone values their employment history i dont see any advantage in encouraging corphopping simply to move shipsone of my deep appreciations for low sec pvp life is that my stuff is secure i know that if ive earned it i can pvp in it when i log on that security is one of the primary reasons ive refrained from joining a null sec alliance where if i have a busy month with outofgame activities i might log on to have lost it all having your items always accessible even if youre being shot at on the way out the door continues to be a huge draw for those of us who want casual pvp id hate to see this go away i just think there are other options limiting station functions when docked is great that dont disrupt a key advantage to living in low sec for the sake of adding an adrenaline boost when youre defending sovereignty
i have no idea what thread to post this in but i just had another idea purely cosmetic but for plexes note this should not be added in until plexing is changed to be a pvprelated objectivemedals awardsspecifically the followingconqueror capturing plexesconquering an enemy systemliberator capturing plexesliberating a friendly systemassault destroying x ships in offensive plexesdefender destroying x ships in defensive plexeswho doesnt love more bragging rights and chest beatingedit and hans it makes absolutely no sense to me why a state protectorate station would allow gallente or minmatar to dock that specifically is the problem i have with low sec docking rightsi  hate the fact that more than a few gallente pilots have carriers docked in caldari fw stations
yes there is some truth here some will change sides but even when fw was pretty much meaningless and not hitting us in the wallet the caldari had many many more pilots than the gallente when they were rolling through systems in eve more people tend to choose the path that gives them more iski am not sure your proposal would do much yes it limits the fw lp to those who do pvp which is good but you wont be able to make as much isk if you are on the losing side even if you do as much pvp as anyone on the winning side because you will not be able to collect as many missions per mission runagain i think you are right in part however plexing is mainly a pve grind because there are allot of npcs in the plexs this is why i dont bother doing plexes for the amarr if they increase the consequences of plexing i still wont do them because i want to pvpif i do not fit my ship for pve the rats will eat through my tank then when an enemy or neutral comes to pvp i will either have to fight them with half my tank and npcs still hittting me or i will have to warp off if they dont want it to be pve then they should stop making it pve remove the npcs and give players notifications of plexes being entered if they want to defend them then they know where to go if they dont then they will lose it either way it will be pure pvp leaving plexes up to the npcs is why fw plexing is and always has been mainly pvemake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
just a reminder everyone the assembly hall is designed for obtaining support for specific proposals while your feedback is greatly appreciated lets keep this thread focused on the original proposal and any general discussion about faction warfare to the main faction warfare discussion thread or feel free to post your proposals for separate ideas in their own threadsthanks guys the more we stay organized in our response the easier it is for the devs and csm to sort through and digest
i absolutely agree with you it doesnt make sense that we would be allowed to dock at all but there is lot of realistically that would never happen arguments that have to be tempered in order to create manageable game play in a reasonable amount of time again im not at all shutting down your idea of denying docking rights youre not the only one who feels strongly about this im just explaining my own personal convictions regarding docking restrictions
i dont like the change on the broadcast history on fleet ui  it take too much spacebefore it was liketravel to xxxnow it is zzz request that the fleet travel to xxxtake so much space for no useits true telling us directly who sent the order is good however we dont need nice sentences at all  the more words to read the less easy it is to get the order quickly and i have to rescale my fleet pannel cause this change take too much space on the x axis and i dont have space here most of the time with the modules pannel i was forced to change the entire ui to 90 to have enough place thats ridiculousso please do something like that at the place at zzz request that the fleet travel to xxx just write zzz  travel to xxxits simple clear and take no place the only thing we need that we did not before is the name of the guy no need for a  well written sentenceyou imagine a marine giving a well said sentence to his guys on the battelfield  seriously hell if you want to have a nice sentence at least put nice colors on the key words
kabump so ccp will find this and take my proposal into consideration
your gonna need to buy the guys over at ccp a couple more rounds before they take you seriously

i do kind of agree that training skills to increase the size of your corp is rather silly the rest of the post is bunk thoughpersonally i think training skills to increase your corp size is silly because anybody can be a leader the guy that flunked out of high school can be just as good of or better a leader than the college graduate this does not however mean that i think it should change the current mechanic is sillybut finethey are almost on the level of the old learning skills actually but not quite as dumb as learning how to learn
the reason for this is to prevent n00bs from starting corps without even knowing game mechanics by forcing them to train it will force them to learn game mechanics before they come on the forums with tears of why is my corp no good ect ect
no a well thought out idea though but criminal scum already have enough things to grief with and brag about if they want to steal millions or billions of isk worth of item or ships they can do it the hard way
i dislike the idea of theft but building on your idea of cargo allowance in stations you could open a new medium for traders for example if all players receive a certain amount of cargo allowance which can be increaseddecreased with standings skills etc at each station you have to balance whether its worth keeping all your items allowing players to buy excess cargo allowance will serve as an isk sink and allow for players to trade these cargo allowances will create a new market obviously cargo allowance has to be capped somewhere and a realistic price point will be extremely hard to determine as ships require tremendous amounts of room but do not necessarily sell on par with most items m3 wise and as such could damage the ship buildingtrading market
the only way i would support this is if i can leave my hanger and vaults open to vacuum at all times and there was an automated clean up service to deal with the mess left after an attempt at theft
well maybe but still it would be good to have some walking in stations what if incarna was released and it was a success its kind of like something else you want it to be strong and big and then its small limp and flaccid with all the effort that went it you just cant throw it all away without the wod stealing development eve can get incarna and it will not be limp
incarna was released and it was a dismal failure the release didnt contain half as much content as wis was built up to have over the years it was being developed all the effort that went into it worked against eve by letting it decay
bump for keep developing incarna but stop worrying so much about graphics
wtf is lox and deo2poses use liquid ozone and heavy waterozone is liquified ozone which is o3 and heavy water is 2h2owhere the hell do you get lox and deo2 its no wonder you cant make a profit running a pos you have no  clue what to fuel it with currentlyif you are fueling it with lox liquid oxygen and deo2 which doesnt exist you are an idiot

i believe eve needs a judiciary committee hereafter refereed to as the committee to help facilitate certain issuesissues the committee can addresspiracyscammerscsm dissatisfactionhowpiracy at the moment is quite rampant throughout eve not that this is a bad thing but there are few if any serious antipiracy corporations none that i know of the committee could act as a middleman for corporatealliance wars especially between antipiracy and piracy corps the committee should be given a budget with which to place bounties on large scale piracy and nullwormhole sec corporations which subvert the empires by placing a bounty on a corporation antipiracy corps can have defined targets with bounty being awarded based on the pirate players corporate rank scammers are also a dime a dozen i believe the committee should be allowed to punish serious scammers or corporate espionage either through bounty as mentioned before or by flagging players as wanted im uneasy as to whether being flagged would allow any pilot to attack them without security loss only antipirate corporations or just as a flag for people who want to get even if you see them in lownullsec csm dissatisfaction and vote rigging and now to the main port of call for what i initially thought of the committee for the committee should be able to impeach and dissolve csms if player dissatisfaction becomes exceptionally high they should also oversee the voting process and be able to nullify votes such as an alt voting for the main all of a corporation voting for their members because they are forced or rewarded in some way this would need to have a strict set of rules laid out with which the committee can engage within however all things must eventually become decisions of the players in my opinion a pass vote in the committee to impeach a certain member of the csm should not necessarily immediately impeach the csm member rather open the vote to the whole community to remove them again the vote process would be overseen by the committee to stop corporate and alliance voting within this would force csm candidates to stick by their mandatesanyway this is just an idea ive had and would welcome suggestions and feedbackand yes i am a new player however for everyone out there who keeps saying we need new player retention this means we need new player involvement so im taking the first step to moving into a political career within evethankyou for your time
cannot support in any shape or formthis would be open to massive abuse by the members of your committee the majority of this proposal seems to be aimed at closing off playing options that you dont like i dont need a committee to help me deal with pirates i shoot them if others dont have the guts for that then its their problemscammers prey upon the inexperienced stupid and greedy so while i dont like that except i do like to see the greedy gouged it is a valid way to play the game a way that they pay their subs to play as to your proposal that this committee would monitor the csm i find that pointless the csm has no power beyond that which is given to it by ccp and the players that support it treating it like an organ of government rather than what it is an advisory body seems excessive to say the least
i would also hope that this idea would give the csm more legitimacy and therefore more power
only if said committee can get people like the op bannedpermanently stop the evemail spam
thanks for the constructive criticism there no wonder you have no new player retention
its very constructiveyou want a committee then i want the ability to have you banned permanently for any reason i chooseif you cant figure out why you have no business posting herethink about itwhy would i make a requirement like that stop the evemail spam
the problem is that new players who dont really understand how eve works post stupid ideas and then get upset when older and more experienced players tell them that its a stupid idea if you dont want to get called out on stupid ideas dont post them there are two ways to deal with the situation1 toughen up if you post stupid ideas they will get torn down and laughed at end of story either accept that fact or ragequit2 wait learn how eve works and what is and isnt an intelligent idea and then dont post stupid ideaseve is not about people holding each others hands and being nice because youre a noob eve has a system of consequences and rewards if you do something stupid you will pay for it if thats not your cup of tea there are plenty of other mmos out there that are much more willing to cater to peoples feelings youre more than welcome to play eve but dont complain because a stupid idea of yours got torn down cest la vie
i understand that not all ideas are great in fact most of them arent but theres no point shutting down all new ideas simply because they dont fit with what you define eve to be eve is unique in the mmo world in that it is constantly evolving from player interaction by simply dismissing all new ideas which dont fit your eve you marginalize this player interaction with the game so dont just its a bad idea because it is rather say its a bad idea because it could be abused we dont need further checks and balances in the csm theyre figurehead anyway etc by simply saying youre new so your idea is bad you give new players no reason to keep tryingand regarding to the third paragraph how does this idea not fit in line with that by being a pirate corporation you engage in the risk of retaliation from a judicial branch the reward however is that you can gain notoriety bounty for all members to increase pvp activity and a more realistic empire response
i had thought this thing about the csm rigged voting was put to bedits like this do you complain when a politician wins every time becuase hes from a very large city and that city always votes for him yes this doesnt always happen but the point is people are going to vote for who they know if the rest of eve doesnt vote at all thats not anyones problem but theirs the csm represents the voting and thus politically active playerbase not the whole playerbase it was never meant to because in order to do so they would have to make it so that you could not log in without voting for someone and even then people would just vote randomly most of the timeand in terms of antipiracy corps they do exist there are quite a few out there they just dont form alliances because then pirates can see them coming they all communicate with each other doncha knowive been on quite a few antipirate roams and weve actually had a lot of trouble keeping the bait and scouts mixed up so the pirates dont get wise ive seen times when weve held the fleet 2 jumps out jumped a single drake into a gate camp and the pirates all warped off before he even loaded gridthirdly griefing is not a problem in this game its legitimate game mechanics at work and there are multiple ways around it dont want to be wardeced stay in an npc corp dont want to be scammed dont read local dont want to be suicide ganked dont fly where they do its actually quite simple eve is about risk vs reward and a lot of people keep forgetting that
i understand your point about the largest city idea but its not a very representative democracy on to the third point your solution for new players who get abused involves no risk no reward and no socializing that sounds like the most boring mmo i have ever heard of

thankyou for the feedback everyone and to clarify i dont think the committee should be able to just interfere with any pirate or scammer only huge scale corporations who actively pursue such nefarious means to hurt the player base ive been killed in pvp before lost the most expensive ship i owned and i couldnt afford to replace it at this point i was tempted to quit eve but youve gotta keep on fighting so while i understand this is how you guys have played the game for the past eight years i think the addition of an idea like this would increase legitimate and newplayer pvp options by allowing serious antipirate corporations to be formed if being able to interfere with scammers is something you all dont agree with thats easily fixed just remove the paragraphthanks everyone

i have been thinking about this and i think the whole docking thing comes down to what ccps original intent was with not letting them dock upi think the original idea was to have supers and titans be this corp  alliance asset that no one person would be able to dock up for themselves and would sit in a pos someplace when it wasnt in use then their enemies could come by and siege the pos and get at the phat lootz insidebut nowadays people just hide their supers using an alt you get the super for your main and then train up or buy a super holder alt that can go in one of the 3 character slots on your cyno alt account it has carrier 3 trained and nothing else all they can do in the universe is climb into your super and logofskinow you can fly around on your main doing whatever you want while your super holder alt who is still firmly under your control is offline keeping the super safe then when you want to rock and roll you go to the safe spot you put your alt in log it in and switch shipsactually i think the super is safer logged off in space than it would be docked in a station ive lost ships because of getting booted from an alliance while on vacation and i cant dock up and get them also i think i have been too lazy once or twice to pull a hurricane out of a station that we lost in sov warfarei think there are two solutions to this depending on how safe you want supers and titans to be1 just say that supers and titans cant wink out of existence when you log off that way youll have to park them at a posor2 let them dock upright now the super holder alt convention is more of an inconvenience than a game changeri honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
said the tin supplier and foil makerexplain why the csm is better than all of the other methods for systematically gathering stakeholder input why is it better to filter everything through a small group of people who are selfadmittedly acting in their own best interest is the purpose of the csm to provide feedback on the game if so who is gathering the input from the groups not represented by the current csm members since the majority of players dont even vote can it even be said that the csm is truly a representative body in the traditional sense if were going to pretend that its a democratic process the process itself must first be decided on by the body politic which is something that never occurred if low participation is a sign that the majority of players feel the csm is a sham then why do we still have a csm the vote would seem to already be in and counted why not formalize it lets have a vote to decide whether there should even be a csm or a vote to decide between a variety of methods to accomplish the same goals finally adjusts tinfoil hat what checks and balances prevent any csm member from from acting on nda information through indirect means a smart observant player with resources and an advanced understanding of the interrelationships of game mechanics could easily get his group to act in such a way that no one could ever say he violated the nda yet they would still benefit from it eg it is confidentially revealed moons will be reseeded throughout eve so an alliance leader opts to not defend the space he currently controls and instead prepare to move to whatever new locations are eventually revealed theres no way to prove he stopped defending it based on that information im not saying its happened for sure but the metagame extends into the csm process so it seems safe to assume that it does intelligent belligerents use every tool they can
disband the csm and with the money you save hire back 1 of the crying dudes that got fired maybe have a blubbering competition where whoever produces the most actual tears in 10 minutes winsseriously this csm has been horrible and proven that the csm election mechanic is so broken that ccp would somehow incorporate it into new eden if it could only figure out howfailing that support my proposal and lets at least have the opportunity to vote the worst of this bunch out
this isnt necessarilly better and i dont think ccp intends it to be the only way to get input i would say ccp have been very good about getting information from the forums about what players want in fact i would bet there have been 5xs as many posts directly from devs as there have been posts from our csm representatives on the forums most people at ccp are smart enough to know that the csm is not representative representative of the playerbase at large make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
lets hear them say say that then that would be a good first step
they pretty much have dont get me wrong the csm is helpful to ccp but its pretty clear that many people just voted for whoever their alliance leaders told them to vote for there was no real close consideration of why they play eve and whether their alliance leaders ideas will make them play eve longer make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
you trolling broif they pretty much have then why the  am i posting in the council of stellar management section of forumswhy am i not posting in the player feedback and suggestions section of forumsshow me where hilmar has said yes were aware that having a goon spy lead developer soundwave a former goon leader security chief darius johnson and a goon spyleader csm chair alex has a huge potential for favoritism and otherwise unacceptable behaviorshow me where hilmar has said yes were aware that csm v represented all of eve and we ignored them so the best of them quit were also aware that csm vi mostly behaves like a bunch of juvenile delinquents and most of their ideas are selfservingcsm vi is like me without the foresight ethics eloquence or intellect perhaps thats why they get on so well with ccp
this is a pretty simple one but one that im sure annoys the  out of many peoplesay you have two equal stacks of trit in your cargohold that fill it to capacity you right click in the cargo window hit stack all and the trit gets magically stacked into one neat pile easynow try to do this in almost any other location pos corp hangar capship corp hangar fuel bay drone bay etc if there isnt enough free space left in the hangar to fit one of the stacks you get an error message saying that there isnt enough space to move this item you have to pull one stack out of the container entirely and then drop it on the other stack whyfix plz
agreedirritating bug and not controversial to fix
plex is fine let the socialists rule earth not eve nobody is forcing you to play the game for free step up and pay for the game if you canUFFFDt afford the isk to purchase a plex
i agree that plex should be account locked after one sale but instead of being able to only activate it for yourself you should also be able to activate it on another person aswell i understand this creates another option for scamming by players selling plex activations but i doubt anyone would fall for this especially considering what a plex is worth this reduces plex liquidity as any plex introduced to the market will only ever be there once this means players will be forced to decide whether to buy them as they need them or stockpile them from the get go creating a jump in the market
any change to plex and i just wont buy them anymore hope that is clear enough ccp and csm
but other people still will and ccp would like to remove the number of plex that are being traded aur didnt really do a good job im guessing if plex can seriously compete with isk buying then youre ensuring the profits go to the company who does all the good work rather than to bot groups to accomplish this either botting must be completely removed or plex must become more valuable than a bots time
seriously you guys want to fix an imanginary problem over 150 million isk plex had been until recenlty hovering around 350 mil for over a year plex is working as intended there for leave it alone market manipulation is a part of eve welcome to a differnt kind of pvp that dooesnt require shooting space lazors
there is plenty of items to play market pvp with plex is the only one which should remain clear from that for the reasons ive already mentioned in my previous posts
id like a straight answer from ccp just how much theyve meddled in the plex market and in what directionhave they printed trillions of isk and bought up plex with it or notall ccp meddling in the ingame economy needs to be fully disclosed
not needed
wait a sec ill forward this proposal to the department of redundancy department
not supported
no i always have my clone one step ahead of what i need
sounds like wows resurrection sickness1
stealth  i lost sps and its not fair thread detectednot supporting stop the evemail spam
i have never lost sp due to inadequate clones on any characters i just think this is a bad and unnecessary game mechanic and dont understand the fascination people have with it
they all say thatand if youve never had a problem with itthen you have no reason to post such a ridiculous ideahypocritical if you ask me stop the evemail spam
you dont have as much insight into other peoples minds as you think you do
they also say that as welljust do a history search on every request to nerf the clone sp penalty threadprove me wrong hot shotsince you claim to be such an expert on the subject stop the evemail spam
im not interested
they also say thatwhat we got here is the 1000000th time someone has posted this idea and didnt bother to do their homeworkmove along folksmove alongnothing to see here stop the evemail spam
this a thousand timeseve isnt about honor points its about shooting rocks building stuff then shooting players alternatively rats if you dont have the stomach for it like me
i like both ideas while yes velicita you did just burn through their armor and structure hp the wreck isnt a single entity its a lot of smaller pieces of a ship take a car for example if a truck hits you then your cars completely wrecked but its not like going up to it with a hammer and hitting it will do any more damage realistically there is still salvageable parts if you do the second one is a bit less realistic considering mining lasers can pull in hundreds of m3 per cycle unless you also want to significantly reduce the salvage cycle time a single piece of salvage per cycle is not a good way to go about it either in my opinion but removing the single winner outcome from salvage is a good idea
1 i think 10 to 20 of the unmodified hulls hitpoints would be better it has after all had holes punched in it and been blown to hell2 like this makes salvaging a proper job
the perfect route design in this game is jita to hekrens hek for brevity from here on out its the route that most exemplifies a riskreward design philosophy yet its only one of two hub to hub routes in eve online that offers reward for risk as a travel optionthis is a shametravel between every pair of trade hubs should offer two distinct routes with one route rewarding risk the reward for that risk would be timetake jita to hek the highsec safe reasonably riskfree route is 19 jumps the riskier much shorter route through lowsec is 9 jumps this is why rancer is such a popular spot for pirates there should be popular locations for pirating these locations should be along shorter hub to hub routes i argue that there should be more of themanother route that is perfectly designed is amarr to rens it is 20 highsec jumps 11 jumps via lowsec again risk versus reward design the reason why amamake is a popular pirate destinationshorter routes arent going to get freighter pilots and carebears into lowsec that is not the argument i am making here those people are still going to take the longer routes thats fine and okay but there are a subset of people who will take the shorter routes when they are available they dont mind the risk of facing pirates if simply to save some travel time im arguing for the pirates that they need more opportunity and more locations in which to ply their trade there need to be a few more rancers and amamakes on the starmapim making the argument for them but i am not a pirate im a freighter pilot im also an impatient son of a  as a freighter pilot longer routes would be a detriment to the hauling that i do but im also damned impatient and dislike long travel times if i can avoid them when im in the appropriate ship frigate covops blockade runner i do take the rancer pipe frequently when travelling between jita and hek ive been killed in rancer it still does not deter mefor other hub to hub travel there needs to be an adjustment in the routes for instance jita to amarr needs more highsec systems between the two hubs currently it is a 9 jump highsec route but it should be a 1619 jump route it then needs a 79 jump route that passes through some lowsec the same goes for jita to dodixie currently a 15 jump highsec route versus a 12 jump route that passes through lowsec the differential needs to be greater dodixie to hek is 9 highsec jumps it needs a lowsec route that is 4 jumps dodixie to amarr is 16 highsec 14 lowsec that lowsec route needs to be decreased to about 8 jumpsthink of the pirates man from hub to hub travel think of the pirates
this is a reasonable idea however i think the reward may not outweigh the risk unless you decrease the lowsec jump amount further or increase the highsec jump amount it would involve a lot of gate changing on ccps part but it is without doubt something that should be looked intoedit also an option for high sec only and low sec included routes should be there when you click set destination if it isnt already
i want the time for plex option to be restored on the eve account management website idk why this was disabled but it sucks plex are how i run my 3 accounts and funds go short pretty often so its usually every other 2 months that i have to let 2 of my accounts run out before i can afford to reactivate them and i have made good use of this feature cause it made my life so much easierso ccp please bring this feature back dont introduce convenience of this magnitude and then take it away 6 months after without telling us any reason plz ccpplayers like if you agree and if you dont please list your reason why thank you
this is hours for plex i believe youre talking about theyve temporarily disabled it because of the current gift items that theyre making available to people they dont want people to reactivate accounts they dont intend to plex just to get the gift trade it to a different account and then expire again at least thats their logicof course there are plenty of ways to fix this if they bothered we too havent been able to bring dead accounts back to life after the expansion because of this theyre really hurting their subscription base by making it hard to come back the current working solution is that you have to file a petition andor send an email from the email address registered to the account requesting it be temp reactivated and then pray that youre at your computer for the 4hrs they reactivate it in
rumour has it that hours for plex was disabled for the duration of the core augmentation offer to prevent people farming this implant i would expect it to be back once the ca2 redemption period has expired but that hasnt started yet so dont hold your breathi wont like you just because you posted a poll if you want to farm likes please post in the like and get likes thread
that worthless piece of 3 is worth the hassle
eos is a pretty good close range pvp brawler good dps tank and drone utility space its bandwidth makes it a very poor pve choice thoughit could do with some tweaks just give it the 225m3 drone bay and another bonus instead say drone speed and tracking it could get overpowered for its role if you give it full drone bandwidth and might make the ishtar redundant if you give it the damagehitpoint bonusby the way it has 75mbit bandwidth at the moment and there is no frigate that can control five medium dronesmain problem is that information warfare is rubbish
ah a very interesting idea here this would be a good fit to tie in with faction warfare plex revamping since that is the principle they operate under  control fleet composition and you give a chance for smaller ships to become much more significant
many UFFFDfix lowsecUFFFD proposals revolve around how to encourage more carebears into lowsec i believe thats a mistake the strong point of lowsec is the small gang casual pvp and we need more pvpers to realize its potentiallowsec has many good points to attract the more casual pvper its very accessible the combination of no bubbles and sentry guns discouraging small sps on gates make it easy to move around lowsec with so many stations its easy to take a break pretty much anywherehowever if you pvp for any amount of time in lowsec youll get cut out of ghsec for the dedicated outlaw thats not a problem alts and corplevel logistics make it a nonissue but it closes most of lowsec from the more casual single account player the one who would enjoy lowsec the mostso i suggest UFFFDwhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsecUFFFDlowsec sp and structure kills cant bring your sec status below 2 the point where travel restrictions kick in to compensate make anyone with negative sec status a valid target wle in lowsec with no gcc or sentry repercussions sec losses from ghsec ganks remain untouched and so trigger travel restrictions optionally allow pod kills in lowsec to lower your sec past 2 ts lets people who want to be 10 for whatever reason become so optionally rework killrights to either remove them or make them only usable in lowsec people can now become part of a UFFFDlowsec fight clubUFFFD where they can shoot each other freely without losing their ghsec accessfor the current lowsec residents pirate and antipirate alike ts would bring more fun targets from ghsec in the form of UFFFDweekend piratesUFFFD and ghsec alliances trying to control lowsec systems and resources both of those have given me many enjoyable fights but both are unsustainable in the face of sec lossesim not sure i can tnk of a negative side to the changewhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
not a bad idea a lowered entry barrier and more incentives really are what low sec needs you also might what to post ts in the features  ideas discussion forum though so it can be refined with more details
damn sir that is a fine ideai would like ts  there seems to be no upside to locking pirates into lowsec anyway podkills and the like aye that would make you unable to go into ghsec but sp kills aggression and gcc to stay the samei dont get why lowsec pvpers are the only ones who are penalised for wanting to shoot other people
wow i tnk ts is an awesome ideai like the idea of pods kills still make you go below 20 so if you want to be a real pirate and kill pods you can but it makes alot of sense to make casual pvp possible
i agree too especially since ccp are going through a phase of trimming out all the unnecessary time consuming fat such as making pos logistics easier surely it makes sense to make a change that eases logistics for lowsec pvpers as jack says its sometng thats really not a problem for dedicated lowsec dwellers just an unnecessary annoyance and for the casual player its a considerable barrier to entry
now when ccp made it the corp bookmarks the bookmarks on overview would be niceideatwo overview named folder to personal and corporation locations and when a bookmark copied there thats would appear on overview
you dont have to train every skill to level 5are you seriously considering training every racial capital including titans to 5 all combat subcap ships mining shipsadd to that skills in market production and research and god knows how many categoryjust a hint you dont need to go for basics if you have ridiculous amounts of personal isk to buy a titan you can buy a char as welli can nearly perfect train a market alt in about a month that is where the real isk is anyway
once upon a time my corp lived in nullsec and we had a ball with smallscale pvpthen i got my first set of 4s and got so freaked out about losing them that i froze in a bubble instead of burning for it like id trained to do from my first step into gw needless to say i got podded and lost them all it took that loss to show me how stupid id been about it all im not in a terrible hurry for level 5 anything so what difference does it make since then i havent plugged in a single implant training times be damned im a much happier podpilot now btw and pod kills mean little more than a nice quick ride home haha as to the ops suggestion i like it makes nice simple sense to meoh and i secretly think the guys in my corp get a little rise out of it when they hear on ts that their only verified female corpmate is flying naked
listen to this man he has a monocle its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
kinda want not sure though
 1 suportthis this realy discorege ppl form pvp
not supportedlosing the ship is one level of hurt losing the imped clone should remain a second one that argument it would remove a barrier to pvp fails when looking at the really expensive implant sets  the typical learning implants are just a pittance compared to the values a number of players even pvpers have in their skullsdont fly what you cant afford to lose  you can extend that sentence to your implants as well
thanks for your contribution faceless forum alt its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
surprised to see this request coming from the goon camp that said i like this side of them o  this is indeed a logical request many times have i given up on a nights worth of pvp as those 24 hours with subpar implants in my throw away combat clone just seem a waste of training time is a perfectly reasonable suggestion 5 base to all everyones a winner in some cases there will be whiners there always aredefinitly an idea i think is worthy for more discussion  consideration
agreed on the point of not flying what you cant afford to losebut im afraid your argument on the expensive implants part is a bit off op is not advocating the removal of all implants just the learning ones the ones you assert are a mere pittance if theres an acrosstheboard means of compensating for their removal the 5 stat boost talked about earlier there where is the downsideadding more implants for operational buffs combat mining exploration etc would be a nice addition to our favorite sandbox wintheres always gonna be people that are afraid of pvp for whatever reason with this proposal we get rid of an outdated mechanic and some new shinies to try to avoid losing in pvpno flame intended nor feeding of the trolls the more i think about it the more i like this and just want to foster some genuine discussion
sweet troll thread thanks for the laugh guys
agreed
keep them look eve is about choices with implants you have a lot esp since jump clones came about first 3 and 4 are pretty cheap the older the player the more true this is second you only ever use two of these implants at a time if you remap focusing on two attributes then you only need two implants you can also mix and match you can do a 5 and a 4 for near maximum training yet a risk worth taking you can do a 4 and a 3 for a little boost over 3sfor crying out loud donUFFFDt fly in lownullsec with a full set when i was out there i just used two 3s had spares and kept them with my jump clone itUFFFDs not a big dealwe need to focus on the real issue costs the costs are fairly high for 5s the costs for 3s is high for a new player there is an easy fix for that lower the costs of implants release 6s and 7s at the current 5 price and call it a day this also doesnUFFFDt address the 5 implants the problem is the same there it gives a direct boost at a high price that gives an incentive to stay in highsec again a person has the same options and the same problemsthere is no way to make people happy short of giving them skills people are not patient all the time i see posts about increasing learning speed getting back skill points giving people unallocated skill points letting people through an obscure method buy skill points this whole thread is a UFFFDwe want to train fasterUFFFD thread that is never going to change attribute implants are just a scapegoat that people can focus onsince learning skills where removed attribute implants are the next target this will either force everyone to train more slowly give everyone maximum training speeds or end up somewhere in the middle the next target is attributes themselves and people are already clamoring about removing those after that all people can ask for is faster training time why because they ran out of targetsscapegoatshighsec envy is no excuse all the time i see complaints about highsec mission runners incursion fleets trading etc we used to see complaints about highsec mining until ganking became so common those who live in highsec are always going to be more likely to use expensive gear high priced ships and gasp costly implants that leads me to my next pointUFFFDadd attribute boosters make them easy and cheap to produce out in nullsec heck make them illegal in empire sure some will smuggle them in but at a nice profit level increasing the rewards of nullsec make them last 24hrs boosted to 48 w skills if you die while under the influence of these who cares they would lose their effect soon and need to be replaced anyway you could change them more often than a remap too heck then use 2s with these and get a cheap boostthe justification is choiceswe should have a choice of how we train there should be ways to increase and optimize that rate at an expense and risk individuals should be in control of this tradeoff those who deem the risk too high have made their choice that choice should not affect anyone elseUFFFDsother repercussions to considera secondary reason is that they are a good isklp sinks and serve as a UFFFDhighsec taxUFFFD as it were with 6 clones 5 slots and most of the population in highsec it has to be a huge isk and lp sink just removing it from the game when there are not enough isklp sinks is a bad idea
meh i got podded the day before crucible and lost three 4s its entirely possible to simply choose to accept the risk of losing those implants also dont shove every implant in your head that will fit only buy what you needyou might as well propose removing all expensive implants as well faction sets cost a lot of isk and no one wants to risk those in nullsec so lets just drop them from the game to save you from jumping clones
id say most people would be happy with the ability to pay plex to release skill points most of us made a lot of mistakes early on and could free up anywhere from 13 million sp if there were a way to do soit takes about 35 million sp to train a new racial battleship with t2 weapons assuming you have the requisite support skills thats frigate cruiser and battleship 4 and all of the weapon systems skill required for the large t2 skill at level 4 with 4 implants it takes two months to be able to change from one set of ships to another for those of us who have been playing less than 2 years thats a substantial percentage of our time in the game spent training skills we wont use and then there are the l5 command skills necessary for t2t3 shipsim expanding my command skills to other races right now and i admit im getting impatient its going to take a long time for me to reap the rewards of training all these skills meanwhile sp i wasted in my noob days go unused so yeah id use up some plex to get sp back if it were availablei wouldnt want to be able to buy sp that would be potentially gamebreaking and definitely a step too close to paytowin

 no
nah thats lamewhat would be cool is a special bomb that popped out on the other side of the wormholei mean itd be stupid as hellbut cool
true but there is an upper limit to the battleship even with afterburners option if this bomb took away half of a wormholes mass that could easily be billions of kg an unfitted orca is 250 million kg if it was a fixed or variable amount it could conceivably replace several round trips with a single shotthe exact amount of mass damage inflicted is still up in the air i dont know what would be fair but the harder these are to make and use the more damage they should do to the whyou know theres always the possibility to make another bomb that can extend the life of a wormhole rejuvenating its age and mass allowance
i have a serious question why should there exist a mechanic to trivially close whs i really think there should be significant risk involved in closing a wh sending through a large bs or hic at least has some risk where it might get stuck on the wrong side might get surprise attacked etc creating a sb bomb to close a wh from complete safety is just unacceptable imo for most whs the game mechanics should highly encourage lots of bs or the use of capital ships to close a wh it should not be something trivially done from the safety of a cloaking sb
this to be quite honestcourse no whs spacer worth his salt wouldnt miss counting and calculating mass on a wh when it comes to these thingsa bomb would take the riskand the rewardaway from such an hazardous environment as whsthe only bomb ill throwis a shrapnel bomb  stop the evemail spam
wh dwellers already have wh crashing down to a science 4 ships total with 1 jump and back for each and the wh is gone this is the case with most whs introducing this mechanic would just make wh life that much easier and lazy i am not entirely opposed to it though i have always thought that a gun of some kind that could fire a super dense mass round into a wh would be cool to collapse them it even makes logical sense that this kind of tech would be developed it would just make wh life a bit too easy
100 do not supportyou want to collapse the hole push ships through it
i agree with the sentiment that ccp should not introduce a device that auto kills wormholes what i am proposing is much more limited remember these devices would inflict any amount of mass damage to the hole that ccp would deem appropriate they could be hard to use require specialized skills and equipment take up a lot of cargo space and be expensive to build they arent systemwide smartbombs that eradicate all wormholes every time they cyclecorrect me if im wrong but im guessing that you would not object if there was a whbomb that only took away a single kg of mass from a wormhole and cost twenty million isk to buy if you dont object to that then were not talking about a principle were negotiating a priceas it stands now wh settlers know how to collapse their wormholes from time to time miscalculations are made but for the vast majority of cases closing up a hole is done with simple math and good communication it doesnt take long and the risk isnt that severe closing a wormhole is an inconvenience more than it is a risk in 95 of all casesthis is not just for carebearing think about the offensive uses of these bombs lure a large fleet into a wh and then rip it wide open so they cant all get back maybe track a mining expedition going into a wh and close off their exit come on the idea of trapping people where they cant get out of has to appeal to some of you
noremove local chat and make it harder to camp gates instead
i never said anything bout removing current resists etc hull rigs are hull rigs not a replacement for gay armor repping blobs nor a solution for active repping just a way to level the playing field for real men who play eveonline without the crutch of armor or shield mods cmon ccp you know you wanna do it
damage control ii hull rigs reinforced bulkheads final destination
1gallente always had the strongest hulls time to take it to the next level
supported i would love to rock a hulltanked thorax
no riski am a 15 year old pilot with 63 million sp this is because i have gotten in and out of this game multiple times but i keep coming back now i need a way to get some isk and i would actually have some choices to move from hs missioning to some pvp and possibly see what lowsec or nullsec is all about so i started thinking maybe i can run some incursions to get isk but with my small wallet and player and character skills i feel i cant really afford to lose the ships required to run hs incursions much less any low sec  null stuff hell i probably wouldnt even be selected for any fleets with my t1 battlecruiser with a little t2 tank anyway there are some of us who are not set and cant just buy everything we need and want some players are just on the verge to be able to afford the activities that can actually make isk to keep this game funguess ill go run a level iii for about 1 million isk for the 5th time today ok ok tears here 
1000also an update from devs about fate of local would be nice local change seems to be postponed together with rest of incarna stuff

you either havent paid attention or youre just making  up tons of people resubbed for crucible its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
does ccp they never programmed in any consequences they dont seem keen to do so either because they dont share our vision of what is and what is not reasonable in the eve universe or because they arent keen to rewrite the code on these thingslets take a few examples from eve as it isin npc hisec when you shoot on a convoy belonging to the same corporation as the station owner then the station guns do open fire on you for a period but then when the agression timer expires you can dock there without consqequence in npc nullsec you can farm pirate spawns till youre blue in the face then go dock in that pirates npc station without consequence in pc nullsec the station owners can determine station access by setting their own standings in pc nullsec there are no station guns however despite that we can dream so here i goproposal 1 switch faction ownership of stations in systems that are lost to enemy factionswhat consequences would this have other than cosmetic in itself is has no consequenceshenceproposal 2 have enemy stations fire upon the opposing station much like gcc  i take it that you mean to have them fire on the opposing militia capsuleers otherwise it makes no sense to meas others have pointed out this in itself is not enough ie what happens to the agents can the opposing militia still dockthe best consequence would be station lock out and agents switching faction this could obviously be diluted to reductionincreased cost of station services and locking down the agentsperhaps the station should be made vulnerable to conquering by the opposing militia when the occupancy switches rather than just falling at the same timehans jagerblitzen you have done some stirling work in pushing the faction warfare cause forward i just think you were a but hasty in putting forward this proposal as the lowest hanging fruit so although i think they are a good starting point for discussion i also think that you are diluting your other thread be making this one
well traditionally proposal threads have been pretty specific in scope focus on one manageable implementable change to the game at a time they are less so the place for sweeping overhauls complicated manifestos and speculation about the places a system can go i agree this is really a drop in the bucket but we still have more patches underway with incarna and it appears ccp is indeed tackling things regarding faction warfare that are minimal on the programming end a station tweak with sentry guns firing on opposing factions should be easy to deploy thus now is the time to throw it down on the table for approval from the community because it could theoretically be implemented even before they move on to summer expansionin case you all didnt notice there are now more faction warfare systems as of the latest patch the plex spawning timer fix is not where ccps work on faction warfare is ending by any means what those systems are i have no idea but theyre there in the patch notes clear for anyone to see it is in this spirit i put forth a simple proposal regarding sentry guns on militiaowned stations though it by no means should be seen as a substitute for the big picture discussions in my other thread its just one piece of the overall puzzle one that can be done now regardless of what else gets developed down the road
thinking about the fact that plexing is still a silly pve grind i have to say i would only want consequences like this to happen after they remove the npcs and let the militia players start fighting for occupancy make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
im dubious about this idea the problem is that as cearain says plexing is still really really boring so what this would effectively do would be to force fw pilots to do an activity that they hate at the moment enthusiasm in the amarr militia for plexing is at rock bottom as demonstrated by the fact that the minmatar were able to capture huola with the vast majority of the amarr not doing anything about it ive tried to encourage amarr pilots to go plexing in the past and its really really difficult  very few care anymore and i cant really blame them  im probably one of about ten amarr who still plexes and i have to say if i had the choice between plexing every day and quitting fw id probably quit fw so while this would get people interested in plexing again in the short term i think in the long term it would result on whichever side is winning just locking the other sides systems down and once thats happened are newbies really going to want to join a militia with the odds stacked against them
since when did getting within 2km of a cloaked ship not decloak it there is a counter but hardcore carebears simply refuse to acknowledge this theres plenty of things you can do to counter an afk cloaky think outside the carebear boxthe rest of your post is as equally pointless as that
you did actually read your op again
uhm you are aware that the current negative value of 00 was always there before right they just didnt show it thats why certain systems had consistantly better rats and belts in them because they had a lower truesec value now they just have it all posted in game instead of having to check derived values on things like the ombey maps
it takes a ton of resourcefulness and dedication to set your igb homepage to wormnavstaticmapperdotlan and check the data laid out in front of youwaves
considering that sleeper kills are at best a very unreliable proxy for wormhole activity and that pvp kills are available anyway through the efforts that already have been made to compile combat logs i support this given that wormhole jump data is meant to stay gone it would make no sense to reintroduce jump data without the sleeper kill statistics in my mind
i dont see why that couldnt be arranged it would limit what you can store there of course but why not the person hacking into a vault that has no atmosphere would have to bring along special gear to be able to move around in such a placethis idea is a big reach to begin with and i dont expect it in the next patch but conceptually i still like it the unease about theft revolves around risk and consequences risk is all of the cybernetics and melted nanoribbons and little things that are worth millions consequences is the thought that someone can start an alt train them for theft and then transfer the loot to their main and avoid the ramifications i want to try and focus on those two ideas a little morerisk obviously there have to be limits someone who successfully hacks into cribbas station vault cant walk out with ninety bajillion tons of veldspar and a hanger full of ships in his back pocket there should be a limit to the volume that can be taken in a single theft a volume restriction is ineffective if the thief is trying to steal the valuable little things which are much more valuable in every respect how do you keep people from being robbed blind here are some ideas time restriction on a theft once inside you have a finite amount of time until station security responds this could be as little as a few minutes and a big vault will be hard to dig through to find the valuables volume restriction the thief came in through an airlock and has to get his loot out in some way it would be easy to say that he can only take things out that fit through the door he came through other means transport tubes etc can come into play and can restrict volume to a set value tiered security secure cargo containers could be a good place to store valuables inside of a vault they could provide a second hackable barrier theft insurance if you lose stuff to theft you get a payout not sure how to prevent insurance fraud hereconsequences loss of gear if you get caught by station security your thief gear is confiscated execution if the vault defenses kill the thief they have to get a new medical clone loss of skill points to prevent further crimes station security erases pieces of your memory removing the skills needed to steal like t3 subsystem skill loss sec status hit perhaps you can even be blacklisted at a station for a period of time if youre caught there maybe you can be branded a thief on show info and in space for a period of time outlaw status
so i vent yesturday testing anomalys in 00 ccp sad they boosted them hmm i didint fieled eny boost atall oonly on hubs thos are boosted but not inaf if look onsanctum or heven sanctums not boosted atal all that in first wave its more bs not gives more profit that makes it longer to tun and profit stays the samehavens litle bit boosted but not much i still stay on 60 milj per hour with tengumy proposal is that ccp culd make rats with more bounty like belt ratsnow in belts wie can find gurista usuprep rats with 18 milj bountysin anomalys tha same rats are 12 milj bountysby increasing bountys on anomaly rats wuld be meat goal to increse 00 profits per hours with probably culd be soem counter part high sec misioning or incursion runingi sorry for my grammar my native language its not english its acioent caldari some ppl my not understand 
the last thing eve needs is nullsec carebears having even more rewards for 0 risks
that its wath 00 needs morep pl in 00 curently systems are 0 population almost max 2 ppl in each pvpers wil not have ny one to shoot soon if in sytem is 12 pppl and moslty off the day they sit in pos and ppl cry thos cebears sitign in poses not rat wie cant catch them they siting in poses that they are mostly pvp alts money making in evei s allready beck to high sec so les pp lin 00 pvpers have less targets to shootmore ppl in 00 some one will make that teriblem istake by mising soem neut or red apearing in 00 pepers have nice kilmail that the simply ting to get beck ppl from high sec to 00 need more rewards then in havegsec and every vere els 00 is not safe place there is no concord
stop posting youre embarrassing us
thats the big point going for near perfect graphics made the whole thing crash into a wall because the single player game was putting graphics cards to the limit alot of effort went into that one room and ultra realistic characters that could have been spent on a realistic multiplayer environment one which my cpu and many others could play ina what if is what if ccp pushed for economy instead of extreme graphics they might have had content that was full and able to be multiplayer on the massive scale that the game is not a personal room but whole city inside a station ccp cant change the past but they can change the future in the approach they go about it
the major flaw is that items arent destroyable its almost impossible to change it now you would have to make it around 100x less expensive and manufactorable ingame and somehow reset the wallet from everyone which is not feasible blueprint copies only via aur but tradeablethe current system does not fit to eve there is no reason to buy anything via aur just buy it via isk and if you dont like it sell it again it does not wear off and it cant be destroyed this basically killed the already tiny demand you see it at the collapsed isk prices  they all cost only a fraction of its original aur valuelast but not least no wod  no wis
i dont know why you guys are trying to keep this thread afloat no offense op but the player base has spoken and most people dont want incarna
correction fis was on the back burner for 24 months not 18most of the work to start incarna has been completed but the 80 incarna 20 fis has been switched to 20 incarna to 80 fis which i think is importantby putting less resources on an experimental technology it can focus on its implementation at less of a cost results in less canceled projects and more production pushed out the doori look forward to baby steps of incarna but killing it is like building a house with out a roof and saying forget it i am donei am looking forward to content like localised markets  buying it off a preferred shop and a shop only selling to preferred customers specialized items  modified ships that tweek a bs to be altering the sig radious for more shields a 4 rig that cant be removedplayer made adventures through bots though the use of book marks and corpes alliances can make missions that improve their strength of hold over an area hell even contract to kill some one silly mini games and pokerincarna has such a possibility to expand eves tool base for players to create a personalized portion of spacesaying no to incarna is like saying no to tech 3 ships
bad comparison tech 3 ships do have a useas said elsewhere this is eve it is about flying in space its not an fps nor is it star wars online or habbo hotel development in cq and its surroundings should be treated as dogwash tasks and there is much more to be done about fis
even 20 incarna is too much ccp needs to cut their losses and abandon further development of it we need more spaceship content in this spaceship game
i dont mind incarna development as long as it doesnt impede fis development its just that simpleand no further rollout of incarna should happen until the gpumelting problem ops rock wall iirc is solved to the point where someone on a celeron running xp can play it my machine is a damnsight better than that i assure you but it still runs a bit too warm i want and im pretty sure ccp does to for everyone who clicks the cq button to enjoy incarna and walking around in stations without worrying about the stability of the machine they run it on the rest of us will be outside flying in spacewin winsudden radical thought maybe this is where the universe could use some sharding wis and fis on two diff sets of servers this way the jita node doesnt melt with the combined wis and fis load meh just a thought
this i certainly dont want wis to become a way to pass the time while avoiding pvp if you want to be perfectly safe sit in your docked ship and spin away that should be the only 100 safe space ifwhen wis comes about
wellnothe most vocal have spoken and stated they dont want incarna most of the playerbase would enjoy seeing incarna finished as would the large number of players that would join eve just to see it
the sims playerbase has moved into eve
from what i read its not even the vocal people ho want no incarna but a small subset of them most would be happy to have incarna if it ran well on the client side and had a point to undockingwalking around in an avatar is not enough reason to have incarna we need a cantina scene with things to actually do but not things that would require us to partake if all we want to do is fly in space think of the separation of the jump to lightspeed xpac on swg where you never had to play on the planet once you got a space ship in order to experience the whole space experience
1i am among those that think incarna has a lot of potential to give eve a real flushed out world experience that being said i think ccp needs to take a year off of incarna to bring all of the former shiny projects like faction warfare nullsec sov
whos to say the missiles dont just ram through your external armorplating and then explode inside your ship where theres air or do you believe your ship is a vacuum on the inside as wellhow can anyone come up with such a bad idea removing missiles would mean removing all reason to fly caldari ships
id start running i hear the murderous roar of thousands of drake and raven pilots as they grab pitchforks and torches
it was just an idea and maby a bad one no need to get angry about it and i am not running for no one and if missiles where to pentrate right trough the hull wtf is armor and shields for i just think missile mechanics are fed up and need somekind of redoing after all these years missiles still shoot from the center of the shipalso if you use missile in a highsec gank concord reacts to te lauch of missiles not to the impact of themso if your missiles are to slow and totaly miss the target technicaly not even in combat concord still pops youi am a carebear so i dont gank people on a regular basis but still
heat damage and explosion damage is kind of rediculouseflying towards the sun would melt your ship in real space heat transfer is very well possible
lets not get too complicatedthis is a game and enjoy it for what it isif you want to follow proper physics and real life leave your basement
why are the caldari probably the most technologically superior race after the jovians using missiles 27000 years in the future they are still using missiles i mean you could replace missiles withplasma based weaponsphoton weaponsnanite based weaponsphasersdark matterturbo lasersphase inhibitorssonic based weaponspulse cannonsgravimetric blastersim sure there are others but this is a start
id love to see your sonic weapon work in a vacuum 
you will never be rid of missilesa missile by definition is a propelled payload of any number of different kinds being guided or unguided to a targeta projectile by definition would also be viewed as a minimature missile at that rate a damn fast one at thathell even a rail gunor a blastergranted theres no propellant but it is a ballistic missile at bestsymantics yesbut this proposal is just utterly ridiuclous stop the evemail spam
its sci fi it can be made to work
why is it ridiculous
hence why this game is now called subcaps online
o atomic oxygenh atomic hydrogend atomic deuterium also UFFFDho2 molecular oxygeno3 ozoneh2o waterh2o2 hydrogen peroxided2o heavy water also UFFFDh2o
yeah i think breaker meant d20 note i dunno how to make the subsuperscript characters least that was the way i read it at first rather than two water moleculesalso wikipedia indicates that liquid ozone is dark blue rather than whitecolourless ccp moar colour
let me guess as soon as you get wardecked you have 24 hours to turn them back on againthis is why i hate highsec and damn near everyone in iti honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
pretty much if you noticed there are no supersub scripts used i dont know how to make them either hmmm thats interesting
yes because thats exactly what incursions need more rewardssir patrick moore cbe frs fras hon vice president of the royal astronomical society
puts tin hat on and waits for nullsec carebear tears
im not saying more im just saying you should be able to choose which one you want the reward or the tiny increase in faction standingand its kind of obvious you save alot of people from getting abducted and turned in to careless zombies for that you should get a faction standing increase if you turn the battlereport in to the right authorities almost the same as them tags you can turn in but here you can choose
mining should give faction gains youre like mining for them
seems fair to me might slow down the isk faucet a bit which is always a good thing actually this wouldnt be a bad idea in missions as well passing on the payout for an increase in faction standing
glad someone likes the thought but dont think it should be extended to missions we already got the storyline missions
nopeople should be able to improve their sansha standings by shooting you

i guess someone didnt read the eulayou provide no compelling reason other than i think these things are bad to create a body with the ability to punish players for performing actions that are within the terms of the gamein case you havent noticed yet eve is at its core a pvp game whether its on the markets in nullsec in wormholes or in empire the vast majority of play involves directly competing with other players you have a lot of resources but too much trust you may find yourself giving all your stuff to someone who has no intentions of giving it back an alliance with enough funds can significantly alter the prices of basic resources in the game by limiting access to harvesting them entire regions of systems change hands over the course of months limited by the terrible sov mechanics  a vocal portion of the playerbase makes fun of players who only pursue activities that are essentially riskless and require no competition with other playerssurprisingly the players who stay the longest and are the most vocal about their love for eve are the ones who participate in these activities that you suggest limiting new players who get involved in these activities also tend to stick around as opposed to those who just run missions over and over punishing players who scam or pirate is telling us that we cant play how we like in our sand box while we make fun of carebears most of us pvp guys will not deny their right to enjoy the game in their own way just lament that they find something monotonous and repetitive fun
first off let me say thankyou for a constructive response i understand eve is a player versus player game and have no intention of trying to change that and in no way am i trying to limit these activities in fact i believe my idea could even help to bolster membership in these areas by placing bounty on whole corporations you invariably increase pvp activity against them a true pirate corporation shouldnt be afraid of bureaucrats and i believe a more realistic system of government inside eve could only help an otherwise extremely in depth game
thats the thing eve is a sandbox you can already do that stuff you can already say ill give anyone who kills x 10m isk that is placing a bounty on someone you dont need an artificial system to do so if you want to form a government system go ahead and do so you will face the same struggles that all governments have namely the opposition of anyone who doesnt want to give in to you but theres nothing stopping you
a full blown player judiciary will just give another group of players the opportunity to do the sorts of things the csm does alreadypiracy and scamming are part of the game and csms are voted in all of their power lies with ccpif ccp wanted to install a means to call a vote of no confidence they would have but since that would make it more difficult for players in the csm to entertain themselves at other players expensedont hold your breath is all im sayingpart of ccps core design for eve was to not only allow players to entertain themselves at the expense of other players but to encourage itoverall eve really is a good game but if people arent lining up to play it they arent and ccp can either act like they care or not its their game and their businessccp doesnt seem anywhere as interested in entertaining the masses and making excellent money and having a major pvp element in eve also known as having it all as they are in entertaining those who entertain themselves at others expensethis basically means that ccp could be entertaining ccp at ccps expense and the bill for that entertainment could be in the millions of iskbut its their money
i understand your viewpoint you are still wrong howeveradditionally i tried to look up this word readnig you used i assumed it was a verb could be mistaken but i couldnt find anything
i think you misunderstand i dont particularly want to form it or even necessarily be a part of it i think a system such of this could help to legitimize player judicial power in the universe as eve is meant to be do whatever you want im sure people would enjoy sitting on a council like this arguing over which corporation deserves a bounty keeping the csm working hard for all players dealing with gross negligence or misconduct of huge businesses i understand and believe eve should be a pvp game where scamming is a legitimate option for making isk but even if you give this judicial branch just enough power to set someones security rating to 10 for continued scamming you give all players the option of adding a bounty to a scammer maybe my first idea was not perfect and not many ideas are heck i cant think of any perfect ideas but i think some sort of system which introduces an additional risk vs reward system is never a bad thing
id like to counterpropose an oversight committee to punish players who commit the following crimesice miningfarming highsec l4sbad posting
you already have a whole csm trying to make those less profitable and make low and nullsec more profitable
there was a item in the database that wasnt available on the marketmining foreman link  drone coordinationand the refering blueprintmining foreman link  drone coordination blueprint
my guess would be either a fleet increase of drone mining yield or navigation speed as to introducing it we just got 3 new t2 mining foreman links with the latest patch id say thats enough for now mining is fools work as it is
nothxbye
i support super cap dockingi support new station hulls that would allow thisi support new super cap hulls to abuse this mechanic withi support single moms dancing on poles on docked titan bridges
because ccp totally doesnt want us spending our money on a second account
1ts is a very good proposalstops belefag from ruining my precious sec status
supportedits good to see a suggestion that gets away from the general force the carebears in and more targets willing or not attitudes you usually see when talking about lowsec and have one that focuses on encouraging the willing playercorp to join the fun
i like it
i like it a lot supporting definitely needs to have the podkills for 10 to appease the tough guy roleplayers thoughalso id consider keeping sentry gun mechanics as is but just taking out sec ts below 199 ts way small sps would still be relatively safe to travel in even if you were 1990 sec and part of the club and it would differentiate the 10 crowd as one more gameplay style they can get more fights by being an appealing target due to no sentry aggro to their attacker otoh they are stuck with sec travel restrictionsim sure the frigate crowd would still congregate to low sec belts et al much much more than they do already good fights for all an alternative to ts would be to finally bring concord bribery in to the game
we could call it lowsec arena
seems like a good idea most of lowsec is guys wanting to kill each other without having to deal with 00 stuff current game mechanics are notng but an annoying obstacle to that
could do ts but on the other hand sentry guns have a huge effect on fights with 210 people per side wch are the kind that should be encouraged in low if you leave sentries in place for the majority of the casual pvp population they will cause lots of mexican standoffs on gates and stationswhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
ts is true and wle it wont make sentries less influential during fights reducing gcc to 5 minutes rather than 15 might encourage more weekend pirates to risk sentry fire over combatand if not us lifetime pirates can show up to these standoffs and mess with both sides
good plosophy true carebears are going to avoid lowsec anyway so why bother trying to prod them
ts is sometng i wantthe security penalty is the reason i dont pvp in low sec
pirate agents in lowsec would be nice thoughedit we were ganked 3 times wle posting ts message
i like it very muchsupported
huzzah
i like it ts idea definitely has my support it becomes annoying and too much trouble trying to fix your sec every time you get below 2 for ghsec travel abilities or keep it above 5 to remove kos rights also what the hell is the idea wa 15 min gcc timer or 10 min standard cynosural field timer  strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat
ts i can agree with why should the people living out there who are shooing each other see their sec status go downi honestly tnk poco based sov is a good idea
10
looks like lowsec is really doing ok lets fix sov 00 first
low sec is certainly not doing fine its been ignored by the devs for years with the pathetic exception of fw a lot of the kills from that dev blog are just lolcamps in amamake and rancer not actual pvp
newbies dont generally have the option to only plug in two implants based on what theyre training thoughplease read the op instead of blindly extrapolating from the first two sentences its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar

1kill learning implants with proper compensation2make combat implants various enough dont make them another must equipment3various other noncombat like social implants as well as pi implants
if you are really going to remove learning implants recycle their iconsall combat implants with the same icon is a pain in the ass use the icons of learning implants to make them more distinguishable like grouped by gunnerynavigationshieldarmor etc
attribute boosts arent proper compensation its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i respectfully disagree two implants in particular would be very effective perception and intelligence i think ccp would agree with me as they are giving those implants out for free while 3s may be too costly for a new player 2s and 1s are not a new player typically is not expected to have access to the entire game that said i suggested making current plants cheaper cost is the real issueas for the op bulletspoint 1 response cost is the real issue thus lower thempoint 2 response see attribute boosters illegal in highsec abovepoint 3 response we need the isklp sink while attribute boosters would have nothing to do with lppoint 4 response boosters could take them to 5 levels i see nothing wrong with 567 pirate implantsas for the summary not to be condescending but it only makes sense in the we all want to train faster or the we want something for nothing sense i would like to see the reverse happen more attribute augmenters added and the potential for future attribute boosts mutators black cyber implants or jovian gene manipulation anyonea short history of 5 implantsat one point 5s were out of the question worth a billion isk each most had 3s or 2s a few had 4s but those were costly too since the lp store came into existence the cost of 5s came down then the price point was in line with highsec availability especially for mission runners who get them at a discount and oh the angst against mission runners now we have a UFFFDhaves and havenotsUFFFD case whereas before the perception was that almost no one had themattribute boosters contnullsec UFFFDhavenotsUFFFD have the strongest argument having risk but not ready access to implants lowsec you have l5 agents i can relate i had a hard time getting my 3s and spares out there attribute boosters would reverse the situation making the UFFFDhavenotsUFFFD the UFFFDhavesUFFFD implemented correctly this addresses the problem of cost and availability this also adds content to the game an incentive to go to nullsec and rewards the risk of nullsec esp if the boosters were 246 in poweragain not to be condescending but the op flattens the gamepushing the envelopei would like to see new elements of the game that increase learning rates this has happened before the second set of learning skills were warmly received initially lower implant prices put 5s in the hands of many happy players remaps thrilled those with poor attributes and good attributes alike giving away learning skill attributes and giving back skill points was met with huge support while removing learning implants seems like the next step i see it as a cap on learning speeds not a boost faster training will make all players happy but i think this is more about costs and UFFFDhaves and havenotsUFFFD more than anything else attribute boosters mutators better learning implants and other ways to increase learning speeds periodically released are what i want to see added to the game
as if learning implant would ever be removed its simple if i fear losing the implants because i may get podded i wouldnt undock thus making no money its the same as with ships if you dont want to risk it why have it at all but thats a personal choice everyone has to make for himself
i mean compensation to those have them in hangeryou cannot just make their property vanishboosters will also be bad if they become a must instead of optional that is to say without side effect and everyone should use
dear gods the goons do have a swarm mentality oo so far i havnt seen ne post made by you guyswith your participation that hasnt been flooded with repsonses from both test and goonwaffe and there affiliatesback on topic thoughi think implants are fine to be honest if you dont want to foot the bill and the loss of the implants should you get podded then its like saying ban piratefaction modules and ammo yet they ae used in pvp were the risk of getting blown up is high depending on what is being done at the time
lulz goon entitlements must be able to get podded at no cost i want the good stuff but not consequencesnothing is must no one is preventing you from undocking because you dont have implants in your head dont plug in what you cant afford to lose
get rid of them same with remapsi remember when i was a noob training all the core weapon and ship skills i calculated i lost like 12 months of training a year into the game because i wasnt mapped for percwill fell into the charisma blackhole i never really pvpd in nullsec cause fear of losing my learning implants too eventually i got a jump clone but it wasnt really used for travel like the skill is intended i just used it when important fleet ops came up so i wouldnt lose my learning implants if players are not minmaxed for trainingespecially noobs they are just hurting themselves in the long run lots of potential sp down the drain just like the learning skillsisk can be lost and replaced but lost training time cannot be replaced this prevents many people like myself who didnt want to pvp because you could lose training time

wow all of pandemic legion posted on this thread as the nonpandemic legion people have said get rid of insurance payout and deny them a killmail if you cant kill it fast enough try harder next time i do agree that having a registered loss on the pilot would be good for stats purposes but flipping the bird to pl is fine with me too sorry guys
the proposal is as thread titlesurely only proposals should come from those members of the community whose words have been peerjudged to be awesome this would have the pleasantly doubleedged effect of i only allowing aforesaid awesome posters in suggesting only the best ideas and ii giving those deemed not worthy by the like system scope to buck up their ideas pull themselves together and become more like the cool kidsin the interests of paternalistic concern however under this system everyone would still be able to vote on the threads of their choice as presentwhat do you say show your support
i completely agree but lets set the goal a little higher so only the cream of the crop actually can participate i think it should be set at a minimum of 10000 likes that should keep the riff raff out710
for this to happen the feature and ideas discussion forum would need to be more trafficed a lot of the threads posted here really belong over in fid the assembly hall tends to get flooded with unrefined ideas that people just whip up and get excited about i am guilty of this myself 1000 seems really high though maybe if it was something like 200 i would support this proposal
the very fact that you posted this idea here proves that having a 1000 likes does not make you a better poster
wrong having 1000 likes makes you one of the best poasters besides look at the other threads in this depressing subforum can you honestly say that even a leftfield idea such as this doesnt at least integrate with the new social network paradigm that ccp introduced here and wouldnt it go well with the very idea of the like system after all what the hell else was it introduced for if not for something like this
i was thinking of something like that but discarded the idea when i considered that number to be way too outlandish if that idea were to be introduced only lyris would be able to create new proposals lolacquiring at least a thousand likes is a difficult though by all means not impossible task for the average capsuleer to achieve it provides a goodly dose of motivation 
i could be persuaded to round the number down a bit depending on the general consensus thanks for your idea 1 to you
oh before i forget even if he had a million likes lol drake draconis and his would forever be forbidden to make proposals im just shooing that proposal onto this one 
to be faironly csm should be allowed to start threads in the assembly hall the general population can discuss idea in the idea and feature section and lyris is just as much a troll as everyone else 10000 likes or not
the last time i posted an ideawas before this forum board was even activatedand i can count on one handless than even as to the number of times i did thatmaybe at most 4as for likes itself who the  said they would be a measurement of ones worth to make proposalsall youve proven is your the least of theselikes is nothing more than ehonour and doesnt mean a damn thing other than someone giving you props for a indivdiual postideas require you to use that thing they call grey matter in your thick skull something you seriously lack in materialand useto top that offyour just being an  in this grand standing nothing short of pathetic troll postinga complete waste of time stop the evemail spam
whats with underlining the letters t r o l and l i wonder
im just going to post your original reply right here it makes little orphans look up with sparkles in their eyes when they realise you didnt and cant possibly given those hideous nerdspecs you wear read closely enough even taking that into account this game is still messedup to actually allow something like thisalso had to add in this gemwow so i guess that must make you the master poster snickers
hmm i just dont know
stop drinking and posting and you might actually gain a ltitle self respectas for your remark about master poster i never said i was you sure as hell arent eitheryour just a stupid little troll who has nothing better to do but to post bullcrapso please post awayin before lock stop the evemail spam
littleyourei dont know about you buddy but i get part of my self respect through the fact that i can spell and can write in a more or less coherent fashion its not all about the internet forums you knowbesides this is no worse perhaps even better than your gamebreaking idea about injecting skills before youve trained them way to go
im going to have to disagree with dtell  with the bites youve gotten on this youve got to be somewhere around 88510 on this onecame expecting tears was not disappoint would read again
we c wut u did ther
try and find all of our mysterious messages d
i like big numbers theyre bigger than small numbers
the last time our voices were not heard in this game we shot at that little statue outside jita and started unsubscribing not supportedi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
still
bump started training for black ops the moment i started eve quit training several months in after realizing they were useless would like those sp to go to something useful
given the slope of the eve learning curve first time offenders of certain questionable yet not outrightly aggressive acts in hi sec should be shown some leniency as an example the use of a cetus ecm shockwave i currently causes instant destruction by concord for a first time user of this device which can easily be mistaken as a purely defensive device this is an obvious shock the loss of ones ship fit and cargo is annoying enough the loss of significant security status however is unwarranted this is a clear overreaction on the part of concordfor the more sadistic eve players who prefer to respond to proposals like these with the usual derision  you might want to pause and realize that the more carebear fodder floating around in the game the more your piratical activities will netthe burst ecm may be a special case and thus easy to patch however i want to encourage an attitude shift on the part of concord and perhaps eve devs in general a 1520 second warning for players who have not repeatedly committed the same type of aggression would be a respectable yet decisive way to handle unintended hi sec aggressionthere are a number of ways to implement with this issue but i propose that a field be added in each potentially aggressive device type per player that records the number of transgressions with the use of this type of device so that concord can react based on a players history the degree of reaction can then be gauged appropriately
does the burst ecm feature a warning
scuse methis has to be the most utterly hillarious request ive seen yetfirst time offenders by concord are quite funny and very light in comparsion to what you elude or imlpymy first time was more of an accident but i was warned prior to said actionyour full of crap good sirkindly take it to the bio room where it belongsnot supportedwalks away laughing stop the evemail spam
i received no warning of any kind  activated the device and the ship was gone no aggression popups have been disabled this is not a gratuitous proposal
well itll be gratuitous when we can get one free gank per 10 hour hero
iirc any module where you get concordokken will show a warning  now if you disabled them already because you were trying to gank a miner say  thats your own damn fault
theres a good idea
actually i feel that theres something of merit to this idea as has been stated the job these bug testers do somewhat resembles the job that actual qa testers do who are employed by the software company directly the only difference in this case is that those taking part in the mass sisi tests are i not employed by ccp and ii dont really get anything worthwhile out of the experience ok they get a load of singularity sps  yippee  and perhaps they log on with their mates and have a laughas far as i can see these testers are performing a task which ccp or any other company would ordinarily pay for the least that ccp could do would be to give these people something small but tangible as a reward  hence why 10k or thereabouts sp wouldnt be such a big deal not gamebreaking really when you think about it
maybe you should think about it a little more before you open that mouth of yoursthe last thing we need is a bunch of people logging into sisi with the single motivation to gain more sps and give ccp poor quality test results to waste their time and delay the repirations of the gameas its been said before repeatedly if you had bothered to read and pay attentiongrant aurumn or vanity items but sps are not to be considered an award unless restricted to sisi itselfanything that gives an unfair advantage is a bad ideaespecailly if that award wastes ccps time in trying to get this game up and running smoothly enough for everyone else stop the evemail spam
i read the ideas about vanity items i thought your idea handing out maps and whatever else was silly but the one about aurum is ok besides other people have already mentioned the dataquality issue and proposed counters to thatat the moment there is not much to entice people to these tests

nofor the simple reason that closing wormholes involves having ships out in space which can be attacked if you replace this with wh bombahs it will reduce the amount of conflict in wspace which would suckso like the other guys said push ships through until it closes plx
has anyone had a fight with people actively trying to close a wormhole or been attacked while trying to close one
yes to bothso why would people use them instead of pushing ships throughyour proposal removes all risk both from being stranded and from being attacked from collapsing
strip mining means just that strip the whole roid to find the mineralsif mining would be pi like it would not be strip miningbut mining could use a buff of some kindbigger mining ships with better resists and i would love to see the rorqual alowed in highsec spaceor another large mobile mining platform

learn to scan then go run gas prochpas until you have a few nanite controls plexing in low sec is pretty much risk free as it is as long as you dont blindly jump through gates and use directionalyou also need less isk  sp to begin exploration than you do to start incursions hell you could even run c2sthe problem with incursions at the moment is that as the above poster shows new players see them as the only viable way of making isk they shouldnt be it complete destroys the scope of this game

infomorph physiology5 reduction per level in the time required between jump clone activationsprimary attribute intelligencesecondary attribute memorytraining time multiplier x4level 1prereq science lvl 5 biology lvl 1 infomorpgh psychology lvl 1as previously posted here
i support this idea
requirements should be considerably higher like infomorph psychology iv and maybe biology ivwere talking about a skill relating to its base skill like advanced weapon upgrades relate to weapon upgradesand with the possibility to shave off six hours from jump clone cooldown the training time multiplier should be at least x6
i dont think a 5 reduction is high enough at lvl 5 you would still have to wait 18h and since most people would only train it to lvl 4 it would be 19h 12m for thema 10 or 15 reduction would probably be better and make it a useful skill
finally something here worth responding toyes
not a horrible idea better than what we have now but not as good as my idea to eliminate or dramatically reduce timer for samestation clone swaps
this is a fantastic idea supported
trading itself is a isk making profession amoung the highest would order number be limitlessthis would end the need of having alts or training them
touche
not supported mostly because you can simply target people who are known to be offline at a given time and thus defenseless even poses and similar structures have some means to enforce a confrontation with the defendersmake something dependent on skills works only for so long until players regularly train to level v then it is either it works or it doesnt without anything inbetween
i was imagining something that you being online or offline would have no bearing on a theft imagine it more like tower defense if that helps you have a station vault you upgrade the locks on the doors you buy and place defense guns detection grids sentry robots traps put valuables in locked station containers youre off in space in a mission or logged off when someone hacks your vault it would make no difference it is the plans and traps you set up versus the person unless you are in your vault when they hack in i dont see how you could be directly involved at least that was how i saw it

i didnt know that though sort of found out through trial and error yes i bought a implant with isk then put it on then the implant or a implant by the most random reappeared in some nullsec station that i abandoned months ago picked it up then resold it for a billion or so havent updated my picture for not having implant but my char icon has it for when i had implantsoooo way to create demand for this fancy clothing shop1 if multiplayer walking in stations happened then what fancy cloths you have on currently would matter more then a picture you took of yourself months ago2 if it binded to you permanently then you could not resell it so buying it and absorbing it unlocks for you now and forever it would create considerably more demand then current system3 if fancy clothing was bound to clone like real implants and if it was blown up you could lose it would add extravagance to buying it and big demand for repeat customers2 and 3 of course rely on number one the clothing shops success is directly tied to interest in walking in stations so releasing could be said as premature i spent my isk on my mono for more of a joke then anything else inspired by hurr durrr
then im asking you why isnt there an equally largevocal faction of the player base pushing for wis a scattered thread here and there but not the storm ive seen against itnothing against a little customizing of the cq but as soon as there is an option to see other players in their own cq im asking for an item to weld the door shut permanentlyno ccp should simply say that the stations administration deems it too dangerous to station security to let capsuleers run around and not be confined to their quarters judging from several proposals theywe are
i like to gamblei like to play mini gamesi like to role playi like to market personal thingsi like to customizei like to like to automatei like to play smalli like to get personali like to dress upi like to look talli like to scratch my headi like to jump on my beadi like to be more than a shipi like being to be humani like to have new players join the gamei like to sell to only my alliancei like to have pet to greet me when i returni like to explore on footi like to have more services i like to make adventuresi like player contenti would like incarna to do the things i would like to do
i am hearing from UFFFDfis onlyUFFFD people is you dont need it i cant tell you what wis can do but is will suckUFFFDtrust meUFFFD this is only a simple pretty game of internet space ships eve has no more potential than that if you dont play the game the way i do you have not business in being here my response isi want a bigger sand boxi want more tools to play withi want more things in eve i can doi want to plan for tomorrow because once today is over i will be board of the same meat and potatoes every nighti want choicesi want my game to change to grow not only out wards but inwards as welli want a universe to play in i want to feel a depth of experience where i can drill down from universe  region constellation solar system station inside a station inside a business inside the back room to the red chair which sits the villain which stole 4 million from me 3 years ago and play pokers and get the pink slip for his battle ship something very very personali want that bitter vet that left 4 years ago to come back and say this is not the eve i won when i left it is so new and different but still feels strangely familiarbut under no circumstances neglect or place only a skeleton crew on fis and the core of eve
the majority of these falls in the area of lasers and blasters which amar already havethough you do make a point mabey caldaris racial weapon should be switched with the ammarto late though
you really hate the amar dont you
but now you dont have to go turn on your defense mods just leave them running all the timealternatively if youre using that little cpu or pg downgrade to the next smaller size of tower if youre hardly making a dent in the pg and cpu of a small tower you need to use your towers for more of course the vast majority of players arent complaining because their towers are profitable enough that even if they werent fully utilizing the pg and gpu of the tower they can afford full usage maybe you should look into making your operation more profitable first instead of whining to ccp about a change that was announced well in advance of the actual implementation
i fixed your post
not always  ive got one thats not profitable with the changes it might break even  but even with the cost being less than profitable researching bpos with no wait and thus being able to bring things to market faster will continue to prove profitableand the corpies like it too works for me
from the numbers ive seen scrapyard bob throwing aroundin general the blocks make towers cheaper to run even if you werent using all the cpu and pg large towers are potentially a different story
great idea now that i think about it and it makes sense overall
and
this also there should be no concord in highsec incursion sites theyre supposed to be busy with the sansha after all
would it be appropriate to say bumps
seems a bit overblown
lol 00 is mostly what ccp worked on since eve openedmove alongbut heres a cookie
the fact that it has been ignored is probably a good indication that it is not nearly as terribad as you want to make it out to be prioritization of resources and alli am not sure what exactly you mean by lolcamps nor the difference between lolcamps and any other type of camps found in other areas since you seem think it matters significantly it would be helpful to clarify exactly what qualifications divide players shooting other players from pvp i am sure that given a sufficiently myopic view you are right i just dont know how tight i need to pull the blinders in order to see itjust in case you are insinuating that its all fluff numbers from smarty camps structure shooting and hauler kills i would suggest that you actually read the entirity of the thread
there is no good reason for low sec going ignored for so long thats the purpose of this thread and many other threads that have been asking for some well deserved dev attention 00 has all it needs for the moment with regards to game mechanics there is plenty to be gained by leaving high sec and going to null lots of incentives exists for making money pvp pve holding territory ect the reason people whine about 00 and why people dont want to go there is because what players have turned it into people arent willing to be worker bees or cannon fodder for big alliances that care little for themlow sec on the other hand has no rewards proportional to the risks for people living there people go to low sec to get kills against and get killed by pirates other than that theres nothing unique about low sec that you cant easily do in high or null
so lets seepeople can enjoy shooteverything pvp without the hassles of 00 ease of logisticsno bubbles sentry guns making fast lock frigates difficult to use these were things brought up earlier and without the hassles of territory holding ctas necessity of huge blobs etc your gripesbutthere is nothing unique about lowsecnow i would love it if i could have all the isk printing of 00 with none of the hassle just because i would like it doesnt mean it is a good idea though more importantly a discussion of rewards in lowsec have nothing to do with the opanyway back on topicop should change the words barrier to entry to barrier to exit technically there is very little barrier to entry something he himself notessecond op has left out some of the consequences of allowing anyone who is 001 to be shot at with no gate aggression this will decrease the amount of time highsec corps and weekend warrior type players spend in lowsecnot that i think the op really cares about that in the first place but maybe i am just being cynical
out of the myriad of fix low sec topics ive seen the past year this is one of the few i actually like you recognize the appeal of low sec and this idea should improve on what we already have there i fully support it
i thought of something similar just last night1
if you want to get pedantic it would be something of a barrier to staying without alts or the meanstime to recover sec quickly lowsec pvp becomes unsustainable in a short timebecause some people wont fight if they dont have npcs on their side maybe but those wouldnt gcc at all and so wouldnt lose sec but many would more than now and so the pure antipirate would have more targets available winwin so whats my hidden agenda thenwhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
1over
there are too many people who stay above 5 just so that frigates cant tackle them on gates by allowing anyone who is negative to be aggressed without sentry retaliation you have fixed this grevious exploit kudos even better is that you give a chance for noobs to play in lowsec gangs too having barely skilled noobs is fine if 23 of them can pin down ships on gates long enough for our tornados to lock from outside point range targets go boom noobs get to contribute and we stay safely out of point range1 to this idea and anyother idea that lets frigs and t1 cruisers aggress on gates
falseantipirates srsmimiru has basically pointed to the reason why highsec dwellers will have to spend more time in highsec they will have to keep thier sec rating positivei was giving you the benefit of the doubt i see i was wrong now
explain how if it involves corp logistics the only option i left out thats basically the corp leaderships altsnrds roleplayers fw from opposite sides teaming up to fight flashies industrial alliances thinking they are hardcore or just opportunistic pvpers who only shoot flashies they are everywhereno they wont have to they may choose to do so if they feel they need sentry protection theres two ways this can goeither there are so many new yellows that there are frigs on most gates then yes theres a strong incentive to be part of the positive sec minority since travel for you will be very safe but on the other hand you do have the option to engage those yellows whenever you want so you wont lack pvpor there is enough of a mix of yellowsnon yellows that camps still need to tank sentries in which case lowsec trave for the yellows is no more dangerous than it is today for outlaws and its not all that dangerouswhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
are you kidd ooooh i see you got me810
when i was a carebear we tried lowsec mining for a while it wasnt any more profitable than highsec mining carried a lot more risk and logistics were a nightmare still we went at it for about two months and here are some thoughts based on that1 lowsec needs more rare ore its currently just not profitable enough to mine lowsec versus highsec move all the medium ores everything but abc and the three most common to lowsec belts exclusivelygrav sites can stay the way they areto push more mining there and of course lots of people have suggested ice be moved entirely from high to low2 get rid of the inefficient refineries in lowsec stations we lost a lot of minerals when we finally gave up trying to import ore into highsec for refining and did it out there theres no point in those penalties and theyre just a hindrance to industrial efforts3 make it easier to set up and maintain a pos in lowsec the empires cant be bothered to patrol out there yet they can magically prevent you from setting up a pos without the proper standings and licenses
you are terrible at presenting any sort of pointhave to agree about the barrier to entrysupported

you edited my post to create a spelling error congratulations
new players can get the cerebral accelerator box editions are still out there they also start with all the points from the old learning skills a standard well balanced set of attributes and the tutorials give away skills and even ships at least tier one industrials cybernetics 1 gives you access to most of the learning implants the prices on 123s have come way down over the years oh plus two remapshonestly i think new players have it pretty goodmistakes will be made this is not because of attributes but because a player is newif you cant afford to lose two implants i dont know how you can afford to lose a ship or replace a clone why no one here is using 2s or 3s is beyond me if there isnt enough profit in nullsec that is the real issue btw not everyone in highsec has a full set of 5s some are smart and just use two at a time some just go for a 5 and a 4 still others dont see the benefit of an extra few hours a month and stick with 3s it is a choice everyone has to makei also keep hearing about barriers between fun but i disagree you can throttle attributes to train faster balance them to perception and intelligence to give the best overall training times or balance them out for all around decent training it lets you choose what you want to train faster lowering the barrier of fun granted you have to know about skills the game and how to play it well that goes for fittings tanking damage trading and anything else in eve if remaps were removed chances are we would end up training at a slower more general speed hurting players top training speed the barrier to fun would be increased if implants were less costly booster were introduced and new implants were released then the barrier to fun would be reduced

youre right it is theres also all manner of things that happen to chronicle the event in fact id say about 99 of all scuttled ships are recorded usually by the foe of said ship who watches it go underlike a killmail only its kept in the military history books
but how does being witness to a scuttling translate into being privy to all data concerning the ship immediately prior to the act hell they are still finding known scuttled wrecks from wwii with all sorts of gizmos and treasures that the observers were completely oblivious to remove insurance generate mail for selfdestructee remove popup notification of sd initiationalternativelyadditionally low chance of getting a copy of mail when salvaging wreck person must be deaggressed to initiate sdthe masssd of dreads you complain about is only tangentially related has a lot more to do with the way the address book system works solution five minute delay before the others ie not allianceecorp get online notification for entries in address bookhardly a coincidence that this complaint suddenly gets so much attention by eves premiUFFFDre epeen whores after the logoff evasion has been removed  well guess what logoffski abused a system designed to protect against power outages and whatnot ie oog events whereas sd uses system that is not only part of game but requires people to remain in game and that they take a quantifiable economic hitps mass logon of capitals that you describe should be deemed an exploit as it is for all intents and purposes a logon trap  only difference is that it is done with capitals since they dont have to be anywhere near the actual gank the tactic is condoned

i was being sarcastic
i realise that
luckily your antigoon crusade has made you even more unreliable and trollish than i am so thanks for your input but i think we can safely discredit anything you say in this thread plus you only have 300 likes

like system isnt going to work but some sort of qualification would be nice ether kills amout on research jobs ect
no it wouldnt it would be some kind of censorship and elitism that i dont want to see here if people are too engaged into one particular aspect they often become blinded to some of the flaws in the system so the input of a newbie might be much more useful than that of a vet occasionally at leastgranted that most of the suggestions are either trolling or incredibly stupid that is the cost we will have to pay for freedom of speechid like to apologize for the poor quality of the post above and sincerely hope you didnt waste your time reading it yes i do feel bad about it

can the csm request that ccp update the players on the future of incarnathere is degree of uncertainty about incarnaUFFFDs future given conflicting statements by ccp there is a lot of speculation and belittling of players that express an interest in incarna which is not helpful hilmar said in his letter to the players that incarna was an essential part of the future of eve then in a later interview said that UFFFDincarna was on ice and that we may get back to itUFFFDthis has created confusionit is also important to recognise that incarna in its current state does not represent the actual vision for this feature for reference look at previous fanfest videosthis is not a request that ccp drop everything that they are doing to focus on incarna what it is is a request that ccp provide clarity on the future of incarna recognising that it represents only one playstyle among the many possible in eve and worthy of further development just as those other playstyles are UFFFD and certainly should not be abandonedso my specific request to the csm is that they ask ccp to clarify what is going to happen with incarna is it not going to be looked at for 12 months will the multiplayer establishments arrive during this periodthanks
i see no problem with this like it or not incarna is part of eve now and there is a reasonable contingent that wants to see it iterated on i hope that with the focus on development shifted back to eve ccp will be able to continue to appeal to the fis people while continuing to improve on the incarna experience for those players that are interested in it as long as the future developments to incarna are in line with the general ethos of eve im all for seeing something interesting come out of it itd be good to get an idea of whether or not wis is completely on halt or simply working with a reduced staff
i would also like ccp to clarify the status and future plans for wis
theres a future for incarna
plain and simple guys  ccp  up with the way they rolled out incarna in allowing the fis stuff to stagnate for about two years hence the 18 months meme from a number of the vets they nearly completely halted iterating on incarna and wod for the moment because they realised that they were in a very tenuous place with eve and thus with all their other plans so did a very quick turnaround and gave us crucible crucible is seriously their plan b release done in a few weeks to make people happy again hell look at the trailer even  its reminiscent of eve never fades and some of the other great trailers of old  they even went so far as to use fraps captures of the game rather than the prerendered cinematic trailers that theyve been doing since dominion likely what well see happen is a focus on fis and a lot of the things that have been broken for a long time for the next 23 patch cycles with maybe some wis stuff thrown in as well whatll likely happen is 18 months of neglect for wis beyond simple things and then afterwards a balanced wisfis approach thereafter
have no fear i am sure that ccp is working very hard with the csm to improve 00
incarna was an expansion it camethats that what the question should be iswhat is the future of wis
however you want to articulate the question is fine the point is that we want clarification
your own fault but still supportedfirst offense should carry very little sec penalty which get exponentially higher on subsequent offense in highsec penalty remains flat at initial small amount in lowsec
bullcrapif its like any other device of any kind you got 1 warning when you initially triggered it and chose to ignore for any number of random reasonsheck even a smart bomb triggers an warning even if theres nothing near by to strikeand if this is your first time getting concordokened then you dont have alot to throw a fit aboutthis has to be a stealth thread for nerfing concord or a trollthread stop the evemail spam
my first experience with concord was when i tried to kill a mining ship of some sort with my thrasher i thought i could kill it and get away before concord showed up i was wrong on both counts id been playing for maybe 24 hours at that point and no i have nothing constructive to say about this proposal
there should be a tutorial mission which warps you somewhere and shows you a popup click ok to have your ship destroyed click cancel to continue if you click ok you get promptly blown up in whatever ship you are no refunds the mission restarts and you cant continue until you complete it maybe that would teach people to read
i wouldnt object to the notion that repeat offenders should lose more sec status it would mirror the way we treat reallife criminalsthat said i do find it a little troubling that its possible to draw concord without a warning ccp has several times made changes in order to prevent people being surprised by aggression or gcc and this is an instance that might warrant a look edit it seems other people have had warnings when they fired aoe weapons if thats the case i have no sympathy for the op
i once had an member that fired a smart bomb edit forgot to mention it was a navy issue megathornedit with a warning issued only to get concorded due to fireing one at a an asteriod in a missioni was equally warned repeatedly for each time i fired a smart bomb for grins in various areasthe op is trollingits way too obviousif it was that big of a deal it would be a rampant outcry from various sourcesnot some face in the crowd stop the evemail spam
years ago i fired an aoe and immediately got blasted obvious and reasonable no complaints there here no damage of any kind was doneseems some people cant read  i received no warning and ive disabled no aggression popup windows multiple complaints concord over reacted to the use of a nondestructive device many hours worth of security standing lost in a first time offence

23 hours of sp for attending a mass test i wouldnt care a person attending every single one would get one day ahead of someone who doesnt over the course of one year i probably lose more sp than that due to getting podded and needing new implants or forgetting to update my queue the efforts of these people make the game better for everyone although i agree that aur or perhaps a unique vanity shirt would be betterrewards for reporting bugs no please the last thing a programmer wants to do is to dig through fifty thousand bug reports saying my ship no work

people would make the calculation and weigh the cost versus the benefit they get to make the decisionit does not remove all riskwhy should ships be the only way to close a wormhole
it does a pack of these could insta pop any hole they wanted to align wh with celestial approach drop bomb warp off no risk
the wormhole collapses due to mass being transferred through it youre asking for a bomb that would close a wormhole without pushing mass through itthe only way i can see this being even remotely balanced is by making the bombs so costly to produce that it would cost hundreds of millions to close the smallest wormholes
the only problem i have with cloaking is that it makes you 100 safecloaking roam run into something you cant beat that has you trapped down a pipe cloak upwant to take an afk break in the middle of hostile space cloak upwant to camp out someone elses system in a t2 frigate and not get shot at by their home defense fleet cloak upcant fight someone who is just better at flying than you are cloak upsmall gang jumps into local while you are ratting  mining cloak up id give cloaked ships a very small sig radius so that people could track you down using the little probing mini gamei have also seen suggestions for a cloaking fuel bay that would run out in 23 hours but that would only really fix the afk cloakingby the way as a bit of space street cred my old corp was pretty damn successful at being dicks with cloaks

i think ccp needs to seriously rethink microtransactions  vanity items would be fine as would some wis items if that ever comes to be but the pricing needs to be retooled completely 65 bucks for a fancy pixel eye patch is insane but we shouldnt have to keep repeating this topic over and over the actions of this past summer should speak for its self

emphasized the important part of the statement crucible is not the csm how many people would have resubscribed if the csm is not as it is now truly well never know for sure leaving lots of leverage for guesswork
crucible is a laundry list of changes proposed and developed by the csm this is the only expansion so far that has directly been the result of csm recommended changes and surprise surprise people are resubbing in massive numbers perhaps this csm actually works and makes the game enjoyablebut im just blueskying here im sure its all a goonie conspiracy and were all out to ruin everything for everyone
crucible is the embodiment of the sixth csms insistence on a focus on fis without the csm its pretty damned likely that this expansion would have just been incarna 20 its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar

i realize that youre a moron but you have to give the csm credit for many of the crucible changes most notably supercapital balancing or are you bitter about that particular aspecti mean if the csm was so useless why the hell would you be making such terrible posts about them its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i realize that youre a troll but for the benefit of the othersyes im willing to give csm vi credit for nerfing supercaps pos fuel pellets and time dilation none of which are what the vast majority of players are happy about the mass unsubscriptions get credit for everything else most notably the fact that this expansion was overwhelmingly a fis expansion  ccp watched what we did unsubscribed in droves they didnt listen to what csm vi saidand if you werent trolling and had read the op youd know i didnt say the csm was so useless let me try again to the limited extent to which this pathetic excuse for a csm has achieved any tangible results they have represented their own selfish narrow interests to the detriment of the game
why are you unhappy about these things they own its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i believe it would be enough already if the acceptance of the application requires a session changebut the old mechanic has to go away anyway because its seriously flawedanyway writing without being seen in localoverview is the wrong wordingbecause hes seeable in localon overview but hes not seen as flashy redbig difference
session change and can only fight 30 minutes after being accepted
how about just requirement of being docked to be accepted you cant leave a corp without docking either afaik
its currently against the rules petition when it happensas for fixing it require that they dock up to complete the application the game already requires that you be docked to apply this would just add an extra step you dock up and apply to a corporation that corp reviews your app and if it is accepted you are sent an offer for lack of a better term you dock up and accept the offer you are now a member of the corp and can immediately begin doing anything any other member of the corp can do
i think the meta or political side of the game needs to be introduced to newer players even a short video that plays in the cq or something introducing the various areas in space and how and why players fight over them maybe a tutorial mission that sends them to a random nearby lowsec system to fetch something would help newer players get over the lowsec is scary feeling give them the lowdown on how to travel safely though lowsec its very hard to get nabbed in a frigate in lowsec
the ui does need to be redone it needs to be done very carefully though bring in ui experts take your time dont try and cram it into one release cycle if it wont fit eve is a ui heavy game i dont think there is a way to get around that but i think it could look better and be more streamlined at the same time
i think csm should take a look at the features  ideas discussions on daily bases there there are allot of complains and sugestions about all sort of eve features and since noone from the dev teams take care of that part of the forum i think you guys could have a use for it new pos system new sov system
i would really like to see remodeling of the ugly ship models dominix moa aeon and probably a few others the first three at least are a real eyesorethe maller remodeling was nice
in order do whatever has to be done so poss can be redone most pos owners would take a bunch of featureless grey blocks at this point streamline corpalliance interface into something like windows server 2003in space so that role management isnt a second job modernize ui appearance addition font options classic serif modern comic sans etc
oh heres another  make it so when you kill a capital ship its replaced with a model of the burnt destroyed version of the wrecked ship instead then work your way down thatd be pretty cool as far as the goal of immersion goes

no that would make the markets a lot less interesting and made trading and shipping far less interesting as occupationsthen you can stop right therethis again seriously cloaking isnt going away i want a covops battlecruiser not less cloakingpick an implant use it want faster learning give up isk and combat bonuses want the best combat bonuses slower learning its a choice dont take it away
bumping this back up to the top of this section
any faction warfare little things you fix now without the overhaul will end up like the new plexing mechanic an easy exploit you can now flip a system in under 2 days and when your faction is full of non pvp oriented mission bears you cant get any one orginized to stop it oh wait it still doesnt matter weather or not your stop it you can still go and mission from it you still get your stuff and only a single name change happens when it flips seriously they could dedicate two expansions to the problems it has ie lack of purpose to plexing fail reward system that encourages not pvping auto entry and lack of spai removal ect ect ectfirst step is get them to release the vision that was fw at the begining and tell us why it didnt happen you know that mythical communication we heard so much about and the blog that was supposed to come out after the gaffe during fan fes im done now
agreed any negativepositive effects should be clearly displayed on your ship fittings window also
and thats where the second part of my posting comes in as soon as you have the skills trained to v  and people will do it  its either it never works if defensive skills are stronger or it always works offensive skills are stronger and people robbing me blind just because im offline and cant retaliateno thanks
stop posting nonsens than make beter proposil to get ppl back to 00 even with curent all pach good tings i dont see 00 population increase
they did boost exploration maybe you should take a good look at the patch notes oh and learn how to spell use grammer and maybe proper english toothey just didnt boost your silly havensanctum carebear easymode money makingas a low sec explorer im enjoying the fruits of this boost immensely and just wishing i lived in a different low sec region
allready done but actualy i not saa eny boost for now there not more sites not les sites the same sites almost in the same sstems where usualy they spawn afcors for explarotion testing need more site to see the stabilty off sites and stabilty off outome from them that way io not talking about exploration ok i wil keep tesiting exploration let see wath wil come out for now how far i scaned its araund 2 sites per constelation but not stable ones if you run out there will be not next imn place i personaly wuld low that that wuld be the same as hiden belts you scan out one shoot it and get faction loot or not get faction loot then after some time 30 min or 1 hour in the same sytems spawns next one and so one that boters cant get get to easy money pritning
you might want to aquaint yourself with fanfest videos from previous years you will see that there is indeed support for walking in stations and the vision ccp had for it most of the complaints against incarna were against its implementation single room and nex store not the original design intentplayers want walking in stations not the incomplete feature that we gotlearn the difference

dont bother responding to zircon hes made it clear hes just a mindless nullbear who thinks eve is all about his playstyle that and hes really really bad at presenting arguments does he even have one
i live in nullsec i simply think that this is a good idea where someone resides in a vidya game has zero weight on their opinion zircon is a moron on his own accord
cool i see this thread has found its troll i guess thats a sure sign its a good idea  i especially like the fact he still hasnt explained why he claims lowsec is sustainable without alts or recovering sec despite being asked toabout the lowsec mining stuff im not so sure it would entice many miners to lowsec certainly not the casual miners that do a large amount of highsec mining anyway what it would do is make lowsec mining an absolute necessity for production which will lead to the price of everything going up since the only people able to produce this ore are those that are capable of defending mining operations in my experience of miners very few have the ability or the inclination to do that im not so sure thats a good idea unless of course youre in the minority that reckons they are able to successfully defend lowsec mining operations and fancy some higher profits pas for negative sec people being shootable without gate aggro i really dont think thatll be a problem for the average highsec dweller who goes to lowsec occasionally if you live in highsec and are into shooting stuff chances are you spend most of your time pveing if the lowest your sec could drop from lowsec pvp was 199 then highsec pve being your main activity will quite quickly work off that hit even if you go on a total bender since part of the proposal was that shooting someone with negative sec has no repercussion the only reason your sec would ever drop would be if you were shooting people with positive sec anyway basically this would be turning antipiracy from a bit of rp fluff into a semiprofession thats actually supported by game mechanics
im not saying people who live in 00 do not have valid opinions but zircon is just one of those bleating lambs who wants the devs attention to be on all null sec all the time he came into a thread about a low sec fix trying to champion 00 buffs
as being someone who lived 2 years as 10 it isnt hard to supply yourself without an alt yes i had a hauler but i can count the number of times i used it to bring me supplies on one hand maybe i was lucky though i was able to keep stocked from loot the occasional foray onto the market and working out deals with friends then again i set up some nice relationships after ransoming a few haulers not everyone honors ransoms though so maybe they dont get that benefitwhen i decided to leave low it sure was a pita grinding up sec would not having to bother with that been nice sure if i had not been lazy i would have never been in that position in the first place it is pitifully easy to keep your sec up if you are not camping gates for haulers and you work solo the sec hit you get from fights where the other person shoots back is minimal that is why i am not sure there is any real incentive for weekend warriors those players tend to be running around solo or in 23 man gangsthe people i do see this helping are those corporations who want to engage in poscentric activities without living in low and those corps who need highsec access so they can shoot wts but who want to go to low when things get slow the first group i may have some sympathy for defending a pos will result in sec hits making things easier for them to mitigate those hits is something i am on the fence about the latter group i have no sympathy fortbh i think there are two questions i have not seen brought up thoughfirst why would making more people flashy boost pvp when people cant or wont shoot red flashies already the gate guns wont shoot you if you make a move on a red flashy nor do you get a sec hit but almost nobody engaged me when i was 10 that wouldnt have engaged me if i 5 making a mechanic that nobody takes advantage of seems kind of pointless so maybe i am missing something second why does everyone insist that low sec needs more pvp it already accounts for 30 of pvp in the game hotzones already rival the 00 hotzones in terms of average killsday and even the quiet systems see more traffic than the quietest 00 systems all the verifable data says that low is doing just fine even though all the forum warrior data tells a different story until someone can answer the last question i wont support any boost low sec111 thread
ive spent about 25 years in metropolissinq laison low sec and from my experience a lot of people dont necessarily think that low sec needs more pvp its just that the pvp that exists needs to be less of a hassle to maintain as things are now if you want to play eve as an exclusive or almost pvper it is very hard to sustain yourself without good corp logistics an alt becomes a necessity even for things like spare mods and ammo much less ships then there is the issue of income the way player loot drops can either make your day or ruin your week depending on how the loot fairy is feeling so it cant be relied upon for consistent income if there was a way an pvper could make isk just through pvp then i think youd see a lot less low sec whines it could be something like a pirate corp getting sponsored by npc pirates that places bounties on positive sec players that is just an example ofc there are a great many ways ccp could make piracy and more casual low sec pvp a self sustaining activity people dont like being shoehorned into a play style in order to sustain the one they enjoy
1 supported this would be amazing agree with 5 minute gcc in lowsec too
some that seem concerned this idea prompts inexperienced pilots to dip their toes in pvp waters enmasse others voice their worries that low sec will be transformed from the tranquil occasionally hostile backwater it is now in to a zoo of spaceweaponfiring activityto them i say goodyes im biased towards small gangs but what id really like to see are more fights im fully behind any mechanic that encourages pvp let the lowsec arena begin
on the whole i think this is a good idea however it does feel like a bit of a slap in the face for those who are currently 10 as a result of actions that would be effectively decriminalised under the new system
its easy for the dedicated player not so much for the more casual ones i have no problem with it myself even when im not outlaw i use hauler alts to bring me the stuff for the most part but when i was running corp logistics youd be surprised how many people complained about having to bring their own mods in when we already provided the hulls and a 100k sp alt in a frigate can bring fittings for several shipsthats a different point but the way sec and aggression works is unbalanced it only works in 1v1 with two gangs shooting each other only 2 primaries will be taking fire at any given time so anyone who is not primaried will get the full sec hitpeople do it ok yes theres a lot of puzzling people who go to lowsec in pvp fit ships but dont engage anything its a mystery but others are happy toin any case the main point of the proposal is the cap on sec loss so people can dip in and out of lowsec without having to rat their brains out the second part making more people flashy was actually to keep the one advantage being 10 has now the chance of getting the occasional sentryfree fightthat only tells me that 00 needs some fixing too but im curious about the distribution of those kills how many of those kills are from pure gatecamps how many are concentrated in the fw areaslowsec is not as broken as other people want you to believe i enjoy it more than i do 00 gangs but the fun memorable fights are not common enough i just want to turn it up a bit get more random small gangs coming throughwhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
man i love it when the ladies gush on and on about me after i leave 3 to you all too but it is not meant to be my spaceboyfriend would be really mad
last i heard lowsec still required starbase charters and empire standings to anchor a pos the same as 05  07 ive always wonderedwho enforces that since there are no patrols by the empire
i live in empire and think all 00 logistics should have to be done with frieghters derpignorance makes it easy to think bad ideas are really good
they do not require standings and charters
this was only in 04 not in deeper lowsec and it was removed 23 expansions agowhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
maybe if you read the the link you would have figured out the obvious low sec doesnt need to be fixed all this thread wants is consequence free pvp without going to 00 if this thread asked for something reasonable like decreasing the granularity in the multiplier i would have supported it this idea is  though it is not in keeping with eve philosophy it does nothing to incentize the groups it claims to incentivize and gives the i want eve to be fps crowd cookies
oh finally you gave something ressembling a reasoningthere is no consequence free pvp in eve ship losses take care of that but ignoring that id argue why lowsec should have those consequences and not highsec wardecs or 00 ratter ganksdo elaborate pleasewhy does eve philosophy apply to lowsec but not highsec or 00removing a punishment is pretty much the same as adding an incentivemmm cookieswhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
with the exception of me calling troll the reasons are there are you suggesting that i need to spoon feed more i still call troll btw plenty of people live pvp in lowsec without relying on alts to feed them ships and modulesif you are shooting wts then there is no consequence in lowsec eitherwhat part is unclearshoot non wts in highsec what happens to your security the gradual diminuation of severity as system security decreases is constant so what are you on aboutedit inappropriate part removed ccp phantom
figures it was a 04 i was trying to set up in and it probably got patched away shortly after and i missed it in the patch notesstill some documentation i read somewhere gave me the idea it was all lowsec that needed chartersanother case of eve utterly lacking good clear documentation and relying on fan sites to provide users with information
you still havent said how i have given the reasons why its not feasible prove me wronglets start with the granularity of which multiplierits not really constant in highsec you lose ship and sec in lowsec you lose sec and risk losing your ship try engaging in a frig under sentries in 00 you get neitherso if you remove the punishments from pvp you wont get carebears to pvp but some of the closet pvpers who run back to highsec every time they approach 2 will stay in lowsecedit inappropriate part removed ccp phantomwhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
you replied to a post that showed how ffs loot market industrial corps and traders friends this thread is about sec status right might i be speaking of the multiplier to sec loss well since you stated you were ignoring ship losses and a generous context to the entire thread is sec status it is constant so again what are you on aboutthis seems like a strange justification if they are running back to highsec because thier sec status is low but would stay if thier sec status was not in danger then i can only surmise that you think they are going back to highsec to gain sec no doubt some people will but only because they do not know it is faster to grind in lowsec it seems more probable that they are going back to highsec because they think they can make more isk there if this is correct then they will not stay in lowsec any longer than they already do
the first two have no guarantee they will have what you need industrial corps will happily provide you with ships in highsec next door to low admitedly last time i tried this black frog didnt exist friends is just someone elses alts try it sometime youll see how it goesmaybe its faster but im not so sure finding bs rats is very hit or miss not like 00 and obviously isk does come into the equation you can try ratting in up in lowsec take 10 hours and make 100 mil or do it semi afk in highsec take 20 hours but make 600 milif they go back to highsec when they run out of isk thats fine by me its no different than a 10 logging off his main and grinding missions on an alt for a bit its being sent back to highsec for being successful thats sillywhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
hardly their 10 is a lifestyle choicefield of trolls if you chum it they will come
as a side note sentries not having tracking is rather unfair to frigcruiser pilotsand nullsec pvp is problematic at best for casual types getting bubbled and podded repeatedly andor getting crap dropped on your head by exsovholders who seem to have a penchant for fleeing to npc null never mind the kind of hornets you can stir up in other folks sovspace
unless the primary in your gang is flashy the entire opposing gang is able to be aggressed without penalty since the people who bounce between high and low are by definition those who are not 5 this is not an issue in small gang fights so much if you want to aggress haulers mission runners people who want to run away etc obviously everyone gets the sec hit i am not sure this is bad maybe i just do not fit in with current eve culture but to me it seems like a good thing to penalize a shoot everything that moves policy within empire especially since there are several other areas of the game where that penalty does not exist nor is it a particularly onerous penalty with a little forethoughtin regards to the statistics i mentioned i do not know for sure about how many are camps i tracked average kills day for about two month using dotlan info i kept both a log of random systems and standard hot systems hed amamake etc obviously the fw areas saw an increase over nonfw but the randomized system list showed that low sec was pretty competative the bottom rung low sec systems still saw more jumps per week than 00 again these were averaged numbers so that single large fleet engagements would scew the picture less the general picture you get from ccp devblog fits with what i gathered on my ownps speaking from experience ratting sec up in low sec is way faster than doing the l4 mission tour if you spend 10min setting things up right in a series of connected systems
well since friends cant count because it is someone elses alt then black frog cant count because they use alts and buying anything from highsec hubs cant count because the traders are alts that got goods from other alts and those goods were made by mission runnersmining alts and industrial alts oh noes i get it nao everyone who is not you is an alt or maybe you should get out moreactually i have been profiting off it for about 2 years now thanks
of course the goons in null and their 2 month old playerbase are going to push this this is only a benefit to null groups who dont normally use implants due to the risk which is what i thought the game was about sadly enough and i hate to use the term its null sec carebearing they cant use implants their low sp playerbase which goons are known for doesnt use them due to risk so hey lets all push getting rid of them and up the learning speed 5x its bogus and a misuse of the what the csm was created for especially as the csm including null sec in general is just a joke nowadays tell you what ccp make this change and advance every older player their 5x accelerated learning from the past 8 years next years proposal get rid of sp everyone can use everything pfft get realgoons proceed to trollthrow out cornball insults endrantoh yea lets get rid of remaps as well
double post
are you care bears kidding me they dont discourage anyone from anything you want to jump clone out to another clone somewhere else put the same implants in that clone and you dont lose anything it makes null sec more costly thats the entire point of this game the risk in this game is what makes it fun you want to play where the big boys play you are going to have to take bigger risks and possibly lose more isk deal with it you want a game where dying doesnt have any consequences go play wow 34 out the crap in this game is indeed trivial but that is what makes eve what it is that is why we all love playing this game because it isnt easy all this does is make the game easier for new players which coincidentally is generally what goonswarm is made of honestly this is a blatant move for them to get ahead in this game if ccp really goes along with this then they need to pull their balls out of their  and get off goons junk eve is difficult eve makes you take risks and pay for your mistakes that is why we all play it and enjoy playing it imo this game has never been about making life easier for the new player but about the gratification you get when you find your feet this is just another step in taking that away
and that is all this was about time to start imposing 1 term limits alil ridiculous when the head of one of the largest alliances can keep getting himself voted in especially when the majority of posters are goons
side note to those btching about jump clones they are meant to be there as a minor convenience not as a form of fast travel being able to jump around the galaxy at will without haveing to take the risk of physically traveling from a to b would severely hamper pvpjust because you guys dont have the gohanes to take a risk doesnt mean the game is flawed it just means you dont know how to play that well yes at times things can be inconvenient get over it and go do something else in game its not like this game is onedimensional
facepalmyou gotta be  kidding meso because nullsec players are too cheap to fly with them the people who arent get screwed  5 implant sets are expensive so why exactly would you think that people wouldnt be pissed about losing them  why should we be out hundreds of millions of isk so that we can lessen the gap between new and old players i had to work my ass off for enough money to get my first set of 5 implants a few years back i fail to see why a brand new player should have the same attributes as me right out of the gate one of the things that attracted me to this game in the first place was the complexity of what eve online really is i understood that i was sorely out classed by the older players of the game and knew that i would have to work hard in this game to be able to compete you know what i enjoyed every minute of it i had a sense of accomplishment in training my learning skills and buying my first set of 5 implants this game is starting to stray away from that everyone thinks they should be in the biggest ship in the least amount of time this game should never be about people being the best they can be without any of the work if you do that then eve is no longer eve its just whats left over of a game that used to be great also i dont feel that you should be able to train your alts up with all the sp boosts you would get from 5 implants without having to spend the money for them if your lazy and dont want to spend the time making the isk for them buy plex if your worried about losing them in 00 then maybe 00 isnt the place for you if your that worried about losing implants them your obviously not going to fly any ships that actually cost some real isk i have nothing against goons or mittani personally but this is an idea i can in no way support i do see a mass of goons supporting this idea for whatever reason but if you guys want to be in 00 then you should have to take the bad with the good null is supposed to be a dangerous place a lawless place it shouldnt be a place where you no longer care about getting podded because implants have been removed from the game in 00 having implants means you have more incentive to win a fight if you have a jc then jump to it so you wont lose them and take the hit to your sphour i would however support a timer change on jump clones take the timer down from 24 hours to 12 hours that is something i could get behind
tldr i want zero loss when i get podded but also all the benefits of 5s at no cost
replace them with more combat and useful implants so that people will still get podded with 100m implant sets if they want to win at war problem solved
goons dont use hardwiring for their drakes
i dont know if you are being clever or mentally challenged510
im roleplaying a goon silly put yourself in the shoes of a goon what would you do
the noname forum alts are so adorable its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
the last batch of rageposts were awesome keep them comingbe sure to vomit words all over because your spelling grammar and style is still at the primary school level and use plenty of ad hominems to show how bad this proposal is because goons its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
look how dumb you are its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
lmao its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
lol if look how dumb you are is the best retort you have i think this battle of wits goes to him
i dont engage in battles of wit with cowards hiding behind forum alts its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i disagree if you are too scared to lose them you shouldnt buy them in the first place risk vs reward i doubt that eliminating learning implants is going to get people to go on more fleets they will just find another lame excuse not to go should we also eliminate pirate faction battleships because people in 00 are too scared to fly them 
they do if they train cybernetics and run missions to get the isk there is no reason you should have everything handed to you just because your a noob
that is part of the risk of living in an area with no law why exactly shouldnt there be disadvantages to living in 00  seeming that the pros far outweigh the cons not to mention that if someone jcs to highsec before an op they are morons plain and simple if someone jcs to highsec to train in 5 implantswell they can do that sitting in any one of your numerous station systems
im saying that new players dont follow hyperoptimized skillplans focused on two attributes only buy what you need doesnt really apply its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
can you tell me the pros of living in nullsecincreased income highsec l4s and incursions have marginally lower payouts with substantially decreased risksafe secure sov space sure and the risk of losing everything when you lose your space and it gets trapped in a station with no way out but spies or retaking its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
that is very true however if they join a corp or alliance instead of sitting in noob corp forever they could learn from more experienced players that was how i learned to play this game when i first joined if your talking about what is best for new players then we need to consider a way to teach them to play and how to train skills not eliminate parts of the game to make life easier for them
honestly you should know what your doing before you blindly remap the point of remapping is to gain a bonus to something while taking a penalty on another thing if you dont know how remapping works you probably shouldnt be doing it
meh give everyone permanent 5s and i wont complain
because no one is sneaky in eve amiritegosh you are soooo cool for being a nullbear ranger living a life of virtual danger and calling people cowardsin a video gamefield of trolls if you chum it they will come
im on the fence about this proposal i dont want to see eve made too easy but im all for faster training times via an attribute boostthough i will chime in to say that seeing all these forum warriors post with alts is pretty funny
ah thats what they call it nowadays its not aversion to being known as a terrible poster youre just being sneaky its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
no but new players are also generally using 3s at most have poor attribute maps i know i did and arent generally operating on anything resembling a plan if were going to base everything in this on what players do in their first few months ive got some suggestions
lawls in any case its internet spaceshipz and some guy hiding behind a pc calling me a coward doesnt offend me  if perhaps the topic of discussion was getting rid of forum alts then i or anyone else would care about your weak comeback in this case it isnt its about goons seemingly trying to ruinkill the very game they play its sad on the matter of cowards grow a pair and buy some 5s if you are living in null problem solved perhaps this noname forum alt should run for csm p if any of you want to ps and moan about forums alts then post another topic and maybe ccp can try what blizzard tried make everyone post with their real name forum would probably be barren of insults then happy holidays
visual skill trees ala diablo 2 without needing evemon would be pretty cool for newbies right now its just a bunch of books and show info

dear sirwhile it would be beyond my good manners to say so directly i have read other people express negativity towards your posting style and i cannot help but notice that this particular post is illustrative of a few elements which could very easily be the cause of that please do not take my words unkindly i am from the internet and i am here to help you get better if you will let me if you reread what you have posted you will notice a sort of wandering and disorganized style to what you have said moreover you go for the cheap lowbrow insults that no one finds endearing or entertaining if you would permit me to be so bold might i suggest that you frame future posts in the form of paragraphs and that you either use separate paragraphs or individual posts to deliver each stinging insult alternately one could be more kind to ones fellow forum users and abstain from direct insults entirely which is the route i elect you might choose to focus your arguments directly on your detractors own claims rather than engaging in an ad hominem against him this will not only keep you from being labeled a nasty man but will also positively label you as someone who has a smattering of knowledge concerning the proper construction of a rhetorical debateall my lovelyris reddit lyrisnairn skype lyrisnairn twitter lyrisnairn
i think if we all followed lyriss advice we would turn out to be veritable spacevirgils or galactichomers i take my hat off to you
i have no problem with this slight modification but you should be aware that i have several circle jerkers following my posting whom are not in my corporation alliance or even coalition i suppose you could call them subscribers to my posts would you consider their likes to also be exempt were we to extend this to its logical conclusion what if i were to amass more than half of active forum readers as my subscribers what if i had literally all of it how and where do you draw the line from circle jerks to this guy is an amazing poster reddit lyrisnairn skype lyrisnairn twitter lyrisnairn
and what about lyris who benefits from bothawesome posters who happen to be in the center of a circle jerk eww end up with far more likes than us common folk yet we cant penalize them for being so awesome they have an alliance full of groupies
i support this proposal it is a fantastic ideai am going to start liking all my posts with my 5 alts now so i can be ready for the changesarcasmno
lucky no one cares what you think
likewise

our alliance suffered two keylogger attacks this week while we expected ccp to fix the damage they told our guys that ccps policy is to only give players back the isk for which the items were sold not the items themselves and not their fair market value ccps reasoning is that to make proper reparations would negatively affect the server economyin reality ccps standing policy is a big handout to isksellers all they need to do to take advantage is to place really low buy orders in a handful of places hack the targeted accounts and sell off their t2 ships minerals and pos fuels to make their billions the offending account will get banned but the buyers accounts will rake in the profit without ever falling under scrutiny the current policy therefore aids isksellers while harming honest paying customersi would like ccp to release data on how many keylogged former customers have quit eve in disgust over this policy and i would like to see ccp revise the policy so it no longer benefits people committing felonies in the real world and disrupting our game community after all you try telling a police officer who arrests you for grand larceny i cant help get back the mercedes i stole because it would negatively affect the black market try it i dare youin the civilised world stolen property is confiscated and returned to its owner while those found in possession of stolen property have criminal charges filed against them why should ccp policy not reflect thousands of years of law enforcement wisdomas far as i can tell the only reason is that ccp does not want to do the work of fixing these problems but there are a number of simple steps that ccp could take to make the game more secure from keyloggers first we could have the option to anchor our email that way when a keylogger tries to change an accounts email address he gets blocked and his ip gets banned second in both of our alliances instances the keyloggers logged into the account while it was being played actively this knocking it offline from another ip address considering this is a blatant violation of the eula ccp could write simple code to autoban the account in these instances and then unban it once the customers computer is securerevising the policy need not drain time and money from ccp but the current policy is offensive to your dedicated customer base its high time the policy was revisitedjm
it is completely in your power to prevent yourself from being a victim of a keylogger i dont see how thats ccps fault
i was about to post the exact same thing but the forum ate my post stop buying isk and visiting illegit sites and you wont get keylogged
agreed against op if you arent responcibile with your accountplacing blame on the system to recover it isnt going to cover it up stop the evemail spam
all i did was downloaded the update to adobe flash player it installed a 3rdparty toolbar without my knowledge the toolbar then installed the trojanbut this is not about me wanting isk back the policy ccp has for dealing with it encourages isk selling and benefits isk sellers while hurting those of us who play the game honestly i have bought 2 plexs in my entire 5 years as ccp can confirmthe policy needs to change so isk sellers are not compensated for committing criminal actsjm
p sure that the flash updates give you a check here if you dont want our 3rd party crap box
lol and from whre did you get a flash update that instals 3rd party toolbars not from adobe site for sure pon a more serious note i kind off partially agree that more account security should be in place but you resoning is little off for example email adress why should i not be able to change email adress a legitimate player wantig to change his own acc mail get bannedor auto banning for loging from different ip you know we have those ip changing internet providers right mine resets connection every 24 hours and gets me new ip in process imagine this happening on a laggy cluster where server will not notice me loosing connection before i log back from different ipsoooo yes for more security in place  things like banks have or whatever but not what you are proposingand for market orders right now i can tell you ow a creative player can make huge billions if ccp will act the way you propose with stollen stuff and money but i hope you can figure out for yourselfread and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
last time i used adobes flash installer on their site it offered google toolbar that said gt isnt likely to come packing a trojan keyloggermore could be done to make it harder to switch emails such as sending a mail to the current email address on file and waiting 7 days to fully transfer but youre right that preventing it entirely means students with university emails would lose access to their eve account upon graduation bad ideasome people play from more than one location home school work a friends house whatever
autoinstall was hackedthats not what i said i said you should have the option to anchor your email if you dont want you dont have tonevertheless there are many solutions ccp could and should look at currently they are focusing on game content while a new wave of keylogging attacks is spreading across the game
the nonreplacement  nonreimbursement policy does encourage the behaviour that jehan is asserting exploits occur all the time in all areas of software id feel more comfortable with my two accounts and all the time and money i invest in the game that i dont get the kind of treatment that two members of my alliance have recieved from ccp with regard to their handling of these issues blame the victim seems to be the going theme of a few people here enjoy a lonelier dogeatdog and soon to be dead mmo if that continues some technologies to force a single step of authentication with a browser to enable logging in from a different pc to your account would be a trivial and high value enhancement to the game look at xbox app activations or just the other examples of banking system logins etc it wouldve stopped both of these types of attacks coldccp shouldnt be prickish about peoples hard earned stuff when the investigation shows theres scams like this that hit them
1i dont see any counter arguments to this at all does anyone see a way in which this is broken or bad
i support this product andor service
be reassured that chairman for life mittens will soon be working with ccp to bring changes to highsec as well
come back in 18 months thank you have a nice day
im going to go ahead and assume that since you have nothing better to do than come here with your dumb remark that you have run out of things to do in eve therefore some sort of expansion perhaps involving walking in stations might help alleviate your boredomyour welcome
unless youve disabled warnings there should have been a warning if things did in fact happen to you as you describe then thats a bug petition it that said since there is a warning you should already be aware of the consequences when you activate the module so no change or leniency is needed
it is very difficult to know where to begin here first off i suggested a number of ways that these bombs could work one of which was a half life method that would remove a fraction of the current total mass and therefore could never actually close it if these bombs are expensive then the diminishing return would mean that people would likely just use them to get a head start on closing a hole this directly addresses your objection secondly a pack of orcas can destroy a hole in the time it takes for the session change timer to run down warp them through and youll be able to warp back before your cloak wears off less than a minute closed hole guaranteed is this objectionable i can only guess the scenario you imagine is of someone dropping combat scanner probes the second local lights up locating the wormhole and warping to it then destroying an orca or two before their session timers wind down and they jump back through the hole this does not insta pop wormholesthe wormholes that people travel through are really just colorful facades put over the exact same code that governs stargates the thing that closes wormholes is a variable in a ccp database on a server in london the reason why mass and time are currently the only ways to close a wormhole is because those are the only two things that affect that particular variablenow as a practical matter i do agree with you firing a bomb of any existing type at a wormhole will have no effect because as you point out these methods do not degrade wormholes however ccp can create items that would affect them that is what i am proposing a new way to affect these variables
the only way i could get behind this is if it randomized the collapse of a wh to the extent that after one of the bombs hits it you have no indication whatsoever on how much mass it takes to close the wh it could be a frigate it could be an orca and anyone using that wh does so at severe peril of it being a oneway trip personally i think that the there should be some more ambiguity in wh mechanics so closing them is a bit more risky closing a wh should not be a trivial exercise
the best idea i heard so far was a new long range long cycling low damage smartbomb on a destroyer ship hull
not much difference is therenot supportingps you people should know better thanks to your claima cloaked ship cant do anything while cloakedeven covert people who fall prey to a cloakie are nothing short of dumb as a pile of bricks for failing to maintain a proper defenseworks as intended stop the evemail spam

is this the goonwaffe recruitment checklistfigures a goon would complain against this we need stricter limits on the csm there should either be no recurring terms nor more then one csm from the same alliance otherwise we have the sad situation that we have today which is kiling eve imo its a lil silly when the largest alliances get to continually pick the csm
once again these changes directly benefit your alliance and not eve as a whole many pilots were uphappy about these changes what a coincidence that the alliance who doesnt use supers daily would have an issue with them
the majority of players dont own supercapitals and arent in alliances that field them on a daily basis moron its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
a lone andski stands against the the unwashed hordes of ignorant pubbies swelling in great numbers of bad posts conflicted implications and conclusions that touch greedily upon the quantities of being wrong andor dumbit seems a lost cause  what can a lone albeit a good poster do against such masses never fear however your homelands will be defended and our likes will blot out the badpoasters
im going to point out why youre worthless here goesyou say that this csm is not responsible for influencing ccps directionyou say that this csm represented their own selfish narrow interests to the detriment of the gamei find it interesting that you can be so against the csm and how it gets elected when your position is contradictory it simply isnt possible for the csm to not be responsible for influencing ccps direction yet at the same time be doing anything detrimental you know since they dont have influence with what influence do you see them being a detrimentif youre interested in proposing a new election process for the csm then cool but if youre trying to take swings at this group and their positionsmotives its often helpful to do so without having a self defeating argumentalso nopejpegpngbmpgifflvmovwmvmp4
since you seemingly struggle with reading comprehension or you need a history lesson ill try to help you outalex the goon spaileader csm chair went to stoffer the goon spai eve developer and basically said brosef i know you have almost no resources for fis just give me a supercap nerf time dilation and make pos fueling easier and were good and stoffer said ya brosef we shall never again have significant resources for fis but of course your request will be at the top of the listincarna happenedplayers raged bitter vets were bitter csm tried to mollify the playerbase and white knight for ccp to little effect massive unsubscriptions were massiveccp watched what the players did and changed directioncrucible instead of being a horrible expansion with nothing but space barbies and alexs 3 requests filled was a mediocre expansion thrown together in 7 weeks but dedicated to fis because of the summer of ragenow do you see how csm can represent their own selfish narrow interests to the detriment of the game without causing the change in ccp direction that occurred great youre welcome run along
stop evading the question and tell me why the majority of players are unhappy about supercapital balancing time dilation and pos fuel blockslet me cut to the chase here and say that no matter how much you would like it you are not the majority of players its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
and you are its funny how we cant dictate what players want and you can dude gtfo here with that what ignorance or you could call me a moron again or a coward pthis is the problem with the csm process goons get a couple of csms and they dictate what the majority of players are
we already have this in the game with cynobeacons attached to pos would it be too crazy to add the cyno beacon to a station as well it would be a service the station owner could or could not add i wont discuss the particulars just the overall concept
so even lazy cap pilots cant be caughtno
lol maybe if it cynod in caps 15 kms off a stations docking radius itll be just like autopilot
get a cyno frig or get enough sov to drop a cyno mod on a posyou fail at cynoing if you cant acheive thisnot supporting stop the evemail spam
gonna have to roll with the masses on this one and say noindestructible cyno because it is attached to a station what happens when every system in 00 has a station
i would like more than 3 character slots on my account i need them for support alts
im really curious how many alts one needs without playing them concurrently if you have that large an infrastructure surely you can afford the isk for one plex a month to double your character slots and be able to run two at once
for either 15 or one plex a month you can get three more character slots as a bonus you can train one of them simultaneously with your main characterproblem
from ccps perspective its a bad business decision why should they let you pay a one time fee to get three more slots when they can charge you 15 a month for it
i am curiousfor what purpose would you need more support alts they cannot be logged in at the same time as your main soyeah
tones of purposes cyno lats for alliance for one botting for oneimagine pi bot that relogs every few minutes to different char and make those short time programs running read and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
welleither way my vote is no get another account and support ccp properly if you want more characters 3 per account is enough
well since he wishes to purchase this benefitavg account life is 2 years iirc1524mo 3603603 slots  120 per slot12050 convienence fee  170so if ccp charged a one time fee of 175 per slot it would cover the average account life plus those who go over that life all nonrefundable should the account be found to breach the euladoesnt sound like terrible thing for ccp imo
everyone hates big fleets we also currently have a filter for average pilots in last 30 minutes and jumps in last hour how about a new filter which basically nerfs big fleets filter for large fleet jumps basically it could try to link them both show graphically where big fleets were moving around it could have a 1530min delay it would allow fleets to head for each other win win

i like both of the ops posts here simply becaues he used the tag entreaty here rather than proposal or my personal favourite demand1 1
agreed theres no reason to treat each stack as a separate immutable entity when you are out of station in reality you have 3000 widgets to sell not 10 stacks of 300 widgets
scenario person a with a pistol w frangible rounds or person b with a knife and kevlar at say 30 foot range which would you rather behint stop drills two in the chest and if hes still standing one in the face kevlar does not make you invulnerable
an excellent idea make it some begins to rattle his sabre
seems it was done on last patch thanks 
sorry if this has been covered somewhere else im at work and lots of eve related stuff gets blockedwas the future of walking in stations discussed is this something that we can expected to see movement on in the next 12 months or should we consider what weve got the complete feature noooooooo
make some changes to assault shipslike in this thread
real men double post
ill get back to you on this
gah i typed out a nice long post but the forums lost it well here was the gist of itone of the easiest ways to learn and become absorbed into a new game after the tutorial is to find a corp who doesnt mind helping out new players these are harder to find in eve than in most mmos a way to alleviate it would be to use a tab in the corp window for rookie friendly corp recruitment there would need to be policing of these corps my idea would be to have the ceo apply for rookie friendly status which would be reviewed and acceptedrefused by a gmisd aura should introduce this feature to the playerthis would help integrate the new player into the social aspect of eve it would provide them with other rookies to play with as well as mentors who could introduce the aspects of eve the tutorials simply cant teach this also provides a good answer to the question of what should i do next that almost every new player asks after completing the tutorialsthere are such corps out there already it just is hard for a new player to find them
edit the point new and improved bounties kill rights and faction warfare and a way to get theregreetings its really fun to fight over stuff and blow things up in eve i am always looking for new and even more fun and devious ways to blow things up or create opportunities to blow things up or get paid to blow things up what you will find below is a set of ideas i have been considering for a while regarding combat loss and ways to make it more interesting and profitablesteps towards something greaterrecent updates have brought changes that while seemingly small in scope have the power to change the fundamental economic drivers of eve online the first and perhaps most powerful of these changes was the ship insurance payment changes insurance reimbursements for lost ships are now paid based on the actual value of materials required to build them this implies an extremely powerful concept the isk value of items within eve can be derived and refined into a single clear number based on aggregated market data this also implies that such a value can be determined for any item sold via the market simply by tracking the isk value of materials required to build items the market value of the items themselves or some combination there of anything from meta 1 scramblers to a tech 3 cruiser can have a mean isk value this is a key concept for proposals given further in the essay the second of these recent changes was the addition of many faction items to the market the actual isk value of these items has quickly become clearer since their addition some faction items can still only be bought and sold through contracts while contracts are perhaps useful for rarer items common items can be tracked more easily through the market there is also much more price fluctuation in contracts multiple items being sold in one contract also makes determining isk value for items with no market equivalent near impossible as stated above determining isk value is key finally the most recent update has brought the ability to see what implants were lost when UFFFDgiving someone a quick trip homeUFFFD this is truly the crownpiece of any aggregated isk value calculation system we can now know everything lost upon ship and pod destruction and therefore determine down the very last cent or isk in this case the value of all assets involved together i believe these changes warrant a serious rethinking of bounties kill rights and factional warfare an incredible new world of opportunities to enrich the game play experience within eve online lay before us systems where destruction and loss have clear value and more importantly clear rewards are now possible there are many possibilities UFFFDmany more then i can relay here and keep my essay any reasonable length i will try to hit on a few of them belowbounties that mean somethinginstead of silly pod destruction empire generated bounties could pay out a percentage of the targetUFFFDs assessed losses until the total bounty prize was depleted players could freely add their own funds to such bounties as they desired private bounty contracts would not only be possible but desired two parties be they single players corps or alliances could enter into a contractual agreement where by a third partyUFFFDs assets were targeted and destroyed a percentage value of the destroyed items would be paid out to the aggressors under such a system payments could only occur for items which were destroyed not dropped however attackers would now gain from both drops and destruction no more cursing the wicked drop fairies because your targets faction modules did not drop at least not so profusely its also interesting to consider pricey UFFFDuninsurablesUFFFD such as t2 ships under such a system so you finally caught that annoying nano fit vagabond while he gets 30 of the value of a tech 1 stabber for that loss you on the other hand are operating under a private bounty agreement and get some portion of the actual value of his t2 hull lucky youcontinued below
killrightswithin such a system kill rights could be updated to allow destruction of the aggressorUFFFDs assets up to the assessed value of incurred losses this also begs for a reconsideration of transferrable kill rights that however is not within the scope of this essaywar declarations revisitedinstead of a flat fee to attack any given corp or alliance limited destruction rights within empire space could be purchased mercenary corps could no longer endlessly attack groups of industrialists for a flat weekly fee at the same time attacks which serve a specific purpose could be executed more freely for considerably less isk caveat i am not supporting one system over another here just giving some possibilities troll for life bruthafaction warfare could be truly profitablewith a more granular loss calculation system in place faction warfare payments could be expanded beyond simple loyalty points cold hard isk could also be paid out this would allow a new income stream in eve for fw participants it might also help balance out some of the disparities between opposing empires that currently exist more opposing fw targets would mean more possible profit and more dangersuicide yarr did those guys who just trashed your freighter in high sec with a suicide gank do it for the UFFFDlolsUFFFD or because they were paid off anyone really dislike you did they put a private bounty contract on you or your corporation you may never know i like to imagine this as a nice replacement for the recently lost insurance payments when suicide ganking as you can see there are many possibilities i believe the examples given above only scratch the surface the key to all of this is an aggregated market evaluation system capable of giving an arbitrary value to each and every item bought and soldthe value of conflict the goal here is to create a war economy a system where destruction and conflict have value not only an immediate value but a speculative one as well conflict is what drives eve online and makes it the engaging experience we all love i believe such a system would give players the tools to fight with one another in new rich and robust ways it would give us new excuses to blow up important internet spaceships and most important it would be fun
no because1 as you said there are much better things to spend dev zots on2 characters wis cannot do anything so excitedly that it would cause boobs to bounce anyway3 the fact this is given attention by you paints you as being overly sexually motivated and perverted if ccp implemented it it would cause them to also appear so and reflect badly on them and us as a community we already get flak for being 95 male we would become a laughing stock4 if your character is wearing a bra  and we know from the character creator she definitely is  her boobs would not bounce anyway unless they were of a monstrous size and even then only slightly so slightly that any development time would be clearly wastedthe only exception to all this and the only time id agree with your request is if ccp introduced strippers like we saw in the teaser incarna footage a while back however if that were the case i am certain ccp would give the strippers realistic boobs regardless of your perverted assembly hall posts you disgusting old man ugh
lolthanks for the laugh the ignorance in this post was amusingwe would become a laughing stock for having realism in a game for ccp showing one more thing that carbon can do right walking makes boobs move at least i know my wifes do perhaps you have never been with a woman bras are not made of steel and dont hold breasts perfectly in place so that they never move

speaking from a wormspace dweller perspective where most fights are small gang size and a single capship present on field is a very big dealcapital ship self destruct with no lossmail encourages blobbing and discourages evenlymatched fun fightsif you have an epic fight where one side squeaks out a win by the narrowest of margins then any enemy capships present on the losing side will have more than enough time to see the fight is lost and hit that one button to cover up the record of their loss which means such an epic fight is less likely to happen as the potentially winning side will want to bring five times as many ships as is necessary to win so that they can crush that capship in under 120 seconds from when they appear on dscan barely squeaking by with minimal force and taking out a capship is the fight you talk about for months afterward splattering a capship who had no chance in less than 120 seconds is notyes please to some kind of record for self destruct under fire for capships yes please to more incentive to start evenlymatched nailbiter fights

unbeknownst to everyone except you myself the mittani and perhaps a couple of instructors at the us navys defense language institute in monterrey california there was a secret message hidden in the original post which had nothing to do with a proposal to limit the forum privileges of nonexceptional individuals nor a troll concerning the same upon rereading the original post i have received the message and informed commissar mittens whose regards you can expect within the next day or so by way of the usual intermediarythe funny part is that people will disregard this message as a troll within a troll and completely overlook the very obvious code words reddit lyrisnairn skype lyrisnairn twitter lyrisnairn

the message has been received decoded and ready to be disseminated giggity to the people but only if they fulfill the like quota
so you need to get likes by making proposals but you cant make proposals unless you have likes huh
unfortunately amount of likes is not an indicator of post quality as evidenced by 1 the quality of bumblefcks posts and 2 the fact that he is one of the primary contributors to the like and get liked thread in general discussioni move ideas should only be submittable to this forum by people who have been following eve since 2002
the only move that you could make and indeed did make with your post is one of the bowels your idea has been noted but ultimately rejected sadly you may wqish to acquire more likes before trying again

the amount of likes dosnt mean you have something in your head this is a bad idea
everyone with over 1000 likes thinks this is a good idea everyone under 1000 likes thinks its a bad ideaeveryone will always vote for what benefits them rather than whats better for the gameif someone suggested that only people with 5000 likes or even 1500 likes the original poster would cry and moan just like the rest of usso in the spirit of this troll thread i suggest to ccp that they only let me personally start threads in the assembly halli honestly think poco based sov is a good idea

yes indeedy
ccp cant do anything about keyloggers that you let get installed on your system no matter what there is nothing they can do about it a keylogger with sufficient information can also take over your email account too so email verification wont fix the issue either nothing beyond a hardware solution like yubikey can prevent keyloggers from gaining access to your accountkeyloggers arent ccps fault and they cant do anything about it maybe their reimbursement policies arent all they could be but there wouldnt be an issue in the first place if you just kept your computer secure
i have multiple firewalls on my machine but thats not the point thing is the keylogger logging in from another ip than mine should be sending some sort of a flag to ccp that the account should be shut down which would have prevented anything from being stolen sure theyd get into my email but i would know whats happening and i wouldnt lose anything in eveim not saying this is the solution just that there are solutions that can and should be explored are you really telling me that ccp shouldnt examine the situation and can you really justify your own apathy with the excuse that my computer was insecure for the first time in 14 yearsjm
why might i askyou mean some kind of verification like facebooks someone logged in from this location system not a bad idea but probably a pain to implement remember you are speaking about a company that wont even build a kill board for its own gamenot that im bashing ccp but id hazard a guess that the number of people effected by keyloggers is relatively low id also guess the number of people unsatisfied after having been attacked and who blame ccp is even lower the question is would the resources required to create such a system be better served elsewherei also happen to agree with their current stance on protecting the eve economy your computer security is your own concern unless the attack was server side you are at fault no matter how unlucky you may have beenit is not ccps responsibility to completely reimburse you with in game assets for a security flaw on your own system especially not at the expense of endangering the game economyit sucks that you somehow got a keylogger onto your machine however it happened but personally id prefer to not see items duplicated on the eve server because of other peoples issues with account securityas for your claim that it benefits isk sellers it would strike me as dumb and overly complicated to sell the items to their own accounts and try to spider web the money back to some clean source a more likely scenario is that they just sold your stuff for as much isk as they could as quickly as they could then purchased a small number of very expensive items and tried to drop them in space or otherwise move them to other characters without any transactions being loggedanyway all of thats blind speculation at the end of the day your computer was compromised ccp helped to the best of their ability without completely destroying the eve economy and im sure they try pretty damn hard to find the people behind this kind of thing too that seems like enough to mecenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
so if i bring my laptop to an another home or isp and my account gets flagged for stolen accountyeahthat will work just grandmaybe you should take a little responsibility for yourself and accept that fact you likely got phished stop the evemail spam
no for all the reasons aboveid like to know this toodestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
honestly id be happy to answer your questions about my personal situation but thats not why i made this thread if you want to ask about my personal security situation create a new thread in the appropriate section of the forum link it and well talk therein the meantime it sounds like nobody has any objections to my main proposal that ccp examine their policy except that it would actually be work for ccp moreover the way the current system works isk scammers are making isk by violating the eula and the fraud laws of most nations on earth by addressing questions of personal responsibility you are avoiding discussion of the topic at hand which is simply that ccp can and should examine how they do business in this regardit seems like ccp doesnt care how we go about getting back stolen property or reporting criminals to the authorities in other words the current policy by ccp says its fair game for me to go about becoming an iskseller myself in order to recoup my losses obviously im not going to but that sort of opening is disturbingjm
well i and most people i guess am still trying to figure out how you get to isk sellers and scammers from a keylogger
no personal responsibility is entirely what this topic is about ccps handling of the consequences after the fact is fine and needs no examination thats the part you seem to be refusing to accept the fact that you immediately brought up isk sellers tells me more about your situation than the block of words you posted in post 1 you and everyone else that has been hacked through a keylogger only have yourselves to blame for what happens the fact that ccp gives you back anything at all should be seen as charityand as for flagging accounts that log in from multiple ips youre really grasping at straws to blame anyone else but yourself arent you
if you are correct why am i posting a proposal that ccp examine its policy and security procedures if i was wanting my stuff back thats what this post would be about and you wouldnt find it here in the csm forums the fact is this is not about me its about the game and asking for the same fairness in game that we get under our common lawi have already accepted what ive lost now im trying to push for change in ccp so what happened to me doesnt happen to others im not saying force this on everyone but rather give us the option to choose what is wrong with your head that you are so vehemently against a request for a few simple security optionsaccording to the eula section 2a paragraph 3 you may not share your account with anyone or allow anyone other than you personally or your minor child if you have registered an account on behalf of your minor child to access or use your account joint or shared ownership or use of an account by more than one user is prohibited logging in from multiple ips would indicate a violation of the eula nothe concept of flagging accounts that log in from unrelated ips several times in succession is one option not the solution there are many other security options ccp could investigate if the company really wants to stop isk scammersdont you think its bullcrap that ccp will write complex code to prevent me from choosing whatever password i want and additional code forcing me to type the name of a character on the account however they think its too much work to write code to enable me the option of preventing others from changing the password or changing my email address without further security informationplease stop defending ccps poor customer service record and lackluster securityjm
well ive logged on with four different ips over the course of the same day me personally not sharing the account or anything like that thats a horrible criteria for determining if the account has been hackedalso the code for checking passwords to make sure they fit some criteria is trivially simple if lenpw8  strisalphapw  strisdigitpw selfthrowbadpwerror break and if you follow proper security procedures to begin with no one will ever be able to change your password or email in the first placeand this isnt at all about ccps security at all their security is fine this is about your security or lack thereof and you letting someone know your password even if you didnt intend totldr ccp cant fix stupid and they cant stop you from letting someone know your password
i would actually like to see a new covops ship type built specifically for solo and small raiding and pirate gangs that has way more gank potential but cannot fit a cyno that way you would be able to eliminate the possibility of a cyno if you know its one these new ships in your system and raiders get a ship that doesnt lack for tank bombers or dps force recons would that satisfy you or is what you really want 100 safe nullsec space in which to pve
you beat me to itit is rather annoying when you go looking for a fight and they all just dock up because they know that they cannot winto bad there isnt a way to maintain a persistant presence in that system so that one could wait for a good ambushtruth is that i dont like afk cloaking as much as the ones im afk cloaking its boring drop local and make everyone happymmos come and go but eve remains garresh
look at my corp and alliancedoes it look like i engage in pve at all
sorry my bad dont pay much attention to peoples corps in ideas threads you were supporting afk cloaking whinners but seeing your corp i can see your real interest is most likely catching cloaked ships at your zone camp er i mean gate camp in rancerin all seriousness i imagine your real issue is with cynos not cloaks
afk cloaking is no threat to anyone any more than a ship sitting in a pos shield with no pilotheres a compromisethe lowest level cloaking device is a prototype this would indicate that its not a final product which is polished and working smoothly maybe the prototype cloaking device i and ii should have a percentage chance of failing once in a whilethis would limit afk cloaking to ships that can fit the covertops cloaks but still allow for afk cloaking

situationmany players using many external tools like forums chat software jabber irc dotlan this is not only based on alliance level many players have top authenticate himself on more than 3 ts servers and forums each alliancecorp has its own implemantation it causes into much trouble autentication in game chatting with leadership and other arkward procedures that minimizes the ingame fun proposalccp should authenticate all player with a openidserver which is independent from the apiserver and give corps and players access necessary authentication data when a pilots demands access his authentication will be checked and his data downloaded according to his api key advantages more and easy management of corp and alliances less problems for pilots with different authentication systems  only one pw that should have a high complexity less problems for the leaderships to manage authentication less problems for short termed based coalitions working together unified software interfaces making authentication more secure disadvantagesthe authentication server has to have the same upptime as the game server if the up time is lower no one will use this service
whats so hard about using the api keys for authentication in my experience theyre quite easy to hook in to

ya the station cyno would cyno you in the same distance from the docking range as the pos cyno beacon does from the shield its the same concept as we have now simply at a different location nothing is different
no there is a massive difference its called stations cant be destroyedunlike poss or cyno shipssurely youve thought this through right stop the evemail spam
stations can be conquered and a cyno ship kill means nothing station services can be disabled by damaging the station just like pos mods

wendis more of a plexer hunter if i open a plex there is a good chance that ill see wendi at some pointanyway back to the actual proposali believe a simple name change would be more appropriate take a look at a station it is huge far easier to occupy it with troops and possibly your own agents in order for this to really work you would have to beef up the guns to instadeath probably i say leave the guns alone no one wants to be killed by anything npci am one of those militia members new players would not be too endangered if the veterans in militia warn them about placing all of their gear in a hotly contested system or advise them to base themselves out of a system that isnt constantly under threati am aware that with the current state of things in minmataramarr fw this would be a crushing blow to all 24th pilots if this was implemented anytime soon i would be perfectly ok with a cosmic reset so that everyone starts off with all of their systems back as for the stuff stashed away in enemy systems keep an eye on the patch notes and move your stuff when you see it

a specialized character doesnt need much skill point to be effective as eve online gets older so do the charactersyet there isnt a need to keep training the characters because they are maxed out at what they do so the answer is to open more slots per account to grow that way i am getting to the point on my accounts where i have nothing left to train on the 3 characters i have on my accounts i have carrier pilots who depend on my cynoetc alt to log into the game and enable them to move all my characters are cynoenabled every character i have can cyno yet the 3 characters i have are committed to a different part of eve im not concerned about training multiple characters on an account im the type of person that wants to have a couple characters in high sec wormholes 00 etc im not changing the way the next person plays their game when you have a characters in a highlow00wormhole corp you are devoted to that corp and cant go from 00 to high sec because of commitments to youre corpalliance eventually this will happen eventually youre eve characters all 3 of them will become so proficient at what they do that you wont have a need to train them there are people who will train that 1 main character to 300 million skill points but id rather have 3 100 million skillpoint characters after which id like more character slots that allow me more access to the game i feel each character on an account allows more access to the game makes my game experience better

nah sister cause youre the intelligentlet me be the blond sexy
i just have read the op so i canUFFFDt comment to the other opinions uttered here atm but i can say already i surly support it it could be even more extended to revitalize low sec or bring low sec to its intended means
eve is in no way undocumented or bad eve is fairly unique and should stay that way im sorry if people want the game to be dumbed down because they are incapable of understanding something more complex than a game that has your plan laid out for you from day 1
btw the game already has this theyre called certificates go unsub over ccp dumbing it down its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
the certificate planner is not what he was talking about go unsub over not understanding the context of the discussion
then go yell at evemons developers its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
and if u remove the learning implants u can also remove the costs for reupgrading ur cloneor remove the clone feature altogether cuz if u can calculate ur loses only in ship cost alot more peapole would stop being carebears and start some pvp
and thus consequence is removed from eve
god no its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i heard some yelling whats the fuzz all about
i just thought of something that was fairly interesting to methe guys here in null want learning implants to go away i also saw a few of you asking for more combat implants my question is thisif you already unwilling to lose 600m worth of 5 learning implants how can you justify more high grade and low grade combat implants when theyre going to cost 7002b isk with omega  if you wont lose simple 5 implants then i highly doubt that youll ever use combat implants
more combat implants is a red herring this thread is about removal of learning implants nowhere does the proposal mention anything about more combat implants
they know that already which is the whole point its just a distraction silly the whole point is to remove consequence from eve i should be able to get podded with zero loss
lmao alt posting its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i believe it can apply you only train using two attributes at a time no more no less there is a dominant pairing intelligencememory and perceptionwillpower two jump clones a few spares and you are set while i used 3s out in nullsec i recommend a 43 combination it really isnUFFFDt too bad on the wallet if you lose themonce you are more established it becomes a choice between more toys or more sp i actually can i can tell you about life in nullsec lowsec getting constantly wardeced and being the one doing the wardecing i know what itUFFFDs like to lose your space toomissions to null null wins hands down sure you can narrow the gap by sinking isk into an expensive ship but then you can get ganked by an oracle swarm on a guristas mission incursions that is a different story however donUFFFDt they have much better ones in nullsec

who said the eve forums was a democratic institutionmore over in dictatorships popularity only serves to highlight the lack of alternativesopposition in a world where only goonswarm spammers have enough likes to make topics that their csm brosefs can steamroll into implementation this kind of nullifies the whole legitimacy argument and further more highlights the massive segregation of duties conflicts of interest present in the current dispensation
the eve online forums are not the csm and its business is ccp said so well then you will be happy to know that the csm is an authoritarianenforced democratic bodywhat is to stop any other group of people from banding together and having a voice exactly as loud as or louder than the collective voice of goonswarm i can think of exactly two things first that other groups of people lack the necessary organization or group cohesion to do it second that enough other people do not exist if the first is the case then one can hardly blame goonswarm and her allies for being successful that is generally regarded as a good thing ya know if the latter is the case and literally the voice of goonswarm is the loudest because there are more of us than there are players in every other group combined then we honestly deserve to get everything we want because that is how a democracy works welcome to the tyranny of the masses reddit lyrisnairn skype lyrisnairn twitter lyrisnairn
noi have no idea who this op is never seen him post anything senseful in my life this thread for example and theres nothing stopping the csm from posting ideas here themselves did you spend endless hours liking yourself with your alts do you feel some sort of achievement and superiority in the mind210 cause op was thrown under a bus
theres an easy and cheap solution to account security  ccp could develop a smartphone app that would register your phone to your account anytime you log in from a new ipnew pcetc the game client could require an extra layer of authentication  a code from your smartphone app the app could use timestamp  phone mac  or some other identifier to generate the smartphone authentication code so when prompted by the client for the extra code you simply pull out your phone generate a new code enter it and off you go key loggers wouldnt be able to generate spoofed keys bc they would need your smarphone and the timebased algorithm to do soall of this would likely take ccps skilled programmers only a matter of a couple of weeks to develop do android iphone and windows phone versions there are tons of ways it could be tweaked to address various concerns
that wasnt my proposal at all first and foremost my proposal is that ccp just take a look at the entire situation and try to plug the holes where isk sellers make profitsecondly under my specific recommendation about ips in your case you would be able to log each of those ips so that if somebody does try to log in from another one it would be blocked but thats a side issue not my overall pointplayer stupidity is off topic make a new threadjm
while i do admit that player account security is up to the individual if there is indeed a way for scammers to safely rip off accounts without recourse that is something that requires attention sure it does create more work for the customer support staff in the short term but it may discourage some activity in the long run
you are so desperate to push the blame on ccp arent youyou just refuse to take responsibility for your lack of care or concern in where you go what you download and what you seethis is nothing more than a whine thread to blame ccp for something you did stop the evemail spam
im still confused about where the isk sellers are coming into the discussion how in the world are you getting from keyloggers stealing your password to isk sellers making a profit
i noticed that op have relly hard time understanding that people have dynamic ip adressesagain  i agree that security can be tightened for the sake of it for example some time age fanfest they showed those devices tokens that generates numeric code based on buildin unique seed they could make it finally available so players can buy it and be sure that their accounts are saferead and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
so you want to completely negate the risk of closing wormholes no
first things first i usually dont respond to posts by random throwaway alts in noob corps man up and post on a mainthat being said i actually do agree with you about docking up or logging off its annoying to corner an enemy fleet in a dead end only to have them log off and escape its also annoying to be swarming around someones home system and see people talking smack in local from the safety of a station i know there are certain game mechanics that you just cant get around but i dont think anyone or any thing should ever be 100 safe in eve thats the problem i have with the cloaking devicealso i dont get why getting rid of local would help the situation at all it would make afk cloaking more effective not less effective problem there is some dude hiding outside my apartment building hes been stabbing people for the last two weeks nobody can chase him down because hes an invisible wizard or something i dont want to go outside because ill get stabbed without being able to catch him and he has the power to teleport a load of other knife wielding dudes on top of himselfsolution lets make him more difficult to detect so you dont know he is out therebasically you show up in someones ratting system in your covops you immediately cloak so you dont show up on dscan then you just poke your own dscan every few hours or so whenever you are at your computer looking for rattersthen you have all your cap pilots and black ops pilots in your alliance in one chat channel along with you so you have them on call when you find something worth jumping then you point your target cyno in a gank fleet blow them up and gtfoon the defending side the only counter to this is to have a home defense fleet already made and protecting your ratter miner so that when the blob shows up you can fight it this means you have 1 person in a ratting battleship actually doing some ratting while 20 people in pvp ships sit bored out of their skull protecting one dude from a theoretical hot dropnow the most annoying part of this is that the cloaky guy in local will only start at fight that he knows his side can absolutely win so if you have a 20 man ratting babysitter fleet hovering in space the cloaky will only jump you if he can get 40 dudes for a black ops drop or enough carriers and supers to kill your little gang so the home defense gang knows that the only way this evening will end is either by staring at one dude running havens all night or by getting out blobbed and blowing upwe keep going on about risk vs reward and balance issues in eve i just think that the way cloaking devices are now they make gameplay unbalanced also the most effective use of cloaking devices makes gameplay that just isnt very funfor the afk cloaker its not exciting gameplay at all you just log on and poke your computer every once in a while its probably more boring than checking facebook for the people doing the hot dropping its not really a kill you can be proud of congratulations you got in a bomber took a jump portal and fired at some random battleship that you absolutely know is going to blow up along with 20 other dudes and for the defenders its really annoying because youll either get blue balled or out blobbedi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
whats the big deal you say theyre only pixels only pixelswell youre correct however i find eve onlines lack of beards disturbing i myself wield a mighty beard oop and desire no demand that more beards are added to the game for player character models im not talking about the generically cut and short variants as seen amongst new edenwho would want their pc to sport an epic vikingesque beard or evil looking long goatee something that players can see in the system chat and tell right away that this guy will in all probability blow your ship to pieces before ransoming your pod and killing your clone outright anyway or perhaps complement the respectable look of an experienced trader grizzled in the ways of interstellar travel or add a bit of obnoxious flair to the booster addict trolling in jitain the end simple idea i know that there are certainly more important things that need attention to these days but a bearded man can dream what says the community
it adds nothing to the game and has not done so for years if folks want to learn about 00 politics there are places with actual information content
or theres a simpler optiondont read it
no
id rather keep it where it is it lets the epeen focused people prance around in circles without disturbing the rest of the sane population so much
read me
if you enjoy agent running or hunt npc or do any kind of fun pve activity in eve your faction standings are changing eventually youll get to the point that doing one more mission will drop your standings to some empire faction less than 5 and you will have some issues flying in a vast part of empire space in case of hunting npc on belts in 00 youll end up with almost no chance to switch to 00 agents if you may ever want it to do proposalevery faction should have a kind of a temporary passcard to their territory in their lp stores like starbase charters costs some lp and some isk we need more isk sinks right when you use that passcard youll temporary rise your standings to that faction for a 24 hours after that your standings are dropped to the previous level the amount of standing to rise is a topic to discuss it can also depend on a price of a passcard ps dont forget to click like if you like
not supported creating a new mechanic for the sole purpose of undermining an existing mechanic thats working as intended it took time for you to ruin your standings it will take time to repair it actions and consequences
my standings are fine but i gather random noob training fleets in empire to roam somewhere and learn to shoot something lots of players ruin their standings when they are noobs and dont really know what the cons are or when they live in 00 npc space for too long they just need a short indulgence for an event before they return to their homes and to the stuff they used to dolook at it this way  if you ruined your security status you will need several days to rise it back if you ruined your standings you will need a half of the year to shoot same 10 missions over and over again is it a good and fun thing to do
eve needs the opposite of what your asking for standings that actually mean something have real benefits and consequences and cant easily be changed
youre doing it wrong then there are many other ways to fix your standings that arent just grinding lvl 4s for half a year
what this guy said youre a wanted mass murderer to some of these factions why should they forget about that for just a little bit of isk
in all seriousness id support chest ambulation if i thought it could lead to other developments where most things in eve are not flexible it isnt something they need to emulate outside wis unless they wanted to try and emulate metal buckling under fire that could evolve from simple ambulations like chestsomething as simple as bouncy boobies can allow for further development and because boobies are always a safe bet to pilot on its the place to start just dont know if ccp could benefit there
man you guys are beating up my thread today
supported and look at all these shitposting alts
what lolstupid statement is stupid
problem is that all that accomplishes is roll back eve to pret3 times and probably make cs even more of an unused class  it will in fact probably be worse than pret3 as the multilink cs are a lot easier to probe out than the t3 ditto  the concept of being able to directly influence the performance of 250 people at once has always been broken t3s abuse just pushed it into the open the only feature that historically even comes close to that kind of power was deliberately crashing a nodein short if anything an offgrid booster should be operating at a significantly reduced capacity as opposed to when being ongrid  as in half strength  makes it a conscious choice to opt for the slight but hidden edge rather than the full monty they dont necessarily have to become instagibbed when moved ongrid that only applies if it is done with nothing further changed when the cs are revised which they have to way outdated the field commands should be given 2 free links slots up from 1 the fleet commands unlimited up from 3 no command procs needed and they should both get tank boost as well as a signature reduction t3 command subsystems should have their link allowance doubled 2 native rather than 1 and the tanking bonuses increased could be a sig decrease or maybe even an  incoming rronce people learn that the 6link hull is kind of useless links will be spread out onto multiple hulls to minimize the risk of being completely stripped  goddess knows there are enough bcs floating around these days to pick up any slack that might appearadd a revision to fleet window where the commander or assigned role can list all available links in fleet and change boosters on the fly  will have to sort out the shield crap first if rapid switches is to be viable for all though
this is great have my bumpedit read through the thread here are a couple points i think need to be answered quotes are paraphrased but accuratewho cares this isnt about changing where pvp happens this is about making lowsec not  if consequentially more people pvp in lowsec so be itfalse club bear is a good counterexample plus youre basing your experience on what you see in lowsec which is a bit myopic seeing as the people this would apply to avoid lowsec in its current state due to being limited to flashieswhere x is some form of grinding alts hauling scouring the stocks of the lowsec market ratting sec from time to time its all some form of grinding were aware that its possible to do that we just dont like it hence the op just stating what the game is like atm and going deal with it isnt constructivethe crux of the issueyoure misconstruing eves harshness into a stonewall want to make eve quote unquote easier more accessible baby go play hello kitty online  wow  cowadootyop wants to change the way in which lowsec is harsh not remove the harshness instead of stupid mechanics and grinding lack of sentries and playercaused danger if you think this is against eves philosophy then you think eve is about grinding and youre the one who should be playing wow not arena though just leveling blacksmithing all daybtw even for all the diehard grindfest fans at least acknowledge the stupidity of sec status making lowsec further removed from highsec than 00 isoh and jack dont think i dont know whom youre talking about when you say people complaining about not having ship fittings even when we had corp hulls
agreed
lowsec also pretty much alienates frigates assault frigates destroyers interdictors and t1 cruisers from effectively engaging on gatesthis added to the fact that newbies often want to go play in a rifter compounds eves elitist playstyle essentially solo lowsec pvp under bc hulls is incredibly hard to find unless you want to be roundly spanked by alex medvedov in a 210 plex get jumped by six drams in amamake i belt i or be ganked by an instalock lachesis tackle for a battlecruiser gangwhen i was a 2m sp nubbing back in 2008 or whenever it was i would have loved to jump in a rifter and tour lowsec trying my hand at nabbing a cruiser or destroyer at a gate or even grabbing an industrial it would have pushed me into true piracy a lot quickerthis suggestion is still one of the best ive seen for a while even if it was a corpmate who suggested itme tips his hat to mr dant
we can call it broseci think a boost to low sec belt rats to nearing null sec rats could encourage more players to low sec rat and force pvp encounters away from gatesstationssupported
 op hmm intresting  i completly agree 1 m8
supported long since given up on learning implants whether something takes 19 days or 16 who cares
i always liked the implant portion of the gameeven more so now that a pod kill shows the expensive implants you have popped
im mixed on this topic attribute implants make up a decent part of the eve market im not sure just ripping it out is a good idea would all the attribute implants i own just vanish with no reimbursmentbut there is definitely a problem with people not wanting to go into null sec because of bubbleswhat if you could warp your pod out of a bubble the risk in null sec would be the same as the risk in low sechigh sec it seems less drastic than making all these implants go out of existance and changing several others that include this bonusmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
pods would make nearly unstoppable scouts  probably not a good thing
less so about this than about getting more folks involvedill give you a funny point to look atback in the day we used to get up at 3am to adjust our queue for training  ever read these kinds of postsguess what  there is a portion of this community that the only way in hell they are up at 3am is if its feeding time and no that isnt from smoking a bowl and getting the muchiesthat real life portion also cannot guarantee they can be online every day to jump clone around nor are they very good at pvp due to lack of time to invest in playing they know it  most of those more dedicated players know it too in general they dont mind this but will only risk what they can afford to lose at each outing2006  the average online time for eve players is 17 hours a week thats a part time jobso if you have those with real lives that play eve who may spend 17 hours a month in the game that average means there are a lot who are spending vastly more time in itthese vastly more types are the ones that seem to post sneers all over they figure they are the normal eve player  which may be true nowadays but if you ever want the game to grow id advise players start looking at those more casual types as where to focus for growth  not your 10 accounts 16 hours a day in eve players  which seem to the the ones all these penalty discussions are aimed atwhen you are cranking in tens of billions a month from your alts and insist that others pay the penalties as if they were only those who also are doing that can participate the rest  dont even bother trying it  those portions of the game arent designed for them so they should just stay out of it  which they tend to do the alt army is again a rather thinner layer of the gaming community than those who spend far less time playingso making things more accessible  enabling folks to follow the golden rule of eve  dont fly what you cannot afford to lose but aiming those losses farther down the income chain to encourage more player involvement yeah i kind of like the idea but im confused as hell seeing it coming from andskiyou see ive seen him chatting in eve  this guy loves being involved in things like hulkageddon laughing about how those bot pilot tears are so great  except last time i checked bot pilots werent around their keyboard to whine when they were blown up  be that as it may  he has been a proponent of more griefing of anyone who plays this game than most ive seen hes about as far from nullbear as youll get and has a bunch of accounts to fund his pvpi saw this thread and the first thing that went through my head was the second post has to be his alt hes trolling here because that post sounded more like him than his suggestion when he says losses like this dont bother him hes being honest its the mitigation of any pvp penalties that just doesnt make sense  that just doesnt sound like himboggle
arent cov ops already nearly unstoppable with the ability to cloak and scan they would still seem to be a better choice than a pod comparing that to increasing everyones attributes by 5 points taking valuable assets from players with no reimbursment and demolishing what is left of already almost useless lp stores it seems a relatively minor disadvantageplus allowing pods to warp out of bubbles would lead to more people buying implants and actually make the economy more robust instead of eliminating a large part of it make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
thinking ccp doesnt love amarr drones
yes because sitting around with supercaps just logged in and idling all day is smartno its not and its not an exploitalso nobody cares whats fit on the ship ever at all its the record of the loss the record of the actual pilots choice to scuttle the ship thats in questionwe could give a crap less what was in or on the pilot also i believe in your rage filled tirade of butthurt you have come after the wrong group pl rides its burning supers into the ground were not known as an alliance to log off in a fightall this may be shocking to you and hard to take i understand that as you couldnt even really stay on the topic in your rant if youd like to sit and talk about your problems a bit we have some people around who can help you out
fair enough generate a killmail with information about what ship was destroyed where and who killed it possibly including damage done no information thats not already given out is given out and the destruction is still documented
not sure why a direct response to post is suddenly both a rant but also offtopic  but something tells me that is probably the generic replythought you have for anything that isnt in accordance with your world view very modern to be sure but hardly constructive and certainly not worth my time so enjoy your silence grathsee that would make sense a blank killmail only containing participants but no numbers whatsoever with self destructed or scuttled in place of damage receivedps really dont see all the fuss over api verification to sd mails which is all it boils down to  guess my epeenego does not need the constant attention and my associates are more trustworthy than others
while you arent the majority of players in game not if ccps own published figures are to be believed not to mention human nature suddenly doing a 360 degree turn you do seem to be one of the most active groups so yes your voice should definitely be heardfield of trolls if you chum it they will come

like others have stated i believe that there are enough measures a player can make in order to prevent most breaching of account security though unobtrusive improvements wouldnt be too bad to see the aforementioned account key generators would be a great option for highvalue targets that are much more likely to be attacked than a carebear gnawing on an asteroid somewhere in 07one thing that helps a lot is to change your password on a regular basis keep it complex but try not to forget it

i think you just read the title of the thread and posted without reading any of the comments no no i do not want to completely negate the risk of closing wormholes youre wrong read the comments
no im pretty sure he read the postsits likely you who refuses to undestand or see reasonwhs is just fineall you need to do is wait it outcamp with sbs and space bombsbubble itor shove some armor plated battleships throughif its a class 1 shove some armor plated tier 3s throughproblem solvedthe greater majority of whs ehtusiasts have it down to a sciencewhile aparently you are troubled or taking issue with said mechanicwe do not need an instai win button for closing whsin its current rendition there is risk of the ship being sent through getting trapped or the risk of not able to collapse wh due to it being odd numbered as opposed to even numbered of hops it forces you to take a calculated riskwith a degrading bomb you would just pop the bombs out cnotinously until the bloody thing collapses and if your making it a partialthat is an utter and complete waste of timewe do not need to add yet an another item to the long list of itemsbut i suspect you will fail to get the message for the 1000th time so why i bother posting is beyond even me stop the evemail spam
troll harder soni accepted from the beginning that this idea probably would not get any traction because i anticipated it i tried to come up with some ways to reign the idea in and try to make it difficult to utilize perhaps these measures arent enough the idea of any device closing a wormhole raises skepticism is there something sacred about the current process of closing a wormhole i would like to say that for all of the flaws people see in this idea realistically you have to admit that its not an instawin buttonill ask this again because at this point this question is about the extent of the effort im willing to put into this does it break the game to have a bomb that takes 1 kg from a wormholes available mass and costs 20 million isk
why the  would i want to spend 20m a damn shot when its cheaper to get a battleship and do the job in the fraction of the timeid rather use that 20m to buy a shrapnel bomb stop the evemail spam
you didnt answer the questiondoes it break the game to have a bomb that takes 1 kg from a wormholes available mass and costs 20 million isk
your just not getting it arent youlet me break it down for you since your failing to keep upif theres no point to it or no needthen yes it isall somenoe would need to do is get a pile of them and lob them at whs until they pop the damn thinga concept you refuse to understand or see with your blind nature of your foolish notion of an ideato top that offits also ludicrously expesive and inefficent at bestall youd need is a couple battleships with armor plates and youd get the job done quick likerisk is a major thing in whsyou take that risk awayyour breaking the gamebut alasi suspect your going to once againignore me stop the evemail spam
im going to rephrase this so that applies to the actual situation better instead of using the random backally stabber imagine a sniper with a laser to drop bombs on a target thats the potential of afk cloaking the threat of force is really what keeps locals in sov docked up not the actual use of forceafk cloaking is a very basic form of unconventional warfare something that has been around for 1000s of yearspsychologically it takes a toll on the people in area the base populace that generated the resources and income to perpetuate warfarethis type of warfare is generally used to make the enemy so paranoid and scared that theyll expend a great deal of resources to expel a threat that might not even be there think about random mortaring and sniper fire the attackers in an urban environment have th benefit of being able to disappear into crowds and it takes a great amount of resources to weed them out in a rural environment this is different sniper attacks could claim a single life and overtime a single smart sniper could whittle down the personal and moral of an entire brigadesun tzu referenced this as a war at home the population has to either want the war or not care about the war in order to maintain a strategic advantage and maintain moral in the ranks this tactic has been used countless times in history to break the backs of nations and has ended in complete victory for a weaker player in eve this very basic principle is replicated in the form of being able to keep pilots logging on seeing an empty teamspeak because everyone is afk because of a hostile in system causes you to not want to play once activity dies down then space is vulnerable this is a legitimate part of warfare in eve this is not going to changeeither htfu and patrol your space or go back to highsec and let npcs do it for yoummos come and go but eve remains garresh
personaly i think the decloaking thing is a bad ideal it weakens the cloak to much for its real intented perposseshow ever i would fully support a new state of the art scaning prob that can only scan down cloaked ships and with perfect skills and ship and hardwiring would take at least 20mins to scan downthat 20 mins is more then whats needed to gtfo cloak up and log out or put a cryo up or actively fly around cloaked from safe spot to safe spot but reqs you to be at pc at least only kind of afk like ice miningit how ever will not let you sit there 247 and be online at the same timeedit and i only say that becouse real life spys have to work damn hard at stealing intel and so should the afk cloakers in any allance system or whthat way they have to at least be at the pc playing to gain what ever there goals are for siting in that system
ok yeah thats a good point going into someone elses space to mess with their heads is a valid tactic says the guy in the npc corpbut there needs to be some sort of counter to this once someone gets in their target system safes up and cloaks there is literally nothing you can do to track them down they can just log in day after day cloaking up as soon as they hit gridi think that the defenders should have an option available tot hem to try and fight back and dont say 237 gate camps on your home system try try and catch cloakies yes its the only defense against this sort of thing right now but that is way to disproportionate an amount of effort that the defenders need to invest versus one guy trying to slip a cloaked ship in systemthe two solutions i think would work are either giving cloaked ships an incredibly small signature radius that is difficult to probe out or giving cloaking devices a 23 hour fuel bay so theyd need to gas up every once in a whilei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
1 on the fuel bay but limit it to 1 hour max cov ops cloaks are not intended to unbalance the game 1 hour is plenty of time on a cloak that you only need occasionally they are intended for spyingscouting not making up for a loser corp incapable of p

mehno reason to remove it just do what i didgo find something worthwhile to read on the other sections of the forums
umm ok it adds nothing but it does remove a hell of a lotit takes the bulk of the pvp smacktalk and lulz out of other forums and moves it to a spot that is quite easily avoidable that does add value by removing junkwithout it you could expect general and war to both flood fill with smacktalk they get enough of that without whats put in caod joining itthanks but i think i prefer it this way
fixed that
er what anomalies give 2 rewards isk and items and empire missions do all of that and lp and in safe space that does not need to be fought fore and you are suggesting that null sec stuff should be nerfed morelp is not a isk sink for the missioner themselves they make money on every lp what are they worth a thousand each if they spend lp and 5 million isk on a mod worth 10 million they make 5 mil strait up thats not a loss its a gain
ya i could not agree more myself i feel bpcs should be droping and not modules them selfs on top of burning the drone goo there are just to many sources of mins out side of mining that needs to change at least on npc targets player targets it works just finethe current pure isk fauts are just fine they would need that isk to pay the higher prices for things if you burn drone goo and change npc loot to bpcs
the last available data the qen from q4 2010 showed 796 of characters in hisec

i do agree with this thoughoverhauling  streamlining the current standingsroles interface so that administration of alternative nonnbsi roes is something worth pursuing imagine if instead of having to join a renter alliance and pay x fee per month you just signed a contract for isk and you received standings within region x ganking other neutralsblues flags you automatically just like how it would in lohigh space only controllable by a judge or any number of possible arbitration methods

i am ok with that change tooeither way  such a simple change can get rid of an exploit and to cry baby to ccp everytime a corp memberor alliance member gets hit with it is not the right way to go
dont think this has been on the radar since the summer i think its time to revive this issueccp removed the ability to see another player characters standings to faction corps and agents agents we can live without and just view through api however the rest are helpful to those that follow the game lore rp or are involved in fw and add some color and depth to eve and our identities in the game reversing this ill considered change would i hope be the first small step by ccp to also reverse their previous disregard for faction warfare roleplayers and their own games storylore
mehi havent really missed itwouldnt be opposed to seeing this feature in game again either
twould be nice so people can actually see tars terrible angel and sansha standings
some of it is still there  you can view this for anyone in your corporation but only by checking what group its with  example checking amarr faction bring up the amarr info go to the standings tab rightclick your corporations standings with them and view composition there sits everyone in your corporation that is effecting it and how they are effecting itwhat they cannot do is check those outside of the corporation nor check to see every last npc faction you have dealt with by checking your characters informationit added privacy but left the ability to see who is impacting your groups effects by asking the npc entity who they likedont like instead of just clicking you and seeing everyone you deal with privacy to players is nicehow do you think a group like euni was able within minutes of a director logging on to find 1 out of over 1000 players who had just cost them their jump clone services by dealing with the jc provider corps agents rightclick  view composition then rightclick the low standings  boot send email fix this and you can come backthis composition stuff has been there for a long time and is easy to use
you can auth players for voice chat web pages or any other program with the api already
the situation is now that many players using the same pw for all the tools and their eve account in opposite to ccps server most of the tool server arent that secureso one secure server is betterto auth player with voice is really stupid its not more than a layer that destroys fun in game with an openid acc it wouldnt be necessary

i dont want those things walking off by themselves chest ambulation made me lol but itd be nice for them to have some natural movement the tritanium bras need to go

these two quotes are importantpeople do not like being limited to shooting flashies in lowsecbeing nonflashies confers an advantage in fightsalts sp grinding not having trade hubs within a jump or two movement grinding hauling alt  movement grind and ratting sec grind are stupid people do not want to grind they want to undock pewpew for an hour and log the f offsince being nonflashy gives you an advantage people will do what they have to do in order to keep that advantage this means gridningwhich blows donkey nuts that means that people who hate being limited to shooting flashies will be just as irritated because they still cant shoot nonflashies the logical solution to end grinding and make lowsec not get rid of all sentries and security loss in lowsec this is not rocket sciencetooo teh topz

i dont like the ideal anymore then i liked having my learning skills removed but omost everything here transfers from learning skills to learning implants so mybe ccp will but i dout it there all about painfull deaths and burning though iskother wise they would have though out the learning implants witch is a bad ideal to begin with and keept the learning skills
not supportedeve is about making decisions to those people that put 5 implants in their head put on the table that they are willing to risk said implants in whatever they decide to do in eve be it pvp pve pvmarket pvasteroidseve boils down to thisrisk management every single one of us decided that were willing to risk whatever it is we put in our heads in whatever adventures we have in eve if you want to train faster on certain skills you put the implants in if you dont want to train faster then you dont put anything in thats your business just because you feel that youre being jipped on training or youve seen other players not want to join you on roams because of their decisions im sorry for you im sorry that not everyone wants to play the game the same way you want to i genuinely am but if this game was the way you wanted to play there would be a lot missing like no miners no one building anything nothing if anything people would all be shooting at each other in their rookie shipswith the scope on blanketing everyone with the a buff on the training i cant support that either first there is no risk of losing anything with the buff just the same as there was no risk of losing anything with the learning skills themselves as someone else already mentioned second eve is about taking every damned advantage you can over another player buffing everyone only lessens the chance of superseding someone else because youre equals all players now training at the same speeds to get to their first battleship at the same time will now all get that battleship at the same time however if someone gets that implant in theyll train faster to that battleship to beat out their competitors sooner advantage implant userthe game mechanic is risk if someone puts in 5s and not willing to risk them in pvp that is their game mechanic decision i feel sorry that you feel that youre at the disadvantage of those who do have the nards to put expensive implants in to get the advantage on you to get better equipment to beat you faster because  well really the black and white of it is that you are at the disadvantage
assuming that everyone remaps sure but thats not really the case its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
it seems a very disruptive way to accomodate the fact that bubbles in null sec catch podsi think if you want to lessen the impact of null sec bubbles then lessen the impact of them and let pods out until i see what the big deal is with that i am not sure changing this core part of the game is the best way to accompish the end result instead of changing the mechanic that is causing the trouble this proposal rewrites a whole swath of the game by giving everyone faster learning which was already buffed with the loss of learning skills gives the already suffering lp stores another kick in the crotch  likely just killing them off and takes valuable assets from players without reimbursement eliminating a considerable part of the market changing the game around for everyone to mitigate a very narrow problem seems a bit like having the tail wag the dog make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i guess but the 610 slot ones are expensive too nobody is clamouring for them to get removed
those nobodies aka goons are too cheap to use hardwirings young minds are eager to learn though

i would like to see a ship that is focused on drone use the the exclusion of launchers and turrents but not being a capital shipon topic tho i would like to know too if the drones are intended like that or if it is an oversight
slackjawed wrotedear eveplayeri propose a balance to the self destructing due to people not able to log off anymore the remaining way to grief is to self destructat this moment you can self destruct and you dont generate a killmail no loot drops insurance is paid out while it makes sense that no loot drops you do self destruct after all its dumb that there is no killmail provided the insurance is something that is also questionablewhat i propose generate a killmail for the last person who shot at the ship damage included or not depends on technical problems i presume no loot drops pay out no insurance this way sd is used for the primary reason it should be used denying people your stuff it doesnt however cover the fact that your ship was destroyedalso the timer should be dependant on the ships size the timer should be that it forces people to use enough dps to be able to kill it a reasonable timer would probably be around 56 minutes for a super a pod could be lowered to 2030 secondsconclusionthe csm has recommended this once already but nothing happened with it then ccp is doing a good job fixing a lot of issues with the game lets make this the next onethis issue was alrdy raised once by alekseyev karrde 20 december 2009the minutes it was discussed in csm meeting 4002  meeting minutes 20091220 1818 results wereself destruct should revoke insurancepassed 72 mrs trzzbk korvinselfdestruct should generate killmailpassed 72 teadaze song liselfdestruct should overheat all modulesfailed 72 alekseyev karrde sokrateszselfdestruct timer depends on ship sizepassed 81 korvini dont mind this changes myselfbut there is a point of conflict in my mind of the no pay out on insuranceit makes perfect logic that a insurance company will not pay out if you destory your own ship but that same logic also means no more pay outs if the police blow your crap up too
i have quit a fair number of games do to keylogers and poor securitypeople can and do follow every possable security mesures staying away from unknow websitessecurity software and in the case of some games like wow geting the keychain with random number for added security and you still get hacked and jacked and even wow handles it poorlyi just stop playing any mmo that will not fix what was broken in my account how do you think i ended up here if it happends here i cancalle accounts and move on to the next game or take a long brakethere have been years inbetween games i have left uowowaion over this kinds of problems i have never gone back and never will and i realy like some of them alot but its just to painfull to lose all that you worked forand normaly way to borning to work though all that content againfor eve its a bit differnt though i would be happy and call it fair if i just got all my isk back and the real market vaule of the iteams lost back as welllike when i run out to the market place and buy stuff right back i need that isk for that i should not even have to  around with buy orders to get my crap back
you dont have to the good ones send you email any ways and the realy good ones make it look like something from ccp that your going to want to open and read
and fyi at this point and time on the internet the weapons out reach the def tools it gos back and forth and right now the weapons are winning the fight over the def tools
bump awaiting csm comment
ok i get it you want to see more about wis you want to sit and spend 2 hours per day doing things that has no meaning within the confines of the game world thats cool with me but before you go flipping out that they dont care about you anymore because they went back to their core game fis  youve got to look at the bigger pictureyoure 3 years old assuming youve played that whole time youve sat through the 18 months and excellence things from ccp and have accepted the lacklustre expansions over that time with the rest of us incarna was a really bad expansion overall  ccp nearly killed the relationship with their core demographic theyve said nearly as much in the recent devblogs and the crucible trailer itself crucible is fixing a lot of the issues  pcu the last two weekends has been at 50k or better for the first time since incarna no crucible has not fixed all the problems in eve nor will the next expansion  but if ccp keeps with their back to basics stance the game as a whole will get significantly better with time seriously  crucible was a great expansion that was practically thrown together in a few weeks look at what they were able to achieve and apply that to what they can pull off for the next expansionsure wis will get the and oh yeah we were able to throw this in too treatment for a while but better that than sorry guys we cant keep tq online it was a great run maybe well see you in perpetuum or something
 no one is suggesting that ccp shouldnt work on the fis stuff we just want to know if wis will be expanded on in the near future as the concept for it is what made a lot of newer ppl sign up to this gameps this is not a discussion its a request for csm to get us some answers
 what part of ccps yeah well keep working on wis but its mainly backurnered stance is hard to grasp
so let ccp explain to us again

ok so when ccp put out the new customs offices they said they readjusted the base tax amount from november averages they did this because the old market value was out of date and far too lowafter this announcement and some carebear tears the market value of pi shot up again but the taxes are still based off the old november ratethe base market value used to calculate pi taxes needs to be automatically updated on a regular basisduring downtime every night an extra routine could be added to the downtime upkeep programs to pull average buy and sell prices for each individual pi material to set the next days taxesso if construction blocks are going for 5000 a unit on average at downtime then the next day a 10 tax on construction blocks should be 500i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
i believe that you have the foundation of the paradigm correct but your conclusion is incorrectyou are right in that it is ludicrously expensive and inefficient taking down a wormhole 1 kg at a time is silly even if the bombs were free your average wormhole has about a billion available mass can you imagine how long it would take you to fire a billion of these at a hole i did the math using a bomb launcher ii and firing every 135 seconds without any pause it would take you over 4280 years to close the hole if you have 10000 friends to help you you could all bang it out in 156 days you and i agree on this so far there are cheaper faster and more efficient ways to degrade a wormhole yet for some reason you are reticent to take the next step and agree that a 1kg device would not break the game perhaps you view such an admission as a camels nose under the tent
you are the one giving the variablesspecifications for your ideaturning my words agianst myself for specifications you choose is nothing short of aragoance and nothing more than bloated ego on your partif your going to turn this into a game then were done hereif you cant listen or read what other people are saying then dont bother posting herei cant help it if your the one giving stupid variables and numbers for an idea thats full of fail or game breaking at bestwether the bomb is 20 mil or 200 milwether the bomb drops 5kg or 5 millon kg or even 5 billion kg this is uneeded and defeats the purpose of what whs intends as far as riskreward balance is concernedthe mechanic is working as intended if you cant deal with itgo back to high secand leave wormhole space to the professionalsto me it was so very easy and simplewait it outor shove a ship through itwhy complicate itor break it that is my reasoning and motivation for shooting your idea downmaking it personal or calling me a trollis childish at best stop the evemail spam
why are you so angry
why are u trolling your own thread 
this idea is about as bad as outposts in wormholes or moongoo in wormholes or local in wormholes or stabilised wormholes or any of the terrible carebear wormhole ideas
each successive post from that guy has been more emotional and insulting the end result may well be that hes furious but thats his own doing ive refrained from insulting him simply because we disagree which is a courtesy i was not giveni continue to discuss this because i like the idea when someone points out a line of reasoning that i disagree with i try to debate it
what is it you like about your idea then  when i read it all i get from it is some form of risk averse method of closing wormholesanything that reduces the amount of ships flying in space is a bad thing in my opinion not having to cycle a wormhole by being able to stay safely at your end and lobbing some bombs from a distance just doesnt seem right to me
good luck convinceing him of that stop the evemail spam
there is something you can do against it load up a bait ship go ratting cloaked ship attacks you they probably pop a cyno sb swarm cometh your bait ship pops cyno three smart bombing chimeras appearif they dont attack you then wheres the problem alternatively stick an alt in their alliance and find out what they actually have and when theyve fleeted upi must admit cynotitan bridge mechanics are a bit lame in situations like this but if you cant get intel on whoever is attacking your systems or form a fleet to defend it then quite simply you dont deserve the spacecenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
its not just about 00 warfare lowsec has it even worse as you dont even have the option to drop bubbles and cans to decloak them when they are moving about in system
low sec no budy cares its a wast of space its only saving grace is no bubbles added to two things you can get no were alse level 5s and fw
i will make you a deal take away local completly and i will gladly support the creation of anticloaking technology i never said it wasnt a good idea i said it wasnt a good idea with local the way it is and i want to emphasis completly that means no sov mods no nothing just delayed local like it is in wormholesafter this the game would evolve you wouldnt be able to react until an attack is already underway this would cause a lot of outrage but it would also encourage teamwork something that many wh corps and alliances have while 00 elite corps cant even fathom the thought of ratting with a few other guys for safetymmos come and go but eve remains garresh
theres no real reason to afk cloak in lowsec you just log in and look for stragglers when your done just cloak up and log offmmos come and go but eve remains garresh
the other difference is that wspace has no cynos or hot drops also it takes a lot of effort to get a sizable invasion fleet in a wormhole so when you blow up an attacking ship it takes way more effort for that pilot to get back in the wormhole than just flying back home and getting in another covopsi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
not sure if it were a module that required bs level pg and a high slot had a 30km range and disabled your warp drive while turned on i could see some cat and mouse type play come out of this where it ends up being a pack of sbs vs a bsmaybe that could be a role for a black ops bs sure you can decloak the cloakies with that tachyon net module but you get to sit there and take it for 45 seconds if you switch that thing on
no touchy black opsthey are used for insertion into cyno jammed systems and general hot dropping of covert cloakiesthats itand that is the problemyour idea would only make it worseblack ops are not combat viable shipsinspite of their initial statsjust expensive jump bridges for a specific small niche that favors the user of said bridge and not the ship itselfmuch like the titans are doomed to reach of todaydoomsdays that cant shoot anything but capitials and genrally used as giant ship slinging shipsat least they have combat vaiabilitythere is absolutely nothing wrong with cloakieswe haev a few afk cloakers in our spaceand while they tend to be annoyingits good fun for the pvp gangs who go huntingif you cant deal with itthen you have no business living there in the first placeits mental warfare at bestkeen use of tacticsor just general lolsif local gets removedand ccp is still threatening to do so then this entire discussion is a compelte waste of timethere will always and ever be afk cloakersjust because you dont see itdoesnt mean its not thereyou think its bad nowwait until sheer and total paranoia sets in then youll really start crying your brains outps fragwarpping isnt an exploitccp acknowledges it as a valid tacticin fact they made some adjustemtns to ita couple expansions ago i seriously doubt they will ever consider it an exploit at that point stop the evemail spam
here is some idea to improve eve experience1  add an option in the hud to invert position between modules and buttons so we can have mods on the left side and buttons on the right2  let us see into corp containers through the corp asset windows exactly like alredy happen with personal assets if u have the container access role of course3  add a searchbox in the corp blueprint window the same that is alredy in all other assets viewer windows4  add a row into agent info window to show clearly if its available to u or not smth likeavailable yes noif no is showed another row above should saystanding requirements x towards corpfactiongodremove the text this agent provides missions to any pilot that meets standing requirements  of course so and pls pls adapt the text lenght to the window size like happens with chat windows im quite tired to resize each info window to be able to read the text5  let us askacceptcomplete missions remotely at least from few jumps far maybe through a skill quite often the warpjump time is more than what the mission requires and maybe u discover the next mission is in the same system than theprevious one very annoying original thread6  direct trade window doesnt remind the size and the position since i started play eve 3 years ago think its time to fix itsame goes for info window7  if youre trying to drag and drop some bpcs onto others drag  drop  stack item u get an error message saying the item cant be stacked and thats ok 1x bpc is correctly moved and the others stay where they were thats not so ok i think the warning message is correct but it should do the move anyway8  add an option to choose oldnew font maybe make more fonts available9  pls move the displayed distance of selected object in space not in the overview window to the beginning of text instead of the end like it is actuallythere are other little issues that i know but atm i dont remind will add them laterif anyone has some other things that would to see fixed ill be happy to update the first post think this way each of them will be more visiblety
1 ambivalent on this one2 thatd be nice3 yes please4 standings needed are iirc 0 l1 1 l2 3 l3 5 l4 if youre kicking it in a station it pretty clearly marks agents as available or not available to you if youre unsure you can check the agents personal info page somewhere in the attributes tab is a standings entry 5 missioning is already easy enough  ambivalent on this one as well6 do any windows remember size and position 7 yeah bpc stacking is a pain
8  be able to switch the ing font to the precruicible patch as opposed to playskool fontmake it a switchable optionas to the restsounds good to me1 stop the evemailUFFFDspam
at stations is pretty clear yes i was referring to the agent personal info window remotely checking if an agent is available or not before going there should be more clear i think ill be more than happy to have bounties or reward cutted if ccp think its needed to counterbalance the remote acceptcomplete feature anyway many missions ask u to deliver some item to the agent so dont think remote interaction would make mission runners double their gains i just would like to avoid uselessy wasting time for that there are hauling missions lol just noted the locked target list resets position on hte right side from time to time even if locked do u really prefer the old font that this to my eyes this seems a lot more clear and i assure my eyes work very fine
how about a whole bunch of fonts i wouldnt mind having verdana or arial or eve in comic sansi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea

for ccp a company from iceland of all places not to implement proper levels of beard power is just appalling for the balance of the game this issue must be addressed

couldnt tell you what they keep in their database but they have to be tracking every item as it is for anticheating purposes the database cost should be negligible as the data can just be cached forever it would be quite interesting to be able to see when you commissioned the ships
i have no idea what you are going on about or if you were tripping balls while making this threadi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
it might also be interesting to see a commissioned date in the km that way you can tell if youve deprived your target of ship or pod theyve managed to hang on to for a long while
so that we can get shiny loots and see more variations in fitssimple proposal
funny thing that is what they always say and ccp will no longer provide this data at least openly to the player base were pushing 2012 right around the corner and i would bet the bank they dont add that stat into the qen anymore they realy dont want to see the trueth of just how many players spend the majority of there time in high sec if they keep releasing that data on every qen and it holds at around that  or higher then the hardcore players would be hard pressed to defend there crap ccp knows were most of the players spend most of there time they just dont wish to say it out loud like in that qenhow ever if you wish to take your own snap shots all you have to do is1 hit your f10 key and select the tab labeled stars2 open your statistics folder3 select the option called averge pilots in space in the last 30 minutesspend the time doing that every time you log in and right before you go to log out then tell me were the over whelming majority of players spend there time in space in eveanswer high secedit on the other hand that is only pilots in space in the last 30mins so mybe all of lownull and npc null realy like spending there time always docked up could the be the real push for incarna ccp belives there lownull and npc null players realy realy like there station time and there for they wish to improve it for them i just dont know
the stats that show nearly 80 of characters not players in highsec seems to make some believe that is justification for and an endorsement by players actions for a further push to risk free pve consensual pvp and other themeparkish mechanics however the assumption is wrongmost players assess their actions and behaviors on whats most rewarding where can the most can be gained for the least effort and risk where the action is and what is most fun eve is also a game where a large portion of players have multiple accounts never mind multiple charactersit isnt that 80 of players would rather play under the protection of concord in highsec but if thats the easiest and safest way for them to make isk you can be sure thats where they will be if not with their main which they have fun with in null or low sec then with alt characters just because you make the most a situation does not mean you endorse that status quothen with most of the miners and pveing characters etc in highsec so too come the pirates and predatory type pvpers i dont mean to insult anyone but the empire wardecers and other similar types are the real pirates of eve at least as traditionally a pirate or privateer is thought of as being lowsec guys are more like gangs of road warriors from mad max they even live in a wastelandall of which point to the 80 figure indicating a serious unbalanced situation in eve not in that everyone wants highsec space wow but rather the risk vs reward is totally off in eve either non consensual pvp needs to be brought back full force to highsec pre p alliance wardec nerf or all the major sources of isk and minerals need to leave highsec
as part of an overall campaign to improve riskreward across eve i would like to see playerprotectionrevenge services ie concord get revamped instead of being a mandatory purchased paid for by taxes i would like to see it be optional that is concord would offer protection services to players in hisec systems on a subscription basis with the price of the subscription being determined by the lowest security level being covered by the subscription eg buying protection for 05 systems costs more than buying protection for 10 systems and by the secstatus of the pilot being covered covering lowersecurity pilots costs more pilots could also forgo subscribing to concord which would leave them open to attack even though they might be located in hisec new players would receive an automatic subscription for some period protected vs unprotected players could be distinguished via overview settings a kind of tweaked bountycontract system would allow playergroups to basically compete with concord in hisec perhaps offering lower prices for notsoguaranteed or swift revenge and maybe even provide this service in lowsec possibly making it more accessible to a greater range of pilots for a price another possibility would be to have the overview icon distinguishing protected and unprotected work on a color gradient observers could distinguish between players protected by highly effective providers those protected by notsoeffective providers and those with no protection whatsoever within hisec pilots would have the option of choosing between various qualities and prices of protection concord would be the highpriced goldstandard and various player groups could offer protection of a quality somewhere between that and nothing those choosing to go without protection would have lower operating costs but would be at a greater risk of being attacked
goose99 is a troll right otherwise hes just plain reedi mean come on deleting anomalies in null sec and move all isk faucets to high sec the most stupid idea ive read on here since ccp announced aurumyour plan would render sov more worthless than it currently is anoms are the only reason currently to hold sov beyond supercap production
add logistics ships repairing the killers to killmails
remove kms problem solved
best core idea ever plus its an isk sink
only if all empire including nullsec is covered and you dont know whos protected until you shoot them also concord should randomly roam and kill you your ship then receive no insurance payoutthere ship sink  isk sink instead of sinking others bring the sink onto you
first off im really happy about the new corp location system being able to distribute system bookmarks in wspace without copying bms into cans is awesomehowever with the current randomized delay it is a horrible pain in the arse to collaborate on system scanning because the unpredictability of when the bms actually show up in corp locationstypically a ts convo between our scouts goes like this1830 scout 1  added k162 bm to new wh folder1832 scout 2  i got a c5 wh here where is that bm folder i dont see it1832 random corp guy well i can see that folder its there1832 scout 2  insert random profanity k warp to me for c5 bm i will put it in corp locations once the folder showsthis will continue on and on and the more people scouting the more annoying it gets because the new items show up for some people but not for allif you want to implement delayed corp locations then fine but make sure that the information provided is consistently the same for everyone
 random corp guy i totaly love corp bm system but the way its works right now is not good you need to constantly open and close people and places window to check if those bms apeared in there or not really frustratingplease fix this bug please
while youre at it id like the option to simply store a bookmark as a corp bookmark on creation rather then having to make a personal one and dragging it over thats just an extra pointless step
that might be a session change thingalso when you create a book mark it gives you a drop down menu of what type of bookmark it is the corp folder needs to show up therei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
all supercapital pilots knew it was coming at some pointhow ever the nerf was over the top i feel the logout timer change would have been good and mybe the drone changes though i would have given them the ablity to fit a full possible flight of both fighters and bomers they also should have keept the 400 sig change to fighters as well but with smaller limited drone bays ya fighers are fine as isthe hit point reduction was pointless with logout timer change and not realy needed lose a hulk thats the hulk pilots fault and no one alsesgallente pos buy a differnt pos problem solvedso i have to pick 1358 im a moron cant you tell
1 supportedi agree with the idea that cs should be on grid
i have to say that i find off grid boosting lame even though i enjoy will adamas pvp videos and the fact that he doesnt hide that he uses off grid t3 gang links the boosts that these ships give are clearly profound and to be able to use them in relative safety is baad mmkay people who say you cant fit these ships for on grid boosting without utterly gimping them get a life and adapt your fitting its very easy remember only fleet command ships are supposed to be able to use three gang links simultaneously efficiently not t3sto that endi support the idea of on grid fleet boosting 1however i believe that off grid boosting should also be possible but at a heavily reduced effectiveness 50 or even 75 less effective as on grid boosting
in a fleet fight you can destroy your enemies damage dealers logistics ewarfare dictorshictors tacklers etcyou should be able to destroy your enemies fleet boosters as well destroying a fleet booster means removing enhanced abilities that may be affecting the entire enemy fleet thus possibly improving your odds in a fightthe concept of safespotted t3 with ganglinks running during a fight with cov opsinterdiction nullifier to move around unchecked is beyond terrible
no sentries are part of what keeps lowsec sane if you want to camp a lowsec gate you need either a gang that can tank sentries among them or a dedicated ship thats likely to die if someone actually fights back either way you are a target for other people around youif you remove sentries it will be interceptors or bombers with falcon support as far as the eye can see i want to encourage lowsec pvp not make it more lameyou could adjust flagging mechanics to reduce sentry effects on gang pvp for example if you shoot a flashy you could get a global anticriminal flag and lose sentry protection for 15 minutes you have taken the law into your own hands the police cant help you nowbut that would be a different topicwhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
on one hand its about choice you can put a 5 set and go pvp theoretically or you can stay docked or you can just not use a 5 set at all and go anywhere anytime you want it is probably to give players some choices that those learning implants where implemented in the first placeon the other hand when most players see themselves required to choose always the same option then the choice became illusory and that option became for all purposes a mandatory onesometimes i wonder if the struggle while the most apparent is in fact just the second most important feature of the game apparently a lot of players considers that progression their sacred skill training comes firsti acknowledge the problem people should not see themselves excluded from the multiplayer aspects of the game because this kind of stupid reasons im just not so certain what the best solution issand over awesome
the solution to goon risk aversion well it is clearly to remove risk from eve
the multiplayer aspect is central to any mmo there shouldnt be gameplay mechanics that discourage people from playing with others i would argue that its a good idea to have many mechanics that encourage people to play with others
yet you post from an altif you cant realize that your opinion is absolutely invalid i cannot help you its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i thought over it since at first i was against itbut i realized that it would be for the better in eve lose the learning implants

an often heard complaint is that the riskreward of manufacturing in lownullwormholes compared to hisec is offim not going type a wall of text on the issue going into that specific subject as its been debated at length in many threads alreadyit just occurred to me after the introduction of pocos that it could probably be easily fixed by taxing manufacturing slots in a similar wayslam 17 tax based on an item value of what ever you produce controlled by ccp on hisec station manufacturing slots and make this tax lower as security status slides downfor example hisec station 17lowsec station 10npc nullsec 5sov nullsec  controlled by station ownerdoing something like this you would actually make it possible for industrialists in more lawless space to produce cheaper making it worthwhile to do so
base costs everywhere should also vary by the demand for slots so that manufacturing slots in busy hisec areas should cost a lot more than slots in quiet npc null stations again pc owners of relevant structures should be able to set their own pricing  at varying rates according to standing like with pocos
ok so you throw a smlsaa into a pos to skip the taxif yes then ccp fix the goddamn pos first
yes a pos being owned by you obviously wouldnt get taxed but thats ok as poses carry risk they can be destroyedmy gripe and that of many other non hisecurity industrialists is that despite the extra risk and effort we put in we gain no competitive advantage reallycurrently producing in lowsec or nullsec tends to cost more then simply building in hisec and shipping finished product introducing a taxsupply demand for slots mechanism would largely correct this

i would just like to say that i fully endorse many of the ideas in this thread as well as this one
i would have to agree having something much larger and grander would be great i wouldnt mind going on hunts however with how it stands there isnt much epic feeling to it by adding a bit more and taking some care to this part of the game would add more action for players to jump on i think jesse hit it on the head when it comes to the bounty hunting in this game
yes i am specifically asking for clarification on ccps vague and contradictory comments and details on what to expect in the next 12 monthsthere is no need for the antieverythingthatisntflyinginspace crowd to get their knickers in a twist just yet but they are welcome to do soit would be great to get a response from csm or ccp on this
after participating in another thread i see two broad options for wisthe first is that each expansion has a major focus on fis and a minor focus on wis much as crucible had a lot of inspace stuff and a small update to incarna in the form of the captains quartersthe second is an expansion at some point that delivers the full featured incarna multiplayer establishments et al and then subsequent expansions that focus only on fis
i fully support the questioning of ccp on matters such as this however the experience i have with public relations and marketing tells me that ccp will release information when they actually have something they can market so it is possible they are working on new clothes that actually have color to them and they may just be also working on station environments but the simple fact is that they would only tell us if it encouraged more people to play or somehow caused an increase in revenue ccp above all else is a business this is especially truesignificant this year also keep in mind that ccp is horribly understaffed they run a tight ship and only allow a specific allocation of resources to given projects if ccp was less top heavy in how it spends it money then there would be the potential for better overall qualityhowever right now the impression i get from the people on the inside i talked to is that ccp likes having small teams because it is both cheaper and has a lower potential for conflict and disorganization the problem with this is that game companies competing with ccp have more resources and staff so they can pump out quality content at a much faster and consistent rate now do not misunderstand me i am not trying to tell anybody at ccp how to run things i only have a ba in management and am by no means an expert or verified authority on such matters i am only trying to make the argument that ccp functions the way it does because it is managed to function that way if ccp were to get acquired overnight by some observably wealthy 22 year old virgin then i can promise things would change and more people would be hired these easily reproduced bugs and experience breaking problems would be fixed in beta there would be more then 2 gender options and the game would have a system by which all nontrial users could vote on what they think the focus of the dev team should be i would of course have a special team of no less then 35 devs and other staff with the exclusive focus and function of seeding the game with futanari references both written and visual in nature
dare i ask how long is ccp planning on fixing revamping and adjusting fis content and settings before they get it rightseems to me theyve been at that since 2003 and it never gets done with more and more suggestions and demands for fis stuff with each passing day from the very same people who demanded an end be put to incarna or they rage quit at this rate fis will never be done and we might as well go play 2nd life so perhaps ccp should have 1 team dedicated to fis and a 2nd to wis with a 3rd for everything in betweenthat having been said i started playing eve for freelancer styled spaceships ive been flying that ship for the last few years now and its the same thing over and over again get ship fly ships run into other ships lose ships repeat cycle im about ready to retire to a permanent life of space barbie jewing isk in my gentlemans establishmenttherefor i too would like some clarity on this facet of eve can we haz space barbie for realz now
how are these contradictory approaches pray tellas ive been saying throughout this thread  the next 18 months will most likely be fis heavy with fixes to all the broken things being at the forefront pos fw sov lowsec hisec wspace corp roles etc wis stuff will be little and extra to the fix content  maybe a corporatealliance office or something slowly ramping up to the full experience once everything is in a happy place and they can neglect fis for an expansion cycle the full wis thing will be unveiled this patch will have soso fis stuff once wis is fully rolled out a balanced approach to the stuff though tbh i dont see much more than performance tweaks or a handful of new nex items ever really being added  theres only so many iterations of mall foodcourt that can be done
who said anything about them being contradictory approachesplus this thread isnt really about endless speculation anyway this thread was about asking the csm to ask ccp what their plans are for wis over the next 12 months simple reallydo you get it yet
well so far after 50 days 70 pages and 1381 messages ccp has said an done nothingalso from what csm say about the meeting apparently they didnt even talked about wis anyway i am still waiting for meissa anunthiel to answer my mail on the issuemy impression is that wis has become that broken half cooked feature nobody is going to look at for yearsso rather than pay 6 months of subcsription as i was due tomorrow and which likely would had fueled the development of a lot of nullsec shUFFFDt i dont care about i just sold some stuff to afford a plex while i wait for the minutes to come out maybe im naive to think theyll be out by january 14 but alas my alt account already was paid until may 2i am no longer playing eve and its a matter of time until i stop paying for nullsecs featureswith an empty and overprized nex store no fullfledged incarna no new casual content no new solo content and no new pve content i wont keep paying for someone else a getting all fun
yeah i am feeling the same really personally i dont understand the lack of response from ccp on incarna particulary given their active participation in other threads its really confusing as to why they wont give a decent response on the future of wisi dont have any problem with null sec getting some loving as every area of eve should get some dev love even those i dont personally participate in but i dont want wis to be abandoned
first off please excuse my grammar i realise its badi have to agree there are some problems with when 1 is considered aggressed examples 1 the guy using smart bombs in a mission gets concorded when a fleet member from his own alliance happens to alow his to wounder into the smart bomb regardless to alliance and fleet 2 a ganker that sends 5 heavy drones after you from 40 km you pop his drones as there heading straight at you and hence you can track them but you get poped because the drones are not considered hostel till after they close range and start firing the bigger ishue here thou is that eve is a realistic universe with realistic market and hence you must earn your ships and such throu lots of time and so on but unrealistic negitaves for breaking the rules of said world the guy who earned a trafic ticket gets the same treatment as the mass murder that said the simplest way to fix the problem is take away inshurance payouts to death by concord make concord kill pods apon repeat offenders and standing drop increses more after each offence while ganking is still do able your resons need to be more worth it no more greving newbs and truning them away from the game
no leniency no way no howyes to education have the devs cook up a new tutorial session where person is given a ship by concord and instructed to do something darwinian  throw in a bunch of text to explain what happened and why zero chance of exploitation you know it will happen sooner or later and the npe guys gets something new to get their nerd onps have devs trawl the code to make sure there are not some modulesactions that are somehow evading the warningpopup

and as many of you have the issue of me having the cca 20 000 sp boost a month assuming 30day month 20 000  1 857 600 translates into less than 108 boost lets add that accounts that are or ever were paid or ever bought a plex by credit card paypal account or bank account that my account ever was are not eligiblesatisfied
nonot everneverend of discussionthis proposal was dead the moment you typed it upand we will continue to swat it down like the annoying fly it is stop the evemailUFFFDspam
noyour idea will lead to a perpetual increase in the cost of pi because its causing price inflation via increasing taxation allot of players are offsetting the increased tax costs by passing the costs down to the end buyerconsumer so the more they pay to extract the more you pay to buyleave the tax price base as it iswe still have to witness a full transition to 00  wh pocos and or denial of access to pi networks via standings and the effect that will have on the pi market supply will be effected in a bad way with 00 sov holders being the main producers of large quantities and demand will remain constant if not increase that in itself will be driving up the value of pi goods if a 00 alliance owns the sovereignty planets with a few networks on them will produce more isk in large enough numbers than 1 or 2 techmoons do on a monthly basis
admittedly this idea did solidify while i was closing more and more wormholes it started off as a wouldnt it be nice if we didnt have to jump back and forth concept however i maintain that this device wouldnt be limited to carebears it can be deployed on a hole that someone else wants to keep open i would be irritated if someone used these things on my hisec openings or trapped me in a system i didnt want to be inthe main allure to me is forwarding the game adding flexibility options and growth these devices would shake things up and i expect that the result would be a far more interesting wspace experiencei understand your concern about ships in space and i dont envision these bombs removing that i would like to see a balance struck where these bombs are rare enough expensive enough and limited enough that they only supplement rather than replace the current wormhole closing methods the ideal situation in my opinion would be to have the players treat the bombs as ideal in certain situations but otherwise not worth the money or effort one last point i wanted to make was with the idea of risk and i was thinking the other day that the use of these devices is a guaranteed loss once the bomb is fired hit or miss that isk is gone but an armor plated afterburner fitted battleship can close holes until its luck eventually runs out i admit the bombs would make it safer to close wormholes although if this is a sticking point i am happy to discuss ways to make it less so but that safety costs isk
first battleships can shoot back even if fired uponthose armor plates add a staggernig amount of ehp and its just enough to get backup called in at worst case the guy tossing the bomb will likely die in 1 to 2 salvossecond your removing risk not adding to itthird and most miprotaintly your idea is far more expensivea battleship is not likely going to die on the first shotonce againyou prefer to listen to yourselfand ignore everyone else stop the evemail spam
again i am baffled by your conclusions you say that the battleship can defend itself and is a tough nut to crack with all of the armor plating while the bomb tosser is more fragile and easier to kill to me that sounds like it is a lot riskier to be the bomb tosseras for it being more expensive youre right although the 20 million is just a ballpark guess of what a good price might be in the long run using bombs like this likely will end up costing someone more money than just by using battleships the bombs would add a different method for closing wormholes that would provide speedconveniencetactical advantage but demanding a high price in some cases it might be the best option in others it wouldnt that decision ultimately will be made by the player if people think these devices are a waste of time they wont be used and the problem will self correct

we know its not an exploit that doesnt mean it shouldnt be to be honest though the only reason i dont rage too much about the mwd trick is because i use it more often than other players doit still surprises me that so many people fly around low sec unscouted yet none of them ever just stick a cloak in one of their highs makes any ship as good as a cov ops for moving about i use it to get my nont3 pve ships about all the time dbut still yeah even ill admit its lamecenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
i have no problem with cloakies rather like them in fact thats why the counter would be so risky and so weak that youd need to think it extraordinarily worthwhile to scan a 30km radius just for a decloak the cloaked ship still would have the upper hand in general stay 30km away from the black ops nor does it have to be a black ops but it should be something big and expensive and risky

adding more isk via bounties  overseers artifacts doesnt seem right to me neither do the taxes on goods even if it is part of roleplay isk should flow freely and not be added or taken away magically giving players control of the custom offices in low sec null sec and wormhole space is a step in the right direction so why not give people control of custom offices in all of high sec economic warfare should have a greater prescence this can also apply to agents too so they no longer give out isk but other bonuses which include lppeople shoot rats mainly for the bounties though not always is it fun bounties could be replaced by special loot inside particular faction rats say serpentis boosters guristas missiles etc for taxing of goods make it so that the corporations and or alliances receive the tax income give people more tools to deprive others of their isk if there is only a set amount of isk at any one time in the eve universe it would reduce the chance of inflation let the rich become richer not because they can shoot the most officers but because of skill in manipulating the markets and cunning you dont need isk to have fun in eve so the poor will not lose out
no and how the hell are noobs supposed to get isk to by new ships if mission agents dont pay for the missions all loot dropped from low level rats is next to worthless this is just another nerf hisec because there is no risk thread
lol a convincing and well thought out argumenti think notlets see incursion rats and drones and sleepers dont have bounties hmm how do the players and new players that kill them get their isk salvage doesnt drop isk how do players get their isk from salvage here is an answer they sell the loot on the marketnew loot can be created if inter medris could be bothered to read i specifically mentioned special loot to replace the bountiesthe no bounties idea would also apply to low sec ands high sec bounties would simply be replaced by items that you sell on the market specific agents could drop more lp and new items to sell etc
think about what youre saying there for a while youll soon realize how stupid the idea of stopping any and all isk injections arei do agree that there is too much isk being created but cutting isk injections altogether is a terrible terrible idea
yep how do you think irl economy works hint gold standard no longer in effect
at the minimum carriers should have the storage capacity of an orca if eve carriers were rl theyd all be using a single closet as storage for the entire ship sizewise leading to some pissed off janitors change it theres no reason not to
carebear fact
neverownedacapitalfactgo pew moar ice
i will  cos the hold on my orca is big enough
cargo expanders in the lows and the t2 cargo rigs work just finenub
watthe killmail from that would be delicious im aware i can fit expanders and  dingleberry that doesnt fix the core storage issue that all carriers suffer from
he wants carriers to be the new jfs
not quite a buffed carrier in this regard is nowhere close to the size of a jf dont be naiveback to poastingperhaps half orca stats would please those elite jf pilots screaming noes i paid billions to have that spaze a compromise if you will
aside from your flagrant attitude maybe you should take the time to give us your reasons you feel a carrier should be turned into an industiralist hauler and spend a little less time coming across as a playground bully stop the evemail spam
on a serious note i do ask why the necessity for this change yes it would be nice to store fuel  more then 1 capital mod in there to swap from triage to pantheon fit on the fly but it is not necessary as you make it sound to be that is why you either a have a hauling alt  hauling  to follow you around with that stuffs or b you make wise choices before undocking
im just retrolling the trollers bro i expected such now since youve replied all serious and such ill respond in kind the carriers primary role is to support deployment to lownull space sure she can fit a nice contingent of ships with her but the cargo space to support the deployment of those ships is severely lacking so you have an average skilled player with access to an average 12 billion isk asset meant for that sort of deployment with the storage capacity of rigged out badger ii once again if were going to try to apply balance and rl stats to pixels it should at least be semirealistic in nature it just makes no sense as it is right now
rl life or notthe carriers role is of 2 major purposes1 to commence triage on the battlefield logistics and why the  did ccp use that damn word2 to haul ships to its destination or provide support in that sensethe carrier is not an industiralist shipits not designed to haul cargo enmassenow last i checkedyou can haul a ship with ammocharges in its cargo baybut nothing elseand guns cant be loaded for some odd reason feel free to correct me on that pointthe only other thing youd haul would be modules and fittingsand they arent that largea jump freighter is superiour in every respect when it comes to hauling supplies of that nature a jf isnt best suited to hauling ships that are fitted however but thats where the carrier fills that niche to a pointso i get you want to stike a balancebut the tools are already presentuntil you can give me a valid argument aside from this would be nicecant really support thisps irl a carrier is not a cargo hauler eitherit relies on its flotilla and outside support to get its suppliesand comparing a floating city to one in eve is a bit of a stretchok maybe not even close to thatand its internal supplies as far as that carrier is concerned is not one of cargo hauling to other bases of operationthats tasked to cargo haulerssuch as c31s or even ship freighters your logic at that rate is reachingps2 not that im saying this a terrible ideajust hard to justify stop the evemail spam
are you implying a carebears opinion is any less valuable than your ownthe way youre sounding right now you look like an idiot
on the surface it could be difficult to justify given all the other tools at our disposal however the average grunt that would benefit from this sort of change the most probably doesnt have a multibillion isk jf and skilled character at the ready and definitely not his own flotilla of alts and ships to support a simple deployment the orca comparison i made was based simply on size so i retract that one is an industrial and the other not however i still propose some buff to at least a third of capacity in both areas
its not as expensive as it seems to afford a jfspecially if your attempting to support a multi billion if not trillion alliance that requiers supplies to field capssuch as a carrierjfs are expensive because of long range and massive cargo hulaing capabilitybut they are risky to use and employi myself am a jf pilotand currently working towards a second one to aid my corpallianceas far as carriers are concernedthey fill their niche quite wellthe only thing id like to see is a bit more offensive capabilities if not some additional defenseas far as cargo hauling not really convinced it will do muchbut then it wouldnt hurt eithercarriers dont do a whole heck of alota carrier in irl is capable of inititating attacks and strikes by deployment of its fighter crafta carrier in eve isnt even close to thatit drops fighters surebut they are just frigate sized drones that couldpossibly be a problembut not an offensive problemat besti may not have a solid answer to your argumentbut a jf is more preferable for the role you seek than a carrier would bebut as ive said yet againtheres no harm in buffing cargo space either stop the evemail spam
have you looked into the rorqual yes it is an extra two weeks of training for barge 5 if you dont already have it but it seems to fill the role youre looking for and doesnt require reworking any existing shipsi will admit that i wouldnt mind seeing some more cargo room in carriers but there are alternatives
wouldnt workrorquals are restriced to only carrying industrialist class ships in the ship maint arraywhile it can haul a jf wins out even with price tag attachedgranted the rorqual is likely going to do better in its nasty array of drone defensesbut then an orca would surpass it as far as ship carrying abilityeven a carrieroffense and defense is debatable stop the evemail spam
i believe i would look fantastic with a beard supportedcenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
agreed beards longer ones could even have movement like long hair does when your avatar moves their head i want to have braids and plats in my beard too
if enough players support it way more than the previous attempt i think wed have a good chance of at least being heard wouldnt you say
oh my god they listened and changed it3
so they can start posting the smack and general bs in other parts of the forums how about no does no work for you
its sort of like the ghost trap in ghostbusters you dont want those ghosts getting all over the other forums do you
or in the case of my alliance a grease trap 
no the eve community has to rethink virtual items there are already micro transactions in eve convert plex to isk spend tiny amounts of real money through isk as a proxy eg for a pile of imperial navy multifrequency l crystals the nex is a luxury virtual goods store nothing micro about those transactions at allother markets have shown that halving the cost of an item approximately doubles the sales there is no advantage to having lowvalue items ie traditional micro transaction item stores people who want the items will find the money to buy them regardless of cost this is what ccp zulu was on about with his 1000 designer jeans statement for the insanely rich price is not a consideration for the record there are also 100k designer jeans out there along with UFFFD42b luxury sports cruisers made of goldwhen it comes to convenience items or concierge items as per fearless i am of two minds on one hand they are a vile foul addition to the game that will inevitably lead to the corruption of ccp by simple greed on the other hand they are a useful tool to allow freetoplay ie unlimited length trials without overly impacting the rest of the game having more people online will lead to more people being online that is the more people any one player can interact with the less likely they will be to simply log out and go play some other more interesting game if you dont think that simply having more people online at any one time is a worthwhile goal go talk to us players in california or australiannew zealandse asian players in generalhopefully ccp gains some useful insights from the 60 day trial experiment which is really just an extension of the 51 day trial experiment theyve already been performing what impact will freetoplay accounts have on the rest of the game assuming there are sufficient barriers in place to make subscribing attractive
absolutely no mts eliminate nex and aurum and allow these items to be produced by players this summer and the exodus that occurred should have sent that message ccp cant keep ignoring the player base if they want eve and dust to succeed
microtransitions  non where n  infinity
 no to microtransactions lots of people despise them as the devil including myself and i have a feeling that a lot of eveplayers feel the same way this is a sandbox mmo not world of tanks if i had wanted microtransactions i would play another game the player economy is whats awesome with eve and ccp should focus on making it more awesome instead of trying to compete with world of tanks and similar implement painjobs and such not as rmt but as more gameplay for the sandbox more content  better sandbox  more players
i do hope the csm brought ccps attention to this thread during the recent summit i look forward to some specific notes on the issue in the upcoming minutes
the best you would be able to store is the date the ship was actually assembled  ie not the date it was built but the date someone right clicked on the item stack and said assemble ship that date would be lost at any point someone repackaged the shipthe problem is that in order to conserve database rows an item doesnt get its own row if its part of a stack the stack gets a row with a quantity indicator that shows how many of that item are in the stack when the ship gets assembled it gets its own row that you can store the name etc in but if the ship gets repackaged that data is destroyed
the whole concept of station games is boring and lame the best way to deal with station games is to make it so that both sides can force their opponents out of stations by paying a small fee the party can bribe the station owner into kicking someone out of the station and forcing them to engage them this will be both good and bad for both sides the dynamics of highsec war decs will change with this
i see you trollin
all the while while your and 9 other buddies sit outside roflstomping the poor bastards when he pops outs while afk no no no and no
on the very off chance that this isnt a troll i have to agree that station games are boring and lame but your suggestion to create a sitting duck shooting gallery isnt the way to fix or eliminate them
in eve there are several problems with the graduation from high sec to low sec there is a huge difference between 05 and 04 my proposal is to smooth it out with an npc response that is instadeath in 10 to a slow buildup of police in 01 with a smoother graduation the risk can increase a little more linearly giving 05 some danger and 04 some safety compared to what we have nowmy proposal is to have concord be certain death with a response time like we have now the difference is that the faction police would take over the job for 05 and below a ganker in 05 could live if they were quick enough below is the outline of the idea1 concord and faction police are different forces concord are still unbeatable but the faction police are killable and escapeable introduce faction hits for committing any infraction that causes the faction police to show up bigger faction hits for actually killing faction police as the sec status goes down faction police response is lower and slower in a 09 you might get a very large and instantaneous response in a 01 it might take 2 minutes for the faction police to show up and they trickle in slowly as long as the pirate is criminally flagged or undesirable status the drops on faction police would contribute to lp or tags or something fw no isk2 more granularity for security status no more highlow00 splits with very little difference between them each step means a meaningful something concord and faction police show up for things but at different times concord are inescapable but the faction police are more numbers based and may have scrambling ships 05 you might be able to escape from the faction police maybe concord shows up from 10  06 from 05 to 01 only faction police show up10  no wardecs honoured instant concord no insurance this is basically newbie friendly space highly reactive faction security forces islands of very safe space around every faction stronghold  newbie centre09  concord delay 3 seconds08  war declarations honoured concord delay 6 seconds07  concord delay 9 seconds06  longer concord delay 15 seconds05  no concord faction police only a response time of 12 seconds and a strong response possible to escape it will chase pilots around and contain warp scrambling ships good ai and an escalation every minute to ensure that they are not chained or takable for long periods of time it would be possible for criminals to run away and jump out of system or dock if you gank in this space you should die half the time04  faction police only response time of 20 seconds the initial force in would not scramble the faction forces get reinforced every 1 minute introducing scrambling ships and escalating until the criminals are no longer in system03  faction response 40 seconds approximately half the response of 04 systems02  faction response 1 minute approximately half the response of 03 systems01  faction response 2 minutes approximately half the response of 02 systems00  as it is now
im ambivalent on the wardecs thing being limited to 08 on down if only for the simple fact that it turns hiding in stations into hiding in 10 spaceheres a rough idea i came up with for some other thread10  no changes from current09  rats introduced08  07  no changes changes from current06  05  remove concord replace with navies navies can be avoided system rules otherwise unchanged04  no navy welcome to supercaps online03  01  no changes00  no changesin 09  00 reduce the respawn timers on rocks no more of this onceday stuffnow slow down concord in 09  07 systems essentially to what happens in 05 or 06 now 2030 sec or so have the navies work in waves with the waves showing up in the same timelines as concord 2030 secfirst wave  normal navy ships iirc no scramssecond wave  scrams brought inthird wave  enough dps to concordokken you if youre still alivewith that then you can choose to sit around through the first wave and gtfo just as the second is coming in so about a minute if you run from the navy you have 15 minutes to bounce around the system before the gatesstations let you pass now since youre running from the navy they wont bother with the waves as youre running around youll have 20 sec or less to reenter warp after youve landed at a celestial or safespot before the concordokken fleet arrives for those of you thinking hey ill just safe up and cloak  the navy will cheat in this regard ie see right through your cloak
concord used to be tankable then they had to be made wtfpwn because people were tanking them
sounds good change it up
they had a dress on sisi but movementwise it did no more than the skirts do no flow simply flexing with the body movements
that is terriblewe all know ccp can do better than that with carbon
im supporting bouncing boobies personally with my own hands if i have to
possibly one of the best suggestions i have heard when it comes to getting more warm bodies out to lowsec and lowering the stigma for the casual pvper to kill others in lowsec1
this actually sounds like a very good idea i like the idea of being able to shoot someone with 001 sec status without consequencethe only comment i would make is that a 20 sec status after killing a lot of ships is fairly easy to rat up perhaps you should have a real sec status that keeps dropping as you get into fights but an effective sec status that wont go below 199either way 1
an excellent idea id like to see this implementedreducing gcc to 5 minutes instead of 15 would also be a big help as most people just cloak or dock up and have to stop playing for 15 minutes which is another factor reducing the fun
needs a bump bump1
well for this just pay out the bounty a little bit at a time based on the value of the podlets say i have an 80 mil bounty on me someone pods me while i was in a 2 mil clone with 10 mil worth of implants they get 12 mil and my bounty goes down to 68 milthat way people would still get a reward for podding people with bounties but i couldnt throw myself a pod party to collect my own bounty because id only gain as much isk as id losei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
well done for reading the rest of the proposal
allright you got mei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
i dont like the idea of limiting bounties to kills because there are more reasons for bounties than violence corp thieves scammers et cetera could all draw substantial bounties without firing a shotalso id love to see it used in times of war where an alliance could designate priority targets via internal bounty contracts enabling them to put prices on the heads of certain enemies
agreed in principle but how do you create a mechanic that allows corp thieves to have a bounty put on their head but that doesnt open any corp director who spends corp isk to being killed for ita bounty system that is based on killrights could conceivably mesh with the wardec system since the essence of a wardec is that it allows all of corp a and corp b to have mutual killrights then members of corp a could put bounties on wartarget corp b that can only be collected by members of corp a
lol i dont see why this alt thing is such a big deal same person despite the character they dont agree with you and your response is to call them cowards and go on and on about alts come back with a real response dude grow up clown
i find this extremely convenient that this discussion comes up when implants are added to killmails
didnt we just finish the same  argument about learning skills
oh if you dont want implants dont use them  they are working as intended giving new levels of risk vs reward to the offendedoffendersyour problem is 24h timer on the clones but that is working as intended as well there has to be some obstacles otherwise it will make you stop concerning about your character and im sure people love when the one they destroy whine about loosing his hard working skill boosting implants 
your credibility diminishes significantly when you discuss risk aversion with an unaffiliated forum alt thats why its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
hey ive got a better idea lets remove the skill descriptions that way eve will be even more unique and less dumb than wow people should figure out what tactical logistics reconfiguration does by themselves no seriously graphical skill trees arent dumb or wow theyre just logical having to click on every single skill or use a third party programwiki to figure out the skill dependencies is a bit  i actually did just that but it would just make more sense for it to be included in the game
shameless bumpurl
low sec 00 and wh do have a distinct advantage in that they have access to all mineral types for their manufacturing whereas hi sec dwellers dont they have to buy it off the market but this is offset by the logistical cost of moving finished product to market hubs  talking about small scale industrialist here not bulk mass producing industrialist that buy their minerals off the marketsone thing to think about is standings  how would that come into play with tax rate
poses in highsec are currently invulnerable but broken wardec mechanics are another topici like the idea of manufacturing slots prices fluctuating based on demand like office costs
umadbro no
nice idea i to support this
very much aware of that issue im operating under the assumption ccp will actually redo the wardec system at some point im an optimist on the minerals issue not really true almost all trit used in null and lowsec is actually shipped in from hisec nobody mines veld in lownull sec 
the notion of a lossmail going to the pilot recording it as a selfdestruct makes sense no killmail though
so when my isp resets my ip address ccp should lock my accounthmmmaybe we should limit it to jumping subnetsbut that happened to me a while back when my isp moved our routing from copper to fiber which goes to a different city and a different subnet and what about when i log on using free wifi while im traveling or i go to my brotherinlaws house we get to talking eve and i log in on his pc to show him something i dont want to jump through hoops every time i play eve from somewhere other than my own house gasp i go outside  just so that you can feel like theyre doing everything they can to protect you from getting your stuff stolen
because everyone uses phones that support whatever app store this would be available onno keep your convoluted security schemes to yourselfin 15 years of internet access ive had one security breach one and that resulted in someone using my pc to operate an irc bot network yeah it makes no sense to me eitherone so poorly administered that i was able to take it over when i discovered the bots presence that made for an amusing couple of days
likely scenario1 op bought isk2 isk came with a free keylogger3 op logs into eve4 keylogger gets acct infos 5 rmters login to acct management and change the details they already know a toon on the acct since hey he gave them the name of the toon to give the isks to thus bypassing the hey we dont recognise this ip whats a toon on this acct enquiry6 rmt bastards sold the toon and got all the isk they sold the op back from the saletldr  buying isk is a bad idea
less  more eve i think its unfair to demand ccp fix your stupiditybut if your keen on said pr 0n remember to go go great firewall
computer says no
okay problems i see with this scenario1 what ship are you flying that you cant track heavy drones yet are at risk of being ganked by them before concord supplies you with a free flight of heavy drones to scoop2 what ship is the ganker flying that can point you at 40 km preventing you from escaping3 why are you trying to target and shoot a full flight of drones rather than simply aligning so you can warp out as soon as the drones fire a shot and concord is triggeredif you ever die to a ganker from 40 km away and they didnt alpha you its because you are terrible at eve
why did he bother engaging the drones in the first placewait it outshooting them makes it worse stop the evemail spam
actually i dont really agree with that the price will always stabilize at whatever people can make a profit at just look at the profit margin on something that is easy to make and has a high consumption rate like ammo your average highsec miner will took at their minerals and look at what they can build with those minerals and if they can make even one isk more selling the finished product over the raw minerals they will do iti did some math and feel free to correct me if i am wronglets say you are doing the most tax expensive thing with pi importing refined commodities building and exporting specialized commodities to selli got these prices off of the average buy price in empire space from eve central so i dont know what the actual prices would be in your regionlets say you are making neocoms that cost 8000000 per unit youll need to buy biocells at 919191 per unit and silicate glass at 464692 per unit youll need 5 biocels 4595955 isk 5 silicate glass 2323460 isk which will produce 3 neocoms which can be sold for a total of 24000000 isk so after buying all the biocells and silicate glass if you sell the neocoms youll make 17080585 isk in raw profit without taxesnow lets say you paid 10 taxes on the current market value of all the materials once to import the 5 biocells and 5 silicate glass and once again to export the 3 neocoms that comes out to 3091942 isk subtract that from your raw profit and after taxes you are still left with 13988644 iskso if my math is right my spreadsheet looks ok so far if you set up your planets in jita paying carebear tears 10 tax based on live market data for every factory churning our neocoms youd make 13988644 per hour and anyone with decent pi skills can put quite a few factories on a planet and have quite a few planets running yeah youll miss out on the 3091942 per factory per hour tax but thats the price you pay for the warm embrace of a concord security blanketafter fiddling with the numbers i figured out that ccp could raise the tax to 55 of market value before youd stop making a profit on neocoms granted at that point the profit margin on pi in highsec would be so low that people probably wouldnt botheri honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
thing is yeah  right now the prices are really high for stuff because nearly everyone is paying 10 or 17 tax  give it a little while for people to start venturing into low and prices will probably start to drop stupid lemmings who drop the price because theyre paying 11 less tax than they used to
drake i think what is obvious to anyone who reads this thread is that you either are a troll my opinion or cant handle anyone disagreeing with youyouve become increasingly belligerent and have tried to use your anger and insults as a substitute for mature rational discussion you imagine that you being butthurt makes you right or that at least people who read your rants will give your comments more weight because of your passion and indignation but really your comments are hollow youve offered very little to the debatehours and time do you think that i am proposing that the only way to close wormholes from now on should be through the use of bombs because thats not part of my idea at all if the bombs are a pitiful waste of time then i expect that they wouldnt be used you have gone back and forth from this being an instawin too powerful game breaking idea to it being a waste of hours and also time those are two completely opposite positions and for the sake of your credibility in this discussion it behooves you to pick one
so if thats truethen everyone else whom have opposed you are trolls and belligerant ok got itthanks stop the evemail spam
this ideal situation wouldnt happen to be one where you want to collapse a hole when it may be a risky to do so via conventional means would itsigh three pages im done let it die please
youre comparing slow ships very valuable that can get stuck on wrong side or ganked easily with cheaps quick and cloaked sleath bombers theres something wrong on your logicim not against the idea of a weapon to close wh bombs seems good for lore but horrible from gameplay point of viewthe ships to launc your bombs must be immobilized for a moment it must be in dangerfor example it could be a system like the one of heavy interdictor or like a siegetriage modeyou cant move or very slowy during a moment while you use your closing moduleif you do it this way im okay but theres no way ill accept something doable with a frigate sized ships and a covert ops cloak
concerning this i have put forward an idea to help mitigate the risks of hotdrops
i moved out to null for fleet fights but all i got were these stupid hot dropsi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
thisdissonance is recruiting members
a drag bubble offgate with your magic decloaker sitting in the right spot and youve nerfed cov ops into oblivion it will be completely useless for anything other than afk cloaking
the original topic was a decloaking device for frag warping mainly when someone jumps through a gate and cloaks immediately before their initial cloak wears off
its called a gatecamp with smart bombs andor dronesherp derp stop the evemail spam
so youre suggesting this decloaking module not work on covert ops cloaksit sounds less atrocious when you put it that way
or you stop gate camping and learn to catch ships other waysps i have never seen ccp classify it as an exploit source please
its obviously a broken game mechanic as it makes someone using it untouchable stop all your high and mighty and think before you talk looks like youre the one with the foolish statementsim hiding in an npc corp because i use this broken game mechanic all the time it makes me untouchable and it proves ccp has a broken sandbox everytime i sit cloaked in a system from dt to dtalso the cloaky nulli t3s make it even easier to use this broken game mechanic as its almost impossible to catch them without a lot of people and a lot of work
you sir are not untouchable your invisiblethats the differenceyou can still be killed by area effect weaponryyou can be found by disruption of your cloakand you can be trackedambushedblown up with some very careful planningyour also unarmed for the duration of your cloaknot to mention unable to activate any modules unless your covert cloak capabale and that only grants warpthat is not a broken game mechanicthat is aragonance on your partand sheer stupidity in othersyou call it broken because you think its broken because you use it to its fullest capabilitiesyou just didnt bother to think about how to counter it propperlyso your answer is to cry like a fat baby in need and tell everyone else they are stupid and demand ccp fix itkeep telling yourself its brokenyou might even start to beleive the lieno one said taking down a cloakie was supposed to be easystop treating it as suchi have been on recieving end and giving end of such thingsi even nearly lost my covert ops frigate to a near miss of a space bombcount on ityou sir are not as untouchable as you think you areand im quite sure there are a great many people who would be more than happy to prove you wrongps and stop treating it as its a broken mechanic becasue solo peopel cant take you downeve is not a solo gameits a multiplayer gamethat means getting a team together stop the evemail spam
no cloaking should remain as it is today
eve is about risk if you dont like afk cloakers then risk going out and running sites and getting popped if you dont like that risk then dock up and quit whining or better yet go back to high sec where you can carebear in safety
so uhhow exactly do you propose people make money in nullsec under this then by selling useless items to people who are already swimming in them
in a reality with scarce goods you could probably make this idea work but eve doesnt work that way asteroid fields magically repopulate after downtime rats respawn endlessly and ice never disappears fixing the economy to a finite resource will simply result in massive deflation as items will flow into the system faster than they are destroyed youre simply swapping one problem too much isk for another one too much stuff which creates a skewed market
following your suggestion to remove isk faucets wholesale while keeping isk sinks isk would become a scarce resource with limited supply which will eventually be hoarded and fall into disuse the word deflation wont begin to describe the damage on economic mobility daily transactions would have to be conducted via an alternative material currency most likely basic minerals that get magically regenerated never mind using any tools for transaction that involves isk let alone buying skill books lp items new blue prints etc the amount of overhead would devolve the economy into something seen in history books like the roman empire or 18c britainthats simply too much pain in the rear for awful trading experiences diablo 2 was more than enough although the latter was caused by a textbook case of hyperinflation but still
but but us goverment creates  from thin air if they need money thay just print them
i think its pretty much a nobrainer that having ccp learn how pvp mechanics work firsthand rather than having to glean it from the forums is a good thingim not saying continue flying these ridiculous faction loot pinatas but i and im sure many other players see it as therapeutic to eve that you the ccp team are putting in time trying to actually play the game and find out what works and whats bustedplease continue
i support this product andor service good times ccp
if only we could get one for the est tz in the us 
i run a stealth bomber and for hiding and running around in 00 and lowsec its awesome but it has one fatal flaw i think you have align just right to get a shot and if not done right you either miss or get caught in the blast so i propose making it so that bomb launchers fire your bombs in the direction your camera is pointed just to spice up the mechanic of shooting bombs at people this way it still takes time and focus to shoot but not so much that bombing is reduced to a hit and run tactic on a single frigate in an asteroid beltit may even reduce some of the afk cloaking issues that everyone seems to have a problem withjust a thought

wouldnt that also lead to bombing runs becoming as trivial as tying ones shoelaces read dumbing it downone of the balancing factors of the things is that they require planning and coordination to pull off successfully as one ideally needs a warpout behind the target to avoid return fire  would much rather want to see a suicide function where loaded bombs can be detonated while in the bay ie 2x current damage at cost of ship and probably pod would open up a whole new can of worms as the things are pretty cheap relative to their preferred prey  bombing runs with zero warning and no bubbling required  at a cost now that is an antiblob tool for the ages
i would buy that for an aurrum
back in the day when a fanfest they were talking about the technology used loads of microsoft products server etci have always been suprised as how the roles in corps worked compaired to what ccp uses in their officewhy not made the permission for corporations like they do with ad active directoryit would be nice to see these permission with a seniro as belowwhere you can take an ou orginzational unit and associate it with an object like a ship array so lets call the ou pos1 and lets make a another one and call it manufacturingnow where pos 1 is you add the ou to the posand add the other created ous into it respected places like manufacturing to ship arrayso when you have a new recruit and and he wants to use the pos you add his name into the group pos1 pos1 can be at 1 or all of the poses you have up  for argument sake lets just say that pos only has permission for the player to go inside itnow lets say you only want him to be able to use the ship assembly arry so you just add him into the group manufacturingthis would be a pain for larger corpsalliances however people will only have access to what they are given the current layout is kind of like inharited permissions are locked and your thowing the users directly into the permission scheam rather then adding to an ou then the ou to the objectwhew if you dont understand please do not call you local it help desk lol
we know ccp tried to enocurage people more into player corps and more out of npc corps so just make it so npc corps can be wardecced it can still be subject to rising price of wardec and so on the beginner corps that you actually start in can still be exempt from wars to allow people to adjust to eve online maybe have it so pod pilots can only stay in their rookie corp a set time limit tooi think that would encourage people into player corps a hell of alot more let the carebear flame war begin go
just npc corps getting wardecedyeptroll threadwaste of time stop the evemailUFFFDspam
meh troll thread but still something that should be addressed the use of npc corps as safehousesid suggest some mechanic that says the longer youre in an npc corp the higher taxes you have to pay and i would say that you consider all npc corp member cumulative to prevent jumping in and out of player corps to reset the clock
this would require ccp to unfix the control button since they royally broke it two patches agofor some reason they unbroke it a little less but it is still screwed
quoting for truth and bump
saving bumpi like the tunnel graphics update but they kept the slugging into and out of warp
if you cant game the payout why limit who can collect i do like that your mechanic allows hunters to work in hisec
you put a 500m bounty contract on me i use an alt to accept the contract and do nothing with it30 days later the contract expires along with the killright and you wasted your time plus whatever isk i managed to shave off the bounty by having that alt kill an empty pod a few timesif you make the payout available to anyone then i can just burn off the bounty without even bothering to use an anonymous alt to sneak a contract
1 if ccp is sincere in wanting to reinvigorate eve and fix old mechanics then they ought to give thought out threads like this a read the proposal is pretty sound requiring little more than loophole searchanddestroy
ok i see that complication what i meant was isnt the easiest way around that to let anyone and everyone take the bounties especially since the bounties themselves are going to be a percentage of the total bounty killrights for all until the bounty has been paid out that way even if you used an alt or friend to murder yourself which still doesnt make sense because your loosing money on every kill that would only be one of who knows how many peoplei think the killright angle might be a little much not because its not a good idea but because i think in practice a working bounty system will used to grief justifiably maybe or in some cases not but if the amendments only affect payouts then at least a bountied criminal could hide in secspace kinda like going to prison p if bounties worked a huge number of players would go hunting huge its a thing im new though so maybe i am missing something

fly what you can afford to lose if you cant lose your pirate implants or your 5s then dont use them how much of an isk sink are implants for the eve economy im willing to bet its quite significant
if only everyone was as bright as youread the op again its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
training takes to long already no reason to make it take even longerthere no thanx keep the training implantseve is more than pvpsupplement to training  idea about fleet training 
learning implants exist to boost your training time assuming 2 implants this is the daily skillpoint boost and the apporximate cost 5s earn 10800 at 200million isk4s earn 8640 at 50ish million isk3s earn 6480 at 25ish million isk2s earn 4320 at 5 million isk1s earn 2160 at 1 million iskthese equate to about a 4 bonus to training per implant point level implants are a significant isk sink in this game this game needs isk sinks to balance isk sources or something called inflation happens you dont need implants you can learn just fine without them and you sure as  dont need 5 implants i fly interceptors and dictors all the time with 3s and 4s in when i was a poor noob starting out in nullsec i would use 1s and 2s does this put me at a skillpoint disadvantage over a pilot that flies with only 5s sure but so what skillpoints only go so far in this game the skillpoint differences between a 50m sp combat pilot and 70m sp combat pilot almost never matter and more often than not they both get wtfbbqpwned by the 4m sp pilot that understands how to pilot their ship to take advantage of game mechanics now lets review your problems with learning implants no they dont if you quit flying in space becuase you have implants in your head then nullsec isnt for you hint you might have an eve problem when you think a day of optimal training is more important than having fun so what eve has consequences what next losing your ship in pvp is bad for the game becuase it discourages people from pvping i cant undock in my rifter cause someone might blow it up why cant it just respawn in station wow  cant put more than 5 quotes in a post damn they are seeded exclusively through lp stores rather than being made ingame entirely this isnt a reason to remove implants characters that need pirate faction implants for any reason are essentially stuck with 3s you mean they cant have a spouse a gf and a hooker all at the same time oh the humanity not being able to train at 5 rates is a small price to pay for the enormous benefits they provide and if its that important they can jc to a learning clone when they dont need the pirtate implants let me restate the most important aspect of this post you might have an eve problem when you think a day of optimal training is more important than having fun

right its a thing
the contrast between the good mood for everything and the scornful silence towards wis is pretty annoying actually i cant figure any scenario in which sayng nothing to your concerned customers is a solutionmaybe we should call in the press
yea establisments and stuff
i was going to let this thread die but i had to come back and say that those are great comments you raise some good points i was hopeful to dig into the specific vulnerabilities of stealth bombers but i didnt get the opportunity if these worked like most bombs theyd have to be deployed 30k away from the target a pilot could essentially align cloaked up decloak and fire the bomb without having to lock then they could be well out of scrambler range and warping off to a safe spot before the bomb detonates would it make more sense to have the bomb have a shorter range and travel slower make the range something like 15k and have it travel at 15ksec that would mean you would be in range of just about any ship camping the hole additionally it could have less hp making it vulnerable to smartbombs what do you think bombs stay on grid even after you leave it but missiles in flight vanish when you leave the grid if there was a way to require the bomber to stay on grid as you suggest that could be an interesting feature any of this sound feasible im open to suggestionsthe orca thing was just to show that it is possible to close a wormhole very quickly with massive ships youre right its not an equal comparison but at the time i was responding to someone who was objecting to the idea of quickly popping a wormhole i just wanted to point out that there are currently ways to quickly pop a wormhole without these bombs youre right its not the same thing but in the circumstances
so you want to take the holecontrol aspect of wormhole pvp away completely that would make it nearly impossible for an invaded system to bring in reinforcementsthis idea is so bad anyone supporting it should be embarassed
eves game mechanics are built around scifi lore i was offering an explanation of why a wormholeclosing bomb wouldnt fit within lore lack of mass you go off on how its all a bunch of ones and zeroes and can be reprogrammed as ccp sees fit youre clearly a lot of fun at partiesedit after catching up with the thread id be okay with this if the mineral expense of these bombs was equivalent to the mineral expense of a ship that would deplete the same amount in a wormhole in other words you can build a oneshot bomb or you can build a battleship this way it would be the same as simply shoving empty ships through the wormhole until it closedfor those who think there should be an inherent risk involved in closing wormholes my solution is that if someone is willing to put such significant resources into mitigating a little bit of risk they deserve the relative safety they also deserve to be quite a bit poorer than those wormhole corps who keep their hardearned isk and minerals and close wormholes the oldfashioned way
im suggesting adding more tools that can be used by pvp and pve players to manipulate wormholes to their tactical advantagethere are lots of different interpretations of wormholes in fiction and eve has its own lore consider the talocan who were masters of spatial manipulation and hypereuclidean mathematics this race likely knew how to make wormholes dont you wonder why no wormholes lead to jove space despite their proximity to the rest of kspace it implies to me that wormhole inhibition technologies exist and are used by the jove to isolate their systems thousands of years ago humankind traveled through eve gate to get here and when that wormhole sealed shut behind us considerable effort would have been made to study understand and reopen it imagine the frantic populace cut off from earth all urging their scientists to figure out a way to get back home decades of research and experimentation probably went towards understand the fundamental mechanics of wormholes even as civilization crumbled around them perhaps there is some lost knowledge protected by the jove or hidden in sleeper databanks that explains a piece of the puzzle i could not have said it better myself we disagree on the cost but i completely agree with the essence of your point
same difference regarding the language you effectively end a corp or alliance having the ability to reinforce or rescue a corp or ally because it simply becomes way to easy to close and roll holes it would have been impossible for example for the aquila hole to have been liberated when the russians invaded if every hole simply could be blown up instead of requiring ships to actually jump through them to take the mass off of themthis would severely break wormhole mechanics its a horrible idea in light of that
im not familiar with that specific incident  do you have a link or any details i live in a wormhole with a static to nulsec and so if someone comes into our hole and picks a fight none of our allies are going to even be able to bring forces to come to our rescueagain i have to point out that there are a lot of different ways to do this im not proposing that these bombs instapop wormholes i agree with you that a device that could take out a healthy wormhole in one shot would be uberpowerful and would likely be abused here is just a brief list of ideas  im sure there are more the bombs could only take time off of a wormholes life not mass they could reduce the current available mass by a fraction by half or by a third which would mean they could never truly close a hole the bombs could reduce a variable amount of mass andor time damage making it less predictable they could have a fixed damage of mass andor time
aquila incidentmore on itthe second post especially read through the linked battle reports etc and youll understand why i consider this to be a bad idea although i can appreciate the desire from a single corps perspective it affects things much larger it effects the entire world
i am a little dubious about getting reinforcements from one wormhole system to another but maybe the alliances span so many systems that it is actually feasible way out of my league i am trying to grasp your argument though here is what i think youre saying correct me if i am wrongthat would be a fair point but i dont see why different means bad
so basically youre butthurt because a covops hauler got through your gatecamp so you want a guaranteed method to catch them instead of actually earning some real pvp killshorribly bad idea
im sorry youre mad cause im right its ok and youll get over it eventually you keep lying to yourself and everything will be ok in your head any time i cloak in 00 at a safe spot i am completely untouchable you tell me what 00 space you live in and ill come out there in my cloaky nulli t3 and cloak up at a safe spot then you try to find me i could leave this toon there until eve dies and you will never find me just for your benefit that is the definition of untouchable no need to respond as im through fighting about this with an unarmed person i feel as though im taking advantage of youccp please respond with a fix time frame for this broken game mechanicthank you
so what youre cloaked and safe somewhere and cant be touchedbig frakking deal cloak up in a wormhole same thing yet no one bitches about that ever stop to wonder why ever really sit down and think about the real difference and real issue hereno well you seem to think cloaking is the problem so obviously you havent let me enlighten you and solve the alleged problem at the same time without breaking the cloaking mechanic or severly nerfing wormholes youre sitting down rightgoodthe problem is simple when youre cloaked up in null sec or anywhere else in empire people can still see youre in the system crazy isnt it the whole afk cloak whinefest is based on that simple fact people can still see youre there while cloaked so how do we fix this without breaking other aspects of the game aspects that rely on cloaking working as it does now first of all removing local isnt the answer too nuclear empire has local the natives rely on local let them keep their local in light of the real problem and in order to preserve local in empire spaces heres the solution1 when a ship cloaks it gets removed from local its freakin cloaked you should see it at all2 when a ship cloaks it loses access to local you cant be seen you cant see them either if youre going to gather intel go hunting etc you need to actively work to get the data you need works great in wormholes would work just as well in the softer spaces3 to prevent abuse regarding hot drops have there be a delay in being able to light a cyno after decloaking length of delay to be determined 15 seconds 30 seconds the point is to offset the surprise factor enough to keep it sporting possible exception should be considered for black ops ships theyre a special class that shouldnt have this restriction imothere you go the afk cloaking problem is gone poof cloaks dont get broken and actually get a little better balanced intel gathering while cloaked becomes an active endeavour instead of passive null space gets to retain a degree of the danger its supposed to have that youd lose by nerfing cloaks bots get easier to be snuck up on all in all a better balanced plan that breaks nothing that i can see
1 the anticloaking bubble is a terrible idea it makes gate camps completely op and is just bad for the game 2 while off topic from the original idea its very much on topic of the rest of the thread a cloakerhunter mechanic that allows you to find cloakies in system must not be implemented until the all powerful intel tool of local gets changed if you create a way to purge cloakers from your system then you can effectively make your system completely safe frankly this is not how nullsec life is meant to be and if you cant deal with constant potential danger then go back to hisec
nicebut removal of local from the cloaked ship kinda defeats the purpose of a cloakie doing recon in a systembut at least its inventiveedit removal of local all together like whsdelayed local is best imho stop the evemail spam
not really it just minimizes free intel you need to actively search out what you want to know like currently in wormholes
not necessarilydont get me wrong i do like the conceptbut it would be best if it was delayed local in 00 much like whsyour the fool if you reveal yourself in open spaceand cloaked or not no ones gonna know your there until its too latebut then the whiney tearful bears are gonna  their brains out even if local was removed in that fashion i fearwould make life interestingbut blinding the cloakyi would think at a minimum if smoeone speaks in localcloaky should hear itknow itblinding him isnt gonna be a perfect solution either because all hed have to do is record or ask someone else to report in on such thingsgood try thobut hard to beat delayed local solution stop the evemail spam
and what about the risk to the cloakersi dont think its right that you can have this module on your ship that makes you 100 safei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
i know i know quoting myself in response to a post but meh im lazy cloaking isnt 100 safe unless you never uncloak in which case it isnt a threatif you have a carebear alliance that cant defend its space against whatever could come through a covert cyno then you probably shouldnt be in nullsec anywaycenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
1 for getting rid of local in 00 i completely agree that 00 should not have anything that relates to empirehowever this is a completely different topic to be discussed in a different threadthe cloaking game mechanic is broken and must be fixed onc
yes npc man keep saying its broken enough times and ccp will give you every ounce of attentionmaybe if you say its broken really fast 3 times they may actually appear magically on this forum and say somethingok maybe 3 billion timeslike this is the 3 millionth time someoen has whinedand gotten stompped hard for thisstart reading and start listeningpeople are giving you sound tactiical solutions to this problem and your ignoring themkeep it upsee where it gets you stop the evemail spam
 if you cant lock down every station system within 14 light years then you deserve to get hot droppedthis is why large nullsec power blocks exist and why null is a sea of blue nap fests these days because they are the only ones big enough to get anything out of their spacei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
would it be a great idea to implement a skillgang boost module for for fleets where you can get a small amount of skill training increasei mean we have gang boost for miningwe have gang boost for shieldarmorwe got boost for movements etcand since those modules only work for those inspace and in the same system and there is risk by being in spaceand im not talking about a boost that would complete long time skills by a day or 2 but something like a few more skillpointsjust a thought that proberly have been mentioned a few times before but its still an ideasignlithrie

i fully agree and it doesnt need fo be announced ahead either just go out and do them once people see a ccp fleet and recognise it it will get all the publicity it needs and why not vary it in size and type toowould be interesting to see a ccp titan and carriers dropping into a system and unlaoding a fleet on unsuspecting people
and not just that smaller stuff too cruiserbc fleets maybe even frigate gangs etc etc
id like to see an isklimited unannounced ccp fleet going for a roam around lownull once in a while have them set themselves a more realistic isk limit and see what kind of fleets they can come up with i seem to remember a rather interesting broadsword fit in one of the previous ccp fleet that guy could definitely do with learning to pvp edit found the broadsword km

people are in no way excluded from the multiplayer aspects of this game because they have 5 learning implants eve online is about player choice anyone who sees themselves excluded is choosing to exclude themselves that is not a failure of the game its a failure of the player everything is this game is about choice you choose what to train you choose what to fly you choose how to fit your ships you choose to sit in 5 learning implants see how it works if you cant except risk versus reward then perhaps you shouldnt be worried about pvp in the first place
being lazy is not a valid reason to change the game
idgaf about this anymore tbqfh but its clear that youre an elitist jerk and should get out its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
funny you havent made a constructive comment here in at least 3 pages all your doing is calling people out for using forum alts anyway im not going to argue with some 16 year old go attempt to insult people elsewhere kid
and that is the problem right there in the proverbial nutshell the elitist jerk is like that because he actually enjoys a game that challenges him and knows how to play correctly you guys are whining about flying in 5s and losing them and oh no what if i die and get podded and lose all my implants how is that fair new proposal every time you get podded instead of getting a new noob ship which from the sound of some of these posts many of you dont belong in anything else everyone just gets a set of slaves or crystalsand the fact that andskis only defense to any point against his proposal is to insult the poster in some way proves how care bear this idea is
you should really look at the nonsense youve been postingcalling the kettle black etc its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
to get one thing out of the way here youre an idiotmoving on it has nothing to do with his objection to the proposal because hes an elitist jerk but his whole go back to wow or rift no skill trees eve is unique  bullshit because again hes a 16 year old elitist who wants to feel special for playing a bad spaceship game p its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
having 4s and a bil worth of missle hardwires never stopped me from going to null solo in a stealth bomber why because i knew i could get the isk to get another set if i wanted to only reason to not go into null with 4s or 5s is cause you make the choice not to
adding to my previous reply its called discrediting the opponent and making their arguments lose their weightyou posted some drivel in the old capital balancing thread about how supercap pilots shouldnt have to lose their ships to one stupid mistake which happened before and after crucible because their ships are worth tens of billions of isk why are they any specialits clear that you want the game made easier for older players while the learning curve is made steeper to the detriment of the new player youre against any improvements that would benefit new players make nullsec more accessible and make skill training less of a chorewere you opposed to the addition of the skill queue and removal of learning skills as well p its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
lol this is just getting pathetic andski is just reaching now you either call someone a mean name or change the subject now you are on the topics of supers ugh do us all a favor and drop corp and move up to high sec your idea aint gonna fly it sucks but time to move on go make a new post perhaps you can propose that every new player gets the choice of a carrier or a dread at the carrier creation screen maybe mitts would vouch for that one i find it hard to believe that goons give two sh about newer players all of a sudden you could do the game more benefit by not scamming every knucklehead who thinks you guys are worth joining you guys simply want this so you can speed up your alt training p commence the typical youre a coward posting alt omgwtfbbq moron carebear insult tangent if it helps i will send you some 5s for the holidaysactually scratch the carrier or dread proposal you might lose one or two and then propose that players should have an unlimited number at their disposalthe hammer of cva has spoken
youre pretty goddamn stupid if you think that im scared of losing my pod or dying in nullsec i dont even pve  i just go out and kill things its a wellknown fact that goonswarm has high sp requirements and only recruits 2003 playerswhen you need to bring my alliance affiliation into this it shows how desperate you are i know i should hide behind a forum altmost people are probably better off joining goonswarm than whatever worthless renter alliance your main is in its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar

just taking your lead mate dont get salty about it now i did wish you a happy holiday though i do find it funny that the guy calling everyone morons and idiots since the first page is thumbing his nose at my playground insults its funny that your insults now seem to be a mirror of mine and everyone elses complaints against you
lol the game should be easier for older players the learning curve in this game is what we all love about it and it is definatly not getting steeper just because you and your lot cant grasp the concept of using a jump clone properly doesnt warrant ccp dumbing down the game to the detriment of the new player my  the server constantly has almost double the amount of people it did a few years back this game being geared toward the older player is how it should be its a reward for sticking with the game being able to afford and use expensive implants is one of the benefits if you dont like the risk head back up to high sec or stfu and go back to wow  they keep things simple for you and nothing bad will happen when you die apparently that really does suit you better and for the record insulting somebody doesnt discredit their point just makes the fact that you have no intelligent response that much more apparent
let me pretend to be andski for a seclawlznublolgogetbentgoonsrocksyouaremoronidiotsloudnoisessssss
except that your mouthbreathing lot wants it to be easier for older players to the detriment of the newer players  see all the bad posting from idiots with your alliance tag who the  are the dominion empire in the supercapital balancing thread im not being schooled by some idiot who cant spell sorryive never played wow i have enough isk that i dont give a crap about losing implants and sorry but you are wrong if you think that insulting someone doesnt discredit them when those insults have a basis in reality its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i am so much more concise than thatget bent idiot its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
lol you really told me hotshot nothing worst then a guy in what equates to a videogame gang thinking what he says matters when because he is in it you would be better posting from a forum alt you simply discredit your toon and your alliancenot that they needed much help yeah goons have numbers and are known but they are not known as good pilots so good job you are the eve equivalent of the special olympics athletes fun to watch but only because you know they are handicapped anyhow if the isk dont matter to ya then distribute it to the masses robin hood there you go problem solved i will be in the npc channels referring all new players to come to you for their 5 money will this work for youlol  your italics cupcake
haha thats funny but seriouslywho the  are you in or out of the game dont remember ever hearing about andski the great the feared pilot of eve killer of rifters your alliance may be known but you are not this does not make you relevant or an expert on matters of the game it makes you some guy who is now known to make bad proposals and will not back them up with reason good day
lol i never used the term schooled and i dont think i misspelled anything and who cares what somebody from my alliance posted on a previous topic or that you dont know us doesnt change the fact that once again you have no retort other than to say that i cant spell
you seem very bitter about something and i cannot resist but ask you mad its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i said good day sirthe hammer of cva has spoken
and this easier for older players sht is ridiculous why shouldnt it be easier for older players these implants do not give that much of a bonus at all im actually curious to see if you have an actual reason why the game should change from being geared towards the older to the newer player and dont give your bull  reason of it drives people away because we both know that there are more people playing now than a few years back so any response lemme cover part of your argument for you really quickalex you are an idiot who cant spell in an alliance nobody knowsso that part is covered for you now 
im sympathetic to the idea behind this but i wont easily support ideas where the solution to a problem is removing that aspect entirely from the game just to get rid of the issue i would simply prefer to see a fix to the issue since you have to address the same issue repeating with hardwirings anyway that fix would be to allow easier access to jump clones and allowing local clone switching without any timershow i vision it is to basicly make jump clone access an easy basic facet of the game easiest solution for this is propably to allow people to simply buy jump clones from the market and allow transferring themgeneric jump clone template item as a normal item so they are easy to move around and get when you activate one it becomes one of your jumpclones and an implanted jump clone would function like a rigged ship since they work in a very similar fashion so basicly if you repack it you lose the implants and it stops being your jump clone if the goal is to have everyone have access to them make it so you get one jumpclone and the required skill from a jumpclone tutoriali wouldnt lose any sleep if learning implants would go away but as i said it would still leave the issue with having wrong hardwirings intact that issue needs to be solved too and any solution to that issue will also solve the learning implant issue at the same time since its basicly the same problem so once you have a fix for the hardwiring issue youve also succesfully removed the need to remove learning implants
i like the idea of jump clone vouchers being sold on the lp store as opposed to requiring ridiculous standings because lol grinding missions or access to a player outpost its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
it isnt one careless mistake can still cost you your ship and pod whether you are in an ibis or in an erebus false dilemma the game is not geared towards the older player precisely because of the way the skill system works diminishing returnsprecisely for that reason  the game is balanced to an extent where highsp veterans cannot simply and effortlessly farm kills on newer players aside from ganking ibises in lowsec but thats differentyep its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
the standing thing with the jump clones is high but since you have the ability to make one with a rorqual or with access to an outpost in null sec i dont think its that big of a deal especially since if you dont have the access to null you probably dont really need a jump clone anyway point being if you live in high sec there is no point in jumping out of your 5s unless its to switch to your slaves and if you do live in high sec you are up there enough to have the standing with someone to make a jump clone anyway if you live in null you probably have access to a station so i dont really see the point to making jump clones more available
if you live in highsec you dont need to jump out of your implant clone but wartargets or a guy in an instalocking podpopping thrasher can ruin your day itd be nice to see jump clones made more accessible not everyone who lives in 00 has easy access to them unless theyre blue to a sovholding alliance and itd allow people to use their wallet to their advantage not having to grind standings when they have the isk ready as is the case with implants faction mods faction ammo etc its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
you really havent given a reason why learning implants are bad for the game id also like to point out different aspects of the game all age together as you grow higher in skill points you become experienced enough to make isk much more quickly than a new player as you grow higher in skill points the average training time of skills you train are measured in weeks not days or hours as you grow higher in skill points you have a much more expensive clone you often fly much more expensive ships and so using expensive implants is not a big deal there is no easymode of older players some things get easier making isk but things get riskier too losing a pod
yea in no way was i saying the game is easy on older players they have as much risk in fact more risk than a new player but being able to afford expensive implants is an advantage though that an older player should have getting rid of learning implants takes part of that advantage away but i agree with you guys that the game isnt on easy mode for older players nor should it be but the older players should be allowed their advantages especially with the risk that comes with having them the game should not be toned down because some people are scared of flying around in their implants
quoteandskiif you live in highsec you dont need to jump out of your implant clone but wartargets or a guy in an instalocking podpopping thrasher can ruin your day getting your day ruined is a part of eve
youre an idiot that is not what i am discussing its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
lol back to that again and bull  it isnt the whole point of this thread was to bring up the idea of dropping learning implants because they are inconvenient for certain players and players in null sec dont use them and itd make the game better for new players and i dont wanna get podded in 5s and have my day ruined directly or indirectly this idea of yours reduces the risk for people who fly around lownull in 5s because all of a sudden everyone has them naturally in their head i get what you are trying to do you are trying to get people trained up quicker people train up quick enough as it iswill 5s get you into a ship quicker yeswill they have you flying that ship a lot better quicker yeswill it break your character if you dont have 5s notaking away the risk of flying around with 5s and possibly having your day ruined to make the game a little more care bear friendly isnt worth it
youre a broken recordrisk vs rewardeve should be miserable for new playersetc etc its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
yea your right because learning implants definatly make this game rough on new players i dont know how i got through it with those damn learning implants keeping me down

how about a little love for amarr drones ccp
excellent ideas in this thread tying payouts to a non100 value of shippod losses seems like the right way to plug that podyourselfandprofit loopholeas long as the bounty payout is less than total value of the ship  mods  the insurance payout  the cost of insurance i dont see how insurance will be too much of an issue however i can see a nondirtpoor hunted pilot trying to grief those who placed the bounty on him by destroying his own platinsured ships for a small loss each and eating up the bounty escrow quickly hunted pilot loses a bunch of isk but the party who placed the bounty loses a lot more since the hunted pilots losses are mitigated by insurance such a tactic being available would reduce the potential for gudfights arising from the bountys placement perhaps the insurance payouts to the hunted pilot for dead ships should also be paid into his bounty escrow with matching amounts to eliminate this tactic ie if the hunted party platinsures all their ships they still get the insurance but the bounty sticks around longer and trying to bleed down the escrow by selfkilling would require more isk sacrifice by the hunted pilotof course this injects double the isk into the economy from insurance payouts on the hunted pilot so perhaps its undesirable im no market guru
well maybe not to everyone but at least everyone with a certain skills level and right corp standingsill try to explain what exactly i have in mindit has been some time since the ccp abolished the lottery where you could get any t2 bpo whether you get them because of pure luck or providence of some higher power is not an issue to which i will go todaythe point is that they should be available to new playerstake for example coprocessor ii blueprint to create a copy of the blueprint you need some equipment as datacore  electromagnetic physics and electronic engineering incognito data interface and copy of coprocessor i blueprintyou also need some skills like science and electronics both at level 5 and some other at lower level like hacking electromagnetic physics electronic engineering and gallente encryption methodswhat i propose is that people who have the necessary skills and equipment be allowed to annually make one t2 bpo at an appropriate rd agent of whose corporations have required standingso for example if you want to make coprocessor ii blueprint original you need this  several hundred datacore both electromagnetic physics and electronic engineering for ship bpo more than thousand of both type   both skills for electromagnetic physics and electronic engineering at level 5  also science hacking and electronics at level 5  one original coprocessor i blueprint  several copy of coprocessor ii blueprint  one incognito data interface  some type of tools like stolen formulas symbiotic figures collision measurements engagement plan  and od course isk lots of isk  for equipment and ammo several hundred million isk and for ships more than billion once you have all the equipment and materials go to the right rd agent  one that have both skills with electromagnetic physics and electronic engineering  provide him with all required equipment and materials and of course you pay him with isk and he provide you with your blueprint but you can only do this once a year and only with one rd agent

the new warping effect looks great the end seems to swirl a bit which makes warping not seem like a perfectly straight line however ships in warp dont move whatsoever they stay fixed and static while warping im sure its been proposed before but wed like to see the ship do a little bobbing weaving pitching and rolling while in warp it doesnt have to be dramatic and obvious just a little sway in this way or that gives the appearance of a ship navigating through spacesummary of eves last four expansions

im always impressed to see that the apparently semiliterate can still come up with such imaginatively bad ideas
no
api and eve map both provide too much intel for free what i suggest is that if you actually want to know how many people are in system or where is cyno or where is incursion outside hi sec etc you should actually need to go there and check it out yourselfi personally see no point why anyone should see on dotlan where people are hanging out
well the map is time delayed so i wouldnt take that as gospel as to how many people are actually in a systemnot the first time ive checked the map to show only 1 person in station only to discover 100 in system when i jump the gatei have no problem with it and i doubt many others will either
spotting a moving fleet is bad example of this even though you can use map for that to some extent if you have some experiencei am personally using map and api for intel with good effectiveness and i do not think it is a good thing for my victims and i see no reason why i get all this nice information for free like i said hi sec is kind of different so i have no problem with map intel on hi sec though only low sec and 00i do however wonder if pos cyno beacons and active cyno jammers should show on map since theyre sort of static structures so having public intel on them would make sense at least much more than people docked or in space or heck npcs killed in hour i think npc kill number is most immersion breaking of all
this is a worse traveshamockery than the camoflage comet bring back my orange shuttle
1not sure about exact details in your post wheter they are correct or not but i agree that this should be looked into and fixedfirst thing should be revision of production chains and availability of certain moon gooif this will not help for example
1 here my inclination is to scream your doing it wrong but ive noticed a distinct gaptrendwith the changes madeits only made things astronomically expensivestupid and not so much balancedi cant help but wonder if they tilt the balance back 
i have also speculated in moon minerals and would like to see this change
is this where the trolls are supposed to comeyour post in gd confused me
while i salute your effort at using logic and game structure facts to highlight eve resource imbalances and your attempt to provide solutions is above and beyond i feel it necessary to point out that at ccp nobody is listening or cares so if you would kindly return to posting nothing but limitless praise and adulation for eve the management would appreciate it
yeah a little less sperging and a little more solutions pleaser32 prices are higher because consumption is higher i would either ramp up the amount of moons that produce moon goo or i would put more of an emphasis on pi products in t2 manufacturing by changing the materials that the blue prints need or allowing higher level pi turn into the finished materials that moon goo turns into pi does need to get more important before ccp even thinks of doing dusti honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
my previous experiance with ccp is that they pick their own solutions and they rely only on their own research im just the messenger here it is up to people to come with good ideas to help ccp and discuss here possible solutionsi just started the first 2 stages of a problem identification  analysation lets discuss possible solution here
i personally think moon minerals should be randomly redistributed on a regular basis by some means or another right now whoever controls the tech moons in the north controls the vast majority of t2 production as a result and thats no good
granted some change in moon mining stuff needs changing tech likely needs a nerf of one sort or the other whether through redistribution or changing of the bill of materials on t2 productionuntil then people who want those moons and the income can you know actually fight for them
hows it going man its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
hahahaha yea right
bro
lets see how this would work ccp makes fleets gets hotdropped by pls supercaps end result andski proposes supercap nerf phappy holidays
i personally what to see them fly smallish fleets into the trade hubs with a special aggression all players can shoot them but the navies and concord wont i would love to see how many people actually open fire and how many sit there and watch
we used to have this kind of event they stopped because of corruption the event staff would prewarn their friends in advance so theyd be ready
great thanks did not know that
you forgot to like
thanks to everyone for showing support to this proposal it is a sound proposal with no game breaking issues and if implemented it cant be exploited
honestly if eve is such a bad game then why are you playing it now lets get this discussion back on track instead of posting irrelevant insults
simple easy fix all drones have the same speed damage mod and tracking no need to get all crazy with the stats on drones ffs every race has a resist hole somewhere and now all combat drones more are useful
pilots with a sec status at 0 or more can trigger a mayday call when they are aggressed except in wh space other pilots with a positive sec status in the range of the call lets say one system per sec status point of the pilot issuing the mayday can then opt to to create a bookmark to the maydays call location and thus warp to it when insystemall pilots in their settings have a setting to opt in on mayday calls default option if oss people that want to be able to act on mayday calls must check this box
why limit it to positive sec status that doesnt even make sense
1 to allow players to react to something ongoing between players in their vicinity if they so choose2 to facilitate the capacity for the good guys to help other good guys beyond corps and alliances allegiances 3 because concord monitoring the use of this channel would prevent anyone with a non positive sec status to use or even hear this channel 4 there is also the ability to use this as a baittrap with the complicity of a positive sec status pilot
good intentions  positive security status any player can raise their standings out of the negatives and into the positives hell if i ever saw a mayday distress call go out i would get over there quickly for one or possibly two easy killssummary of eves last four expansions
1 get in a corp2 fleet up3 i need help guys when  hits the fan4 the cavalry arrives
its a trap
velicitia is right  but many ppl dont have enough corpies online maybe youre away from hq maybe youre outside corp peak hours etc etc  or maybe you just want to encourage more group play and social interaction  and yes convenience really does matter  the same way 1000000 papercuts dosort of seems similar to calling for help in local though  but it adds the ability for other pilots to more quickly respond how would the agression flagging work for this though say someone shows up to help  how could they do anything more than function as a neutral repper unless they are willing to take a sec status hit and are in losec

im in test bro im more space poor than a homeless mani dont need a personal stake in this to know that invention works just fine for people that have half a brain and the only people that cry about t2 bpos simply arent interested in putting in the effort to make invention work for them

when running missions or deadspace complexes there are frequently structures there that can be blown up i would like to propose that ccp revisit how these large collidable objects lcos behave and what they leave behind when they are destroyed specifically i would like to propose the following expand the loot drop tables to include more random mundane items like trade goods on stations and large structures these should be in abundance intermingled with the occasional valuable bauble all lco vessels this means the prop ships floating in plexes should be destructible unless there is a stated reason for them not to be soevery lco that gets destroyed should leave behind at least metal scraps and token garbage even if it is mostly worthless the more massive the lco the more there should be it is preposterous to see a giant space station explode after prolonged bombardment and have absolutely nothing left behind consider what gets left behind when a ship is destroyed and then try to explain why structures many times more massive simply evaporate into nothing if ccp decides to make a given lco drop nothing that structure should be untargetable or otherwise marked so players dont waste their time replace the largest lcos with wrecked versions or debris fields when they are destroyed when ships are blown up they leave behind wreckage shouldnt there still be something left in space perhaps this wreckage could be both salvaged and looted and not just a lone jet can in spacei look forward to your feedback

i agree ccp needs to be a lot more active with customer relationssilence is golden but ccp is now 14 karats too much
a simple idea to get people more involved in eveat the moment i cannot fathom why someone would remain in an npc corp for longer than a year except to evade wardecs and therefore exploit game mechanics and play counter to the spirit of evethis idea is an extension of ccps decision for an automatic 10 tax in all npc corporations tax would after perhaps a month begin to increase at a rate of maybe 2 per week just a figure i randomly came up with there may be better onesplayers would not be able to reset the tax by leaving and rejoining an npc corp as their previous tax would be remembered and continued from or if thats too harsh maybe the amount of tax would slowly diminish as long as someone is outside the npc corp allowing them to spend some time outside before returning to less tax that would then begin increasing againmaybe there could be a skill to reduce the rate of tax increase not sure just musingthis idea will encourage players who are essentially playing eve as a single player grind to explore the pleasures of playing a multiplayer game in a manner that is also multiplayer
you cant force people to play the way you want them too people will either play the way they want to or theyll quit and play another game
you have a strange idea of what encouraging means
just remove npc corps and let dudes get individually wardecd

fixtfield of trolls if you chum it they will come
yes because eve online is hired goon online stop the evemail spam
i mentioned this as an idea a looooong time ago supported
different means bad in this case simply because you take away the ability for reinforcements to ever arrive you completely break wormhole system assault pvp by reducing it to a faceroll once you get your fleet and bombs in there instead of the chance of reinforments arriving its over before it beginsdont be dubious about the ability to get reinforcements i was there that was one hell of a weekend we wound up having to come in through null if i recall and then it was two or three holes deep to get in there once hole control was won the scanners did the rest such an epic battle would have been reduced to a footnote system invaded and lost there would have been no writeups no coalition of wormholes alliances answering the call to arms to help defend friends and allies no youd be taking away far far too much from the game for what really is nothing gained except a little safety in rolling holes which is damaging enough
if the main objection is that alliances and big groups cant dominate wspace as easily i say that is even more reason to implement this plan immediatelywormholes arent condusive for alliances and mega corps they are inherently isolated systems that can only sustain a handful of pilots you can probably attest that finding the route to get reinforcements into your wormhole was likely a giant pain in everyones ass wormhole geometry isnt good for that kind of mobilization wspace is elementally divisive
you actually allow the big alliances to dominate with these things right now even a small corp can scream for help from narwhals or the like and actually get it you would doom every small corp in wormholes to being unable to ever get help if invaded be that help from other alliances members mercenaries etcits critical that people be allowed a chance to reinforce their systems if needed to call in the calvary when all hope is lost you would break that making the initial invasion itself the final act instead of the events of the next day and a half ill tell you what bounce this off someone in narwhals for example they specialize in these type of mercenary reinforcements get their experienced opinions on what it would mean is someone could simply blow up holes and maintain hole control that way how would it effect their income or style of play ask someone in aquila if they would likely have been successfully reinforced if the russians could have blown up every hole as it appeared my experience is my own but i take a lot in and do fairly well at seeing the bigger picture but these guys are far more knowledgable then ill ever be
i dont think it is as dramatic as you say if these bombs never exist it isnt going to stop fleets from closing holes youd still have the chance to reinforce your system nothing would prevent you i am assuming that the russians were already offline when you were bringing in the calvalry so i dont see how this changes anythingat this point i am leaning towards the 25ths  2 hour solution the bomb would remove 40 of the wormholes current total mass allowance and 2 hours of its life so the mass of the wormhole would go like this100  60  36  216 1296  7776as you can see each successive bomb takes less and less mass away from the total this is zenos dichotemy paradox practically this would mean that 5 bombs would need to be fired at a hole before it goes on the verge of collapse under 10 total mass if these bombs are 20 million apiece and the blueprints are rare enough that would seem about right to me
i would like to propose a threaddegrading bomb which i would launch at this thread so i could remove it from the forum at no personal risk

so the current customs office rf mechanic is rather silly the owning corp cant put up any defenses cant control when the office comes out of rf and has to pay alot of isk for the thing my proposal should be a simple change to make owning a customs office a less risky endeavour1 let us put defenses on it simply have them activate on agression that way everyone still can use the office but if they shoot at it they have to deal with some defense this will cut down on lone idiots spending hours rfing an office because they want to be dicks2 either add a stront type bay or allow us to set when we want a customs office to come out of rf currently if someone outside of our prime attacks the office comes out of rf still in the attackers prime which limits any sort of defense on poss we can set rf to come out when we like with good stronting but with customs offices we have no choicethese 2 changes would bring customs office more in tune with poss and make them more attractive as it stands spending about 100m to set up a big bullseye with no defenses or rf control just seems silly
1 defences wont do much  though may get a kill or two2 you can set the time it comes out of rf you know
approvedorange was cool
is it just me or ar the not turning on correctly i have asked other of my corp and thier firends and have gotten back that the arent turning on currectly would like to know if anybody is doing anything about thisthanks
hey were entering an era irl where the internet makes it possible to get all kinds of information about people for free by anyone who has the skills it this were a medieval fantasy game id say yeah no free intel but i wouldnt be surprised if it were to become possible to make that kind of an api in real life within the next five years if not today
as others pointed out the map is delayed if your concerned about free easy intel you should asking for the removal of local chat intel as it dwarfs any impact by the map and dotlan
you seem to be posting in sheer ignoranceallow me to point out the flaws in your argument1 the api data you see is gathered from the ingame eve map that information is then sorted and compiled ie dotlan2 the api dumps from killmails are willfully given and not generated automaticallynot sure how dotlans works but its not generally free3 api data is 5 to 15 minutes delayednow i ask youhow the hell is this considered free intelligenceintelligence is only as good as its accuracyyou want to eliminate free intelmake local delayedthen well talknot supporting an another failed idea stop the evemailUFFFDspam
just die
in game
i never suggested anywhere to keep isk sinks isk sinks as well as isk faucets will be removed
and then isk will be removed
well yeah but thats just because the carebears rule in real life 
how about doing ccp incursions  just borrow the incursion mechanics
yeah its bad the question ccp needs to address is whether this blatant attempt to go after alt accounts is going to outweigh their desire to make the eve a long term good quality gamemake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
bump
not supportedit is my opinion that having to make those choices and for new players they can be difficult choices are what sets eve apart read above other mmos removing learning implants and granting everyone the 5 bonus automagically removes one layer of choice and dangeri honestly dont think again imho that removing implants are going to get people out pvping more  people as a general rule will do what they want when theyre ready some guysgals get in the game and are in 00 win two weeks some never make that transition risk aversion exists before implantsvovfyi posting from main 
i agree mostly i agree that removing implants arent going to increase pvp chancesi agree that people will do what they want when theyre readyi acknowledge that i could get wtfp0wnd in one volley by a toon whos two weeks old depending on what im flyingi dont agree that risk aversion exists before implants thoughsome people know the realities of 00 and some dont some know the realities of pvp and some dont myself i know the reality of both and personally i dont care to play this game for 00 or pvp i know that im going to get dragged into pvp at sometime or another and i wont have a choice about it at that point but thats where my fun comes in the risk of knowing i have something expensive someone wants to see up on their corpalliance kb and then expect that im going to cry about it come on its a game if anyone is going crying over virtual income they really really need to rethink why theyre playing eve and sinking real money into iti wonder if these same guys who get beat by npc players in civ style games cry when the cpu knocks them on their ass  oh wait they just restart the game to avoid being beat
first remaps then the learning skills got removed and now asking for thisnext it will be remove attributes i dont want to plan a year ahead etcyou can take my 3 charisma from my cold unsubbed frozen corpse
funnily enough perpetuum the eve clone removed attributes a while back afaikopthread having to make decisions is part of what makes eve good stop trying to make eve bad it was bad enough that the learning skills got removed this is just farcicalthis is a terrible thread and we are all terrible people for posting in it
supported its stupid i dont even care about implants anymore when it means i cant even go on alphafleets because i might lose a set of 5s losing a set of those actually hurts because you get laughed at
lol its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar

where is the dislike button
to expand on something i posted earlier since this thread has been necrodid love to be able to release some of my skill points to remap for something im actually using a lot of people made mistakes early on and wasted a lot of sp figuring out just what we wanted to do in eve for those of us who have only been around 13 years this can represent a rather large percentage of our skill points for someone with 2030 million sp 2 million makes a big difference examplesif i want to train a new turret system to level 4 specialization for t2 gunssmall 390600 spmedium 994410 sp 1385010 totallarge 1641690 sp 3026700 totalwith a proper mapping and 4 implants this will require over 48 days of training training for a new racial battleship is 678600 sp taking 11 daysany given races cruiser 5 is 1054440 sp requiring almost 17 daysthis puts a typical player at needing to spend 23 months training to be able to fly a new battleship or t3 with t2 weapons for someone who has been playing for less than two years thats a lot of waiting meanwhile all the rookie mistakes we made with skills are sitting there being uselessive made it this far without being able to do these things and dont care whether its implemented or not but i dont consider this gamebreaking if its done i would certainly take a couple of plex out of circulation in order to regain those wasted sp
1 this has nothing whatsoever to do with sec status2 what is a good guy we all kill tens of thousands of people daily those rat battleships thousands of crew anyway sec status isnt a measure of whos good i can go gank a load of miners go back home to null and be back in positive standing inside of a day3 so i take it this is highsec only then why is that if i cant have a help im tackled in the belt button in nullsec why should there be one in highsec where youre rarely at any risk anyway4 so what this again has nothing to do with your sec status and is likely the main use of a button like this
i like it but dont limit sec status mayday calls drop a beacon that lasts 60 seconds and shows up in the overview its basic function is simular to how a cyno behaives in the overview then anybody and everybody can show up to save you or kill you and the guy attacking you would be a very interesting thing to have in gameas a measure to prevent abuse you must be agressing or agressed by another player to call the maydaymmos come and go but eve remains garresh
i like it but no sense having sec restrictions if you are literally in trouble enough to need to make a wide band plea for help its not like youre going to turn down the help of dodgy pirate types who arrive to pirate your aggressor as as well
the griefing potential this would provide would be immense
1 if youre outside corps primetime every so often ok thats understandable ie weekends because you were on early or you had a day off or something if youre constantly playing outside your corps primetime sounds like youre in the wrong corp2 if youre that far from hq so your mates cant show up  wtf were you doing over there alone3 as for not enough corpies online  see 14 assuming lowsec  unless theyre blues anyone who shows up will be more apt to kill the both of you than help
i dont see any reason why this idea couldnt be useful and worth the time i do however disagree with limiting it based on sec status and location either the ship has a mayday function or it doesntperiod why wouldnt the system work in wh space for example we have shared corp bookmarks in wh space and we can warp to each other just finepvp works in wh space in the same way it works everywhere else only we dont get the luxury of intel from localso yeahill support it but only if it works the same way everywhere for everybody yeseven pirates
i dont see a lot of point in thisin nullsec you cant even trust the guys with high sec status throwing out an sos just tells them theres easy prey in systemin lowsec its always a trap i wouldnt help anyone there but the guys im already in a fleet within highsec no one could shoot at them unless theyve drawn a criminal flag in which case concord will be there at least as soon as the first player was able to respond if they have a legitimate reason to be shooting you be it war or aggression or kill rights then the rest of us cant interfere without bringing concord down on ourselves
i think what hes meaning is if someone responds to a sos call they are already signaling their intention to be a good guy and try and save him so concord would not get involved as long as hes not the aggressing pilothowever i can see this being abused all over the place especially in hi secfor example someone canflips you and goes red flashy you shoot him and become the aggressor so he hits the sos button and all of his corp mates come and gank you with ease as concord will turn a blind eyereally dont think this would be a good idea to be honest
if its a replacement for concord that means i can gank people and then use an alt to respond to the sos stopping me from losing my ship love itif it will allow me to invite people to fights where concord wasnt going to show up also awesome i can throw an sos and then when people show up to rescue my alt i get a good fight and can use my alt for rr because its funnier that waybasically if im given a mechanic like this i will abuse the hell out of it to kill the gullible
loloh the hilarity that would ensue now i really approve this ideait seems a little tweaking of the idea is in order to make it a viable one
how would people be notified that there was a mayday call going out i am imagining someone setting off a smartbomb at the undock in jita and a thousand popups appearing all at once on every single players screen that is within 3 systemsperhaps it could be something in local and it would appear on the warp to dropdownit would have to be unobtrusiveof course someone is going to find a way to grief with this you know that
come to the disco party
hahaha i stand corrected of course people will grief with this  fixed
as an addendum i would like ccp to revisit the drop tables or lack thereof for sleeper and talocan structuresfrom my experience destroying sleeper or talocan lcos drops nothing this is a missed opportunity and i expect that the pvp crowd would agree someone trying to blow up a sleeper structure is pretty much a sitting duck for an extended period of time exactly what gankers would look forencouraging pve ships to stick around and shoot at the structures gives a little more opportunity to pvp ships that might be lurking this opportunity does not arise because there is currently no reason to shoot at a lco in a wormhole a little more risk a little more reward what do you think
in another thread a dev mentioned that ccp was interested in our suggestions on what gameplay should happen in incarna aside from the features and ideas section of the forum and who knows what does and doesnt get read in there im wondering how we can make the process more participatory for both sidesmaybe do some crowd sourcing for gameplay features or a survey as part of the next eve newsletter to all players asking them to rate various potential gameplay items for wisi would like to make this suggestion part of my request to ccp and csmat least this way ccp can demonstrate player support for the features they include in stations
i stopped reading your drivel right there this is just more elitist garbage spewing forth from a hole that doesnt have a brain behind it to regulate the flow just because you dont see the value in wis doesnt mean nobody else does you are probably one of the 95 of nullsec players that pvp solely to pvp you dont take systems you dont reinforce stationsyou just pvp its pointlesssee what i did therefact is ccp had plans for wis to make it more than just walking around most of you dont know this because you were either too busy crying like little babies to read the information or you are just too blind and stupid to pay attention now wis is on the backburner because of the sheer number of idiots that play this game and dont like the way everybody else plays itas for the thread subjectit is likely that we will have to wait until the fanfest to hear any more new news or an update on wis i would also like to point out that you are requesting an update from ccp devs in assembly hall they likely will not post in here as they have made it a point not to do so at all this is a forum for the csm the only csm i would half expect to reply in this thread with any information of value is trebor
my guess is that this thread exists because ccp is ignoring the 56 days old 1478 messages long thread at general discussion bear in mind that so far the only weve got from the csm is the mittanis hunch that the nex store has been abandoned and nobody wants to think of it
ccp only respond on happy post these days and even locks 1 or 2 with normal discussion where they think its an attack on ccpdont expect a response on this one alsoit only shows the respect ccp has for its customers when they rabble right ccpwe know from the past that this is the case
no this thread was a request for the csm to request an update from ccp essentially im trying to use the formal process of the csm to get the clarification we would likelets see if the wonderful process that is the csm will workpersonally i think the request is reasonable were not asking for a particular feature to happen immediately were not trying to force largescale changes across eve all we are wanting is for ccp via the csm to talk to us and respond to our concernscrickets
why are you confused the language is fairly plainare you looking for something likewe will not work on incarna until 230 pm december 17th 2012 at that time 3 developers will start working on the platinum skirts and put out new skirts that are biegeseriously the company has just redirected resources if focusing on fis stops the subs from bleeding and even starts to turn things around im sure they will continue in that direction i think ccp will continue to do some things for incarna but it is not going to be all we hear about anymore those days are hopefully in the past make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
agreed ccp should have told us their plans for incarna in the first place and the outrage about the nex store wouldnt have happenedccp seem to have a real problem considering the implications of the changes they make to the game look at customs offices the community designed half the features for the new poco systemin fact most of the stuff in crucible was thought up by the players looks like you have a pretty good deal here ccp
why does my ship auto align to some fictitious point in spaceif i stop my ship at full stop  it should stop  aligned to whatever point in space i was moving towardswhy does this matter simple exampletry setting up a surprise attack with a cloaked bomber you cant align properly and wait till the time is right to decloak and throw a couple bombscurrently i align to my target and set my speed to 0000000000001 so i stay aligned
if this was trueand i think it might bei support itedit yes it isspecially if your alinged to a safe spot that is above your horizon at an obsecne angel and you would only maintain it if your where movingso yeahdef want this fixedjust remembered a valid example as to why i thought it was the casehence my edit stop the evemail spam
i recall reading something in a star trek book once that explained the reasoning behind an imaginary planar field that everybody used to align ships with each other it was absolutely ubsurd but primarily was done to negate the silliness of ships in space from different races flying at different angles based on how they evolved in their own exploration of spacei do agree with the op to a point the auto alignment makes our ships in space act like submarines that balance themselves when stopped after diving or surfacing on the other handseeing ships at all sorts of weird angles in space would feeloddkinda like how the new stargate alignment does it makes sensebut seems odd looking at them compared to what we are used to seeingi would like to know what determines what is up and what is down for pilots in eve how was this determined and why doesnt one race fly upside down compared to the others i guess one could argue it is the plane of a specific solar system that you are in or perhaps the plane of the currently known galaxyi digressagreeing with the op1
agreedit is pretty annoying for sb bombing runs in particular to have to maintain a little speed to remain in perfect alignment
agreed when i say stop i dont mean turn the ship 30 degrees and stop
just make bomb launch in direction of your camera like ds
well done i could not have been more condescending myselfnot sure what to think about this on one hand i think it would for sure increase the number of participants 20k sp or similar amount is not exactly the end of the world and the more people testing the better the test as it is a stress test goes on the other hand it might though not necessarily lower the quality of the reports
put a little more effort into your retort1000 players showing up for free skillpoints and typing up 1 liners in their reports while missing a few dozen valid reports will likely  off the devs more so than helptime is moneyand devs dont have tmie to jibba jabba stop the evemailUFFFDspam
im assuming you mean in my opinion your proposal is based on the idea that all people in npc corps arent also in other corps well maybe that toon isnt but my hisec toons support me when i need it  and i havent lived in hisec since nov 2008 i like encouraging people to explore different aspects of the game with carrots  i guess some people op only understand the stickedit to add not supported
as in life i believe in a mixture of carrot and stick so far we have seen only carrot as those affected by any stick threaten to unsubscribe which never happens i understand how you may all view this as being simply my opinion as you will all be affected by it though i believe it will objectively increase the quality of the game for everyoneto expand on this it is necessary to define quality each player feels that different game aspects offer different levels of enjoyment so will measure quality in different ways however for the purposes of this idea i will define quality as fun fun is an enjoyment of playing the game and taking part in its various offerings and interactions  the constantly changing variety and fresh challengesi contest that the actions of those who never leave npc corps is not fun as their range of activities is limited and generally will always be closer to a mundane grind that simply earns money as fast as possible this is closer to an addiction or chore than fun in the true sense therefore is of a lower quality of game play someone must take responsibility for the people stuck in this manner and if no amount of carrot will remedy the situation it is my belief that a tiny stick should be employed i also believe this will not cause a mass unsubscribing as the introduction of mandatory 10 npc corp tax did not it would also be arguable therefore that ccp could employ salami tactics such as introducing a similar 10 increase every two years with minimal protest from the communitythis is not about killmails it is about a worrying disconnect i feel with this mass of players who it seems are playing a different game to me and who i cannot interact with their ships may as well be a background animation flowing through hisec gates and making the universe appear more alivei myself have a high sec alt and wouldnt mind this change in reality it does nothing to impede game play players may simply join a player corp to avoid the tax
theres a reason for that it is just your opinion the point remains that forcing people to do stuff is a bad idea thread
aww are you lonely maybe you should send them isk then you will have friendsbtw i now crown you the boss of what eve is all about and how everyone else should play their internet spaceship game
you believeyou contestyou thinkyoufunny stop the evemail spam
lot of hostility and cynicism here i am starting to understand now what hulkageddon is about the perpetrators probably tried to reach out but have given upyou all react as though i am asking for all of empire space to become nullsec that would be ridiculous all i am saying is there should be a balance of riskreward there should be a greater cost for what is essentially invincibility it feels like what i am proposing is the stick because the only way this can be adusted is in that direction after ccp made it possible to grind cash from an npc corp until the top 1b ships can be afforded there is no better or more expensive ships that can be accessed only in player corp activities lowsec nullsec hisec so if we are to rebalance risk  reward our only two options are the carrot which is providing an entire new line of superexpensive and powerful endgame ships more tech 3 maybe which is only accessible by taking on more risk  or the stick which makes existing ships harder to access by the invincibleone is the carrot as it provides new stuff the other is the stick as it removes stuffmy concern is for those in npc corps who have ground to the absolute end game with nowhere to go in my view one shared by ccp in fact if you read the devblog announcing 10 npc corp tax this grind should be the beginning of ones eve experience not the end there is such a wonderful game world to experience and many of you are essentially playing x3 beyond the frontier
ganking a hulk in a catalyst has riskbtw where do minerals and mods come from where do you get your ships from and theyre not interacting with you back in the days you had to mine your own minerals and build your own ships good times
you should be asking what the  does hulkageddon have to do with being in an npc corporation i suspect hes getting desperate now stop the evemail spam
i laid something like this out about a week ago in another thread i definitely approve of driving people out of hiding in npc corpsneutrals are probably the biggest contributors to the highsec isk fountain if we could make it unprofitable to operate bots and longterm grinding alts in npc corps we at least would be moving them into corps where they could be war targets
not everyone is a bot floppieuntil you get past that bitno one will win this fight stop the evemail spam
read again the issue isnt just bots its that anyone can operate an npc corp alt for moneymaking and be virtually immune to attempts to reduce their cash flow it lets them run missions in utter safety then send that cash to their main character to be spent doing whatever it is youre trying to keep them from doingi briefly considered the idea of simply making it costprohibitive to transfer money from an npc character to another but thats easily circumvented so the only real solution is reducing their ability to make money while in npc corpsalso heres where i suggested this with a lot fewer words
cant believe no one sees what will happen if this idea went livea bunch of singledigitmembership alt corps with 0 tax wardecd  make another for less than the war dec cost what is you plan to deal with this so you can force people out of the npc corps also as stated eventually this idea would get people to 100 tax rate in npc corps thats legit yoflaws aside this idea is still awful
easily my favorite line in this entire thread loland hes right if you force people out of npc corps they still wont comply with your wishes they will still do everything in their power to avoid youthis entire thread is nothing more than a big huge my idea of a sandbox is more important than your idea of a sandbox whine you cant force people to play the way you want them to and you cant force them to interact if they dont want to get over it
you raise a good point about the one man corps i dont think such an exploit would matter though as if people leave the npc corp to make their own single digit corp they have still increased their risk and so still deserve the reward of 0 tax they would receive i do not think npc corps should end at 100 tax thats silly perhaps 40 should be highest for example and maybe a slower increase 1 a week like i said in the op i am open to ideas for the actual numbersanyone reading most of the replies in this thread would think the op says turn empire space into nullsec so i can kill whoever i want when in fact it is a measured and reasonable approach to redressing hyperinflation risk vs reward the devaluation of most items and everyone having now completed eve as we wait for ccp to supply a new end game
so make it more difficult to close one corp and open another and put a cap on npc corp taxes so that its reduced income not completely removed the idea is to make sitting in npc corps less desirableanother idea might be to add hostility between npc corps so that rival corps wont all you to dock in their stations or give you access to their agents if npc corp characters were only welcome in their corps native empire space meaning they cant use agents elsewhere and had rival corps in that space that would deny them docking privileges it might become enough of an annoyance that they leave the npc corp
surely if someone wants to subscribe to eve and pays their money each month as you do they can stay in a npc corp if they want to what gives you or anyone else in this thread the right to dictate how someone else plays the gameif someone wishes to remain nonaffiliated to any corp or alliance in eve then that is their right to do soremember not everyone in a npc corp is there to avoid wardecs there are plenty of reasons as to why a character is there most notable being null sec alts for logistic purposes they dont run missions for the most part so an increasing tax rate would not affect them at alli will not support any suggestion that impinges on someone elses ability to play the game their way
have to agree with mr menancefloppie you bring up a valid point but the fact remainswe have no right to force anyone to play this game any differently than we would expect you fine gents to do soand the excuse of stopping bots isnt going to fly eitherbecause obviously not everyone is a botyes everyone here has high sec altsso its shooting yourself in the footthere are ways to take them outeven if they arent convient as a war dec stop the evemail spam
you dont think avoiding wardecs has anything to do with why npc corps are used for nullsec logistics
not really it would be just the same if they were in their own corp most of the hi sec griefers that dec large null sec alliances wouldnt waste their time trying to work out which one man corp belonged to a null sec tooni know my logistics toon is in a npc corp just because i couldnt be bothered with setting up a corp when it wasnt and still isnt necessarythis is not my main either and is in a 1 man corp but i do run missions on this toon and various other things but that is my choice noone forced this on me and thats exactly whats being proposed by this suggestion imposition on a select part of the eve community to conform to someone elses idea of what they should be doingdont agree with that and never will
what he said
this
silly and cliched ideaaside from that in case you missed the recent newsflasheves subscription numbers did dropfield of trolls if you chum it they will come
ccp dictates how we play the game every second were playing it concord thats telling me i cant shoot your ship when i want to how dare they not let me play my waywhat were suggesting here is a look at a way to stop the abuse of the npc corps without forcing people out of them alliance supply lines are largely untouchable because they can be maintained from inside npc corps isk faucets such as mission mining and incursion alts can all be protected inside npc corps people pay a paltry corp tax for absolute immunity to the movements the corporate world of eveas i said im open to other ideas such as restricting access for npc corps to their own empires create a more robust background of lore regarding the corporations and their relationships and then use that lore to create restrictions that fit within the game universe and give it more depth if you wanted to make it really interesting occasionally shift those relationships along with news articles about various corporate contracts and summit meetings and suchmeaning that if youre living in an npc corp your ability to do business may be suddenly cut off as your employers status changesas it stands you can be employed by a gallente npc corporation and run missions for the caldari navy in which you shoot federation ships im pretty sure the caldari would never hire someone who worked for their rivalsfor the time being all rights may be revoked by ccp at any time yeah id like to see those shoved out and forced to reside in player corps where they were vulnerable to wardecs for the purpose of interfering with supply lines but i dont know a good way to do that though my idea of docking restrictions does make it harder to run npc corp hauler alts
you really shouldve quoted my whole postnull sec alts for logistics wouldnt bat an eyelid at being forced out of a npc corp they will just make a 1 man corp and carry on their merry way how are you ever going to know they were an alt for a specific corpalliance also as i previously stated logi alts rarely run missions so again a tax rate increase wouldnt affect them so it still wouldnt work for that specific purposeyeah ccp dictates how we play their game not you not anyone else that decides how others will play the gamedocking restrictions would limit a lot of the game for a lot of peoplewell i am sorry to say but there are people that only like to run missionsmineplexdo pimanufacturing without being wardecd by griefer corps every other minute thats how they want to play then that is fine by mehow about you and all the griefers move to lownull then you can shoot at anyone you want and leave the npc corp people alone why is this even an issue for anyone is beyond me unless you are quite happy in hi sec griefing people that cant or wont shoot backonly trouble there is the people in null will shoot back and are likely to have a lot more friends than you doagain this just smacks of i want you to play the game my way oh and the part about npc restrictions theres already a game mechanic for that shoot gallente navy ships for caldari missions for example then you take a standing hit to gallents and vice versa think that is working as intendedone thing that may help this situation full on no holds barred war between the 4 factions in eve be a gal toon in cal space and you can and will get attacked something like that would be coolthe big boys have been too friendly for too long nowwe want war
ugh you dont get it right now theres a risk in closing holes you need to jump through and theres the risk that company on the other side keeps you from jumping back this risk is necessary for wormhole ops to take place there needs to be the chance for hole control to be wrestled from one side or the other youre bombs idea fails someone knocks the hole to second crit with no risk now its impossible for a fleet to get through to reinforce allies or whatever this cripples wormholes ops and is an embarassingly bad idea
i really dont care about reinforcements that isnt even a factor im considering
nopeyou just want the i win bomb in dealing with uninvited guests and closing down wormholesbe honest nowtraditional methods are too expensivetoo risky for you to deal withyou couldnt care less about reality or the facts concerning large scale operations let alone game mechanics stop the evemail spam
this is why you fail theres a hell of a lot more going on in the game than what you alone care about
so were back to these bombs being instawin in your opinion well the problem is that you and ingvar angst now disagree because he says that these bombs would help the invaders and you are saying that these bombs would help the defenders against the uninvited guestsyou two disagree on who it would be beneficial forthe reoccurrence over and over in your posts about reinforcements tell me that this is a very important issue to you i do understand that as a part of a corp that was rescued when invaders came into your system youd be sensitive about anything that would disrupt your sense of security i expect you see this proposal as an assault on the mechanics that give you that security i can respect that motivation but i simply disagree that it should be a determining factor i would quote back to you your own sentiment there is a hell of a lot more going on in the game than what you alone care aboutfrom all of the resistance ive seen to this idea i hope that everyone can just relax and rest assured that no matter how long this thread gets this idea probably wont be something ccp will adopt i think it is a good idea and im amused by the discourse were having but i dont honestly expect this to come out in the next patch so just ease back theres no need for people to get their blood pressure up it is a conversation on a topic we disagree about
but thats just it no one cares that you dont care many do your bad idea would result in people losing their systems with no hopes of being able to fight back you turn wormhole assaults into carebear adventures with minimal repercussions ive been involved with both ends of the spectrum system assaults and defenses you have no clue how much of the game youd break simply because you want a lazy way to blow up holeswe can agree on one thing ccp wouldnt damage their game this way so there should be no threat of seeing something this ridiculous ever implemented
it already is and always will be simply because the players will find a way to make it trivial
currently theres risk you actually have to go through the wormhole many times to close it these bombs remove the risk by allowing somone to stay on one side only and reduce the hole to the point its unusable wormholes are about the risk we dont need crap like this making them safer

i agree with drake on this onewhat you propose is a double edged sword and more likely to be used for wh denial than anything elseit will make whs nice safe and cosy for the people already there that is just so wrong so no way i can support this one
i agree with this drake denying reinforcements is the same as denying people access to your hole i am totally with you these devices are used to degrade holes without bias they dont exclusively work for invaders or defendersthe issue i think that ingvar angst sees is that he had a very close call his group could have been ousted from a system they were really invested in he is imagining the russians lobbing wormhole degrading bombs at the holes instead of having to fly their big logiorca through them the orca was the lynchpin to them saving their system because once they blew that up they could keep the holes open and get people to fly to their rescue i do get where hes coming from there are so many topics i want to address i have to revert to bullet points the russians were on in their time zones and were asleep enough at the wheel literally and figuratively so that aquilla could bump their dreds out of the pos and blow them up now if you have the time to bump an opposing fleet out of their pos you have time to close a wormhole or explore to try and get reinforcements in the only time the russians were doing anything was when they were online and active and whether or not they had bombs thats how it was if the invaders of a hole have to use these devices they will need to be flying a sb sbs can be destroyed much easier than orcas or tengus the aquilla incident did involve a russian orca but without a pos or an orca youre not changing ships in a wormhole this means that youre stuck in the sb these devices would cost a lot they are a guaranteed loss ive been saying around 20 million isk and i think thats a good starting point 20 million per shot you can either fire off 10 or 11 of these things or you can buy a tengu hull at the same price the cost might not matter to big alliances who replace their lost supercaps with a yawn but very soon it will be obvious that this bomb is a convenience not a replacement for jumping back and forth through the hole this
do you actually put any thought into your argumetns or are you just trolling for grandstanding purposesyou just single handedly made yourself look completely and utterly wrong and yet at the same time came up with some sort of copout to make your proposal seem reaching to have some sort of validatiywho gives a flying crap if russians use sbs or notpoint iswe will use whatever tool cheapefficient at our means to deny or grant access to whsyour bomb is nietherits a too easy i win button to close holes or deny access or just because excuse that can easily be sorted by any ship with a ton of armor plates for the same priceyou keep diluteing your excuses into one simple concept that you refuse to ackwnoeldgethis is all simlpy because i want it and its right as suchwe dont need it or want itthank you very much stop the evemail spam
posting in an obscure thread on an eve forum is hardly grandstanding besides this thread has been at least 90 negative towards this idea  if i am anything it is a glutton for punishmentneither cheap nor efficient if that is true why do you call it an i win button your standards may be different than mine but if i was going to design an i win button it would be effective drake you are assuming that i am pushing this idea because i want them for my own use i dont need to use these bombs and if i had them i would probably save them until i had a really good reason to use them i know how to degrade wormholes and i am perfectly happy to let the dangerous ones expire naturally if ccp came to me and said we have decided to make your wh bombs but you and your alts will never be able to use them i would still support the idea  its not about me at allyou can keep insulting me and deriding me and trying to provoke me into acting like you do but when you do that the messages i see are i cant compete so i am going to try and hurt you and im not mature enough to have this discussion you arent hurting my feelings youre just making yourself look bad we can disagree with each other without being petulant
the forum monster needs to be contained i dont know what causes it but its very annoying to always have to copy your post just incase the worst happens even 1 line quick responses
yeah the hiccups are starting to get on my nerves
the sad thing is the old outdated forums worked perfectly fine this new and improved one gives endless error messages and devours posts ctrl c and ctrl v are two things i hit before clicking post every time even on ones as short as this the old forums didnt have this problem it is inexcusable for the new ones to have it
dont get me wrongi love the new forums but the weve been ganked page is not only annoying to look at but irritating in how often it occurs it is bad enough that i have had to get into the habit of copying every post i make just in case
just fyi with google chrome im able to click back when a post gets ganked and the previous page has the text of my post in it firefox and ie have not given the same resultsbut yes this is the only forum i know of that suffers from this problem i dont understand why ccp felt the need to come up with something new and bad when so many existing forum systems are so reliableedit and the redirect for the weve been ganked page is stupid if i open a link in a new tab and get weve been ganked thats iti have to close the tab and reopen it i cant refresh i cant click back its a dead end other sites dont do this

so i took it upon myself to update my corps fittings because it had old fits from a past alliance which is now dead i wanted to also add in new fits from new alliance doctrines implement a standardized naming convention for the fits and also input fits from plain text online to do this one would assume that itd be easiest to export fits edit the xml then reimport them however this took me over two hours to do the xml editing was just fine but importing was a huge painfirst one cannot import a fitting xml sheet to their corporation list even with proper roles instead they import to your personal fits of which we only have 100 then when importing if there are errors in the module names itll still import other ships instead of making you fix everything first this resulted in a ton of duplicates which needed removing to make space for fixed fits after that i found out that the bloody import mechanism didnt even import every ship every time it imported about 6070 the first time and then i had to delete those fits from the xml sheet and reimport bringing in anywhere from 2050 of the remaining ships i think after about 1015 different imports i finally imported all of the corp fits and i lost most of my own personal fits because i couldnt think of a good way to keep corp and personal fits separate during the import this is just patheticso to put it plainly these are things that needshould to be fixed in the corporation fitting management interface import to corporation fittings dont import if errors dont import duplicates import every fit in a document in one shot remove fits from personal list when setting as corporation fit but not the other way around before anyone asks this is an alt and any grammartypographicalother errors are due to habits it being almost 5am and me being sick

only as far as people put up their stuff read the last word as any expletive of your choice on failbook or similar sites i have a good idea about what is readable or searchable about and from me on the net which isnt very much and id rather keep it that wayand if you mean something like hacking meaning gaining unauthorized access to data records when talking about by anyone who has the skills i wouldnt call it free since it takes at least some efforts on your part and comes with some risks so your example is flawed even more so when it comes to anything military ever heard of operational security
i understand what you wantbut why frankly i would have to say no to this simply on the basis that we are supposed to have future tech in eve future tech would allow for this kind of information to be widespread knowledge and easily accessible from my understanding on the lore end of it all of the information you see on that map is derived from the gate system it is delayed for a reason as wellnow if you want to limit information gathered through api i would completely agree

just on the outside looking in i find it strange that this comment keeps coming up in relation to this problem with moongoo the way i see it these moons have been controlled by the same people for years one can assume they have quite a bit of isk now and with such a massive amount of it on the defenders side how can lets say a small corp ever have a slight chance at taking a moon let alone defending it from someone with those resourcesat that point its not a matter of will laziness determination whatever how could anyone feasibly compete against someone with thousands of times greater resources eventually the aggressors will run out and give up

nah dessies are fine inside of minors if youre in a minor to fight then some frigs sitting on the warp in would work fine methinks id sure as hell engage with with even numbers against destroyers if im already inside the plex 12 the time a dessie is range fit so its a nice gamble to take with expendable frigateshell i even caught a catalyst outside a gate i was in a punisher while his friends went in and survived long enough to my friends to get there from a stargate and pop him however if im frig soloing in a plex with absolutely no reinforcements nearby and i see a destroyer inbound ill be doing a nice gtfo maneuver for sure
ive decided that since i broke my yellow crayon in second grade that no one can use yellow crayons if i cant use a yellow crayon no one else should be able to id buy a new one but im too cheap and im scared that it will break again
ive decided that youre an idiot its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i cant see why you fail to discuss the facets of the proposal without making retarded metaphors to crayons and primary school i figure its easier to chalk it up to the autism spectrum v0v its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i actually have to agree that removing the learning skills from the game was to the betterment of the game and the new player it took months to train those skills and even though a lot of us suffered through it it was a major detractor to the game from a new player perspective now that those have been removed everyone begins the game with what was once considered max learning skills however i fail to see a logical argument as to why learning implants should be removed ive seen a lot of posts here but as of yet still havent seen anything valid ive certainly seen no flaw in the game mechanics presented i honestly dont see any new players being awed into the game just because learning implants have gone away every single new player ive known in this game that has quit eve has quit for reasons relating to highsec things relating to the lack of mission variety mining is boring things along those lines i have never heard someone say they quit the game in the first month because i trained faster than they did i have however seen quite a few older players erage in local because they got podded and their implants are on a killmail now
you dont like crayons 
fear of podding due to loss of implants is a major reason why noobs are afraid to leave highsec they can easily change to a cheap ship but cant change to a cheap clone because they dont have jumpclones and as a noob learning faster is really appealing so theyll try to get the best implants they can as soon as possible arguing that this mechanic is not especially bad for new players is a rather narrowminded position and yes noobs have implants from day one if they do their tutorial missions which they should
everything that could be said about learning skills could be said about implantslook somebody is doing is right above me you must train as fast as possible and that is an inconvenience because xyz so give noobs skillsimplants for free
on the other hand if you had your way those noobs wouldnt fly anything other than rifters for their first year its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i joined before there was an enhanced npe and i was running poses in 00 and getting involved in alliance fleet battles in my first year so if you know of any noobs who managed to be stuck in rifters for a year with the current npe tell them from me that they fail terribly and should go back to wow
say guys if there was a shorter 4h or something timer for clone jumping within the same station would it solve the issue with wrong hardwiring  learning implantswell just throwing some ideas here not sure this is a good one its still like trying to have the best of both worlds low risk and high rewardsand over awesome
if youre going down that route you might as well allow implants to be plugged out without being destroyed jumpclones were meant to be as a means of travel to save pilots the excruciating 50 jumps back to empire not as implant switching method
must have some delay otherwise having perfect hardwiring for your fittings become kinda mandatory in small scale encounterssand over awesome
do you have a source for this claimanway what does it matter what the original intent was im sure many things in this game work out ok even if they are not used as intended edit this seems like a less disruptive option than simply removing all learning implants from the game if the only objection to it was the functional fixedness one expressed above then i think it would be a contender sadly i think there are other problems with reducing the timer to 4 hoursmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
im not sure if it was ever explicitly said by ccp but its a fairly safe assumption if you know a bit of eve historyit was the response to people selfdestructing their pods so they could reach their destination more quickly it was common practice back then it seems silly today but warp to zero jump bridges capital ships covert cloaks didnt exist and traveling through 00 was slow and painful red moon rising introduced jump clones as means of rapid fleet deployment implant switching was probably an unintended but acceptable sideeffecton a different note it is well worth remembering how old eve is and how much it has changed some things just dont make much sense in todays eve and others never did not everybody realizes this instead making the assumption that everything is working as intended and makes sensei would also support removal of attributes entirely for that matter replacing it with a fixed spday the attribute system we have seems like it was originally intended to promote uniqueness between characters but it just doesnt work out eve has evolved along a totally different path all it does nowadays is reward yearlong remaps and inflexibility
you see there is only one reason left why i dont support the complete removal of attributes which is way more radical than the thread op there are a lot of people out there that wants more options to actively influence how fast their skill training goesthere is some truth in these claims after all it is your toon and you should be able to control him to be better at what you want him to skill training in this casebut that may also be a reflex of people who played too much traditional rpg and mmo where you are supposed to make insane ammounts of grinding to become high levelbut we are getting offtopic here the thread is about how the implants end up excluding people from the pvp content in the long run even if they dont realize it and even if it was due their decisions all alongsand over awesome
this is just sillyyou want a jumpclone then get your standings up no mmo should offer everything to you at once in every mmo you have to grind in some way in this case you grind your standing up to get a jumpclone there are also other alternatives to getting jumpclones any null sec group worth their salt should have a rorq that will provide you with a jumpclone without the standings issue it seems to me that you guys want to go from az by skipping the rest of the alphabet video games and especially rpgs are about becoming strongerworking towards a better all around toon hell even first person shooters are this way nowadays bf3 modern warfare seriouslyif you dont want to actually play the game and want to be all powerful from the start then why bother
is this a joke you been playing eve for two daysget a jumpclone there problem solved otherwise stay the heck out of null or risk it you try to not fail have a proper scout and not get podded spent lots of time flying around 6v in crystals mind you and never got podded once we always had a scout and alternative warp to avoid bubbles try to fail alil less and this wont be such a problem

character sales void your point entirely p its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
if that is the option people take then no it doesnt void my point it helps it spend money or isk and you can have access to a toon with a jumpclone whammy problem solved yet again in either case you promote the game you are are either working in real life to buy plex or you are working ingame to get the isk still requires work ccp isnt giving you a free overpowered toon i actually sold a toon to a goon a month or two ago he got itlook i can do it too  mmbunny
ugh double post fail
this all comes back to flying in what you can afford to lose cant afford to get podded w 5s in your head use 4s cant afford to lose that bhaalgorn you just bought stick with the geddon you choose what you fly how you fly it and who you fly it with there is no game mechanic flaw with learning implants the only flaw is how people fly and noobs really have no reason to be flying around with expensive implants the average skill train time for a new player is probably around a day for the first month or two the bonus that the implants would give wouldnt even be that effective and when the implants would become useful the pilot should be reaching a point where they can afford them better especially if they are in a good corp as a few others have posted before me you want to fix the problem of losing implants jump into a different clone or learn to fly better neither are very difficult
learning implants promote new players to work in the game to get better implants or it promotes them to load up the eve website and buy plex either way its good for eve
forum alts i kind of agree with our goon friend my posts would yield no credence had i used an alt i think i raised some good points and addressed the op thoroughly thatUFFFDs all iUFFFDll say on that oneolder players eve should and has been designed to favor older players it is a given that said life should not be made too difficult to new players they should not have nearly the benefits that older players enjoy but this is a game and should be fun regardless of character agepvp entry while removal of learning implants may persuade a few players to pvp i donUFFFDt think this would affect the majority of players the loss of other implants modules and ships are also considerations honestly i think you would be surprised how few payers have 5s and still do not engage in pvp
bump
thank you very much for your responses guys some constructive some not very thank you nontheless negative result is a result too what i would like to point out is that there seems to be bias in terms of what kind of people surf the forums in other words people who mainly surf the forum are th veterans who do not want this change to happen whereas most of the people with whom i spoke with and who wanted the change were more or less rookies and rookies initially rarelly crawl through the forums  hence this group is underrepresented
the issue in your logic is that you assume the rookies understand the game as well as the older players rookies rarely actually understand most of the core philosophies of eve they are still expecting eve to be a cookie cutter mmo like all the other ones theyve played but eve is a dark and dangerous place where there are consequences to your actions older players usually appreciate that part of the eve design philosophy and dont want to throw that away simply because some noobs feel like it should be easier
well yes and no i certainly agree and fully support the core philosophy of eve and i think its beautifulhowever what im trying to say here is that people object for wrong reasons introducing plex for remap does not necesserally make eve easier its still same mechanics at the core im arguing that people object because of selfisheness
selfishness your wanting an real money solution to a problem concerning the choices you make in gamelearn to live with them or get outits that simple stop the evemail spam
a they dontb it wouldnt matter to a well constructed argument whether they did or notand the thing about the whole only a minority read the forum  yeah that minority being those that are relatively informed and actually care about the gameremaps are a arguably necessary evil plex are a necessary evil opening one up for free use with the other is a terrible idea
here is my idea for bounty1 pilot 1 wants to put a bounty on the mark2 pilot 1 enters the reward amount and pays a fee for keeping the bounty open for x period of time which would be calculated relative to the bounty reward amountthis should get exponentially higher according to bounty value 3 the mark is notified of the bounty and then is told UFFFDin the event you are podkilled by a pilot registered to collect your bounty UFFFD a fee equivalent to the bounty reward will be charged to use your clones regardless of who provides the service including your own services if you are podkilled by a pilot not registered with the bounty office a fee will not be charged for using you clones and the bounty will still stand4 pilots wishing to collect a bounty must register with the bounty office before killing the mark5 the mark can approach the bounty office and pay a fee equal to 80 of the bounty placed on them to have the bounty nullifiedthese changes create a large risk in being pod killed for if you do not have the isk equivalent to the amount it would cost to use a clone UFFFD you would have all your isk taken from you unless you are killed by someone not registered with the bounty officealso if the mark gets someone they know to podkill them to collect the bounty this would only serve to remove the bounty only because there would still be a cost incurred to the mark when activating their clone the mark could never be sure if the person they have asked to podkill them will hand over the money to pay for the clone feeas for concord placing a bounty fees do not apply for using clones when killedalso provide away for players to tag ships and follow them through gates but limit it to detectable within 3 jumps or so also provide a time limit on the tag so eg if its been 30minutes the tag no longer broadcasts this should also show where a tagged ship is docked this ability should only be given to pilots currently registered with the bounty office have skillsequipment associated greater the skill level higher the chance of detectionhave skillsequipment associated to stop the detection of tagsthat is
op ah cool we basically had the same idea 
you can simply substract it see
i think part of the problem is that ccp did discuss their plans for incarna they demonstrated a working multiplayer environment they talked about the wonderful tech underlying it they talked about how boosters would be traded in bars how players could rent out shopsand then we got a single room
smokes and mirrors marketspeak demomode please dont tell me you believed that manure they shoveled around especially when walking in stations was a buzzword even years agoyou may be missing the point that we got a single room and the nex store and i think without the nex store we wouldnt have cq either and i presume i dont need to explain what the motives behind the nex store were
the point of this thread is to ask the csm to request ccp as to the future of incarna
ccps exact prioritization for the next couple of expansions is still up in the air but it will focus heavily on fis work there may be some more information in the summit minutes about manpower allocations but i cant go into more details at present
called it thanks trebor i think frankly most of us want to see work continue and focus on fis but we also want to see the completion of wis frankly i could care less how ccp allocates manpowerthat is their business not the players so long as they get the work done efficiently and correctly with fewer bugs and less delaylets wait for the summit minutes and go from there i honestly think we wont see any real information on wis until fanfest though if we get some new info from the summit that will be nice
because just going to the effing wis thread and say were still thinking about it bear with us would be so difficult
thanks for the responsebut still cant understand why they keep quit even after more and more people are asking for infowe are not demanding anything or go to jita to blast some statue thats for 00 alts who fly in systems with a too big alliance and are bored at least not now jk
what trebor said should be obvious to anyone who has read the recent dev blogs and what ccps ceo said how frequently do they need to repeat it every 2 months make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
nothing to repeat we know that fis got priority now but a lot want wis and are hoping its not on the shelves foreverthats all we want to know everything they possibly could give on info about wis
they already gave all the info they have on wis up to right now
yes ok tell me then were the tqs the only room s they were working onwas or had they more in the pipeline to finish what are their expectations regarding wisdo they think they will be able to pick it from the selves againagain not demanding more wis right now but want to know if there could be more later
thanks for your response trebori think the main thing that we would like communicated to ccp is that there is indeed support for the original vision of wis but that it should not be confused with support for the current state of incarna nor are we asking that it take any particular priority though similar to any feature in eve we would like it to recieve serious developer time at some pointi know that the summit has already occured and that incarna did not feature highly in those discussions personally i think it creates the impressions that ccp is abandoning the feature im not sure why ccp wont clarify their plans for this feature over the next yearcan you formally request that ccp respond to the issues raised in this thread and those in the 75 page thread in general discussionweve been playing the wait and see game with incarna for years enough is enough already
what drives me nuts is how this silence does nothing for ccp and is unnecessarily bothering people i even pondered the chances of taking the matter to the press
any previous plans for wis will have been greatly hampered by the fact that incarna showed the technology behind it to be a buggy resource hogging graphics card frying piece of crap
please dont troll this threadits the first decent idea ive seen in weeksthis has nothing to do with stealth bmobersor luanching bombsthis is exactly what the op says it ishe just used one examplei gave an anotherthere are dozens more where that came fromfrom all walks of evejust support it  stop the evemail spam

god i really wish ccp would revisit war dec mechanics hisec is safer not safe
heres a countermeasurejoin tax evaders corp leave corp soon thereafter npc tax counter is reset to zero if not do corphoppingso awful idea is still awful
i agree with thisi look at hi sec as the western nations all nice cosy and you can live in relative peace but you can still be murdered in the street cops then appear and punish the criminalslow sec is more like developing countries still reasonably safe as long as you know what you are doing but be in the wrong place at the wrong time and you are toast cops are ineffectual here just like the real worldnull well thats the somalia of eve to be honest everything goes and dont even think of looking for help from a cop i think wardecs do need to be looked at again they dont seem to be doing the job they were designed for hi sec should be safer than low or null but not a total pvp free zone eitheri actually think npc corps should be allowed to be decd its just a corp like any other maybe even allow the faction that runs the npc corp to help out as well just means you will have a million noobs in frigs to deal with to kill the guy your afteror how about taking a contract out on someone assassination would be cool just make sure it costs a fortune otherwise everyone and their brother will be assassinating everyone after all weve already got the terrorists suicide ganking everything why not assassinsjust some thoughts that may make life in hi sec interesting they may be bad they may be good make of them what you will i still dont agree with forcing people out of npc corps though
why else would you be posting in this thread pushing your ideathis is not a discussion on wormhole mechanicsthis is assembly hallyou are proposing a new tool that breaks whs mechanics to the degree of removing riskyet you flounder all over hell and make it look like your right all the time while shooting yourself repeatedly in the foot until you run out of ammo ro bloodwhichever comes firsteven your so called cop out about ccp saying they would use your idea but not your alts or yourself is just flat ridiuclous in itselfand the best part is  so what your saynig isyouve been waisting our timefair enoughtake your discussion to a more appropriate forum thenwere done here stop the evemail spam
because it is a good idea it doesnt have to personally benefit me for me to advocate for it
i think its been fairly well demonstrated that this is nothing resembling a good idea its a nerf i makes dangerous space safer it makes wormhole ops safer this is inherently a bad thing when you remove the risk from wormholes you remove their heart even running pi should come with inherent risk with these damnable bombs all someone has to do is blow their static down to second crit and theyre pretty well fully safe to do what they wantyou create riskfree wormhole living as a long time wormhole resident i cannot stress enough how much i disagree with this
my current ideas on how these bombs should work bomb flight time should be 10 seconds bomb speed should be 15ksec bomb area of effect should be 500m radius bomb must be launched from a bomb launcher ii bomb volume  95m3 bomb armor hp  240 bomb structure hp  50 bombs would be banned in empire space like all bombs bomb wormhole mass multiplier  4 bomb lifetime modifier  7200 seconds blueprint originals would not be available on the market blueprint copies would spawn in random stationsin order to fire these devices a pilot will need to have bomb deployment v the pilot would need to be in a stealth bomber fitted with a bomb launcher ii the size of these bombs 95m3 would mean that a maximum of 3 could be carried by any races stealth bomber the pilot would have to align to the wormhole and deploy the device between 15499m and 14501m for it to affect the wormhole at all this deployment zone puts them within targetingwarp disruption range of people camping the hole the bomb would be slow moving once fired traveling at half the speed of current bombs they would have no resistances to any damage type obviously this means that they could be shot downi had mentioned earlier that if the bomber had to remain on grid for the bomb to have an effect that would add exposure im not sure if this fits within the current game code though if there was some measure that could be put in place to make it a little riskier i think it would be more acceptablei doubt that these bombs would be used with any regularity considering their expense and risk relative to my proposed effect it gets expensive too quickly but in specific circumstances where the tactical advantage outweighed the cost i can see them used to great effect
well actually itd be interesting to see if there are any pi bots out there thats how we could tell if its too difficult for them to doi dont think bots are complicated enough to handle the little probing mini game the problem with grav sites is that they stay around too long someone can probe it out bookmark it and have their regular mining bot run it all dayreplace belts with small grav sites that deplete in 23 hours of mining at whatever rate people normally mine belts in highsecalso if you think the probing mini game is too hard for noobs then put some veldspar only belts in the starter areas until they go through the probing tutorial or better yet make them learn to probe before they can minei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
i dont think the pi model is applicable id concur with some of your thoughts here and its something ive given a little thought to myselfnow assuming the forum doesnt eat my post yet againi think any change needs to start from first principles belts are celestial objects and they move now modelling a whole load of roids all moving at different velocities would be a nightmare so we need to simplify thingsa system can spawn a number of belts per day with a total number of roids pretty much as at the moment except they dont all spawn at once except in starter systems which remain exactly as they currently arefor all other systems roids spawn in segments of say 510 roids and they a segment only spawns when scanned for now before i go further then mechanics for existing grav sites remain unalteredfor every thing else there are 2 classes of belt segments basic and enhancedbasic segments only spawn the 2 base types of ore for that sec levelregion and only the base yield typesenhanced segments can spawn all the ore types for that sec levelregion and both base and high yield typesbase segments can be picked up with a normal ship scanner enhanced segments require the use of core probesalways 100 chance of detection on single scanboth base and enhanced type segments are moving with a velocity of say between 50ms and 120ms the base types have the higher speed making them more condusive to mining with frigatescruisers or ab fitted bargesexhumersso you now have to keep up with your roids to mine themnot only that when you bookmark a segment after scanning for it when you jump to it it will be moving and moving away from you so you now have to catch up and keep up note this also applies when warping to somebody whos already in the belt current game mechanic of warping to somebody whos moving if the segment has moved more than 200km by the time you arrive you arrive in empty spaceroids are only removed from a belts segment list if theyre mined out otherwise they appear when scanned for until the list is exhaustedfuther changes to some sort of interactive model require more thought and would at least require additional mid slots on bargesexhumers and should mandate the use of a survey scanner to make any interactive model worth while some form of structure modelling for each roid would be required however this has an upside who says all roids are solid perhaps they contain voids perhaps hitting a void automatically shuts down a stripminer who says all voids are hollow perhaps they contain another ore type or worthless rock or ice or even gas the gas may not be inert or it may be under pressure after all blowouts are a major problem to the oil industry
i agree that such massive concernted efforts should be required if you really want to catch that damn covert ops ship or cloaky haulerbut do you agree that battleships t1 industrials command ships battlecruisers and every single subcap class ship in the game should be immune to all but these enormous well planned gate camps too because thats what frag warping is its complete immunity to effectively all camps for effectively all shipswhich is also why i get so confused that people dont use it more often but anyway yeah people shouldnt have to spend hours dropping drones around a gate at the risk of ccp coming and popping them anyway if they use too many just so they can solo gatecamp and catch a dominix with a tech one cloak and a mwdas for cover the gate in smartbombing battleships rofl not a fan of small gang pvp i take itcenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
neither can i believe you are educating me and you arent let me show you1 drones get blown away in low sec because of sentry guns2 smartbombs the module or the effect does not prevent cloakingyour an embarassment to your alliance if you havent figured out that smartbombs wont prevent cloaks or that sentry guns will pop any drone in 1 volley see what i did there wanna try again you have one thing correct though the united are pros
you forgot to mention that smart bombs will damage regardless of whether you are cloaked or notcare to try again nooblet stop the evemail spam
sure ill try again noobletyou ever try to kill a bs fitted or otherwise with 1 2 or maybe 3 if youre lucky smartbombing bsit still does not solve the crappy near exploit mechanic you so desperate try to maintain
1 not if you use an alt2 sit a rohk on a gate at the right distance in the direction of the outgate then watch for incoming cloakies and smartbomb them to hell as they land doesnt fix frag warping though so i think drake misunderstood you when he pointed this outunless he means you need enough smartbombing battleships to instapop that pesky dominix d i dont know why but something is telling me from the last few posts that drake doesnt actually know what frag warping is centeri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
1 not really practical imo even with the extended radius because of the drones you still going to need 3040 ships with drones out to prevent any cloaks from working will have to make a model of it to see what the exact number is2 really ur telling meus this  uhhuh thanks  even so at a guess you are going to need 40 smartbombing bs to prevent cloaking just by their proximity
what the hell does a battleship have to do with cloaking devicesare you compeletely off your rocker or somethingi think youve lost iti suggest you take a break before you make it worsemost preys in this context are blocakde runners or cruisers or frigatesanything else is likely going to be very difficult to hide let alone escape stop the evemail spam
geez i guess you still havent read the op among other things the op proposes a counter to frag warping frag warping involves a cloak i used bs because of their sig radiussize to create as many decloaking bubbles around the gate aswell as the frag warping bs if you do not know what frag warping is i suggest you reread the thread
weve tried that cant believe i missed that little gem which leads me to believe you havent read the op or the thread
i see gatecampers begging for sympathy regarding their plight to gank defenseless ships and not getting any
1 you dont have to be at the gate use a myrmidon orbit gate at 10k with mwd abandon drones one at a time around the gate cover the gate in a sphere of drones but not too many or the ccp gods will come and blow them all anyway2 heh was saying it more for drakes sake ok so thats confirmed you dont know what frag warping is and youve been ignoring us for the last two pages pro tip any subcapital ship can warp using a trick involving cloakmwd and it is impossible to lock themcenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
not soported we see enof people trying to ruin the enviorment in eve is it not enof that there will be all manner of deformed faces and people in there underwear this is not apb if you dont like it leave id prefer to keep eve the game with the highest avg player ageiq we can
i am sorryi do not understandwhat is a unisex dressyou mean a kiltsarcasmi would be all for kilts of all things to survive thousands of years of lost information and blah blah blah in eve
he means like this
its an old idea that has been suggested in the past im not saying it is a bad idea but it will not be received warmly in eve
ok yes this dude is a spacetardbut we could have the roll of faction police be filled by players in faction warfare corpsso for example if i was in the gellente navy or whatever their fw corp is called and i am in gellente space and i see someone who has bad enough standings to the gellente that it would have gotten them shot at by the gellente faction police id like to be able to shoot at them instead of them just getting blown away by npcsi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
remove concord and give players the ability to patrol highsec as the pohlees
pirate get killed by the faction police
10
dont know where you are from dude but usually the pohlees are worst criminal scum most countries ever producei support this i wanna be a pohlees man in eve
i used a straight texteditor and despite some module misspellings and shiptype mismatches due to copypasta everything worked fine xml isnt exactly hard but yes i was aiming more for a mass fitting upload system that worked and wasnt buggy as hell
could anyone explain why instead of fixing the wrong decloak distance ccp add a sound to the coi didnt see any row in any crucible updatepatch telling decloak distance is incresed from 2000 to 3200mdid i miss smth is this the way they mean to work
if you read the devblog about the new pi offices or just tried to set one up yourself youd notice that there is a little drop down menu that lets you select what time of day the office comes out of reinforcealso i dont think they need guns i like that a small gang can have a shot at taking one down not every corp is big enough to stage a full on death star pos bash and not having guns means that you need to live close enough to your planets that you will see their gang in your space and can get some home defense upi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
due to the sheer size of this proposal i have compiled it into a pdf file and hosted it please download the 624kb file from the link provided belowplanetary interaction 21the file is clean the site itself is like imageshack or photobucket for small files feel free to scan the file for viruses if you are somewhat anal about securityfi topic is located here
im getting warm fuzzies reading this beast and im only on page 11
supported if something has a huge outcome on the fight like a t3 fleet booster it should be also on grid and a viable target for the other side
 1 supportedthe ship which decisively affects the outcome of a battle is currently untouchable this in itself is ridiculous its a balance issue dealing with you being able to drastically affect the battle without anyone being able to do a damn thing a
it should apply to them as well it may not be a combat advantage but it is still an advantage risk should be required for advantages of this scale with good intelscoutssecurity there should be no issue
concur once you start making exceptions then any change even if good can be questioned thus eroding it to oblivionhopefully such a change as this will be implemented alongside changes to the principal link carriers namely command ships so that a mining operation can choose whether they want to risk the big boat for the extra bonus or are content with nonbonus links on a sturdier hullps really wish ccs are updated soonUFFFD regardless 
approves of this 
yeah i think the turrets are mainly there just to protect noobs and highsec carebears that wander into lowsec not some outside force to screw up fights on gatesi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
supported for obvious reasonsi dunno what the hell i was smoking when i came up with this godawful name
i have a set of 4s and pew pew regardless this idea is based on the belief that implants make people not want to go do other things in eve and as far as logical fallacies go this one is pretty basic the idea that pew pew is the end all be all of eve is wrong as there are many things for a pilot of new eden to do in our wonderfully diverse universe and that the only thing keeping new players from getting out there to play eve as you see it is a set of implants that this hypothetical new player couldnt presumably afford for a while if people like you me or anyone else want to spend their hard earned or not so hard earned isk on implants thatll give higher skill points thats our right as players if you prefer to not use them out of a fear of being podded however then that too is your right as a player logically i can only see the removal of these implants having a largely positive impact for the nullsec player base rather than the base as a whole as such i cannot support this proposal and call on non nullsec players to stand with meand on a side note i cant help but notice that this first page is full of goon and test members almost exclusively two of the biggest nullsec alliances pushing for something thatll greatly affect them regardless of the impact or lack thereof everywhere else
this surprises you any of the large alliances tend to steer the hand of ccp in their game design the players that have no interest in lownull end up getting the short end of the stick such as getting stuck with stupidly high export taxes at poco as one example
they are trying to push people out of high sec and into the regions where the game is suppose to be played ie lownull the pocos were a great idea imo but we digress
no no a thousand times nopay to win mechanics are not what we as a general player base want in eve and as such this idea has been denied time and time again i wont waste time belittling you because regardless of your idea the post you wrote was well done and expresses your opinion thoughtfully
actually you are mistaken lcos are the indestructable objects lcss large collidable structures are the destructable onesthis is a very low priority issue with very limited impact on the universe not supported sorry but at the very least i like your thinking
supported it is an improvement even if it is a low priority one that will likely never be addressed
did i get that wrong oh well theyre listed as large collidable objects in the data dump some are even titled lco angel bunker but if theyre lcss instead i can roll with thati bet youre right that this is a low priority thing i just cant imagine it taking all that long to program i might be underestimating the tangle of coding but im guessing it is just a randomizer and a couple of tables give it a like anyway little thing little time makes the game better it is an achievable goal let me put it that way
i would really really like to see an easier way to overheat  turn off overheat for individual modules its very hard to try to click on that little green line in the heat of battle especially if you are managing overheat on multiple modules most of the times i miss click and the module does not overheat or does not turn off and i end up burning it outwhat i would like to see would be a much wider line on the top of the module icon or some other easier to click hot spot and to make it red when its overheated green when its not it sort of makes senseanother issue is the way modules are shown as overheated or not if the module is cycling as overheated and you click the green line to turn off overheat there is no way to tell if your click worked or not and turned off the overheat you wont know until the next cycle begins which is stupid because that one cycle may burn it out we need new indicators as follows1 overheat off  faded green color as it it is now2 overheat on and next cycle overheat is active  solid bright stoplight red3 overheat on and next cycle overheat is deactivated like i mentioned above  flashing red the soft kind of flashing with gradual darkening and lighting this indicates that overheat has been deactivated and the next module cycle will be normalplease please fix thisthanksps no im not interested in the opinion of the its fine the way it just just pay more attention and lean to be more accurate with your mouse improvements are bad for harcore players like us people
1i can only agree with op fix it ccp
ctrl  click on a module to toggle overheating or another modifier than ctrl
yah but you still cant see if it will turn it off or not i would like a graphic representationno guesswork p
is this currently an option 
if you had a modifier like that for overheating itd be shiftclick to keep with the existing conventions
sadly no it isnt1 for this suggestion
that would be really freaking cool but only if it came with all 4 races of set pieces
whoever did that doesnt know how to set up a chess board or they made the queen of one race a bc and the other a bs
little outside the purvue of this boardbut why the heck not  stop the evemail spam
both queens are battlecruisers the gallente queen is a brutix
do want
hell no i want the sexy myrmidon as my queen she can pop out as many drones as i need her to too
which is precisely my point the pieces should be set up with the board rotated 90 degrees there is a correct and incorrect orientation for a chess board and queens should go opposite each other not mirrored see this for a nice picture of what a chess board should look like
the prophecy is placed wrong rule of thumb is that queen goes on color
lolwhat a load of  i do suppose that something that looks as good as the carbon character engine would run and feel like crap for someone who has a  system
so what can we expect some information as to the future of wis from ccp or do you think its acceptable that the walk in stations stuff that ccp promised to us and have been working on for years has now just been shelvedits blindingly obvious that a lot of people want to see more walk in stations content and the incarna crap that we have now is not what we were promisedshown i think its about time the csm do what they were elected and get us some solid information instead of ignoring a section of the community
lol
please give the source of the promise they did say they were working on it and they did work on it the fact that with current hardware its impracticle to do what they want right now does not mean they broke a promise i dont think they are ignoring you they did put out 2 or 3 dev blogs 1 on shaders and one on the new cqs and one on new clothes about incarna in the last 3 months really face it you are getting a decent amount of attention but you want more attention you want them to return to the days when that is all they worked on but that will kill their business make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
show me a devblog where ccp explain what happened to all the wis content gambling public areas drug trading has gone and why we have been left with this incarna dressup bullshit that nobody wanted or expectedi dont know why you guys are supporting ccp so much they have given you nothing for years because they claimed they were working on wis and now wis has been canned wake up youve just been cheated out of you money im a new player and there is a bunch of stuff that i would like fixing in this game but i was willing to put up with it because i expected incarna to be worth the wait cant you see why myself and other would like to know more
noone is asking for this noone is asking for ccp to focus all of their attention on wis it is a cheap trick to suggest that we are all we want is that ccp commit to actually giving it some attention and give us some direction as to when
recently ccp added some new default overview settings default pvp default mining etc these are a great idea but there are two big fixes that need to happen and would take ccp 10 minutes to dothe default pvp overviewfleet members corp members alliance members militia members and blues in general should not show up on the overview basically people you shouldnt be shooting at should not be showing upalso add a logi channel for the people who do need friendlies showing upevery other overviewthe flashy red of aggression and off yellow of negative sec status need to have a lower priority than fleet corp alliance militia good standing i cant count the amount of times someone with a poorly set up overview has shot a friendly because they got aggressioni am sure you guys can come up with some more default overview fixes but these are the two that really annoy mei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
not supportingyou presume that your style of pvp overivew is the same as everyone elsewhat about logistic pilots what about scouts etcetcetceveryone has a different way of doing thingsinstead of a new set of defaults or a fixthere should bea tutorial on adjusting overivew settings as part of the npe if you willi could be spitballing a little bit herebut everyone has there tastes for various areas of expertise and needs stop the evemail spam
people flying logi and people just shooting at enemies will always have a different overview anywayjust make a default logi and default everybody else in pvp overviewalso when would you ever want an overview that would make friendlies flashy red every once in a while because of some aggression mechnici honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
when would anyone versed in pvp not know how to set up his overview or at least be tuaght as such stop the evemail spam
well following that line of reasoning why have default overview settings at allits for convenience sake its so every fc doesnt need to worry that hell have one dude with screwy overview settings its so you dont have to fiddle with your settings as much when you set up eve its so when you try to get people to join the game you dont need to walk them through setting up their overview to not shoot at blues every single time someone starts playing evei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
logisticsedit also i find it useful to see who is on the field in a small gang engagement not all of us are lemmings incapable of properly choosing targets on a mixed overview i like the pvp overview the way it is
i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
ERROR
see my edit
this is where youre wrong period if such a gamebreaking tool existed it would quickly become a requirement to train for and use these tools to keep up with the tools that use themthis breaks wormholes its an incredibly bad idea that benefits the richest and largest corps and alliances only which is pretty much going against the grain of the wormhole paradigm
these bombs would not be used by most corps that want to degrade their statics in situations where the corp felt safe they would use conventional means these bombs would cost a lot and using 5 of them a day at 20 mil a pop adds up to real money in a hurry now if your corp has the 3 billion a month to spend on these per wspace system you control then kudos to you but i think anyone who takes a sober look at it will see these as an unnecessary expense if you dont believe me run some calculations and tell me how to make it affordablesure people will want them and train up to use them but unless they are in a stealth bomber they cant and even if they are in a stealth bomber instead of a pvp ship they are open to being podded the bombs can be defeated by a single battleship with a smartbomb camping the hole there are lots of limitations if anything i am starting to think that i am putting in too many concessions to try and find the middle ground
horse crap if youre static is a 5 billion mass hole and youre online alone at the time the way these abombinations c wut i did thar would be used to crit the static to make the hole perfectly safe for that single pilot to do whatever itd be worth the expense for the security to mine arkonor all day without much threat if you so chose the rich would abuse these while the rest would still incur normal risks theyd also become an expected expense in wormhole ops an invading force would budget these into the assault then use them for risk free hole control of an invaded system the whole concept of adding safety to wormholes is detrimental to the frontier lifestyle they represent in eve too much gets broken
pretty much this stop the evemail spam
so you spend 100 million to degrade your hole to 7 and then you mine arknor until you make 100 million to replace the 100 million you just flushed down the wormhole then after that the rest is profitso be it
you really have no concept of miningyieldprofit output of a wormhole do you stop the evemail spam
i get the impression hes not ready for wormholes so hes trying to nerf wormholes down to a level of safety that wont keep him awake screaming at night
i remember when we dragged out a ton of arknor and stuffthe problem is not getting the oreits processing the stuffa concept he has not experinced aparently stop the evemailUFFFDspam
im sorry that we disagree i wish you all well
barrel rolls would be fun wouldnt they i can see it nowbarrel rolls in my chimeraloli kidi kid
as long as bots can work with ocr its just a matter of programming it to work with any visual system piprobingetcand since bots are businesses for their creators its not hard to get good programmers for the taskso without 100 first hand experience i can speculate and probably be right about it that there a lot of piprobing botsthey could be slower than humans in those task maybe less accurate but the principle is simple enough to automate itread and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
yes plz its highly annoying
at lastwell at last weve gone from step one to two but at last none of the lessedit ive noticed that you could shave off a few pages by saying that mi will be the same as pi without the need to descriptions and in the few cases of there being changes just add those changes in there is no need to repeat what was already said also may want to consider such with the link and storage facility descriptions too
finaly new pos system new sov system
my god mandownloaded skimmed through the areas i like 10 internets
i knowlaziness set inif there is ever a revised and reposted version of this proposal ill keep that in mind
i didnt read it because the download site looks sketchybut if it makes pi take fewer mouse clicks to set up ill support iti honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
the idea is well thought liked and contributed by many players in the fi channel i hope ccp will prove their capability of UFFFDcommitment to excellenceUFFFD through adopting wonderful ideas from player like thisto op i will like you with all my accounts and hope for best but seriously dont get too attached
every like counts i have it on good authority that this document is currently being circulated amongst the powers that bethe fi pi 20 topic is also a debating ground that sees new ideas pop up almost weeklywell have to wait and see what comes of this tho
agreed that if a ship is getting bonuses i should be able to shut those down by having a chance to kill the boosterthis was a flawed mechanic1
actually yes they arelarge groups rarely use t3s for boosting as the fleet is rarely stationary a threelink loki legion or tengu would have a hard time surviving even with logistics you have all resists and considering that such groups routinely use fleet warps ie to land the fleet on a pos at optimal it would be impractical to boost from off gridyou do not need to run a t3 gang link alt to be competitive believe it or notthis isnt world of tanks its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
yeah id like to see gang links only work on grid that way you could shoot them out the same way you shot out logi rather than just have them safed up at a posgranted this is probably an api swapping session changing nightmare having peoples stats going up and down depending on whether their squad wing or fleet boosters were warping on and off gridalso if you dont like the idea of a grid being to met gamey or whatever just say it only works within 300kmi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
assuming you meant ongrid so what that would only affect the noobier fleets that where the fc warps everyone around with no warning  the experienced fleets are already accustomed to bringing logisewar in separate from the dpsehp boats and adding a handful of link hulls to those groups should pose no problems for thembesides who says that there can ever only be one ship with links present and that it has to carry all of them at the expense of tankdpstackleewaretc with a little dev time i am certain that multiple ships could be assigned as fleetwingsquad booster part of the problem is that the system is designed to have just one booster per fleet level which makes the current 1 superlink boat not only obvious but downright mandatoryguess that depends on where and how one operates try going up against a boosted hurricane in your unboosted ditto and see how well you fare  hell have longer scram higher speed lower sig and more ehp than you can ever achieve alone but for a gank on a gateundock or a baittrap it does indeed make little differencethis is the main reason why the change has to be carefully implemented especially since ccp has so far been unable to solve the shield hp issue that is caused by fleeting  may have to change the bonus to one of rechargeresists or something to circumvent itideally the change would be in conjunction with an overhaul of the link ships so that the need to warp inout constantly is limited it should still be there but not even close to what we see with ecm birds and logistics
seen 00 been there done that been not impressed sure rocks are larger resources are more plentiful but is it worth all that hassle for me it isnt and im not talking about expenses in isk only but back to topicusing the oftencited sandbox metapher it is just a matter of what tools you have and not have implants  regardless whether theyre attribute implants skill implants or maybe boosters which are a sort of temporary implants for all its worth are just another tool use it or dont its a personal decisiontaking away whatever tool there is just makes the game a bit poorer be it modules be it ships  even implants
id like to mention that i dont speak for my alliance its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
supposed to in no literature that ive seen from ccp official or otherwise that game play is supposed to be played in lownull
alright so what attracted you to this game in the first place the idea of running missions all day solo or all the stuff about the 600 player battles its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
no end gameevery other game that i have ever played has a particular point you have to get to to win then start over be it get to level 80 or race to the end of the track faster than anyone else or beat up x number of armies while collecting y number of jewelsin eve there is no end game and there is so much to do in this gamethis is the problem with a lot of people who play this game for the sake of pvp and believe me im not saying youre wrong is that theyre so narrow focused on one of the major facets of this game that there are other facets that they miss out on true said people may not find it attractive they may find it boring they may not have any interest in it pvp is not the end all  be all of this game and that is what fascinates me about eve
removing learning implants isnt going to force anyone into 00 or force them to change their playstyle it will just remove the unique incentive to stay in highsec with 5s or 4s for the poor plugged in while not playing the game to the fullest this is bad for the same reasons learning skills were bad and worse because the incentive never ends unlike learning skills of course some of those actually doing this may feel like theyre losing an advantage over people who dont
sarcasmso why not remove implants entirely then all of them all slots gone totally removed from the game no really letssarcasmseriouslywhen you have implants from 610 sitting in your head youve got permanent bonuses that affect other aspects of the game be it for ship bonuses tracking bonuses mining bonuses whatever some of those implants are also in the 100s of millions of isk to buy as well they give you the the same effect as what slot 15 do except they dont gear towards a permanent learning bonus but a bonus to how you fly your ships for different situationsthe only real difference between 15 and 610 is that 15 adds sp which extend the life of your character excluding certain scenarios where sp can be lost where as 610 grants bonuses for that moment however 610 may give you the edge you need over another player in pvp or allows you to bring in more rocks per cycle or whatever for that moment in time either way the implants give an edge the point of all the implants are to give players the choice in which edge they want itd be also up to the player to put in the 100 mill implant to get that extra 5 bonus for tracking speeds i dont know if there is an implant that does that just picking something for pvp so itd be their decision if they want to pay in isk for that edgehow that edge comes into play is a matter of player choice i concede that true that you gain more sp with the implants in while offline than you do without with no effort aside from grinding the near 600mill isk to get the set that aspect is there but this just means that players have the ability to get into more aspects of the game that require higher levels of skill faster with no effort now while sitting in 5s may be a deterrent to engage lownull it is by no mean a game mechanic restriction the choice is yours to put 34 or 5 in your head or dont use implants at all it also comes to mind that the same ordeal with rd agents happen where you grind to a certain point to get research points for free after that the player doesnt have to do anything but you can cash out and get an influx of isk this also happens while the player is offline should that be abolished as well gain for no effort for any length of time but since most die hard pvprs dont do research i guess theyd never think of thatseriously
i dont think you really understand anythingi mean youre ignoring everything that has been said in this threadeverythingincluding the stuff that didnt make sense and was flagrantly idiotic
you could apply the same logic to learning skills they too were merely a matter of choice of course we all know that not training them was a bad choice bottom line is some choices are at odds with what this game is about and they need not exist choice is not a holy cow that shall not be slaughtered
the heart of this thread is risk versus deterrent versus enjoyment versus choice each one is weighted differently for each player and this is where everyone seems to get up in arms about everyone should have that enjoyment scale way up high theyd better otherwise i really dont know why their playing choice is also probably something that would be way up on the scale as well risk versus deterrent will reflect the level of enjoyment and choice simply by other players actions right now my corp is at war most of us arent war mongers dont care to pvp im one of them but then there are a few of us who are blood thirsty and some of us will step up to the bat and get the adrenalin rush im one of them  dont care to pvp but get the rush i dont enjoy being in a war i dont enjoy the thought of losing my ships at a random time because i just didnt pay attention to local once and didnt notice they came online that turns my enjoyment level down and the number of choices i have while in game being in a war is a deterrent for me to play the game i want to play that mean i should start up a thread saying war shouldnt exist for corps based in highsec
player choice is the holy cow in eve that choice is what sets this game apart from other games the choice to be whatever you want and do whatever you want to train however you want and fit your ships however you want the more you slaughter this so called holy cow the more eve becomes comparable to other mmos now im not saying that other mmos are bad because they arent eve what im trying to say here is that there is a lot less player choice in other mmos compared to eve
its the point you make not the toon you post with posting with an alt doesnt give your post less credence so long as you make a good argument and stick to the topic at hand
wrong forum alts are used by those who cannot stand behind their words its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
please give me some more detail as to your meaning i dont want to make assumptions here do you mean in an in game military aspect or in experience 
none of that really when youre hiding behind a purposemade npc corp forum alt usually evident by the lack of a portrait neutral sec status terrible spellinggrammar etc you are essentially admitting that you dont want to stand behind your posts with your main i dont know if its fear of retribution or the inability to back anything they say up with experience that can be shown ie via killboards or reputation but in either case i dont really care for posters who hide behind forum alts that have been in hedion university for 4 years its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
no no to the next person who requests it you get one a year plus some give aways the changes to bonus remaps makes extra ones even less needed plan ahead

they were going to do this couple of years ago or at least thinking about it but miners went ragemode for no reason by some imaginary maths some ppl thought it would not be good idea to make botting more difficult and mining more rewarding and less repetitive
so as far as i can tell the icons used to make a corp emblem or logo or whatever you call it have been around for quite some time with nothing new we have gotten character changes such as carbon and wis but not new icons to represent who we are as a groupi guess its not terribly important but its one of those thousand papercuts issues something small that would mean a lot to me at least if it was updated and if implemented allow older corps to redesign their logo one time to the updated icons or possibly make it so for a small fee ten million isk or so you can continually redesign your logo kinda like companies today can change their imagejust an idea
would be nice to revamp the corp logo stuffyou can actually change the corp logo as many times you like at present without any fee iirc
these were already seen on sisimaybe summer expansion
yeahand while we are at it lets see some faction tier 1 and 2 battle cruisers fed navy myrmidon actually id like to see more low sp people with faction gear just lazily floating around in lowsec doing whateveri honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
tech 3 frigates and battleships first plx 
i want an abaddon with brickwall texture
brickwall lolbut seriouslysome faction bcs would be nicetheres faction frigscruisersbssbut no bcs or even destroyerswould be kinda cool to be honest stop the evemail spam
hmm might be nicepersonally i just want the blood raiders to actually use their ships instead of just amarr ones
this please
confirming that cosmos are difficult to track note pages anyone and the cosmos items need a revamp  rebalance take away the crazy material requirements pleasejust use the extra skill book requirement to make these items and lets start getting them in game1
i would say they should clearly label structures differently that could drop loot items and pertain to the mission to those that dont have large coliable object be the category for structures that dont drop things or have any impact on mission and structures be for anything potentially useful
shift  click or shift  activate module with f1f8 was toggle overheat 2 years ago but ccp changed and brought this to an end they ruined this great function too i dont know why
it probably had to do with grouping guns since that uses shiftdrag easy fix use a different control for grouping btw shiftmodule shortcut still works
they could even use the whole nex store and add it to your hanger lounge and challenge someone to play against you
things change over timei recall hilmar some months ago saying that he wants to come back to incarna the real incarnacurrent incarna is a small confined single player game which goes against everything massive and multiplayer about evecould always give a new statement from eve developers what the future is not that its the post incarna era with cruciblewonder if crucible is a reference to the rebellion of angry players like a crucible
no they hadhave other stuff it wasnt all ready to get released with incarna this summer look at the sisi build and stuff there are references to other placesits probably a good bet that the winter expansion was initially intended to bring these other venues to wis  and then the complete backlash from the community the emergency csm summit and other internal discussion made ccp go oh  guys were not going to survive another expansion like this they came up with crucible  fix a lot of the little things refocus on fis bring more ships note they may have been in the works anyway and just put on a faster timetable seriously its an apology expansion  the real test of their new direction will be the summer 2012 expansiontheyve pulled the majority of wis and wod and other nondust people back to focusing on fis wis may have a token team like fis had for the last 2 years so there will be little things that get done  but they know they really have to work on the technology before they have a multitoon environment lest they melt peoples rigs again
provided how im stuck with this account prepaid until may you bet i will keep hammering this nail until i get an answer
if you are in a cloaked bomber and align to a spot and put full stop on your ship why does your ship stop and then align to some totally random spot in the universei propose this be removed since bombs shoot out at the alignment you are facing you must always be in motion to shoot a bombm
please dont repost proposals already been posted
i dont even remember posting that 2 months agoi 100 appologizei know during one post a while back i crashed and then i couldnt log back in but i am to blamesorry for the double post  by me
an oops woulda been sufficent and we supported the ideamight as well bump that one as opposed to this one stop the evemailUFFFDspam
have fun bumping a deployed capital its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
to align in eve means to have desired direction and 75 of ships maximum speed therefore you cant have ship at rest and be aligned ship at rest has no direction from server point of view it will accelerate in any direction at the same rate
did you even bother to read the thread
follow up1 concerning lack of a popup filed a petition and got a response  ccp cant verify that i did or did not get a popup so they wont act annoying but i wont loose any sleep over this  it just reflects badly on ccps willingness to work toward an equitable game2 concerning how aggression is handled in hi sec ccp support says your disagreement with the onesizefitsall punishment is something youll need to take to the csm or devs as we merely explain the rules we dont make themso a final comment on the eve universe for this csm proposalgames have to be fun to be profitable  both for the devs and the players  obviously players can choose not to play and no one wants to play a dying mmpog game choices either encourage players or discourage them  the goal actually requirement is that more things must encourage than discourage players to keep subscriptions rising or keep them steady and active as an example the permanentlossofships paradigm in eve is perhaps the biggest and most controversial dev choice  quoted by many as an encouragement it is realistic and yet it is dramatically expensive and puts many players off yet ship loss is a defining characteristic of eve and overall attracts a significant number of game players who dislike the shallowness of many other mmpogsthe extent of this proposal however is small in respect thus the issue it challenges has been generally ignored and yet with deference to the random sociopath sociopathic features include grandiose sense of self callousness lack of empathy rarely in difficulty with the law but seek out situations where their tyrannical behavior will be tolerated condoned or admired 1 in game law enforcement over reaction to game violations will have no encouraging effect and thus will only decrease player numbers if it has any effect at all  there is absolutely no rational reason to not temper concords reaction to first time offenders  and in fact attention to details like these will only improve the encouragement players receive regardless of their level of experiencewhat it comes down to is what type of and how many active players do you want in the game respect people and more will follow no tutorial make the game funthis is a general attitude that should be maintained throughout the games design and although it was spurred by a relatively insignificant event many other issues will fall under this proposal1
i think the really old text that was similar to times new roman gave this game a flaming shot of class instead of the majority of the game being minimalist blockiness which is fine but that flare was exotically awesomeheres what i mean if that font got readded as an optional font or for important things like warp announcing i feel the game would have more weight i guessthoughts

ooooh using fancy words like retort and things like  so those filthy plebeians will not comprehend your verbose meaning lest you take it upon yourself to enlighten them with your wisdom how very droll and the way you lambasted my retort by suggesting it was subpar when it clearly elucidates both sides of the issue simply brilliantalso if people have to show up and submit a report i doubt they will intentionally file wrong reports so given that most of the reports will be about actual bugs experienced that in and of itself is useful because you can see which bugs are the most prevalent then again all of this is probably lost on you because tmie sic is money and you need to get back to swearing on the developers behalf
awww isnt that cutehe learned how to use big wordsget over yourself alreadyfree sps will be the wrong motivatorits obvioushence why this idea wont flyif you cant figure that outno amount of fancy talk will help you stop the evemailUFFFDspam
yeah because thats what new players need another layer of tutorials between them and the gameplayi also like how the dude getting on an alt and clicking like on himself shows up as two likes attached to this threadi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
the whole tutorial system needs a major refresh people are coming out of eve tutorials having had introductions to the basic pve activities in the game but with no understanding at all how the basic pvp mechanics worki assume youre talking about me since im the only dude here with likes besides you dont be petty and accuse people of stuff you cant prove i know who my likes came from and they arent from me
take a look again hisec is not safe its just safer fact more ships blow up in high sec then anywere alse that counter points your ideal that high sec is safeit matters not if you think only stupid people loss ships in high sec its still fact
notwo reasons why this shouldnt be implemented 1 it would be too hard to implement compared to how desired it is ccp already has enough stuff to fix2 you want to force players to join a playercorp even if the ones they want to join dont want them and they dont like the people in the corps that do want them
just allow bribing concord to wardec one individual even in npc corp it should be probably a bit more expensive stuff but i see no reason why notand then you can also just suicide gank
yeah this might be something to wait on but the november tax updated happened all at once and the surprise of it all caused a speculation bubble if ccp waits another 18 months and does another tax update it cause more carebear panic and another pi speculation bubbleid wait for people to get used to the player owned customs offices then set the taxes to pull from the market value of pi and gradually update themselvesi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
i look forward to its implementation img
so i took some time yesterday to check out some of the female clothing and whatnot for my alt i noticed the skirts that are available and purchased one those i notice dont have any flow to them because they are tight and short at this point i am a little curious why ccp hasnt introduced more clothing that has movement to them scarfs for examplegod knows we dont need scarfs in the game just an examplewould move around or bounce or sway when walking long gowns or long sleeves on dresses perhaps one thing i didnt take the time to check that just came to mind were the gowns the amarr wear yesthey are gowns get over itill check that out tonight i think if the amarr gowns flow properly then there is no reason breast and fat movement isnt possible the carbon engine is really quite impressive with all that it can do ccp needs to show this off as much as they can breast movement would not only do this but also add just a little more realism to the game it is the little things that make the differenceand of courseto remind the freakout vets out therethis does not take priority over space stuff and other bug fixes
so you want offgrid fleet boosting to be nerfed to the detriment of practically everything in the game incursions ratting mining defense fleets etc for the marginal benefit of honour matches its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
jumping to conclusions big time are we you were the one who said they are not needed to be competitive i merely tried explaining why you were wrongis it a nerf if it brings balance to the game as a whole consider what links are able to do  infinitely up max fleet size scalable bonuses that enhance very important characteristics why on earth are logistics and ewar required to not only be ongrid but in range of almost everything when their individual contribution is infinitesimal by comparison how is incursions defence fleets et al unduly nerfed by a change such as this the only thing that changes as far as they are concerned is that the link ships note plural will need actual pilots available as multiboxing can be kind of iffy in combat situationsmining would be only be affected to the extent of losing the extra 15 bonus granted by the orca whereas the rorqual provides nothing additional  where does it say that mining should be barges only with all auxiliary craft stuck in pos until needed throw a tanked command platform into the belt it can even help with rat clearingnote personally abhor the current mining system and would prefer it be changed entirely thus making the above completely obsolete so mehps keep in mind that only a few nutters have asked for an ongrid change with nothing else done best solution would be to go over the ccs t3 subsystem and whatever else might need tweaking to facilitate the change
after 8 pages of posts it is blatantly clear that the only people who dont want this change are the ones that abuse this mechanic already
really you see people flying t3 gang link ships solo i think it would be kind of silly to fly that without another ship that they give the bonuses to but whatever you may still see it how does that work for them you know if they are giving the bonuses to another ship that is 2 ships right to me solo means 1 make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
its just a difference in the type of pvp we do and what he does im not saying one is better or worse but its definitely different for solo and small scale pvpers it makes a big difference in fact i would almost say you practically throwing ships away if you dont have a booster alt now with the t2 mods im training my alt but the thing is eve is not going to be as fun when i am forced to do things like drag alts around with me by forcing this down everyones throat people are more likely to get tired of eve and unsub altogether short term gain by making people get booster alts  long term loss because eve is no longer as fun make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
whereas the only people that do want this change are likely upset that they lost their 1v1 in rancer or whatever because the other pilot was dishonourable with an offgrid t3 link shipit has nothing to do with the other pilot simply being more competent thats for sure its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
noit has to do with immunity from the risk vs reward scale that eve is supposed to have
overwhelm them with superior numbers bait them next door or deny them a fight if youre that worried upset you cant get a killmail on some chucklefuck in a linkship because youre not equipped to probe it down or you dont want to bubble its pos we then i dont know what to say its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
dont say anything at allyou obviously are completely oblivious and ignorant to the entire issue
what are you talking about honor there is nothing dishonorable about using t3 boosters i dont recall anyone saying there was nice attempt at a strawman lots of people prefer not to have to drag a neutral alt everywhere they go in order to pvp it has to do with wanting to have fun in the game as opposed to the game being a chore some people think eve is such serious business they dont understand that perhaps that is why you missed a major point of this proposal i dont know the only thing i can say is you are deliberately skipping the reasons people actually give for wanting this proposal and creating strawmen make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
this is your serious business nulls sec mindset deny them a fight great you know lots of people like to pvp in this game denying them a fight also denies you a fight signing on with no fights is just as boring for me as it is for them fights where you are just camping gatessetting bait and blob traps and winning with overwhelming numbers is boring too do you really still get any sort of thrill from that the thing is you play the game much different than lots of other people interested in this topic your strategy and null sec sov strategy in general often boils down to doing things that make it so the enemy no longer wants to log on anymore the problem is those tactics often involve you doing things that are eyestabbingly boring as well itUFFFDs a matter of who can outbore the other side the side that wants it more read takes internet spaceships more seriously wins in chess there used to be no time limits and sometimes people would just take hours to make a move and sometimes it took so long the other guy just couldnt stand it and left this actually had a name it was called UFFFDout sittingUFFFD your opponent well thatUFFFDs the way i and allot of others see sov war in eve how long are you going to sit camping that gate or that station you and likely many people who play the game like you are simply out of touch with the other people who will say yeah this is boringa chore i will stop playing they just donUFFFDt care as much as you do if the game is boring or a chore they will do other things with their time anyway none of this has much to do with the proposal other than to point out the solutions you think of are not really going to work for people who arenUFFFDt super serious about internet spaceships if booster ships have to be on grid you can still use your strategy of outboring the other side but on the other hand people arent super serious internet politicians and sign in to have fun fights will get a benefitmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
because denying them a fight was the only option i proposed its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i also addressed your suggestions of overwhelming them with superior numbers and bait and ganking them make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
who says i need to use tactics tactics are for the boring sov nullsec blobbers its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
yep your right thats what i said make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
if you dont want the implants dont buy them if you want the implants buy them and use themdont see the harm in them dont see the need to get rid of them like anything else if you got rid of learning implants people would just find some other excuse not to fleet up
i totally support the idea instead replace them with sum other new implants on their place  lp market doing variety of other bonuses
3 letter name on a 2007 character its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i couldnt agree more with this idea i dont pvp except in war decs and thats in hisec because i am too scared of loosing my implants then i am stuck to hisec which can get really boring after some timeif ccp doesnt react to this thread they really are letting their subscribers down imho
anything to make mining lessbottable would be a definite improvement if the bookmarks became an issue add a line of code to the bms folder interface unseen by us that creates a new kind of roid  bm that despawns with the siteim not a coder so have no idea if that would even be possible but if theyre going to be random spawning belts throughout a system you would never need the same bookmark twicerandom spawning belts maybe a mining interface like pi so that you have to target the desirable portion of an asteroid to get the best ore in the roid  that should do a lot of botters in it would also i think have the effect of reducing botmining and make miner  mining more financially rewarding
personally i like being able to log into eve check out local see no goons get into a hulk and warp on an ice belt without having to probe out a site firsti think it should stay the way it iseverybody in favor of this approach could move to whs insteadmake things harder for botters in the short term yes then they code smarter bots who can probe and youll be back to square oneif eve can ragequit over something as small as the nex store watch the rage unfold over a big change like this
nice conceptsafeguards systems 05 to 10 keep their belts being charted territoriy means everybody knows where the ore is and gankers too sites should be small so they wouldnt last more than three hours even to a solo hulk so botters should bother themselves to create new bookmarks each three hours sites should be rellocated on each shutdown and of course wouldnt ever respawn refill nor anything that made the bookmarks usable for more than 3 hours of exploitation or 23 natural hours additionally would be nice to create a lowsec miner something with a tank parallel to its cost 3 strip miner slots wo hulk bonus to mined amount and 1 slot for either a probe launcher or a cloaking device
i dont think it matters you force ice and ore to be in sites and not belts and the bots will just start scanning i would much rather see real belts in systems that actually span the entire system like real asteroid belts do and then add something else like sleeper rats that can kill the bots

reading trough it till now this is looking just brilliant well i went trough version 10 and u mate are just amasing1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 but got one question how u plan to do the population birth and death i mean it should all go in real time and i dont know entirely the story of new eden but i dont think there should be lot of population on those plantes i mean if every player can build cities of million of population wldnt be in line with the story i think shouldnt it be that every player can build a small encampment of few dozens of ppl who will work support and defend the pi production
1 player will not be able to build a city with many millions of people in it unless he has like 10 accounts and uses each alt he has at a cost of many billions of isk to setupthese populations will start at 500 per civilian command center and increase with a  every day or so this is automatic based on the type of planet and the type of buildingssetup the player opted for ultimately taking many months to reach the hundred thousand mark depending on how well they can play sim city so in that aspect individual players will have very small networks with very small encampments as you put it with a small amount of people on itat the end of the day the population on civilian networks and in larger cities will not defend themselves that is the job of eve pilots and dust mercs actual players will have to defend their pi and mi civilian populations againstother eve playersdust playerseconomic ruinincursions
good good it is excellent i love sim city well if these ideas get implemented eve online would just be a perfect game would offer so much contet for everyone
holy crap1
as i say to everyone who brings up similar ideas ccp has game designers already they are usually good at their job and are almost always far better than players are at this sort of thing the chances of them seeing a proposal like this and fully adopting it are basically 0in this specific case ccp had a ton of stuff planned for pi and it turned out to be too much work to implement so they started cutting features and we ended up with the system we have now which is boring and lacks any sort of game pi is also where the dust link will come into play and they already need to figure out how to make that compelling fun and interestingcsm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
ccp should start a developer program in a similar way that smartphone app markets work create a framework where third parties can implement additions similar to this which are then accepted by ccp to be put in evelot less work for ccp lot more sandbox
i think this is just an amazing ideasetup a new sandbox test server or allow players to install an offline sandbox test server on their machines code the changes que the changes for upload to a central test server get some feedback goingonce we have consensus on that addition it could be migrated to sisi for communityuser acceptance testingif it passes mustard ccp migrates it to tq
supportedi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
this is the most amazing proposal that i think ive ever seen on eve great effrot i really hope ccp looks at this and takes it seriouslycsm now its your turn do your job and push this forth
1st off id like to say that the work youe done in putting this together and thinking it thru is  brilliant detailed and well thought out howeer i beliee youe got one ery flawed assumption on which you efforts are based that assumption is that ccp has the skills and management drie to implement it  in short they do not the deelopment history of ee is layered with so many half baked designs and implmentations and so there is no chance that ccp can do this within the code design size limits of 4gb that they hae set that limitation in their thinking and code architecture will ensure that this can not be implemented the concept of a deelopment architecture that encompesses dlc is not what they are setup for and skilled up to doi am truly sorry to point out these flaws that ccp has self imposedmy suggestion is you should sae you time and effort for nowccps sand box is ee online the sand is owned by ccp we pay them a monthly fee to throw the sand at each other that is all that is here so moe along nothing more to be seen
i like mi just look at the wormholes we can setup pos in there but you cant interact with moonspi ideas are just perfect 1
no theyre not letting anyone downmy regular jc has 5s from 15 and 100mill implants from 610 right now in my jc with nothing attached because my corp is in a war i lose some sp while in this clone so whatgrind missions to get in good with an npc corp that has the medical bay study to a level 1 skill and you can amass two or three jcs to play with
grinding missions is super funor you can just hop through a jump clone corp ie eacs and not deal with that nonsense its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
true many methods around the whole grinding scenario you can pay other to do the grinding for you while you get standings uppoint is if you want to get something done there are enough roads this game permits to get the task doneedit the advantages come to those that want to work at it if you want to be lazy that is entirely your problem
10
so you want to pvp without consequence sorry but this is not what eve is about also if you get podded in highsec then you really shouldnt be pvping get a jump clone problem solved there are other ways of getting a jumpclone without grinding standing i dont owe a toon with standing higher then 2 have about 24 clones on each one
is this another mittani plan to ruin eve further i think it is honestly this suggestion sucks balls
i am not the mittani and youre dumb its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i support this it gives greater flexibility and if someone feells like paying ccp over9000 to save a couple days of training i ave no problem with that and about the meaningful choice you still have consequence it hurts your wallet most of eve boils down to that anyway
not supported because it allows you to buy overall higher learning speed or flexibility in training with real money
how is that currently not the case with more money you can buy better fittings pay more mercs offer head money for ganks of competitors or pay for protection money to gain easy access to farming grounds there is no limit how much real money you can inject into the game to get isk to do soalso with real money you can just buy ansome accounts having some 80mil sp each first place besides providing another isk sink for ccp i do not see the problem if the cost for another remap was made proportional to the currently applied sp  please comment on that thus rookie mistakes could be remedied rather cheaply while wanting an extra remap at 80mil sp may cost you say 10 plex i bet you would think twice and rather wait for the 10 days you might have possibly savedcheck the moderated 10000 papercuts evelopedia page
you mean you couldnt do 10 seconds of system scan to find a random roid thats just lazy i dont pretend to be a coder but bots probing i find that difficult to believeas for all of us in favor moving to whs i already live there
bots have already had a good two years to start scanning i betcha theres a reason why they havent already
bots will not be scanning any time soon it would be outrageously difficult to make them do so you would probably need image recognition for that since the position of probes and signatures is random i support this motion
1myself and a few other people were throwing around an idea similar to this a while back in si edit  found the link
there have been a number of threads on this topic i posted an idea myself in this thread mining mechanics changethere is also an opinion expressed in this thead that bots are quite capable of scanning whether thats just using the ship scanner or with probes is another question
nice ideaone comment from an astronomy nerd  they should just be single or maybe double asteroids in each location not belts you could still have many targetable ore deposits sticking out of each roid so the gameplay is the mostly the same
actually quite like this but yes unfortunately the backlash from eves botting community would be immensepersonally i like being able to log into eve check out local see no goons get into a tengu and warp to the 610 without having to oh waitalso bots that can probe maybe bots that can probe quickly no plus from ccps perspective chances are theyd find those botters a hell of a lot easier if they four hours straight of terribad scanning to watch out forcenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
i fail to see the problem with this well all the forum whines will suck  but once theyre gone itll be great
i do not suck in the invention just dont have too much time that i can work with invention except when my corp permanently reside in high sec
i actually did not know that never really tried
well we do have ccp focusing on flying in space rather than turning eve into a barbie dress up game so adding ships is pretty reasonable at this point id like to see the faction lineup for navies and later pirate factions fill up we still need navy destroyers bcs and yes even capitals some should be fw only while others are available at all faction appropriate lp stores generally speaking i think the standard navy issue buffs of an extra slot or two 50 hp and sensor strength and a little extra fitting resources would be appropriate but some may need major changes like the navy scorpion received one thing is for sure the imperial navy coercer will be needing a second midslot
you do know we just got tier 3 bcs right there was a whole expansion based around them
problemseve combat comes down to either a very exhausting game of rockpaperscissors or a competitive social networking match with little in the way of decisions that can be made during the course of combat to alter the outcomelack of UFFFDterrainUFFFDi included fleet control tools as well as ship control in this discussion as they are imperative if line of sight mechanics are implemented in evesystem ships of your class can block line of sight to the target you are attacking they must be within the critical distance for your weapons the critical distance for your weapons is calculated as a percentage of your weapons base range optimal  1x falloff with your skill and relevant ammunition bonuses applied if this requirement is met then your weapons do not fire until there is a clear line of sight to the targetfleet formationsthe ability to for formations with greater ease would be necessary if these changes were implemented this feature would only be one of many potential changes that would target the role of fleet commander in an effort to simplify current mechanics and add new ones with the hope of diversifying and rewarding the role of the fleet commandersystem the fleet commander should be able to form and save fleet formations utilizing a new light and easy user interface before forming a fleet during a fleet the commander should be able to broadcast formation plans to the fleet these could appear as waypoints in space that fleet members have to approach the fleet commander should have the ability to designate a center to their formation with ease say by indicating a fleet member as the center the fleet commander should have the ability to dictate the orientation of the formation around the center when warping the fleet the fleet should maintain the current formationship pilotingthis mostly applies to smaller faster vessels but the mechanics could be added for all ships regardless of class frigates should be able to utilize their maneuverability to take advantage of line of sightsystem1st control method the pilot may choose to enter this control mode this mode changes the function of the mouseUFFFDs right key when the right key is depressed and held a line will appear extending along the longitudinal axis from the bow of the pilotUFFFDs vessel when the mouse is moved from its initial position the line will deflect in that direction and the ship will maneuver in that direction as well the distance that the mouse is moved will affect how radical the turn is pilots should be able to modify the sensitivity of this control method in game2nd control method pilots should be able to create and save maneuvers within the user interface these maneuvers can be used at a later date using hotkeys the orientation of a maneuver may be rotated along a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pilotUFFFDs ship when it is performedchanges to the universeall pos shields asteroids npc stations player outposts and other structures will block los completely for all modules except mining lasers
this makes absolutely no senseplease rephrase
i apologize if things were unclearassume you are flying a battleship that is currently engaged in firing upon another vesselanother battleship crosses between you and your target intersecting the line designating los to your targetif the second battleship is close enough to you then your weapons are unable to fire until your los is clear

currently ridding ones system of old offline towers involves blowing them up this isnt a challenge in kspace because capital and supercapital firepower can readily be brought to bear on the tower and without a reinforcement timer to delay the process the relationship between dps and time is linear in other words many hands do make light work in this case however capital firepower and numbers are both hard to come by in wormhole space in addition starbases are much more frequently neededused in wspace as stations npcconquerableoutpost are not availabletower clutter is a problem in wspace as each offline tower is an entry on peoples directional scanners the more clutter on dscan the harder it is to see what you actually need and simply removing towers from dscan is not an option due to the need to keep track of towers that are onlineactivei propose that one of two potential solutions be implemented as part of the next expansion a module similar to a codebreaker or analyzer be implemented that has a chance each cycle of reverting a towers ownership to the pilot using the module on the tower or alternatively forcibly unanchoring the tower the module would have a short range 5km maximum so that it could not be used against an online tower anchoring iii and hacking i would be required roughly parallel to a data subverter except for the anchoring requirement which could be dropped it would be a tech i module and have the same mineral requirements as a codebreaker i or data subverter i starbase tower shield regenerators are shut down when the tower is taken offline by a fuel outage this would cause the towers shielding to slowly deplete over time while it is offline eventually only the armor and structure of the tower would remain to be shot through allowing the tower to be destroyed more quickly than it would be otherwise i dont want wormhole space to turn into a boneyard chockfull of the dead carcasses of starbases such that you have to destroy an offline tower just to put your own starbase up whenever you colonize a system do you
on the flip side you can build your own capital ships to defend your tower and attack other towers littering your system in the case where a system is crowded with discarded towers and you cant erect your own the options include attempting to make contact with the owning corporation see if they have the time or inclination to come and take the tower down for you perhaps theyll sell it to you since they obviously dont want it anymoreif you are able to erect your own tower you can easily bring capitals to clear out the towers you dont want polluting your spacethe very same circumstance that encourages the proliferation of abandoned towers also mean that your tower will be relatively safe its not like sleepers are attacking your tower while youre logged out
it is not very practical t build a dred just to take down 2 offline towers it also takes a week it just means you have to sit there for the entire day with lazers or drones which is annoying
assuming offlined towers here stats from chrukerdk ehp ranges calculated by hitting 100 at the weak resists or 100 at the 50 resist actual ehp will obviously fall somewhere in the middle omni ehp assumes hitting the tower with 25 each emexkintherm damage rounded up to nearest 250kamarr  40m shield 10m armour 8m hull 50 ex 25 kin 58m  98m ehp 6725m omni ehpcaldari  50m shield 4m armour 4m hull 25 kin 50 therm 58m  108m ehp 6955m omni ehpgallente  35m shield 8m armour 10m hull 50 kin 25 therm 53m  88m ehp 6125m omni ehpminmatar  45m shield 6m armour 6m hull 50 em 25 therm 57m  102m ehp 675m omni ehpassuming we have a gang of 10 bs andor tier3 bc throwing 1k dps each at a tower with 60m ehp so effectively hitting with 75 or more of your dps against a resist hole and the remainder against the 25 resist60000000  10000  6000 seconds6000  60  100 minutesso with 10bs  itll take you just under 2 hours to break a tower unless ofc they have 99 resists in hull whilst offline chrukers site says 0
keep it simple after three or so months towers forget who anchored them and can either be unanchored by the next person to come along or simply selfdestruct
so10bs is generally not feasible until you get to a 3mil kg or larger hole assuming 100mil kgbs however 10 tier3s is feasible and realistic combat fits for tier3 bcs put you a bit north of 900 dps so youre looking at 9000dps against the given 60mil ehp puts you just shy of 2 hourstower using only tier3s bs obviously can achieve the higher 1000dpsship numbers easily so they have no problem with this given mass limits make an allbattleship fleet feasible which they often dont in lower class systemsalso from these numbers you could do it in about the same length of time using 20 bombers assuming 500 dpsbomber which is achievable on a hound with good skills and a max dps fit
with the tier3 bcs fit for absolute gank youre looking at just north of 1k dps using faction ammo and meta 4 guns talos lolfitmagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iidamage control ii10mn afterburner iiempty med slotempty med slotempty med slotmodal mega neutron particle accelerator i caldari navy antimatter charge lmodal mega neutron particle accelerator i caldari navy antimatter charge lmodal mega neutron particle accelerator i caldari navy antimatter charge lmodal mega neutron particle accelerator i caldari navy antimatter charge lmodal mega neutron particle accelerator i caldari navy antimatter charge lmodal mega neutron particle accelerator i caldari navy antimatter charge lmodal mega neutron particle accelerator i caldari navy antimatter charge lmodal mega neutron particle accelerator i caldari navy antimatter charge lmedium hybrid collision accelerator imedium trimark armor pump imedium trimark armor pump iall level 5 skills this tops out at about 1075 swapping to t2 guns and void youre looking at 1320 or so obviously its not a typical combat fit  but since the tower is offline sacrificing survivability doesnt really make a difference since the op was talking about abandoned towers in his system i assumed theyd have a pos or three set up and they were living in wspace with that they should be able to manufacture the necessary ships inside sure its a right  to have your combat pilots mine for a bit and having to deal with  refining 75 yield tops with max skills and the implants alternatively you could run the ore out refine it at a 50 base station so you get 100 yield and bring the minerals in but then again you need a wormhole big enough to let an orca through  its too damn much work in iterons  even the small sites have something like 23 million m3 of rockso the only real logistical nightmare is getting the fittings inside assuming were not using t1 trash that one could build inside

station games are rather lame and make high sec war decs a joke war decs should be painful and hardcore like other lower security pvp the system needs to be made high sec war decs are crippling and demanding to both the aggressor and the aggressed both parties are automatically placed 75 km away from the station when an engagement occurs you will have to either burn 75km to the station or burn 75km away to warp to it assuming you are not pointed your choice neutral reppers will gain the same aggression as the target and will be automatically sent 75 km away from the station at the same spot of where the engagement occurs this means that neither party can use the station as a means of cover
this coming from an npcerfirst offthey are very painfulits called denial of freedom in high secfreedom to blow up ship and pod atwillsecondly post with your mainor please kindly go away because your solution is highly irrational and smells of ragetear fest of a bitter greifer and not the victim of a war decstation games can be solved by being clever when it comes to tacticsmake them come to youdont bother camping themyou want to beat them by campingfit for alpha strike and large numbers1 shot 1 killsimpleps station games are always a point of contentionthis i wont denybut your attitude doesnt reflect someone interested in dealing with it from both sides of the fenceonly the agressor side stop the evemail spam
bring more dps
problem you hate station gamessolution fight on gatescenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
what do you mean buy gtting moved to 75 km away like if i am sitting at the station at 0 and someone shooots me i teleport away from itit simply does not make sence
grief corp declares war on highsec corphighsec corp litterally cannot do anything about it wardecs are pretty much free sothe problem is griefer corps not the highsec corps war dec prices are should be increased by a factor of 5 at least
i see so fighting back in literally impossible for you pubbies
i love capital station gamesand they dont even need hisec or wardecs
as it stands now after sixteen missions you receive one storyline mission that storyline mission type is random and not based on the missions that were completed to receive it some players may be able to complete one type of missions but not anotherfor example a player that runs distribution missions may not be able to run security mission eg a industrialist flying a iteron mark v trying to complete a level iv security missioni propose that storyline missions are of the same type as the majority of missions completed to receive that storyline missionexamples16 security missions  1 security storyline mission16 distribution missions  1 distribution storyline mission10 distribution missions  6 mining missions  1 distribution storyline mission
as it stands right now you get missions from the nearest storyline agentso if youre running missions for distribution and get a security because well the security storyline agent is in that station  well you should have expected it
i fail to see what this has to do with making storyline mission types received relevant to the missions completed other than providing an example of how confusing the current mission system works
its really difficult to tank your sec status when you first start out hitting 001 isnt going to deny you access or more accurately free passage to any part of space its not a big deal its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
terrific as always
supporting thisyes im an amateur
will read this fully once christmas dinner is oer and done with hae a great one eerybody btw 1sm
brilliant absolutely brilliant  for god sake gie this person a job and make it happen 1  1000000000000000000000000
ye gods it must hae take you months to do this great suggestions i hope that ccp is listening if they are not then im up for some serious whipping1
i guess the question to ask is this someone running twenty thirtyplus planets how much work does this add to their already busy pi how will it affect pos fuel prices will smaller corps dependant on less insane fuel prices wind up haing their poss shut down because of the side effects of this what are the ripple effects how will it ultimately affect t2 production research eerything the little guy with a pos in high sec does for a liing
so 1 then
1 it should be the same or similar time inestment 2 the little guy will shut down his hisec pos and do it all on hisec cities on planets or he can keep his pos i dont care either way the costs of setting up indiidual networks with slots will be the same as a pos only drawback would be that the pos uses fuel where indiidual networks dont but the networks will cost isk to operate each month where the pos doesnt if on the other hand that network joins a city itl be ery much like a pos in terms of cost so itl depend on the player and what he prefers3 pos fuel prices should remain largely as they are now if not suffer a reduction in prices cities will consume pos fuels as well as make more of them ia bonuses to industrial networks spitting them out so there should be a bit of an equilibrium thing going4 there will be an increase in t2 production and moongoo in the medium to long terms so expect a decrease in prices associated with those items this will also open up inention and moongo items to the little guy and take the monopoly away from 00 alliances and coalitions who hoard up all the techmoons they can find5 more slots no more cues for slots  more research
they are tight but not short enough knee skirts blow wheres the hawtness
pvp without consequence i think its enough to loose your ship not having to worry about also loosing implants or if you are in a jc loosing training time time is money i have never been podded in hisec read my post again i said hisec is the only place i pvp in war decs because my pod is safe there if i get a jc i loose training time which is what this whole thread is all about having to jc and loose training time for a little pvp fun then there is a timer so you are stuck in your jc for 24 hours instead of just being able to jc back after the fight and good to know that you have 24 clones i really couldnt care less
i bought some 5s a week ago which arent exactly cheap why should everybody else get the same thing for free
i believe this was an idea brought up to benefit null playersnot hi sec wardec carebears according to your logic all implants should be removed cuz losing a ship is enoughwow yeah time is money and this is one of the many great things about eve online you have to make choices some choices may not benefit you in the way you like there are plenty of other mmos that offer your preferred style of gameplayif you are sweating your implants that much cuz u know you are gonna lose them then perhaps you should refrain from your little pvp funin any caseim done with ya you may return to killing retrievers in high secbeepblurpdurp
1 never really liked mining that much it would give good reason to mine in lowsec simply because of the rapid respawn rate of the sites itll make it so someone will need to have to scan down a new system on the roam if they want to gank the mining op 
now do this for five hundred battleships now do it for the same number on the opposing side now put out the fire that used to be a server line of sight targeting just isnt feasible
it is limited and it seems to be a relatively simple check there is an invisible line that extends from your ship to your target if this line intersects with another ships volume within the critical distance of your weapons your weapons do not fire it seems like this feature would be using data that is already tracked by the servers and the client i may be incorrect though
1000 los checks could be done in less than a millisecond the server already has to know where each ship is to display the same thing to multiple users
this is wholly foolish and full of fail1 1000 vs 1000 fights are stupidly insaneno one would get a shot off or disconn due to lag2 a reasonable solution is loss of los results in friendly fire or misfireyou get in the wayyou get your ass blown offalso results in serious issues see point 1 i do like thisit would be more realisticbut its problematic3 op has never been in a large scale fleet fightpoint 3 alone kills this proposalnot supporting stop the evemail spam
yeah they have got to fix this i just burned out my guns in a 1v3 fight
that is very true and should be addressed
yeah for a full home system case where the op is being conducted by a single corp no worries alliancelevel work is more interesting but thats due to pos borkedness whats newand holy cow thats one ganky talos you have there i was looking at 1100 with t2 guns  void  2 magstabs which gimps your tank enough as is you want some survivability in case you get pounced on with dropping down to a single magstab giving 900 or about the same numbers for a 3 gyro tornado with 800mm acs and faction fusion hail should give you a bit more but prob not enough to push you  1k dps oracle pulses and naga blasters too its a bummer the nagas a hybrid boat should put up similar numbers given that one can actually belly up to the tower in this casealso not everyone has the spare pos capacity to engage in shipbuilding ops ps c2 wormholes fit orcas its just that 500mil kg for inout is 14th to 16th of your mass limit right there
yep
1as for why the ships balance out when you stop i believe thats because the original physics engine for eve was based off of a submarine simulator or so ive been toldmmos come and go but eve remains garresh
the solution is longer docking time rule when somebody aggressing at station 1 minute now increasing to 15 minute same as the aggression timerthe neutral repping is an another story forbid docking too as a combatant
neutral reppers need to be nuked from orbit so do the station games then we can talk about wardeks being serious bisyness
this man said it all close the thread now
please dont remove station games then i wont be able to quickly grab easy loot from those at warthe only way to remove station games is either remove war decs  or add a stupid arbitrary mechanic as suggested in the op both are bad ideas imo
wardec is a joke independent of station gamesmake any sovholding entity autodecced shootable by anyone without concordken able to return fire once aggressed
everyone should be required to be in a player alliance or a corp aligned to an npc faction in order to access any meaningful isk sources and all those entities and players linked to them should automatically be at war with one another based on standings etcand yes station games are pretty lame that could use improvement but not another means of pvp avoidance while making lots of isk
those who wish to pvp must pay a monthly tax to concord for wreck removal and clean upoh wait im sorryyou said pvp avoidance is bad i figured you wantted to force people to play the game you wantted them too so its only fair rightfunny aint it stop the evemail spam
that doesnt make any sense ninja salvagers would do that for free didnt understand what youre trying to say with the rest of your post but im assuming it made even less sense
aparently you dont speak sracasticeselet alone bother to think before you posteve online is eve onlinenot pvp onlinenot pve onlinenot hello kitty onlineif you cant figure that outyou have no business making such foolish statmentsps still dont get it it was a jokederp derp concord taxing pvpers for wrecks left behind is a little obviousbut so was your statement about forcing players into wardecd npc corps is just as much as a stupid joke as mine stop the evemail spam
fix station gamesenable wardec reform
hmm and considering dust will not take effect in wormhole space how would things work there cities and all that dont really make sense in frontier space
cities will be setup as it is in empire low sec or 00but cities can only be wiped out by sub caps and capital ships in teh whs since dust wont work in whs and incursions dont happen there leaing it up to the ee players to do all the workindustrial networks can proide ice for wh towers from ice planets thus eliminating the need for wh players to bring stuff into the wh they would still hae to go sell their lewt in empire or they can use the cities to turn their wh into a new drone region where they recycle and use eerything they could een start constructing super caps in whscities would allow wh alliances to entrench themseles een more in a wh making for more good fights in order to sere eiction noticesso it makes perfect sense
i fully endorse this proposal 100000
ccp needs to contact asuka solo about becoming part of the de team this is the most impressie proposal i beliee ie eer seen
i find myself intrigued one last thought for nowthe transition to getting something like this set up from current would be expected to take how long and at what expense people that rely on pi for their own pos fuel would there be a significant period of fime of clenched bowels trying to get things running again before the pos goes belly upif the answer is to stock up prior youre creating an artificial spike in prices as people take adantage of the transitionnote not being critical at all just trying to think of sideeffects that may not be thought of initially
looking good one nitpick trail accounts in reference to spi banking not only a typo but also a bad idea i would suggest that it makes abundant sense to simply make loaned money one of many features that trial accounts are simply not eligible to engage in
a single network from 500 settlers to 1000 should take you about a week or two at an aerage growth rate of 21 it should reach its capacity limit the amount of acancies from all your buildings within 1  2 months then it starts generating homeless and you need to put them to use or get rid of them which costs you iskso if that single network was part of a city with ice mines you wouldnt hae to export homeless feed them into buildings that consume them and sae you the isk cost automatically depending on the amount of ciilian networks proiding settlers to the city mechanism your looking at about 24 months before a city would hit its capacity that or you can train ship crewssetting up single networksof the ciilian industrial or military network types should set you back around less than 8 mil with a 13 mil operation expense per monthsocial establishment networks will set you back many hundreds of millions more expensie operational costs per montha city i was thinking should be in the 1 bil isk to register area with monthly maintenance costsbills payable or else 12 blocks of fuel per day plus any costs to sustain the population and building serices outside of thatwill there be a stockpiling of pos fuels maybe will the prices spike maybethere will always be people looking to exploit the market made by new shipstechnologiesgame play styles
i have to agree i was hoping for much shorter skirts than what we have
i think i would like this idea more if you had one giant belt that went around the entire planet or solar system but you had to scan to find the 2 or 3 roids that you could actually mine in that belt it would be impossible to just warp to the belt and then just travel around it because it would simply take too long you could also use this as an excuse to add in new probes mining probes and maybe even a new skill for it
it cost about 700isk total which for any eveplayer amounts to being free
navy baddon oo me want
personally i feel that any new class of ship released should immediately be released with its faction variants i would love a navy oracle on the other hand i can see the reason for not doing so in that they are trying to balance the game right nowintroducing a new tier of battlecruiser was already enough of a risk to the balance of pvp ccp needs to wait and see what happens with the new bcs and make fine tuned adjustments where needed before introducing more ships to throw things off balance again
hello there
ok some season greetings from germany ccp what are u thinking what you doing  eve is a good game  no discussion but i wrote several informations to you about incarna or walking in station what ever it will be named in the future i know  incarna is the technology to solve your future problems but have u realized the giant amount of coding doing a unique station environment having the capability to get housed like corpoffices bars etc was to much and not deeply thoughted by youthat was your fault to declaring that incarna and for what this stands is laying now on ice  isnt a solutioni beg to get recognized i  and i hope other players do not want to let incarna die we need a plan to solve this problems we need to focus to communicate with the players no matter if a response come from a csmmember a gm or from hilmar on his own  we need communication here give us a plan  a roadmap  where we can see how it looks like with incarna but do not talk nothing silence is no gold in that casei want a open space experience  and i do not want a station environment like in star trek this crappy station  is not bigger than the iss station i mean  realize  like jita there is a station where hundreds of freighters are docked in can u realize the dimensions of this  the stations must be so big that it needs hours to get from one place to the others this is a new mmo what you have to program i cant understand why are u are not realizing this big amount of coding workif u solve this problem thanks for your designers giving us the captain quarters  in the future i will kiss you  and this is the reason why i am paying for this game  every month because i believe  you can solve this and doing a milestone in programming a whole simulationbut anyhow get started tell us what happen tell us what you are planning and goddamn if you have problems to solve this in one part  try smaller steps captain quarters was a small step i am a coder sorry only flash applications i know it needs time i do not want a solution from your side wich is halfhearted  i want a system an environment wich allows to do a scalable future orientaded solution for solving the incarna problemif you say you have the solution then tell us that we have to wait until the levels have to be designed keep us informedgreetings
this is tongue in cheek and no ccp never said this outrightin seriousness though ccp just went through probably the worst year since tq has gone live all of you who are screaming for them to go back to wis have to realise that the rest of us have been here waiting for ccp to get back to fixing things in fis soundwaves blog was joking about the 18 months meme that ccp created when they told us that wed get three expansions of nothing for fis because of their plans for awesomeright now today and at least until after the 2012 summer expansion ie the next six months ccp really has to focus on fis  they dont have a choice because most of the playerbase is watching what they do
agreed in space when you stop you stop no matter what direction you were facing the auto levelling to the galactic plane has always irritated me simply because there is no reason for it
we can whine but this all comes to submarine engine eves usesi fully agree that even though it does not matter what side you are facing in full stop apart from sb bomb launcher it is more immersive to keep original direction while stopedhowever it could cause little more net traffic right now it is possible that there is no traffic for stationary targets but it can be totally opposite and it can be similar to moving target just values being zeroread and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
the obvious solution is if you dont like station games then dont play themid suggest you go find someone that is willing to shoot back but i suspect that isnt really what youre looking for
what would that accomplish nothing giving enemy a fight is what they wantand pubbie person plays game for funno pubbieperson plays game specifically to target weaker players  pubbie detected cant get touched in real life so needs the epeen to be loved
no i was actually serious about that
epic facepalm stop the evemailUFFFDspam
if at war the timer for redocking after just undocking should be increased by a factor of 10 also the aggresed corpalliance could also grow a pair and organise and actually fight back remember kids inter corp communication is a good thing
this thread ended with the second post now drake is in here having to ward off all the crap ideas with a stick
its amusing though popcorn
just transfering aggression timers so that neutral logi cant dock will stop a lot of the stupidity that comes with highsec station gamesthe rest meh we get plenty of kills on stations usually without the use of rr i think weve fielded a lone rr alt four times in all the engagements ive been in its all about getting your opponent to engage and then bringing overwhelming force on them before they realize their mistake and get back in the station
station games  lame but working as intended 
please and thank you
easy fix removing station campers automatically removes station games
because of my work offshore i am away from home 12 of the year which leaves me with the same amount of untrained sp what i would love to see is a skillmanager via browser or sometging like evemon so us working abroad can at least train their skills i have tried other programs such as splashtop but it requirs too much bandwithmany naysayers will say that it would make it easier for toonsellers to train their toons but wtf its allready easy as hell
yeahi cant help but agree with this frankly the only reason i can see as to why ccp hasnt allowed it through eve gate is security and to give players a reason to log in and play once in a while i dont think it matters either way anymoreif i want to log in and play i log in and play if i need to change skills i log in change skills and log out simple as that i spend more time on the forums at work than i do in eve at home to be honest with you stillmy biggest concern on this would be security it would be one more door for hackers to use to obtain your account the new api system should fix that problemhoweveri would rather wait until they actually release the key fobs as extra security perhaps even make it so you can only change your skills via the website evemon or aura if you have the key fob for added security
personally i think issuing a demand to ccp isnt the best way to go about proposing your ideaim not saying im against the proposal  just that issuing demands will likely not get you what you want they may have mentioned something about this in one of the more recent devblogs as part of the make gate better push for the dust rollout
you open that doorthe botting business and rmt would get out of handyou can demand all you wantyou will go nowhere stop the evemailUFFFDspam
as it stands storyline agents give out missions that have little or nothing to do with the progressive story of eve and are useualy just the exact same missions over and over and over again the existing missions need to be compleatly scrapped and replaced with new ones and some system to prevent the exact same mission distributed sevral times in a row especuly that dam materials for war preperation one which doesnt really make sense as the war has already started like a year ago

gie that man a bells1 internets
the homeless thing i dont like that too much extra to worry about when all i want is to make fuels now if they can be conerted into biomass or something a billion isk for a city people are running 20 planets thats insane as nicely thought out as the idea is its really too much of a pain in the ass imo pi is already a bit of a chore but not so much that its not worth doing id fear something this elaborate blowing up to the point where you log in and spend hours dealing with all this stuff only to find you neer had time to undock before bed this is almost worthy of a game itself not a side actiity
so go make pos fuels with your 20 separate industrial networks only nobody is going to stop you or change the way you do it make it more difficult or more time consuming unless some bigger alliance doesnt care for you doing this in their backyard out in 00enjoy clearing them one at a time for the rest of days as wellid rather do them all et mass by combining everything into 1  6 cities but thats just lazy old me
if the existing remains the same or at least the level of work for the end results that would be one thing but would ccp really have a one way or the other thing even when they try that with the pcos they screw up the taxes so badly that the original isnt really a viable option

this is just the kind of thing that eve is missing this extremely in depth addition to the game this is awesome took me about 2 hours to read this thing very slow readerbut i love this idea and support it 100
please come plexing for the minmatar i think it will take some time for people to sort out the fits but other than the slicers and hookbill i dont see anything that will be able to stand up to destroyers there are reasons why those 2 ships are not as good as destroyers including their price but that is fine i am willing to wait until the majority of the ships doing plexes are destroyers in the past i would say only about 25 of the plexing ships were one of the 4 pirate ships yet people thought that was a problem now i bet over 50 of the ships in minors will be 1 of the 4 destroyers at least if they have any intention of staying for a fight instead of warping off as soon as an enemy comesi think that will be the inevitable result once people figure out the fits if i am right then this made the diversity of ships in minor plexes much much worse regardless of this issue though what about the op proposal is hide and seek plexing still a problem wouldnt we get more fights if the players knew where the plexes are being takenmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
well i dont want to have a big sign saying were plexing in akidagi right now i want them to take a look at the occupancy map and see that theres a big ass blob over the system and say to themselves self i think theres bad guys plexing in akidagi i think i should scout ittake a fleet in and see what we can doits still pretty easy heck if the caldari want good fights then they should just come and plex over near nenna open plexes sit in plexes cap plexes soon enough itll get noticed by us and wel come a fightin a few of us have been known to come into a plex with even numbers or down 1 we just want fights same as them
well if you are openly attacking their military complexes isnt it odd that they are not notified of thisits actually pretty easy to plex without pvp ank proved this she capped over a hundred plexes in less than a week and never did any pvp i agree for the most part both sides want gfs the problem is finding them when i plex i would say there is less than a 5 chance a war target will enter the plex i entered i dont think that is really that great for pvp in fact i think that sucks giving the militia a notification would solve this make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i guess where you go from our disagreements is what kind of notification system do you want something in militia chat something in your notifications that i largely ignore because of pvp notification lag im guessing what you want is something thats nonintrusive that gives an up to the 1015 minute update of current systems being plexedi also wonder if all of this is a moot point because of the last csm and the fact that they discussed fw during it
it may be moot but anyway what i was thinking is a seperate channel that would only give notifications of complexes that have been entered no players would be able to type in the intel channel otherwise it would look just like any other channel it would just generate messages like cearain merlin entered minor auga the timestamp could be enabled so you would know when i entered actually there would be one chat channel for the gallente caldari front and a different one for the minmatar amarr front i would have access to both but i would probably only look at the for the front i am currently fighting atthe intel would be immediated that way a pilot nearby would have enough time to jump there and possibly save the plex it would take balancing but the idea would be to keep the fighting fast paced and dynamic the militias would have to assign different pilots to several different sections of the front so if the minmatar saw the message cearain merlin entered minor auga someone might report in their intel channel that they are going in that minor with a destroyer if 5 people from the minmatar said they were going in with destroyers someone might reassign some of them to another system that would need defending instead of doing overkill in that one that way they would be using all their pilots as effectively as possibleif one side had larger numbers then the other side may have to abandon certain areas but they could still regroup and try to be competitve in others that is the goal i would be going for there would need to be allot of tweaking but this proposal would be the first step make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
learning implants reward good players people in this thread complain about learning implants because they got podded and are mad about itmy opinion deal with itgif
cant agree with this the ones who wishes to spend the extra isk and take the risk of getting implants should definately train skills faster
just bumping this idea because i believe it would satisfy both sides of this debate
were all very sorry that your too scared to leave highsec but that is not a reason to eliminate a part of the game your lack of courage is not our problem this is probably the worst argument to support this proposal that i have seen posted here
the underlying problem with implants in this game is pod killingsaving mechanics are stupid in empire killingsaving a pod is a matter of how good your internet connection is in null secwh its just a matter of whether there is a bubble or not in either case there is no real game play or skill involved in savingkilling a pod yet allot hangs in the balance this proposal has some merit because it makes it so there cant be as much hanging in the balance of this terrible mechanica better solution would be for ccp to make pod killingsaving mechanics bettermake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve

i feel safe saying that no one in this game has been in a large fleet battle this being a game and allif tranquility can handle it why not do an los checkpilots could have a simple switch for how their ships handle the check either hold fire until the designated target is clear or be a bozo and shoot a member of your own fleet be a lot more interesting than being one to two button wonders and would certainly require more discipline than a lolblobfield of trolls if you chum it they will come

it is not relevant but i have been in large fleet battles i have been in probably the largest fleet battle eve has seen the really amusing part is that i was once part of fcon p more importantly we are rapidly approaching the activation of the time dilation feature i dont want to get my hopes too high but i am carefully optimistic that this will make large fleet fights far more enjoyable i really hate waiting 15 minutes or more for modules to cycle off while having no clue if they ever actually fired the addition of los as well as fleet formations would add much needed strategy to fleet engagements and before you say it no i do not have any illusions that los and fleet formations alone will radically change the battle field in eve however it could be a starting point for more robust changesnullbeard rager i currently lean towards a simple fail safe mode that denies you the ability to fire it would seem to make sense that the manufacturers of your ships would not want fleet mates blasting each other apart accidentally however the option to either follow the built in fail safe or disregard it does open up opportunities for some serious lols hmmm i am torn

recently a new player i was teaching to play the game fell victim to the margin trading scam this has somewhat dampened his enthusiasm for the game and as he was trading to save up for plex even if he does want to keep playing he might not be able to now i realise this is not considered an exploit by ccp who seem happy to see off potential customers in this fashion so there is nothing to be done through petitions i thought however that it might be entertaining to approach the problem incharacter within the eve worldthe eve market has a broker trading system administered by the secure commerce commission this is to ensure fair trading and i always recommend new players to exclusively use the market for trading because of thisgiven the nature of this particular scam i feel that the scc is at fault for any losses incurred specifically under false advertising statutes the scc on behalf of a capsuleer is offering to pay x isk for x units of some commodityitem the scc in these cases never has any intention of buying these items at this price they have access to the capsuleers wallet and can check any time whether the player can afford the items capsuleers are told to use common sense to avoid this type of scam but calling an intimate knowledge of the high level trade skill mechanics common sense for a new player is a stretch in addition the same argument could be used to say that the scc could be using their common sense they actually have access not only to the persons current wallet amount but also their history of prior activity and it should be a simple matter for them to use their common sense in rejecting this kind of false buy order i have been playing the game for years and never used margin trading so i didnt know about the mechanic myself or i could have warned my studentsi wanted to post a message to the scc to invite them to out of court negotiations pending my lawsuit but i can find no way of contacting them i thought perhaps as a constituent the csm might be able to offer representation or at least put me in contact with the scc i think it would be unwise of the scc to ignore this as a ruling in my favour could open the floodgates to thousands of similar lawsuits and cost the organisation trillions the point of broker trading is that the broker guarantees the transaction we pay significant costs for this service and on previous occasions where i have made mistakes in terms of typing in too many or too few zeros or similar issues the scc has always been happy enough to take my money even on occasions where i have immediately rectified the situation in cases like this where the scc made the mistake of offering to buy a commodity they never intended to pay for they should take the hit themselves and sort it out with the offending trader any way they can trust is crucial to the sccs operations and this is a major breach

we are not screaming for anything we just want some info is that so hard to understandi have said this so many times i like what they did with crubicle and want them to continue that wayccp stated themselves that crubicle was done in six weeks plus some needed bug fixes afterwardsthey can do a lot more in 6 months and still give the wispart a small crewbut dust beta is coming so eve development is on ice anyway fis or wis
its been said by ccp that wis and wod is pretty much running a skeleton crew for the forseeable future and is essentially on ice for the next expansion cycle or two yet people are continuing to ask for updates or information about wisincarna news article about the layoffs and restructuring 
they talk and talk about fis which is fine we agree that needs attention and probably the focus for at least one expansion but those who want wis dont want it to become the next damn abandoned feature that nobody is gonna look a for years we dont want to log in to see the damn lonely hearts cq band wondering what ifand guess what so far nobody is looking at it thats the first step in becoming the abandoned elephant in the room and with the background we have its udnerstandable that we want some atention and some pr fluff specially for usignoring a thread thats been going on for 2 motnhs and has reached 80 pages is not going to fix anything rather will put ccp in trouble sooner or later we care about our players and listen to them does not mix well with we flip the bird to a whole bunch of our players for no good reason
so ccp dont care tell me something new
removing local chat and afk cloaking  two subjects that have been done to death lets waste some time discussing a combined solution that ccp will never implementa enforce constellational chat as local is now all players online in a constellation show inside this channel but there is no indication of which system they are in players also show in local as they do now with one exceptionb any player with an active cloaking device is removed from local they cannot be seen there and in turn cannot see anyone else there themselvesshould the player be decloaked they return to the local channel as normalc introduce at least one method for identifying or forcibly decloaking any cloaked ships im keeping this intentionally vague as it will be a key balance issue but possible methods include repurpose supercarrier ecm burst into anticloak pulse add a similar module for other ships  such as the rorqual  to encourage it to be ongrid during mining ops starbase modules that can be manually controlled to emit an anticloak pulse within a given range could require sov upgrade to use new scan probes that will confirm the existence of a cloaked ship within a relatively small area without giving away the exact location the idea behind all this is that its still entirely possible to rack up the sneaky kills with clever use of your cloaking device but a savvy player will still have various options to use before making themself vulnerable some of the suggestions at the end are deliberately intended to play on the riskreward aspect of eve  such as putting out capital ships to reduce the risk to smaller ones while still facing risk themselves

t3s are currently the closest thing to a subcapital pwnmobile they excel in many areas and have too few weaknesses to stay true to eves rock paper scissors concept and although with their modularity they are supposed to be jacks of all trades and thus master of none they overshadow various specialized t2 ship classeswhat i propose to fix this is not a dramatic nerf but a mild adjustment which is far from killing the usefulness of the ship class reduce the number of rig slots to 2 in keeping with the t1t2 tradition it should even be only 1 but lets leave it at 2 for now dropping a rig slot has basically two effects one is losing a bit of flexibility of which the t3s still have plenty through the subsystems the second is reducing a bit of whichever characteristic people were maxing before buffer cap dps etc reduce the bonus to effectiveness of gang links of the warfare processor subsystem from 5 to 3 to bring it in line with fleet command ships a maxed and mindlinked t3 can give some pretty insane bonuses more so than field cs which are supposed to be top dog here increase subsystem skill rank from 1 to 2 at least even considering the possibility of skill loss upon death the training time for such a powerful ship class is a joke im not a fan of the skill loss mechanic but if it is to be kept im in favor if increasing the risk inherent in flying t3sid like to include other things like a maybe a 10 reduction of ehp across the board but unlike ccp im in favor smaller tweaks at a time one would have to see how these changes play out in the wild theres probably other small tweaks that could be included in this list now please commentim aware this proposal is controversial because obviously no one wants their shiny toys nerfed but lets do it for balance i am also aware that some t3s are underperforming especially the legion although this is a nerf proposal to the ship class i am not opposed to giving some love to specific t3 ships or aspects
except for their boosting abilities tech 3s are more or less fine with the exception of the tengu
im not sure how the legion can be classed as under performing unless you compare it to the tenguthe tengu is overpowered want proof simply head out to any mission hub where are the cnrs golems machariels paladins it feels like half of the populace are flying tengus these days i say feels like because im making the claim without sitting down and performing a surveythe nerf the tengu needs is not hp or rig slots its simply a nerf to the combined bonuses of extra kinetic damage extra rate of fire and extra range no other missile boat in the game gets all three bonuses together a tengu pilot should have choices to make perhaps the fifth offensive subsystem can be a long rangedamage bonus subsystem while the current one gets diminished to the rate of firekin damage bonusesas for warfare link processors the contest between command ships and strategic cruisers could easily be evened out if fleet boosting had to be done ongrid no need to nerf the 5 t3 bonus since you wont be able to fit more than two warfare links if you want to have any kind of tank more warfare links means more command processors and more cpu mods which means fewer mid or low slots for tankall this is only my opinion of course but i actively abuse a 6link offgrid booster tengu while flying a hml mission tengu i would fly a cnr if the tengu wasnt just so damned good
i feel the same the tengu is displacing many of the dedicated mission shipsi am not opposed to this tengu nerfthat is another proposal i already supportedpeople work around that limitation by using the fleet hierarchy and more than one t3 and i definitely think the actual t3 bonus amount needs a nerf not to mention a lot of people question the whole concept of a singlefew ships giving 250 ships bonuseswell thank you for still agreeing it needs a nerf
who gives a  about pve balance thats like saying that cruise missiles are overpowered because cnrs are the most common faction bs in mission hubs thats not a comment on how balanced the ships are its a comment on how bad eves pve istrying to balance ships around the braindead npcs we have instead of trying to balance the npcs against the way ships actually work in pvp is the fundamental error here
mara brought up pve my initial post was focused on pvp
and thats full of  as wellmalcanis is rightand even thenthis proposal is full of you really dont strike me as someone who knows pvp when it comes to tech 3 ships i am getting a vibe your butt hurt in getting owned by onetry burning through several tech 3 ships in pvp engagements and then come back here and tell me otherwisenot supporting stop the evemail spam
a major gripe among those who live in 00 is the sov system how it is bad x y and z while i do not have any ideas for a complete overhaul and i am aware of the wariness expressed by csm members about wading into this morass i have an idea i wish others to see and criticizethe source of greatest frustration to myself and others i know is the reinforcement timer mechanics it is my desire to remove either the attacker or the defender from deciding the length of a timer rather the limited randomization of such a timer seems to me a fine solution to the issue of crosstimezone sov warfarewhat does this mean the basic premise of the reinforcement of a structure is fantastic the allowance for a day or so to organize the defense of a structure is critical to game mechanics what is not critical in my opinion is the determination of when exactly the structure will exit reinforcement indeed i believe this component to stifle pvp in 00 the limited randomization should be something like this putting in x amount of strontium clathrates into a towerstructure allows for a reinforcement timer to activate of at least for example 36 hrs with a random component of  12 hours the implementation of such a system would allow for a corporationalliance from 1 timezone to assail a corporationalliance from a different tz the variability should allow for timers to occur in a more interesting manner to the attacker and hopefully would make for more largescale fightsin my opinion giving the defender the dictation of the time of the fight assuming minimal brain function and 1 person online with access to the pos makes for boring wars while there are methods to get around this such as kiting a tower once below 50 health or attacking during the holidays when players have more flexibility in their playstyles i feel that a less demanding solution is this small randomization defenders can be still reasonably certain that they will have a defensive timer in a workable timezone for themselves if the first timer is miserable they still have 2 more tries and if that fails they still have many more systems to go and can go on the offensive themselves under my model if a faction reinforced 10 structures they could be reasonably certain that at least 1 would exit reinforcement in their preferred timezone and there would be several others that would be in timezones that are in timezones both sides could fight overtldr limited randomization of reinforcement timers would make the game more fun and would make crosstz sov warfare less painful for the attacker i am growing weary of staying up to 2 am or waking up at 4 am to participate in a fleet fight randomization would allow pilots a chance at a fleet fight instead of none without taking extreme measures such as altering ones sleep schedule i think all of 00 would appreciate this change
there is no up or down in space but a galaxy can have an up and down side maybe some guys and girls just decided that one way was up and subsequently all stations were built around the idea that one side was up and the other was down the ships that were built followed this concept and even adapted to levelling to this imaginary planar a sense of up and down makes things feel a little bit more natural for humanoids

while youre right that there are ways around this problem i agree with the op that its counterintuitive that a stopped ship realigns instead of simply stopping
i believe the costs to war dec is really cheap i propose that there should be a bidding war between the aggressor and the victim in determining war dec coststhis will allow industrial corps to easily fend of lone corps since they will most likely have more money heres how it will workwar deccing corps will start off with 2 million with 2 million increments in biddingwar deccing alliances will start off with 50 million with 50 million incrementseach bid will prolong the auction until 24 hours pass after the last bid this will also serve as an isk sink to help balance the isk faucets within the game
heh
something like this would be a nice addition when wardecs are reworked but adding it to the current system wont do that much good your idea needs more work regardless how do you ensure one participant cant delay the war indefinitely by waiting to the last minute to outbid the other the 24h extension after each bid is simply too long it would be better to have a set duration for the auction with small extensions after each bid if there was less then the extension time left on the timer basily a wardec contract auction after a winner is determined hostilities start after a 24hours or you get a decshield against the aggressor for a set period of timethe bigger issue is what happens when a side wins the auction currently you can easily shed a wardec or just leave the corp and the deccer can use alt corps to force reauctions and transfer to one when it wins an auction so the system in many cases doesnt really offer satisfaction to the winner of the auction because of the various loopholes in the current mechanic i think an auction system would still be an improvement but the wardec system needs a complete overhaul not just little tweaks
your sheer ignorance of the situation is staggeringyou assume industrialist corporations have more isk than the attackerif you think thatyou have a lot to learnmore so than you realizeand that is just one of many problems in your proposalmaking them more expensive is a good thingbut its a temporary fix at bestbut not based on your very very poor assumption stop the evemailUFFFDspam
no because this would significantly add to the time to start up a war and allow the targeted corpalliance more time to move assets drop in and out of corps and generally engage in behavior that used to be considered exploits also any restrictions placed on atwar corps would have to be extended to this time frame as well this would just make wardecs even worseedit also theres the obvious problem of what happens when i wardec you you buy your way out of it and then i wardec you again all it would take is for a number of people to make their own corps wardec yours one at a time until you run out of isk with which to defend yourself then they all join whichever corp won the bidding war and youre right back where you started only youre out quite a lot of isk
a new form of greifing is bornisk extortationtoo bad its all lining the pockets of concordyour assumption of attackers being poor is a very stupid onelike i saidignorancemust be blissful stop the evemailUFFFDspam
why not just make war deccing a corp 100 million and an alliance to be 500 million to 1 billion this auction thing will be endless as every bid increases the time to 24 hours

supportthis has for my admittedly short playing career been something that has annoyed me greatly i dont know if its only the ship animation that returns to the plane and the server keeps a vector in the right direction regardless of whether this change would be functional or purely cosmetic it needs to happen my one suggestion is that they either put this as one of those check off option boxes in the menu or they add a command to level to orbital plane because i can see the usefulness of having the common reference point for certain applications
i was doing some gallente missions the other day and generally the serps like to sensor damp you this is annoying but i decided i would counter their damps by tweaking my fit to add a sensor booster when i do their missions as i was doing this i wanted to monitor the amount of damping they were doing to me in real time so i turn on my fitting screen and pushed it all the way to the left so i could see my effective targeting range change as i came under various levels of sensor dampsat that point it occurred to me that the little window on the far right of your fitting screen that shows you your ehp would make a perfect stats screen if only you could cut off the rest of it it would be awesome to have during pvpi would like to see a button on the fitting window to minimize it or hide the ship fitting part and just show your ehp defense offense and targeting statistics then you could move it around as an fully docking information window that you could choose to use during combat to monitor the status of your ship duringthis would take a minimal of coding resources and i think this would fit in the direction that the eve ui seems to be going ie more compact information being offered in an easy to read format the better information is presented the better everyone flies and the more fun to be had for allits a simple proposal but requires little effort and has the potential to enhance combat any thoughts on this
forum ate my proposal twice good thing i copied it the second timeforum ate my proposalto reiteratei was reading the hybrid rebalance notes and comments in the information portal earlier and thought of this as an additional solution for galentehybrid balancing that doesnt affect other factions or indirectly create exploitable bonuses on gallente shipsthe idea is just a basic modification which would be applied to all gallente ships to one degree or another and assist them in fitting armor tanks while maintaining the roleusage amongst the different factions worst case scenario wih rebalancing is that all ships of a similar roleclassification become indistinguishable from each other in all but outward appearance this avoids that and helps to actually increase the individuality of the various factions ships in all classes and rolesessentially the idea is to reduce the incurred velocity and agility penalties applied by fitting armor tanks to gallente ships by a percentage reduction of effective mass addition based on the typical roleusage each ship rail platforms and ships dedicated to long range electronic warfare or drones for example would see less benefit than those dedicated to blasters tackling or the likeexample would be a 20 reduction in effective mass addition for velocity and 15 reduction in effective mass addition for agilty resulting from the fitting of armored plates on a brutix for a buffer tank alternatively it could be a flat reduction of 20 to effective mass with regards to the penalties applied to both to keep things simple and minimize claculationsits not that the ship ways any less its just that the ship is less affected by its weightzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub

i fully support this idea especially the automated npcfleets moving your stuff from the planets
thats way more than knowing where the fighting is occurring i would almost keep the intel open ended and let the militia coordinate on their ownlike if a militia had a channel specifically for plexing i think ccp is trying to stay away from npcs as much as possible and get that kinda stuff into the hands of the players i dont think theres ever been someones job to just check all contested systems and see if theres someone currently plexing there if there was to be an npc plex reporting channel then id also have less intel in that it maybe just letting you have a real time list of whats contested or where theres plexes that are currently being run with updates around 1015 minutes from an rp standpoint you could say that the intelcomm routers in low sec are old and in disrepair so that they dont give exact intel im still not sure if i would want npc updates though maybe if fw gets some sort of sov system where we can install upgraded comm relays then sure otherwise i dunno
im still against any form of automated system that gives automatic intel with no work updating the map would be a good way to go about this perhaps have the systems that are contested blink or change color if they had a plex taken within the last hour but beyond that everything should be in the hands of the players
if you dont want to lose you 5 set in pvp dont pvp in them ccp gave you the option to have more than one clone so you can have more than one set of implants or none at all once again this is something introduced by an old player for the benefit of new players i call shenanigans eve is a game of choices and consequences if you click the use jump clone button you better mean it because you are told in advance that there is a 24hr timer on using it again if this means that you happen to be in your 5 clone when delve gets attacked by whoever the fk is out there now and you dont want to risk losing your training clone then tough  go tomorrow i have had a 5 set since i could afford them and that has never stopped me from roaming with my friends whenever i damn well please and i live primarily in wh systems im smart about it and stay in a group i do everything i can to make sure i come out of the fight pod intact but if i lose it oh well time to start saving again if new players cant afford uber implants then the game mechanics must be working because uber implants are designed to be expensive new players unless they sell plex wont have that kind of isk for a while in my opinion uber implants are intended to be a reward for the older players who have stuck it out and have earned some accelerated training times or better ship statsif i missed the point of the thread please let me know so i can amend my post its 3am and im very tired
i would also like to point out that your training time as a new player is much different than when your an older player as a new player you primary train skills that are between the 1x to 5x training times older players are in a far different situation we have to train skills in the 8x to 14x range newer players dont need the 5 learning implants as much as older players do if they have to train in 3 implants for a while it really isnt a big deal they dont have to sit through 52 day skills when they want something to level 5 i can understand helping out the new players a bit though in truth i dont believe eliminating implants is going to help them yes theyll train faster but i doubt there will be any more motivation to pvp because of it what i have really noticed in this game is that in most cases the ones who want to pvp do the ones who dont wont no amount of elimination toward those expenses short of making pvp risk free will persuade them otherwise and that is something we cannot do
you got it backwards new players need the faster training time because they cant do anything well veterans on the other hand are in no rush  they can already fly a ship for every occasion and then some and have what they need to secure an income
the average train time on a new players skill is like a day you wanna give them natural 5s to drop it by an hour or so per skill not worth it the way its set up works fine you learn the game as you train and by the time you can fly the bigger and better ships you are more skilled w skill points and your personal ability to fly throw a noob into a 60 mil sp toon just means hes going to be losing tech 3s instead of frigates

i would request that you provide specific detailed arguments against the proposal at hand what you have done is attack me who i am is irrelevant the weakness of argument lies with you not ii shall attempt to distill your argument for you it seems to revolve around server load andor player response time under lag conditions i would agree that these are potential killers of the idea if it were to be determined that they were severe enough i do not believe that you or i have the technical expertise to make that call however and i would leave this determination up to ccp developers this mechanic might help with the server lag problem assuming that the check itself does not negate the gains by creating a scaling logistical cost to your fleet as it increases with size as a fleet increases with size the formation required to ensure that all fleet members have an unobstructed los to their targets would increase in volume and complexity a slightly smaller fleet might be more desirablethe ability to warp and maintain formation would make remaining in formation much less stress inducing but you would still have to travel to the way points for the initial formation i have even toyed with the idea of allowing the fc to automatically warp the fleet into a new formation with the added mechanic that if the intervening distance was not long enough members of the fleet would not arrive in formation they would have to travel the remaining distance to their broadcast way points on their own resulting in a potential loss of dps
it also would distract people from their blobs to actually have to keep track of line of sight and positioning in microcosm and most people who are out to massacre other people are mostly looking for minimal risk and effort despite all the complaints about how boring blob combat can beagreed good idea in theory but perhaps not in practice
that isnt really relevant the problem is that the computer doesnt magically see the loss just because it has the location info currently the server propably only needs to know is the locked target is in rangecan your shot reach that targetdo you hit it all other info is pretty static so it doesnt need to be recalculated constantly with los you need to calculate the flight path of every shot and compare it against all other objects in range to see if any of them cross that line youve turned it from check against the selected target when the gun is activated to calculate line of fire and compare it against all other objects in range when the gun is activated its a totally different scale of calculations compared to what we have now in a fleet fight its not going to be just 1000 extra checks its going to be thousands of checks per ship or gun if they are ungrouped los only works in games where the number of players are low its the reason large scale combat in the scale that eve currently offers it is impossible in all multiplayer games that have losits also a can of worms because of the aggression rules depending on the exact choice its either a huge cause of accidental concordokkens or free ganking and can offer the possiblity to use neutrals to block ship guns if the guns will simply refuse to fire it raises problems with missiles too are you going to have the server calculate free flight paths for every missile or stop them from launching just because the direct line of fire is blocked at the time of the launch missiles are also entities so are you going to be checking the los against them toopoint being its going to make current scale fleet fights totally impossible and cause several issues with the mechanics no matter how its implemented maybe it could work if it only calculated huge structures or asteroids instead of ships but los calculations on the scale you imagine would ruin the current game and the benefits just arent worth it imo
if anybody actually reads the ops post and takes into consideration all that is proposed and if they have a brain they would realize that it would actually work and probably quite well at that what he is proposing is a mechanic that would not only bring in more of a tactical feel to the game but utterly change the way pvp is played today formations would allow fleet commanders to adjust the fleet accordingly to allow the maximum number of ships to be able to hit targets without getting in the way of each other as the opposing fcs counter adjust their formation to protect one ship or fire on another the other fc would have to do the same it would also start making people think about where they are going and where they are right then and there do i keep moving forward to get a better angle on that ship or do i move in to protect my buddy who is about to diethis would also likely break up the blob mechanic of current fleets as nobody would want to be in large fleets with a less likely chance of being able to hit anything they might break up into smaller multiple fleets part of the same operation flanking would then have a purpose for example sniper fleets might become useful again
no one should be making these proopsals until they have actaully legitimately participated in a large scale battleuntil such time that has passeddont expect anyone to support thisexcept those with garnd delusions of self proclaimed experince whom live in high sec or hide behind npc alts stop the evemail spam
againnever said that it wouldnt be utterly fun or hillariousits irrational in the current system and how eve online functions in the context of very not large or itty bitty large scale fleet fightsthe whole reason behind time dialation is the primary reason for this being horriblethe server cannnot handle itits slowing down time ingame to catch up to the clients requesting copious update requestsif the op had bothered to read the freaking devblogs you might actually learn somethinglos is great in a funny friendly fire scenariobut this is not reallitythis is not terran field spaceits spaceand theres alot of it stop the evemailUFFFDspam
currently the server propably only needs to know is the locked target is in rangecan your shot reach that targetdo you hit it you do not really know though and neither do i a line between you and your target already exists you can see it by turning on your tactical overview i do not know if my experience represents the norm but i have experienced no noticeable lag when toggling the tactical overview on either this line is already present and not shown or it takes a miniscule amount of power to generatei imagined a single line extending from the center mass of your ship this sacrificed the realism of having individual los for every gun but i did it for the server blades the poor poor server blades that might implode under the stress missiles would also sacrifice realism for function missile ships would use the same mechanic for calculating los as turret ships i toyed with the idea of allowing missiles the ability to travel around large static objects like poss but the amount of math required for this would seem to be substantial i also feared making cruise missile ravens op so in short there would be a single line from your ship to your targetits also a can of worms because of the aggression rules this is the only serious problem that i have seen so far in this thread and it is very serious i apologize i am used to fighting in low sec wormhole space and null sec i have not fired a shot in anger in a while due to being disappointed in eve and i am pretty sure it has been over 3 years since i have fired a shot in anger in high sec in short neutral shielding of targets in high sec warfare is a killer you probably should have listed that first i am going to have to ruminate on that one for a bit i cannot see a way to negate the problem at this momentthank you destination skillqueue for your additions to the discussion i shall try and find a way around the high secconcord problem and post it soon
for a purpose of server knowing whether you can shoot or not  no this line does not exist now and to know it server must cope with the dreadful n square problem you do not need to know all the math and coding to understand that it is very simple logic actually it is amazing how many people still cant understand it thoughthe line you are talking about is drawn by your client and evaluated by your brain the server does not possess their computing power and needs to rely only on his own for the sake of securitythe only thing we dont know without knowledge of all eve innards is how much it will add to the existing calculations will they increase tenfold or by a mere 10 because server already does so many things but  n square  inevitably will be thereinsert some waste of screen space here
i have been following several of the threads regarding complaints about fuel blocks and a thought comes to mind since one of the main issues with them is they removed peoples flexibility in fuel requirements and forced everyone to pay for a null sec use case and created a new artificial demand for null sec fuel that research poses never needed before why not diversify the types of fuel blocks one can produce i could easily see something like1 high energy fuel blocks  full cpupg2 high cpu fuel blocks  high cpu low pg for research poses3 minimal fuel blocks  low cpu low pg for tempstaging posesthis would reintroduce some of the flexibility of match the fuel usage to the use case while still allowing the simplification fuel blocks giveit would also make the dependency on oz dependent on what kind of activity you are doing rather then the one size fits all this is how null sec people use poses so of course it should require lots of stuff produced there model that we have right now
so your going to complicate a fuel system that was simplified to something more complciated that it was beforedont get me wrongmotivation is validi get the purposebut this isnt gonna workmight want to go back to the drawing boarddont know of any suggestions off handi like the simplicity of new fuel blocks stop the evemail spam
you err significantly when you call full cpupg a 00 use case pretty much every tower outside hisec is going to be maxing pg due to the need to fit defenses while many of these towers use significant cpu moon mining refining assembly labs even without considering ewar batteries such as in the case of a wh dickstar tower which is going to fill its cpu and pg to the brim even more so than most nullsec ones willalso i do not see the utility of a minimal fuel block over a fullspec one for a staging tower or even a throwaway one as leaving a tower defenseless for anything longer than a span of days invites an attack especially in kspace as there are bored supercapdread pilots to contend with
i agree it is not quite as simple as one block for everything i think it is less complex then what was it 7 different commodities each of which need to be dolled out manually at each tower in the right ratios this setup would at least keep the complexity to the manufacturing end
good point i admit i am not a nullbear so it was a case i was only really aware of from reading the other threads and how it seemed to be the one that experienced a decrease in costsin this case i was thinking of very short term towers i occasionally put up small towers with just a maintenance array and corporate hanger they were pretty cheap to run and could be used to interface with a freighter after a single op
that particular point was one i didnt touch due to the fact that poss in nullsec and highsec are worlds apartyou have conord protectionwe dontheavy pgheavy cpu is a balancing actyour fuel changes could cause major problemsbut its not something im an expert inthe frequent issue with most proposals is people dont forget to weigh in all walks of eve lifetunnel vision is a bit of a draw backnull sec life is very hectic and rampant at times1 fuel block for all things of 1 racial pos type is a quick and dirty solutioneven if inelegantthe only people who are losing out are those who dont employ maxium consumption of the pos resources it was a sticking pointbut one that can be overlooked by propper management stop the evemail spam
this is kinda my point now there is a onesize solution but it is optimized for null sec what i propose is adding in a number of type of fuel blocks so that people in different situations can use a different block this proposal would still include the current block type but add in two additional types so trying to get away from the current tunnel vision
i wouldnt agree its tunnel vision making changes generally means somebody benefits and somebody suffers no matter what the change this is the case a good change is when the benefits out way the suffering look on the brightside your now getting free pgcpu so you may as well use it to make your pos look more busy might be helpful in the case of a possible war dec
would be easier to simply have one fuel block for cpu and another for pg have them consumed at a rate matching the percentage used call the cpu fuel coolant to make it fit the situation better you fuel your reactor more to drive a higher pg and your computers run hotter with increased cpu demandor just leave it as is
that makes sensegood luck convincing ccp however stop the evemail spam
or you could slap up some extra labsassembly arrays and rent the space outthe moral of the story is tower fuel efficiency is dead so make the maximum use of your towers now
all i learned from this was that youre a  teacher can we move on now
wow a lot of hostility i am sorry i brought it up perhaps a bit of psychiatry might solve some of the issues you guys have with life but i guess we might as well forget this thread for the moment i am curious as to why this makes everyone so angry though perhaps i will ask in game it seems to me that enjoyment is gained from fanatically raving that i am inferior i can only assume this is either because people delight in hurting the feelings of others in which case i apologise for disappointing you or there is some compensation going on in which case you have my sympathy

this forum is absolutely hilarious when it comes to clueless publords championing their own exclusively personal gripes and issues with the game that affect precisely zero players except themselves instead of clogging this forum up with pointless impractical ideas or entirely aesthetic fixes and why not focus on coming up with solutions to the numerous longstanding problems with the game that actually impact a decent portion of the playerbasestupid impractical proposals include but are not limited toproposing entirely new classes of shipsdemanding the csm demand clarifications from ccp on xyzpurely aesthetic changes to ships eg logos paint schemesmassively complex overhauls to game mechanics that arent actually brokenanything to do with nex or captains quartersyou have been given the most successful and energetic csm to date to carry your ideas to ccp why are you wasting this opportunity with proposals that clearly havent been thought through or apply to such a small subset of players that makes them not even worth the attention of csm members let alone the bother of implementationmy humble proposal stop being dumb
was going to support until i read
the assembly hall is a relic of the time when the csm was considered by a few to be a parliamentary body it should really be merged into the existing features and ideas subforum as ccp doesnt pay attention to upvotes in ah or threadspamming
this is true i doubt those lazy csm faggots even read this forum
thisespecially when you see five pages of discussion concerning some idiotic mechanic that would take a full team of programmers years to execute properly eg missiles and projectile weapons hit ships based on line of site damage weapons systems propulsion etc oh and you can see the damage occurring in real time too like torn solar sails and shizzlecenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
ah is also a relic of a bygone era where the csm would actually try to communicate with the players more than ccp did soon well be hearing about how the mittani dissolved the senate and UFFFD oh hang on thats the other evil empire storyline
1ass hall is currently the only formal venue for interacting with the csm and raising proposals if it is removed you have to provide a replacement fi is not it
so your proposal to end all the impossible requests in the assembly hall is to make the most impossible request of all people cant stop being dumb individual persons can but as the size of a group of people increases the combined intelligence of that group decreases to match the intelligence of the stupidest memberyou only need to look at 4chan or youtube to realize the truth of thisfrankly youd have better luck proposing an idea to nasa to move the moon a little closer so we could have better surfing
stahlregens argument is only supported by the facts and as homer simpson wisely commented you can prove anything you like with those things
sturgeons law the obvious corollary of this law is that for every 1 good suggestion you need to wade through x bad ones and further that the rate of good suggestions will always increase more slowly than the rate of bad ones it sucks but thats people for you if the ah produces no more than 4 or 5 good proposals out of the 8001000 made every year then it has served a worthwhile purpose the 996 bad proposals are simply the price you pay for getting the 4 good ones for free

thistakes 1 dev 1 day to implement
so much 1three months is a pretty reasonable timeframe this would also prevent people reserving moons in highsec with offline towers
three months is a horribly short time if you want towers to become abandoned id suggest a reasonable timeframe would be 12 months to allow for people who are sent by work to places where they cant access the internet at all or at best have expensive bandwidth which cant be spent on gamesthree months is the kind of time that runs past when you let the tower go idle for a few days while you head off exploring null sec pvp traipse around low sec getting absorbed into exploration or decide to help a friend out with some faction standingsbuilding dreadnoughts and carriers in wspace is par for the course if you dont do it some pvp corp will set up their own tower as a safe base of operations from which they can stage their attacks on your corp members and towers if you cant bring superior firepower to their live online tower you will end up losing your own tower
i once anchored small towers on all the moons in a wh system to deny another corp the ability to establish a footholdi think everything is working just fine on the other hand you sound kinda lazy
ill counter that as long as its a onesystem affair it doesnt matter if its a single corp or alliance running things  since you can just launch the ships for the other guys to hop in still a pos fix would be nice ccp if youre going through one or more systems things get interesting readannoyingyeah definitely went with gank  tank on the talos fit mostly because were talking about an offline tower in wspace so youre gonna be right up against it and dont have to deal with range so much and its a fair bet that the owners dont have anyone able to do anything about it im also assuming that if you had 10 of those fits youd have a guardian or two as well maybe a falcon to increase the gtfo ability now if were talking about removing an online tower then weve got to switch to railsartillerybeams so well lose dps there and then theres the need to fit a semblance of a tankyeah i understand that shipbuilding requires a lot of pos resources and here i thought null was a  for that  again my suggestions are built off the idea that the op has settled in a system so i suppose it has a static so blowing through the mass limits one time to get the ships or a secondary tower for construction etc shouldnt really be an issue  and if youre going to settle you might as well get a cap or two in there there has been more than one wspace system weve passed by because oh found a carrierdread on dscan obviously if were talking about an unsettled system that youre trying to siege then you really have to weigh the proscons and come up with the best solution possible
this seems like a good route to proceed along abandoned towers should be resources available to the next capsuleer willing to fuel them absent this some way to salvage a tower for parts without blowing it up would also be a good improvement a lot of raw materials go into a tower 90 days is a long time to leave a tower unattended so i think the time frame is more then fair
fiddle constans telling people to pvpp wololol
so the fact that the tengu receives range damage and rate of fire bonuses when no other missilebased ship in the game gets those bonuses is no cause for concern that t3 cruisers get two bites of the overheating bonuses cherry is no cause for concernthe fundamental error here is you running off on a tangent simply because i brought up an example of how t3s are unbalancing the missionrunning aspect of the game do you dispute that a missilebased tengu performs better in pvp than a cerberus do you dispute that offgrid boosting allows t3 ships to perform fleet boosting better than a command ship is overheating irrelevant to pvp combat
t3s are pretty balanced with how expensive they are for most people its like buying half a carrierthe only thing id be in favor of is upping the training time on its skills i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
cerberus reallyi think the main balance issue here is that you are comparing a 500m2b isk ship to a cerberus t3 ships are for all intents and purposes the most expensive subcapital ships that people regularly field in pvpalso part of the reason those mission hubs are filled with tengu pilots is probably due to the fact that tengu training time is minuscule compared to that of a golem or faction battleship although the tengu is probably a little imbalanced in that respect its hardly game breaking only half a carrier xd my t3 is about the same price as my chimera pcenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
ive had my share of t3 engagements on either side of the gunfrom you on the other hand im getting the dont nerf my toy vibewith a nerf their price would also come down through reduced demand without sticking on complex mods on the ship t3s dont get to 2 bil in fact the cookie cutter alliance tenguloki fit is 600700 mil that is less than a mach or a carrier and still tengus have way less weaknesses than those yeah i know different ship classes but when people bring arguments like it costs so much it should pwn it has to be mentioned
i wouldnt call that a mild nerf about my only point of agreement is that spread of missile bonuses on the one subsystem that has them really though its dps is tied to the bonuses offered by stationary targets and fleet boosting ive dusted one in a merlin and took almost 0 dps flying in a straight line away from it autocannon cane and i wouldnt have been so luckythats a missile issue of course weakness of the weaponif the t3s get nerfed and the market drops youll also find a corresponding drop in supply as the wormholers find something more profitable and worth the effort to do spend some time in a hole and tell me how much fun it is without a crew to bash sleepers you need some serious incentive to make guys wanna do thatits a special ship leave it at that height of technology advanced beyond anything the empires have known beforezubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
i did say 500m2b p most solo t3 pilots will stick on some seriously expensive mods t2 rigs etc and those are the t3s that really pwn as for it costs so much it should pwn a carrier plays a different role and in most fights is considerably more useful than another t3funny you should bring up pirate faction battleships though would you fight a bhaalgorn in a tengu or a machariel for that matter proteus vs vindicatoranyway ill admit a fleet of 600700m isk t3s are pretty awesome especially with logistics support but then again if you kill one or two of them even sacrificing a scorpion and a fleet of whelp canes would still leave you isk positive at the end and if you cant kill them because you dont have any ewar logistics or webbers then you probably wouldnt have won even if they werent flying t3scenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
i dont think that a drop of say 20 in the value of sleeper drop would severely reduce the numbers of wh dwellersthats a rp argument to keep the imbalance
as it is for a solo pilot raiding c3s i make only slightly more than i would running incursions and finding a decent c3 thats empty takes considerably longer than finding a fleet for incursions thats dual boxing with a pimped t3 and a t3 salvagertake 20 off that and i may as well go back to running incursions which i dont particularly want to do because theyre boring as hell either that or endlessly scouring forge low sec for the 510 and 610 which gets equally dull after a whilecenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
your income benchmark shouldnt be incursions as they are in dire need of a nerf their riskreward ratio is completely out of whack now that running them has been perfected but that is getting off topic
aye thats true but unfortunately they wont be nerfed which unfortunately means things like whs need to be balanced around themas it is its pretty close if you dropped the iskhour of raiding c3s below that of running incursions a lot of players would instantly swap professions especially since to run c3s that fast you need to risk a pretty pimped shipclonecenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
1 for having ballsas for this idea i dunno im a wh dweller so im inclined to scream get off my lawn mainly because i feel that wspace is already suffering badly from highsec incursion iskfountains wspace has gotten alot more quiet compared to p
aye it seems a lot safer too just out of interest and not to derail the thread but what class wh do you live in and whats the pvp like i was considering swapping to living in whs from raiding them but the lack of people put me off only time ive ever found a c3 that was populated absolutely all of them warped to pos and logged off at the first sign of trouble eventually they put combats out but never actually warped in and engaged my bait ship dcenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
this idea is so bad i dont even know where to startdont mess with t3s except to nerf their gang links alternately buff the command ships links so that they return to their proper role in the fleet
you should at least try to use like arguments because right now you only you sound like every other whiny carebear that is afraid their shiny is getting nerfedfleet cs with t1 ganglinks already gave badass bonuses t3s with t2 ganglinks are over the top
calling floppie a carebear pricelesscenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
good godlet me get this right you want to nerf t3 ships because they give more bonuses than other ships out there that are a third or even a quarter of the cost a properly fitted t3 costs 600 mil or more last time i checked they give the bonuses they do because they cost a lot they cost a lot because of what it takes to manufacture them now if there is a balancing issue between the t3 ships i am all for fixing thatbut these are t3 ships they are the best of the best right now they should be slightly better than a t2 bc but not better than a t2 bs they should not be worse than t2 bcs and lower simple as that
not especially when turret ships also have range damage and rof bonuses if its ok for a zealot to have those 3 bonuses then you need to really go into more detail as to why this is a bad thingand doesnt the cerberus get a range rof and damage bonus the eve wiki thinks it doescaldari cruiser skill bonus 5 bonus to kinetic missile damage and 10 bonus to missile velocity per levelheavy assault ship skill bonus 10 bonus to heavy assault and heavy missile flight time and 5 bonus to missile launcher rate of fire per level
leave my tengu alone and bring other t3s up to the same levelinstead of crying and moaning for nerfs you guys should spend your useless time posting stuff to improve other t3s and mission boats
lol seems like i really struck a nerve there everyone knows the tengu is op  hipocrits
the tengu needs a good hard nerf it has high dps long range and heavy tank the other t3s barring the legion get to pick 2 of 3 the legion cannot have high dps but gets the other two just fine i for one rarely use t3s in pvp not counting off grid boosting the more specialized recons bcs and pirate faction cruisers are more effective at a lower cost about the only role they do better than anything else is the probing cruiser class marauder for exploration but it has no t2 equivalent in that role to compete with the only thing on them that needs an across the board nerf is the ganglink subsystem either css need to be buffed to 5 per lvl or t3s need to be nerfed to 3 per lvl doesnt make a damn bit of difference to me which is done
agreed that cs should get the 5 for warfare links while t3s should only get 3 t3 boosters get plenty of other compensating advantages
t3s will be nerfed by the introduction of t4s we need more t3s available from frigates on up to battleships
from someone who killed 1 loki and sent the other off the field with a cane and a friend in a drakekeep the changes small lengthening the training time of subsystems would be a good idea if something was needed to compensate for any future removal of the explodingt3 skillpoint loss and the tengu might be able to do with its missle subsystems rejiggered making the missile subsystems into a choice between the accelerated ejection bay for hightofacemeltdps ham fittings a la the legion counterpart or the rifling launcher pattern for longrange moderatelyhighbutnotuber dps hml fittings would be a good idea imo dont go all nerfbatintoground on them as a class though as the legion would become useless and the loki and proteus would become what the legion is nowas to the t3 vs pirate faction bs issueyoud be surprised for instance a webbing loki could kite a vindi to death with ease how is a blaster vindicator supposed to hit out to loki bonused web range and even with 800mm acs the mach still might have trouble with a t3 under its guns also the only thing that keeps the tengu from kiting everything under the sun is the lack of a long enough point if something else maybe a drag or stop bubble cleverly placed by said tengu pilot is keeping the bhaal from warping off in the bhaal vs tengu casethats one dead bhaalgornalso more and more varied uses for sleeper lootsalvage would be a good thing imo t3 ammo might be an interesting concept to ponder
imo t3s are a result of ccps inability to find roles for new ships so they went hey lets make modular ships that do it all just better vandalizing the delicate inter ship class balance if strategic cruisers are any indication of how the other t3s are gonna be eve would be better off without them
i had a 650 dps arty loki with the web subsystem it was pretty epic in most respects save one it could only web to about 50km with a faction web and links i wanted a 100km web the rapier could provide that while the loki couldnt i ended up never actually using that loki and sold it after a couple months of it collecting dust i wasnt afraid to fly it in fact i kept trying to come up with excuses to but it just wasnt of any use our little gangs needed the range of the rapier not 300 more dpsthat situation is presented across most t3 setups they can do several things at once which is great soloduo but in any larger gang youre better off with more specialized ships and this is completely ignoring cost
personally my biggest gripe is that these structures have waaaaaaaay too many hit points most sov fights i see are two massive fleets maneuvering around one another until one side wins and the other runs for it then if the attackers win they have a boring structure shoot ahead of them maybe the improved dread mechanics that encourage more people to use them will mean more dps and less time on structure shootshonestly as far as hit points go i think that every structure in the game poses pi offices sbus stations whatever should just have enough hit points to discourage the lone ass in an oracle who feels like making you waste strontalso as far as timers go there are just waaaaay too many timers which take way too many days to take a system from the initial fight to online sbus then you gotta keep em safe and take out the tcu and shooting at a station multiple times takes way too long as wellif we are going to redesign sov warfare then the idea of sovereignty needs to come down to one basic question if my enemy and i both had the opportunity to invest all of our resources to fight in one system who would winright now i think the only way to do this in a timely manner is to work the reinforcement timers so that youd have to have a major battle in every time zone and then just be done with iti honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
i like the lone pilot idea sov warfare might be far more interesting if the lone pilot could indeed quickly take down or temporarily disable tcus jump bridges or pos raiders could slip into an underused sov system disable the jump bridge defenders would use to repel them and get to the work of plundering assets aka taking everything you have stored in your posassets should be protected by human players and not just automated defenses that dictate when the clash of the titans will take place then the massive alliances would have to allocate players to defend the systems they hold actively instead of just shuttling a massive fleet of jump clones from one engagement to the next their massive offensive campaigns would also open the door to their own vulnerability to the opportunistic counter attack from the little guyslets increase the risk for sov holders and make them continue to earn the rewards of holding a system
first off the csm positively loves frolicking in the mud and other sticky substances so one should never hesitate pushing them into such or even flinging it at themsecondly if you merely want an idea peer reviewed then you are in the wrong place  features and ideas is down belowas for the polish you are trying to apply to the turd known as ehp grind mechanics  give it up it will never get a shine anyone is happy with
yeah thats a good point granted id like a small gang of 510 people to be able to mess up a jump bridge instead of just 1by the way i have also noticed that if you lower the response time people have it lowers the distance at which people can batphone in their friends if you want small entities then theyll just need to respond to the things they live next toi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
the real issue is that a stopped ship realigns parallel to the galactic plane  straightening out as it were if i had to guess this is because of the way movement is handled in eve you literally do not have direction unless you are moving so your ships model returns to the default horizontal positionwhat should happen is that the direction component of the last movment vector remains leaving the model properly oriented while the velocity component is reduced to 01 from me
for the love of godthere is another thread for this already posted by the same person that posted this one over a month ago use that threadlet this one die this was established with the second post in the thread read before postingthank you
i think this is just the richest 1 telling the rest of us 99 what we can and cannot shoot atfight the man occupy jitai honestly think poco based sov is a good idea

i would have them remove the npcs from plexes and leave it to the players to defend entirely thats the other part of the proposal but if the enemy attacks our military complex then we should know about it i agree no one wants the job to check all the systems to see if someone is attacking our complex why wouldnt the complex that is being attacked report it it doesnt make any sense at all why not let us know so we can try to quickly react make the game dynamic and fast paced just think about itagain the purpose of this proposal is to have eve offer something for people who dont have hours on end looking for fights eve offers lots of opportunities for those who like to hunt for hours waiting for a fight it offers very little for those who dont want to wait hours at a computer screen hoping something will happen and often leaving disappointed i do not want to change all of eve around i just want one mechanic that brings about frequent quality small scale pvp fw plexing would do very well if you like warping around hunting you still could you can do that in fw or in null sec or as a pirate that is basically all the game offers now i joined a militia that is at war for a huge faction they should tell me where the fighting is going on not just tell me go wander around see what you can find imagine if you joined world war 2 for any side and they said ok take your gun and wander around the world looking for a fight this sort of change may not be for everyone but the thing is it would provide a something you simply cant get in eve now frequent quality small scale pvp by adding something new to what we can do in the sandbox eve will attract more players and keep existing players who may get tired of constantly warping alt scouts around anyway just think about it make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
taking an hour to update that hardly sounds fast paced or dynamic i mean if we want a mechanic in the game where we find out some gang may be in a system so we then all take a half hour to ship up and then when we arrive they see we shipped up and so they either disperse or ship up even higher leading to no fights and allot of smack talk in local then the one hour delay sounds good but really doesnt eve already offer this  in droves why not have a faster paced more dynamic part of the game that players can participate in if they wish like i said its only one mechanic in the game im not forcing this down everyones throat if you like to spend hours hunting for a fight you can still do that really i know allot of people like that about eve and thats great they can still do that but why tailor every pvp mechanic in the game for people who have lots of time to hunt for prey i didnt join a hunting club i joined major a war i dont want to sit for hours in a tree waiting for a deer to wander by i want to be thrown into some action look if there were between 1040 systems throughout each front that had plexes and the notification system i describe we would all get about 37 decent pvp fights in 2 hours of play doesnt that sound goodmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve

he posted many times about t2 bpos i was looking for the one where he dissects the issue in like 4 different supplydemand situations each with their peculiarities
i think the fact that t2 bpos used in the construction of 50 million isk ships sell for 35 billion isk sort of speaks for itselfzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
yes it means he probably made a loss from reselling it at that price
invention is cheap and easy compared to the supply lines necessary to actually build t2 modules even if noobs had the bpos they wouldnt have a source for materials other than the market making it pointless to own the bpo no new t2 bpos are necessaryunless ccp will give me a full set of t3 bpos first then ill change my mind d
what he saidif there is anything wrong at all its the fact that it is called invention
reverse engineering is what you do to an alreadybuilt item to determine how it works this is done to sleeper wreckage ingame whats being done with invention is that you take a bpo add an existing dataset and produce a modified blueprint id say thats just plain engineering
yeah but thats already used to get more pg
definitely one of the papercuts static signatures should have static ids

okthen i suggest you give us a logical reason for eliminating scamming from this gameor kindly get the hell out before you embarrass yourself this is eve onlinenot hello kitty onlinedont like it bumble wow is that way  stop the evemail spam
i dont mind scamming as long as there is some way to detect if there is a scam or not the marginal trade scam is completely undetectable you can say it is all you want but you are flat out lying there is absolutely no way to know if the order will go through or not until you have tried to fill it
n units that are being bought for far more than regional average with a minimum order of x units where x  n pretty easily detectable
i was gonna sayany scam in eve can be detected if you pay attention to whats going on around youthis particular scam obviously entails a savy marketeer and only happens to people who are quick to buy low sell high without paying attention to detailsnote the underlined partthat is the problemand that is the buysllers responcibilityif it was that big of a dealit would happen more often than notand i dont see this kind of tearful whine thread anymore than maybe 3 to 4 times a monthor less stop the evemail spam
this part is bad what youre doing is nerfing the  out of wormholes for those things that could be used in wormholes or setting a precedent for the nerfing the  out of wormholes by breaking cloaks and the ability to remain in a system unknown and unseen gathering vital intel the probes horrible idea for that very reason the other three any sort of cloakbreaker introduced sets the precedent for adding or expanding in the future which could spill over where its not neededsimply by not seeing the cloaked vessel in local youve eliminated the whole afk cloak scares me thing big thread in features and ideas already on that concept
no dont nerf wspace into the ground
why does domain or tash murkon not have a single concord station between them while metropolis has 9would it be not fair that every region have at least one concord station for its inhabitants to be able to visit without having to travel many jumps to visit

your implying they are unfocusedand your ignoring the obvious fact that tech 3 ships have to be configured to fill those rolesand when they arethey end up being worse off in those roles they arent configured for than they are in its intended rolealready your being told by pvpers they tend to not use them as often as you hate them for fear themthis smells like a carebear whine more than anything elsetoo many ships fill those roles better than a tech 3 does due to its extreme focustech 3 ships are fine as they are nowinfact some are better off being buffed as opposed to nerfd stop the evemail spam
i really dont understand why someone would care about anything that might be called balance in pve use the best ship there is if its a t3 use it if a marauder can do better fly the marauder if your primary complaint is that tengus are too good at missionsfly a tengu and cash in on it or if you prefer to feel like your missions are tougher fly something else but dont try to push change on everyone else just because you think a ship is too good at shooting npcs

yes they are but thats not the primary issue the remark was a statement on ccps game design the issue is they offer a very compelling package of dps survivability and variable extra abilities that is hard to beat the only real downside is their cost the skill loss doesnt count as its currently negligible trying to balance that out via cost is also bad game design at best look at supercap proliferation for referenceyou clearly havent been doing much 00 or wh play lately or you would know that is not true the only typical fleetgang role i dont see much t3s in are logistics ecm and cap warfare if you read my opening post you wouldve seen i support the buffing of specific t3s or aspects thereofi know you have difficulty understanding it so let me restate i dont care about pve this proposal refers to t3s in a pvp context i do however have the opinion that introducing ships which obsolete entire ship classes isk not being a factor andor are overpowered is bad game design that actually hurts the gameplay no matter if in pvp or pve and mara brought up pve note i stopped doing regular missioningrattingpve about 2 years agoby that logic nothing op would ever be nerfed and seeing that you are only in it for yourself what are you doing in a proposal that is trying to improve the game youre a textbook hypocrite
classy also you complete lack of comprehension of the nature of adhd makes me chuckle that you think it would prevent me from understanding anythingso why are you replying to my post directed at people who do and you say i have difficulty understandingbut cost is a factor should ccp be balancing deadspace mods so that t2fitted ships can compete with them they cost more because theyre more effective t3s same thingif t3s make so much obsolete why arent they the only ships on the field rightbecause theyre woefully inadequate as main fleet ships they do support well theyre great at solo and small gang combat and they can bring unique abilities to bear but they will melt in the face of a more balanced fleetcontext much lets go back to the part where i was replying to people complaining about tengus being op in missionsjeebus and im supposed to be the one with a short attention span edit you do realize that just because you started this thread not every reply is about you right sheesh some people think the world revolves around them

in all sectors if a cloaky or a member of an original fleet that completes the site remains near the gate it does not despawn for them but appears to do so for everyone else as ccp has recently changed the mechanics of anomaly spawning to prevent exactly what is happening in incursions i hope the same can be done here at this rate a small group of players or alts can effectively shut down entire systems of incursion running in all sectors of space pwnage
reallyanybody want to get a fleet up so we can go test this over the next 24 hours
the more it happens the likelier a fix is i would think in anoms ccp said exploiting the respawn mechanics amounted to economic warfare and so it was fixed so that it despawned no matter what after site completion the same should be happening here but isnt
im going to bring it up when i get on corp ts tonight if we can hold open empty vanguard sites while were up to other incursionrelated shenanigans this will be fun
uhhh why are you guys trying to tackle the big picture i only brought up 1 specific change i am offering absolutely no insight about the sov system in general i am only considering the timing mechanics i dont want to prattle on about the grind its almost as if you read the first part of the first sentence and then stopped
great and then me and my friend should wake up at 4 am to defend our tower such a great pleasuresarcasm off
the idea is to make the battles at different times allowing for variability in who is fighting someone will always be that 4 am guy but if there is variability it is unlikely that it will be the same set of people for a whole month
ive heard that so many times and while i agree that ultimately game design should be entirely left up to ccp i dont think it would hurt the game at all if some of ccps game designers put their egos down for a minute and took into consideration some of the kickass game design ideas that some players spend lots of time and energy devising seriously what would it hurt eves player base is full of smart people and if i were ccp i would make it mandatory for game designers to at least rummage through these ideas and see what good stuff can come from themedit i recall this original idea from another thread and i supported it then so i cant imagine why i wouldnt now thanks for putting it all together into a pdf ill digest it over the next few days if i can ill give a preemptive 1 based on what i recall from the original thread great workthe world as we know it came about through an anomaly anomou the gospel of philip 15
bare in mind the new t3 bcs with large guns im pretty sure thats a player created idea thats as old as eve itselfeven the ships we ended up getting were player designedso this ccp adopting and implementing player ideas thing does happen

lets take a closer look at new charactersnew characters are the only ones who can use the only attribute enhancing booster in the game not long ago ccp gave them out free with new accounts you can still get them in boxed editions of eve for the cost of a months subscription combined with 3s which takes minuets to train they get effective 6 implants for 35 days you can even go for 4s in a reasonable amount of time for 7 effectiveness bonus access to various combat implants add a third neural remap up until jan 5th and new players are in a prime positionremove all of these bonuses and new players will train more slowly for the first critical month after that two 3s or 4s are not expensive add to that the low cost of low sp clones and now implants are even more affordable to younger playersthe real concern which few are outright saying is 5s those are costly a young player really cannot afford to lose those but they can afford them one at a time and can keep them in a highsec jump clone or station bound many corps have standings that give instant access to jump clones even still many argue they are not worth the cost even in highsec because they do not make that big of a difference take two 4s vs nothing and you see a jump go from there to two 5s and you only notice it when training high multiplier skills to 5for older players you see more complaints about the price of medical clones in light of extending trials to two months i think extending the booster to two months or more is worth considering i recommended various cost control methods and proposals in previous posts
i support the idea of allowing players up to 6 months to get the training bonuses while us vets are waiting on our month long level 5 skill this will get them into better ships faster to go do that pvp thing all you youngns are doin today

ok make cloaking remove you from local so that if you jump into a system occupants get a brief flash of you in local then everyone sits around in the intel channel wondering are they still here after you cloak and are invisible to them on grid warping around and exploring the system with impunityor make local constellation wide then when someone gets ganked out of nowhere everyone sits around in the intel channel wondering are they still here can we form a gang to killbait them wait are they still here for us to even do that dont rat when a red is in the constellation could be an answer to thisor remove local altogether so noone knows what the hell is going on anywhere outside of someone elses misfortune reported in the intel chan for others to read aboutpart of me sort of wants this so i could play with it but it would turn eve into a game of marco polo

if anything i want this implemented mainly for active cov ops cloak only i mean its not very cov ops if everyone knows your in the area and somewhat defeats the point of being in a stealth orientated ship right since everyone just docks up or leaves system the second people are seen entering system
yes please make covops overpowered
local is fine nerfing local will cause major problems very few want no local like they have in wormholes but if you do you have that choice to live there why screw everyone elses game upmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
this is exactly why i posted the thread for discussion  to get another view and get people to raise issues with the ideas suggested i honestly hadnt considered the implications for wormholes of course theres no reason for that to be an issue local in wormholes would stay as it is now this change should only affect regular space cloakbreaker or cloakfinders could also be very easily restricted too the supercarrier and sovbased pos mod ideas are obviously impossible to use in wormholes mods or special scan probes can be made unusable in the same way as cyno gensi disagree the main effect should be always scared as you never know if a system you jump into already has a cloaker i think this will lead to alot more conflict in eve in general as people who dont take care when moving around will quickly be caught outanother facet of the change is that it rebalances the concept that cloaked people can have an effect on a system simply by being present in it this is especially evident in the case of stealth bombers camping jumpbridges who can choose to when to engage do so already aligned out and are very hard to trap unless they make a mistakeby removing these bombers from local and stopping them from seeing whats coming it adds more opportunities for them to be surprised
if youd read that thread particularly the latter part youd have seen more objections against removing cloaked ships from local yes removing local from them stops them from seeing whats coming but thats easily circumvented by having a blue alt in system whats worse is however that these cloaked gangs imply that those who actually inhabit a system has to watch all gates and all wormholes and keep an active antiincursion gang going 2357 we have a place for that its called wormholes and given all the extra work theyll have to do just to keep a system semisafe added with the lack of income and ecitement for those on guard duty and id expect itd take just a few weeks before nullsecs carebear population drains into hisec to make isk there instead i dont want nullsec to become even less populous than it already is weve already seen the effects of the anom nerf on the population do we really have to see the effect an increase in risk would haveunless of course nullsec is increased somewhat in profitability to make the extra work worth it and even then im pretty sure well see a fair bit of carebears migrate back to hisec
this for the most partthe solution is just change local to whs styledoneno ones going to give a crap about the status of a cloaked ship because you wont even see the damn thing in localthis bull business of removing cloaked ships from local and them not seeing local is utter tripewhomever came up with it originally needs to be drawnquarteredtarredfeatheredand shot and not necessarily in that order and for the recordthe op isnt the first one who brought it upthis is the 10th time ive seen this craptldr  remove local  all else is nonrelevant stop the evemail spam
and this improves on the suggestion of removing cloaked ships from local  how
that would be me please be gentle on the quarteringthe idea was to find a middle ground regarding removing local and breaking cloaks which wouldnt affect wormholes where theres already no issues the idea of cloaked vessels truly disappearing would also end the afk cloak threads id prefer things be left alone and people grow some balls and stop whining because theyre afraid of the person thats not at his computer but in lieu of some of the horrible break cloak ideas that people were spewing out there which would break wormholes by making them safer than high sec i suggested that
no im pretty sure it wasnt origionally stated by youthis debates been around a long timepoint isif local becomes delayedno ones going to know whose doing what anymoreand anything over that is just thatoverkillits a waste of time to discuss beyond that pointyou wont see themthey wont see you unless either speaks upmiddle ground or notit suits me just fineand im quite sure the bulk of the masses wouldnt have much to complain about short of sheer mass paranoia everyone has the same chance as everyone elsecloaking device only makes you invisible to the naked eye at that pointnot deticble by scannersbut then he cant see whose around without making visual contact either or dsyou cant get much more simpliler than thatits a switch to be thrownno programming needed stop the evemail spam

very few people do and a big reason is there is no local there that means you have to fit a scanner to find any wts  which not only gimps your ship but is more of a hassle than anything fun you cant quickly tell if there is even anyone there let alone anyone to fight you cant tell if there is a blob there cloaked and ready to gank you you cant pve there without hitting the dscan button like some sort of ocd imbecilethese are only a few of the reasons 93 of eve subscribers prefer to play eve where there is a localmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i guess ill have to do the entire process with you as wellwhat exactly do you think will be the most likely result of no local or if certain ships are excluded from local

ok i guess if ccp decides that 93 of their playerbase has no business playing this game then they will make all of eve no local like wormholes yay even more reason to blob up in eve great solution to every problemseriously if you like no local in wormholes play there you can make more isk than pretty much anywhere else in the game just dont assume everyone wants to do that if we did all of eve would be in theremake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve

how the  can i make eve further into space wow when im simply against changes to the current mechanics or are you trying to insinuate im making eve into space wow to try to force me into accepting ideas whichll ultimately turn nullsec further into a desert than it already has turned after the anom nerf

and you completely pass over the analogy i made if complex mods are okay in spite of their being more powerful than t2 variants why the whine about t3syour point should ccp nerf tengus so drakes go back to being the spammobile then will you be whining for them to nerf drakes just because a given ship is the flavor of the month doesnt mean its op i dont recall any changes to drakes or tengus for quite some timewhy would there be a shift from one to the other my guess metagame drake armies arent as effective as they once were because they were so widely used that other fleets developed hard counters to them when the tengus are consistently trumped theyll find another ship to blob you deliberately took my statement out of context and tried to apply it to pvp which was obviously not my intent dont accuse me of deflecting when i point that out here ill spell it out and try to use little wordswhen you are shooting the little red plus signs use any ship you want because you are the only person fighting and balance doesnt matter if one ship does the job better than all the others use that shipalso i cant even fly a tengu i dislike caldari ships and missile boats in general exceptions made for the sacrilege and vengeance
lol  little red plus signs
there are no complex mods that increase a cruisers dps and tank from average to that of a bs nor are there mods that give bs the speed agility and sig radius of a cruiser t3s have bothim actually liking your train of thought here although i will disagree with your conclusion blobs of tengus in their current form and with the current other ships will never find a hard counter there are some tactics that offer a minimum of effectiveness against them but engagements with similar numbers on each side tend to go heavily in favor of the tengusanother cause for more and more people switching to t3s is the increase in purchasing power which we already skirted before which shows another reason that balancing through cost is a bad ideawell and about the drake many people including ccp have stated for years that it offers maybe a bit too much in a single package none of the quotes were taken out of context your mistake is to believe there is no such thing as balance in pve therefore you are assuming i am wrongly applying your pve statements in a pvp contextop mission boats are one of the multiple reasons the isk faucetssinks are out of balance and again introducing ships that obsolete all other hi end mission boats is just bad game designfinally i dont think that the 3 nerf items i proposed are at all unreasonable
the horse isnt quite deadbut we are going to continue to beat it anyway
indeedstill cant get over the fact this is a glorifeid carebear bash aruging over its not fiar mispelling intentional argument we should nerf tech3s cause its not fiarand to top that offits an op who hides behind an npc for whatever reasonthats the trifecta of irony stop the evemail spam
i dont think the op has ever been inside a wh before thats likely the real problem t3s in terms of pve were meant for wh spaceare they overpowered for pve in empire and nullhell yesbut they are just right for wh space then againa supercarrier is op for pve we should nerf them againany kind of balancing should be geared towards pvp and pvp only period no discussionno ifs ands or butsperiod after that whatever ship fits best for the job in pve gets the jobin this case it is the tengu get over it
show me a t3 that gets the dps and tank of a battleship either you fail at fitting battleships or youve seen some outrageouslyfitted t3s in its covert configuration my legion deals no damage at all my proteus will top out doing the damage equivalent of a bc and having the tank of a moderatelytanked bs unless of course i want to drop several billion on the right mods and implantsfor now i dont play in the blob v blob world because its never interested me but its been my experience that sooner or later someone decides there was never even a box to think outside of in the first place and arrives at a really surprising solution to a particularly troublesome problem like a tengu fleet id hate to see creativity lose its place in eve in favor of instant rebalancing every time one ship type or another rises to dominance mostly because being creative is probably what im best atif the problem is an excess of isk then you should be advocating a reduction in isk generation or an increase in isksinks to pull it back out of the game if t3s are a problem now only because people can afford them now then your real issue is with the supply and demand mechanicsive seen people running missions in machs and nightmares with nearly as good efficiency as a tengu shall we nerf them to dial down the isk faucet as well every ship you nerf for pve you inadvertently nerf for pvp as well eve needs more isk sinks and bot countermeasures not nerfed ships
i canbut its cheatingspeed tanking ok ill shut updps falls short but then not that short stop the evemail spam
you made me pull some numbers from efthave a look at the cookie cutter 00 fleet tengu pl tengustrictly t2 fitted it has 125k ehp evekill and eft dont match 568dps over the full 117km range limited by locking range signature and agility of a cruiser not to mention very logifriendly resistances the only typical fleet bs that has significantly more ehp is the baddon all others match it at best quite a few get more dps but at half the rangeive seen the emergence of a fotm fleet and later a counter to it a couple of times now some were dealt with by finding the right counter tactic by players ex ahacs others got countered by game changes ex the bomber rework killed the snipe bs im not yet seeing the same happen for tengu fleets although they have been around for over a year nowmissions and ratting are the biggest isk fountains in the game their payouts and the speed at which people complete them have multiplicative properties so if you give players the tools to run through them faster they will generate more isk in a given time frame in the case of t3s its even a positive feedback loop more isk means more people getting into t3 which means more isk that is why you have to balance pve ships as wellnightmares have become a rare sight tbh as i dont have experience in pveing in one will take their rarity compared to pimped out tengus as indication they are not or less op not so sure about the mach drake you failed to mention my npc status in your last post

show me a reasonable example of a t3 link ship with three links displacing its fleet command counterpart you wont because t3s are effectively gimped by the fitting requirements of the links and the command processor modssuch ships are relegated to the role of afk fleet boosting from inside pos shields unlike their fleet command counterparts which are better suited for fleet combat its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
maximun idea amazing refreshing multiplying the ingame things to do and awesome  lots of likes
this is obvious and should have been done a long time ago
support maybe people will gasp actually put gang links on a disposable tier 2 bc
i can think of one reason why not shield gang links its bad enough shield gang links have an issue just from getting in the right system they dont really need to keep yoyoing back and forth between boosted and unboostedif they fix this so the levels are determined based on a percentage of full shield however then i see no real problem
the question becomesis it in the best interest of a new player to be putting them into the biggest ships possible in the least amount of time i say no it isnt in their best interest the faster you put new players into bigger ships the worse off they are going to be a large part of playing this game is learning how to fly your ship just because you can sit in it doesnt mean you can fly it a new player who joins a corperation right out of the gate has people to guide them along but lets face the facts there are a lot of players who dont join a corperation for months those players often have no one to guide them along if were looking to help new players then we need to think what is best for all players not just the ones helping you pvp max sphour is not always a good thing especially when you have no idea what your doing
youre all over this as if its going to end up with 6 month old characters flying perfect titans or something its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
password protected ship for boarding or removal from ship maintenance array not that ive ever had anythig stolenzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
cosmos missions have awesome storylines and they provide very nice change for all the grinding i really wish i could do them again on some daythe cooldown should be very long though maybe one yearwhat do you think
currently afaik players who play solo and have only one account cannot benefit from warfare links while soloing however players with two accounts can i would like to see gang links even if you are a solo player who creates a gang with noone in it affect athe players ship there are already solo players with two accounts who can use it so why not even the field and allow one account soloists to use them too it would also allow new solo fits to be fielded without the need for another account id love to see what new fits can be made viable by a proteus with warfare links on its own
theyre gang links for a reason
they are gang links yet a single player with two accounts can use themthey are gang assist modules yet do they need to only be used by by mutliple accounts
you need to be a gang to use themthat means more than one pilot is requiredthe fact your using the pathetic argument of 2 accounts or 2 alts for that matter is stupidbecause thats the 2 pilots prerequisitetry to troll harder please stop the evemail spam
one person isnt a gang
wow theres a lot of hostility here you need to chillhow would allowing gang links to be used by single account solo players be bad pray tellan extra module capable of being used by players who cant pay for a second account to use one
yeah and a single player with 2 accounts can do a whole load of other stuff that a solo guy cant  scouting remote repping etc etc military experts are suggesting that you get a second account if you want the benefits of having a second account
as far as the mechanics work you need a valid fleet in order for bonuses to propagatelinks to work the fleet skills are leadership wing command and fleet commandleadership  2 pilots in your squad per level a valid squad is the squad leader plus up to 9 other pilots at l5 skillswing command  1 squad per level a valid wing is the wing commander plus 5 squad leaders plus up to 45 other pilots l5 skillsfleet command  1 wing per level a valid fleet is the fc plus 5 wc plus 25 squad leaders plus up to 225 other pilots l5 skillsif anywhere is invalid the pilots in that squadwing will not get the bonusesinvalid squads  any squad with a squad leader who cant run with the number of pilots under his command or any squad with no pilots other than the lead or any squad with no leaderinvalid wing  any wing with a wing commander missing the requisite skills to run that size of a winginvalid fleet  a fleet with a fc incapable of running that many wingsedit  removing redundant stuff
pay for an advantage like the original intention of the nex store actually im pretty cool with the idea of second accounts its just i dont like the idea of supposed modules that a single person can use if they pay for a second account sort of like paying for an advantage module although in retospect you do need to earn the isk to pay for the second account to be able to use gang linksyou can indeed get around using a second account for gang links too actually
trust me 23 actual live breathing humans will murder a single player who is multiboxing to pvp
i hear one of the benefits of a massively multiplayer online game is that you can play with other people its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
no its more like you have to play for an advantage
i see what you did there
not in support to op but this is absolutely false a proper multiscreen keystroke duplicating setup will murder any multiplayer gang of the same size coordination is always on lag with more than one person even assuming its all vets who know what theyre doing most of the time your fleet is made of grubs who cant follow simple directions go fc something anything
enough with the statistical shenanigans percentage of characters does not equal percentage of players there are 3 characters per account and a very large number of players have multiple accountstheres some seriously faulty logic going on here by some to justify the status quo just because players choose to make isk in high sec does not mean they want eve to keep riskpvp free pve i think local chat intel is terrible game mechanics but i take full advantage of it all the same all players except perhaps the most dedicated roleplayers choose the path that will lead to the greatest reward and advantagerambling on about how only 7 of characters spend time in worm holes is some indication that local chat intel removal is unpopular is also faulty as theres more differences between wormhole space and the rest than simple delayed localand zim talking about high sec incursions being some critical training ground for group flying completely ignores that players have been doing that fine in eve for several years prior to pve raids in the form of incursionsall risk free pveing needs a massive nerf buffing null anomalies while leaving local and continuing incursions in high sec is hardly the answer
what other hisec pve activity requires the same level of coordination between a bunch of players in this gamenullsec pveing is hardly risk free
so the more people we coordinate with is now going to be the measuring stick of how much isk we should make seems largely irrelevant to meno i suppose there is some risk if your both careless enough to do it afk and honest enough not to be botting the danger of null sec is only in traveling via gates a risk virtually eliminated by being part of one of the big alliances and staying in home territory
you are right about the high sec numbers being inflated but its unclear that wormholes numbers are deflated many wormhole players keep at least one alt in their wormhole just incase they get podded rightso while the high sec numbers are very likely inflated and the null sec and low sec numbers are deflated its unclear whether the wormhole numbers are deflated or inflated due to that extra alt being kept there sure maybe not everyone in the corp has an alt there but many will the biggest difference between empire and wormholes is the lack of local yes wormholes need to be scanned but that is not a big deal the fact that wormholes can close and bounce you on another side of the universe is a pretty big deal too but you can see if its about to close the biggest difference is the no local so you have no way to tell what sort of numbers you may be up against going into a place with no local for pvp is just begging to get blobbed but if wormholes had local many more people would go there for pvpmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
you seem to be under the illusion that people choose to play in empire or wormholes based on the presence or absence of local people arent in empire because of local or in wormholes because of the absence of local
please if wormholes had local pvp would be decimated it would be impossible to plan any types of ops covertly people would dock up at the first sign of a stranger it would suck the life out of wormholes altogether it would become as safe as high sec sadly fortunately nothing that stupid would ever happen
are you naturally this thickheaded or are you just trolling its almost like i havent said that hisec incursions could easily do with a nerf to payouts and the only thing im definitely arguing against is the complete removal of hisec incursionsdoesnt even need to do it afk to lose a ship all it takes is not watching the intel channels and a few seconds of not noticing redsneuts in local if youre unlucky
unless you can reliably stick an empty velator anywhere in a system over an extended period of time and not get podded then its not going to be as safe as hisec safer than now yes but not as safe as hisec thats taking it too far
no this is a terrible idea and if there was a 1 option id be hammering that the tears over cloaks is ridiculous it doesnt need a counter because it counters itself by making the pilot incapable of actually doing anything
except it doesnt prevent them from running around and choosing juicy targets which is a fairly nice advantage to have
which could be why you have to train cloaking to iv and fly special ships to do it
the only reason you can do that in high sec is basically because no one cares about a free noob ship floating around out there its not worth getting concordokken over in a wormhole thats a target of opportunity either someone that doesnt belong there or someone that you want to remove for control purposes although with those damnable cloak breaking probes you probably could leave a velator parked somewhere as long as you had people manning the probes would become required and keeping the cloakie on the run if one should show up so yeah those probes would effectively make wormholes nearly as safe as high sec
no itd still be more dangerous than nullsec
nearly as safe as high sec and more dangerous than null secyou seem to be coming around that null sec is already safe enough without nerfing it further by breaking cloaks its already quite clear that being able to scan down a cloaked vessel would make wormholes incredibly safe places to live no one would ever have a chance to be in a hole long enough to hunt a random target gather intel in preparation for an op anything wormhole pvp would die
its wh  nullsec  lowsec  hisec theres no way whs can get even close to hisec by that minor changeas to cloaks id find it hilarious if cloaks consumed some sort of fuel if just to make staying cloaked in a single system for a few days in a row actually require effort but im way more interested in shooting down awful suggestions thatd completely  over the precarious balance that determines the nullsec population
minor minor you really need to start paying attention or at least learning the game a little before you go blathering on about thingslets state it again not that youll actually pay attentionif you could scan cloaked ships down with probes for example these would become required items in wormholes it would become one of the first things you do when logging on when anything is happening etc to have these probes out looking for cloaked vessels much like its common practice to keep a skynet of probes out looking for new k162s that may appear so whats this mean if someone comes or is in your hole cloaked you get a ping that theres a cloaked ship somewhere the relentless hunting begins you begin to attempt to scan him down continually and if youre trying to protect your hole you never stop until hes either caught or leaves period you coordinate with someone else if required who has combats out in case he logs you go for the quick hit and kill it would become impossible to be in a hole with the intent of preparing for an invasion for example you couldnt stay in there to scan the opening for a fleet you couldnt park off the pos and gather intel it would become ungodly easy to lock the system down to any unwanted visitors that you would decimate wormhole pvp completely breaking the systemodds are that you wont admit to understanding this goons troll after all if thats youre game youre playing it well btw but others understand ccp certainly does as well
sigh its a minor change just like remove local or remove cloaked ships from local is a minor change its not something ccp could spend months on implementing unless theyre totally hopelessly incompetenti know perfectly well what the impact of that change is and its still not getting anywhere near hisecsafe
i do not think you know what you think you know
i know i know more than you think i think i know
wormholes have so little pvp as it is if they were completey removed it wouldnt decimate pvppeople who pvp know that when local is full of a targets friendlys if they attack that target they will get blobbed so not allot of pvp happens in those systems unless people are dumb or new when you see very few in local or about your numbers you know you have a good chance of a good fight so lots of fights happen that way thats why you see so much pvp in low sec and null sec compared to wormholeswhen you have no local you are just asking to get ganked and indeed the number of ganks versus gfs from wormholes far outstips those numbers in null or low sec that is why allot of pvpers dont go into wormholes i never said allot people go into wormholes because there is no local i am saying the opposite many people dont go into wormholes because it has no local there are plenty of good reasons to go into wormholes you can make more isk as a carebear than pretty much anywhere in game you are relatvively safe since there is relatively little pvp there many of the people in wormholes have very little pvp experience so it should supply kills you can do industry etc given the amont of isk ccp throws at wormholes you would think about 35 of the player base would be there but its not the biggest difference between wormholes and every other area of space is no local yes wormholes can close and move but that is not that big of a deal because you can tell when it is about to collapse the biggest problem for pvpers is when you go in and attack someone its a complete crap shoot as to whether you are going to get blobbed its like flipping a coin who will get blobbed you or the other guy imo coin flipping isnt really a fun game make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
nice brostash you got going on there kinda creepy you look like the sort parents wont let their children nearsummary of eves last four expansions
you mean like this proposalget out
hear heari agree completely lets get back to our grass roots and bring back the issues that really matterlolsummary of eves last four expansions
have to agree with drake and danika on this one its hardly fair that not every system is within 1 jump of a major trade hub or they are not close to an ice belt i could go on and on with this but i think you get the pictureits not really a problem and if any change is made because of this where does it stopits not that much of an issue to fly to a system to redeem your lp just as it isnt that much of an imposition to fly to a major hub to sell things thats life i am afraidstrongly disagree with this proposal
this proposal which i believe is a reasonable and practicable proposition is not really about the inconvenience of travelling 15 jumps to visit a concord station it is about equity and equality to reiterate there is a big imbalance in the spread of concord stations metropolis has 9 while two whole regions like tash murkon and amarr have not one between them every high  sec region has at least one trade hub its inhabitants can access within its space is it it too much to ask that tash murkon and amarr also have at least 1 concord station apieceas for this current proposal where does it end when the residents of tash murkon and amarr have access to concord stations within their own regions as for anyone else having access to concord stations there more than welcome to join this lobby  i hope more people will come on board and give their support for this proposal
