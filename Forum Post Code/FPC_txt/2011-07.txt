suggestions1 can we have a way to earn aurim in game  via doing loyalty faction perhaps2 can we have a lottery in the noble exchange on a regional basis with a chance to win either aurim or store fashionsexchange itemsthats all
i support of course and ccp must understand the quality is the most important thing for us more free to play methods aurum and shiny stupidities are dangerous for the spirit of the game we want a game with a strong and nice back story a world complex and interesting i dont care about facilities agent without quality and differencies incursions randomized i dont pay each month for a monocle publicities and pants whitch cost more than two month of gaming sorry for my english  i hope a french traduction of the client but no matter about that

cosmetic onlybut only if the gear is player made like in second lifemaking me turn into a 3d model forcing me to wear clothes and then asking me to pay 15 to a dev who has already been paid to make a cool shirt that should have been included from the beginning of your wacky 3d model idea is pretty lameseriously we were fine with a crappy portrait and spinning our ships

nomicrotransactions are going to destroy eve as we know it if ccp decides to implement it
no i dont support this madnessno to microtransactions keep eve awesome
cosmetic onlyid also be for very restricted concierge services like recovering horrible faction standing not to go above 00 effective with perfect skills and with a long cooldown timer as to when you can do something like that again again
cosmetic only
want to see my ship and have easy access to cargohold not a door 1
i care not for spinning my ship but the lack of functions while docked right now is horrible no double clicking to open cargo right clicking to open drone bay etc everything just takes so much more timeso 1

1 thats how it should have been done off the bat
love it
im commander shepard and this is my favourite idea on the forum
1incarna must be more fondamental eve isnt a free to play or a new game without history communities and spirit i hope ccp will open his eyes in a better way for us
supportedvery thoroughly drafted idea this would be an ideal solution and i might actually use cq if this was to be implemented
agreed would show off not only the concept of a capusleer but the lovely internal station environments that we have gotten to love and are now foggy and washed out yes needed to showe scale but why waste any of this games beautysupported
awesome idea the cq makes no freaken sense
1totally agree with this a great idea it offers a lot more immersion into eden
1100 ok i hope the csm and ccp read this proposal eve isnt a free to play game without background and stories too much mistakes for this 13th update i want an immersion not a new incarnation
1couldnt agree more on this topic
1 iff cutscenes are optional
incarna is a dangerous way for eve online i hope ccp can change now to survive in this way of excellence we love eve online isnt a game with possibilities of free to play methods with monocle which cost more of two month of playing without listening the community and background stories please dont break all the world you made possible 1 for new eden 1 for slogan of ccp  excellence 1 because in fact excellence is sacrificed time and time again to the big god of the release schedule and new features
i would support it providing that it was limited to once a year like attribute remapsor something similarthere was a fee attached to the service similar to that of character transfer fee also there should be a way of looking to see what the original character name was eg formerly whateverstupidnamewas in character info somewhere this way people would be able to change theyre names while not being able to shake off bad character reputations for example someone who is a corp thiefscammer cant go change their character name to clear bad rep
supportedperhaps the players prior identity should not be attached eve is about risk and neutering it would water that down the victory of hydra reloadedoutcast bore that out during this years tournament  in terms of confusion over them roleplaying as two alliances instead of one and their victory was accepted by the contest as a sound one for accomplished eve robbers i suppose that a name change might be the equivalent of getting a fake id launching them into a new life of crime somewhere for other players name changes could enable them to vanish into witness protection far away from whoever is tormenting them scary stuff i wouldnt trust anyoneactually a mischievous idea that might be amusing could be to have new namesidentities expire after 6 months reverting the player back to hisher original name it could be the equivalent of finding an infiltrator in your midst ive been watching too many thrillers psapph
i like this

yes a
for nonactivated accounts over a year old  sure
implement thats a couple of sql queries to purge the accounts and to clean up the associated data afterwards
if those players have interacted with others  contracts  kill mails  there will be broken links in the databaseeg you killed a trial account player and got a kill mail to himherccp deletes the players recordyou kill mail is now broken because it point to a victim who no longer existsi support renaming them to caldariamarrminmatargaylentte citizen  though
sounds good
1 for trial account only older that six month
should be no more difficult that if the character was biomassd
trial accounts only yes but perhaps a time frame longer than six months
yes trials only
its actually an implant if you read the description you can see it on the nonphotoshopped pictures of the avatars wearing them as well
the problem with implants surviving the destruction of the pod would be the damage it would do to the market however i would support something like upgrading the pod to be able to survive a volley or two for a price id est capsule modules

1yes please i do not need my eyes drawn to the station services where the nex store happens to be manipulative p
its a different color so it stands out hey look at me im shiny its blue cause spending money is soothing and cooool like blue instead of red and mad or green to remind you of usd
supportedthis is just another small thing about incarna that smacks of being forcefed bull i dont want to be directly reminded of the aur relation every time i open my wallet
down with the microtransactions
supported
get rid of itits annoying as hell to open up your wallet and see a tacky secondary currencythis whole story just makes eve and ccp look cheap
i dont see why we need aur as aur is made by converting a plex a plex is bought with real money or isk so isk  aur adding aur just wastes development time on adding a new currency which doesnt matter
yes
agreed living in the dark for months on end is fine for people in the arctic circle but we are paying for this game
up
signed cose i want to know aswell
wrong you misinterpret my messagei said that since they do not care the rest who do care should be heard and heededwhy because eve is a deliberately democratic society and that is an officially stated goal of ccpso please read the csm white paper written by ccp before attempting to argue why the opinions of the csm whose role it is to represent the playerbase should not have their highest priority requests met of which mt is one of thosethe council of stellar management  implementation of deliberative democratically elected council in eveplease run for csm election membership before arguing that our player elected council do not hold the opinion of the playerbase at largetheir vote counts because ccp said it does again i refer above linked documentplease show data that supports an overwhelming opposition to the views of the csm who were voted for by and thus represent the playerbasewrongbut first off i do support vanitymt and plex because that revenue supports ccps development and running costs and provides further profit but youre wrong in saying ill continue to support them regardlessi have unsubscribed all three of my accounts one of which has already expired and they will remain that way until ccp clarify their stated promise to never have nonvanity mt many others have also unsubscribed or are planning to when ccp make the wrong decisionkeeping tally of unsubbed playersif you understood the history of eve online well enough you might understand the educated opinion yes i mean opinion until and unless proof arrives that the launch of cq may in fact have been the day that eve online diedthis opinion might be wrong and i do truly hope for the sake of ccps several hundred employees in something like 4 different countries that ccp does survive and prospers but i certainly wont be funding a game that was converted from a subbased to mtbased business modelccp can still restore their trust and respect with the playerbase
i would be completely against this it would destroy one of the main hooks that keep a lot of the older players in the game wreck the character bizarre making everyones toons worthless and also bring about further ingame advantage for those that can payplex allready does that also new players should have to work their way up in eve and learn to play the game id be all for upping the starting xp to say 5 mil but the idea of someone just starting out and with enough plexaurum be able to fly the likes or a carrier in a week would just be gamebreaking and would destroy any immersive effect the game has to offer
i have been thinking for a long time now that eve should have game mechanics that explicitly award the player with small yet noticable amounts of sp simply for playing the game since at the moment players who actually play get only the same spgeneration capabilities as subscribers who only logon to change skillsto clarify timebased sp generation should continue in its current form but you should also get bonus sp for actually playing the game not sitting around in a station mind you but for killing pirates participating in the eve economy researching and invention with bps mining performing exploration tasks taking part in incursions etc etc etc in a fashion not too dissimilar to many other popular mmosit would take a bit of work to perfect so it wasnt too easy to game it for excessive boosting maybe include a system of diminishedboostingresults but i think a good balance could be achievedthis would have to be a free addition to game mechanics with no mt involved that way the old and new players get the best of both worldsyoud be not only encouraged to play more often and i suspect active players tend to encourage their friends to play too more so than inactive players but the new players can feel like their actions are boosting their growth while logged on thus can get into battleships faster for example but sps continue to generate as usual even while logged off the old bittervets loyal long term paying members who made eve what it is get to maintain their spstatus for as long as they remain subbed and play the game and they would get spboosts just like everyone else keeping it fairi suspect the biggest turnoff for new players is the raw rl time it takes to be able to do bigger and better things but playing the game could and possibly should boost the rate at which you grow just without the growth ending when you log off like with lesser mmosi dont know if this has been suggested before so i apologise if such a mechanic has been debated and shotdown previously
no no nononoonononoonononon way no big spoiler
initially your rage prevented you from following reason now your zeal is messing with your comprehensive reading skills how else can one explain that my whether ccp will sell sp or not is magically read by you as they will indeed sell sp since you are basing your entire argument on that paper let me be the first to tell you albeit belated that the csm has been a farce from day 1i as many others have been with eve long before the csm even came about and every single decision ccp made that the csm opposed was implemented anyway so please you can keep dreaming of the csm playing any role in the decision making process at ccp but thats all it is a dream nevermind the fact that again the overwhelming majority of the playerbase does not even care about the csm as reflected by total vote countputting some paper ccp wrote front and center is an appeal to authority which is a logical fallacy you want to make an argument then make it citing some meaningless whitepaper doesnt support your causejust loldo you know how many people posted omgwtfbbq 14 accounts unsubbed when the mom nerf came through what about the carrier nerf what about all the other nerfs over time where hordes of players raged on the forums for a whole week how many hundreds and thousands of accounts unsubbed yet here we are and the concurrent player count has been stable over time talk is cheap biomassing isnt there is no viable alternative to eve if one wants to keep playing a game like it which is why all the ragers will continue to payhollower words have never been spoken they dont need your trust or respect they only need your money which you will continue to give them eve is a service just like any other service you consume on a daily basis do you trust and respect your utility company or do you simply take what they provide and pay for it what about your isp i am sure at the very least half the readership has a ty opinion of their isp or cell provider no trust and no respect yet they keep paying so please idealism has no place in the real world
thankyou you made my point precisely since if ccp continue to state black and white policy and promises yet continue not to honor those promises then they will lose supporters like myselfthats why the csm paper is fundamental to the point of the argument they say one thing yet appear to be doing another it would be fine with an unreleased game but not for one that has an 8 year old historywrong yet again it is your words that couldnt be hollowerbut allow me to reference the alleged words of ccp hilmar i can tell you that this is one of the moments where we look at what our players do and less of what they sayso there you have itas stated i have made my action and that was to unsubscribe my accounts those accounts will remain that way if ccp dont come through with an official statement to uphold or reenforce their promises regarding mt and as soon as they do theyll get my money again and sure if they then go away and break promises yet again anyway theyll just have to test out what the consequences are which hopefully for their employees is to survive and make big profits theres no denying that theres a risk to be tested thougha relationship is a two way street when one party breaks the bond the other party loses interest the concept is fairly simple so im not sure why youre so convinced that i and many others will continue to give money to a company that doesnt have our interests at heart ill just go play another game that suits my playstyle betterit is only fair to allow ccp the chance to restore their respect and trust with usi can tell you that this is one of the moments where we look at what ccp do and less of what they say
we all know what you were implying you can not hide behind your intentions it just doesnt work your little clause whether ccp will sell sp or not does not overshadow the intent of your threadsorry chump but bull siht doesnt get by on these forums often dont whine when you get called on it
so thats400 x 15 dollars6000 dollars it sounds like a lot but its not not when players are paying for two or three accounts at once i could make that money in about four or five months at my current pay ratebesides the impact on the game where everyone would be flying an officer fit supercarrier what would be the point in playing anymorewe work hard us players to move forwards in the game get used to it or harden the  up
i am convinced that most people who say on the forum that they cancelled their accounts are not in fact going to quit the game because history has shown this to be true over years there were multiple higher profile outrage events with the forum filled with ragequit posts yet the concurrent player count shows that there were no massquittings so either the posters were lying or the server stats arei wasnt implying anything i was making my point that your 15month will be used to get me my microtransactions whether you like it or not this is independent of whether sp will be offered other mt items will be offered and it is inevitable that some of those items will be nonvanity items the writing is on the wall and your money will pay for it
lol look at you tempting to taunt and weasel your way out of your own thread grow up your 15month will also pay for microtransactions and so long as it stays just vanity and is economy neutral it doesnt bother me so please keep bleating and squirming around
proof that the majority is for mt and its good for ccp 20 of the playerbase are statitistically rich and ready to pay for this service those who unsubscribe and even quit are max also 20 of the playerbase so the rich players will compensate the leaving of poor its like a train wich had only 2nd class waggons and now have 12 first class waggons and the big rest 60  of the playerbase  some of them about 5  will spent extra money from time to time for comfort to feel special in game so even in this horrific scenario should 20 of players quit ccp would still make more profit i for myself would gladly appreciate sp for plex or aurum to those who think they will loose somehow because of it get a life spent more time in rl get a education and good job and then you can also be special
100 of morlidots22 got their umbilical cord wrapped around their neck during childbirth causing severe oxygen deprivationsee i can make up numbers too but at least i quoted some evidence to back mine up
i am not against mt in eve to a certain extent but this is a horrid idea that would be dangerous to eve a game you have to pay to play already this kind of mt could kill eve unlike selling vanity items
the only thing it proves is that you can type the word proof now lets see if you can figure out what the word means
well ive moved past 140m sp and i tell you its not about skill points you dont win eve with skill points they arent that importantif someone wants them bad enough sure let them buy them the joke is on them really its just like someone buying a bunch of plex to sell for isk and get a pretrained account sure they will have a lot of skill points but no clue what to do with them
exactly i totally agree sp limits are their to restrict your ship type and modules but once you can fly a ship with the right modules then the real learning and mistakes come in i today bought a rapier pvp fit falcon and dramiel and ill be enjoying piping in the with my corp over the next few daysweeks trying to learn how to fly them and enjoy them but right now i have no clue and expect to loose them in short order when not in a bigger gang having sp doesnt ruin the game it opens it up there are always more things to train and perfect most people just want to enjoy playing eve how fast and at whatever pace they want and we should let them
i really do think that you need to work on your reading comprehension skillsjust for you since me making this topic didnt give it away for you i wholeheartedly support microtransactions thus i will happily pay my 15mo to support their development and introductionwhat amuses me is that your angry 15mo will support mt and where mt is headed as well even though you dont want that even if you quit eve the microtransactions are here to stay which will be good for me regardless
and its time for the ccp holders to sell their children and a kidneyo7
this thread is probably so interesting to read due to humpinks reasoning abilitiesit frames the picture of a viking warrior beating through waves of unshaven middlelowerclass workers however the warrior is starting to lose sight of his edge as wellall jokes aside however it is clear to anyone that spent time reading and thinking about this topic to conclude that those in favour reason with logic and those against reason with the uncertain futureas perceived in history if ccp does implement it it is to secure their survival and therefore the survival of eve all the naysayers may do as they please but eve will never implement anything to cause its demise no matter how vocal the forum isif they dont which suggests their intention in keeping the current loyal subbers that is convinced paying for a skill to train is good gameplay which creates a decent bond of attachment in the end that solution seems more stable too than the burst of sp purchase cashthere is absolutely no reason to theorycraft the doom of markets imbalance of combat due to new potent spwise pilots or any ripples of such whatever is implemented players who love this game enough will adjust and so will the sandbox all we need now is time which may or may not be a key point of this topic
op is clearly a trollif this 2003 player was such a proud supporter of mts he probably wouldnt post on his 1 month old alt as usual a surefire way to determine just how full of bull a poster isa second indicator if he was so happy with the current mts he would have a monocleso even if this wouldbe troll does in fact like mts he had to realize to his dismay that he cannot buy eve status with rl money he just gets flamed for wearing nex  in a spaceship game so now he wants to buy something that gives an actual advantage and voilUFFFD skillpoints are an integral part of gameplay cant lose them either winwinand yes clearly it adds to my entertainment if more virtual goods are sold on eve in fact lets disable skill training altogether until people pay 1000 aurumday to activate it would make my gameplay so much more enjoyableor and this is a really revolutionary approach perhaps moronic trolls should just stfu
youve no room to speak of reading comprehension skills it is your defense when someone manipulates your words but when you want to manipulate the words of another it is all fair game anyone can read through this thread and watch your behaviortoo bad you no mts rl huh then maybe you could buy up some karama points
lets think about this lets disregard the fact that the forums largely exist in their current state because people are able to post with their altsanyone who has been actively playing the game for several years is likely deeply invested in the social aspect of the game and revealing the true identity of ones main character is ill advised because the perceived status long term contributions to a corp or alliance created could be severely compromisedits a bit like leading the war on drugs for years and then come out and say that you are a pothead who does blow every night thats just not advisable if one values the relationships one has established over the yearsother than that attacking the person because you dont like the idea is a logical fallacy you want to argue the point then do so whom the idea is coming from is irrelevant to the discussionthat in itself is a reasonable argument however from my personal perspective vanity mt dont excite me i know lots of people will buy cloths or skins for their ships or whatnot but to me those items do not carry a value proposition what do i gain by buying a monocle nothing yes the character looks different but so what to me thats irrelevant when i was forced to go through carbon character creation i clicked the random generator a couple three times till i saw something that wasnt hideous and moved oni will spend money if it buys me time because i value time i dont value looksi dont want to buy status i want to give money to receive time because time is my most valuable and very finite assetthat line of reasoning that makes it impossible to take your arguments seriously no one is talking about disabling skill training you are trying to go to some extreme to invoke an emotional response in the readership which incidentally is exactly what trolls dothe sale of virtual goods can can doesnt have to add to your entertainment value if it results in more people joining eve for you to play with or to shoot at if you are a pvperbeing opposed to nonvanity mt is a bit like being opposed to buying bread because at the end of the day you really didnt earn the bread you didnt plow the field didnt buy the seeds didnt tend to the crop didnt harvest it didnt mill the grain didnt fire the oven didnt kneed the dough you merely cheated your way to some bread by exchanging money for it
so you are a selfproclaimed hypocrite alright then next
i was about to say
still i support this or at least some thought in this direction
wont work in the current market wait for eve to evolve more
this is a very intresting idea but a old oneit should be possible with current gamemechanics to implement such a marketbut alot of companies should change there strategy value of a share should be assigned by real value of assetsfor instancemoney  50 of its valueassets in lockdown  100 of its valueassets not in lockdown  80 of its valuemineral  80 of its valuevalue is determed on market average this way shares wil go up or down due to the market and adding of new assets to the share corporationworking with a poolsystem wil get this to work bettercorporation wil own there part of the sharesthe poolsystem wil have the rest of the sharesplayers can buy from the pool or from other playersbuy shares  110 of valuesell shares  80 of value tax depending on skills betwean 5 and 10 money sinki will post a compleet worked out version of this system sooni have reason to markup the current prices this to do with market fluxuations and giving the corporation some breathroomgreets and regardsrodrom caldera
sounds nice yes please
i agree that there should be a system in place that allows for the value to fluctuate however i think the value of shares should rely on more than just iskassets of the corporation the value should also rely on the actions of the corporation and its members if a corporation defeats a corporate competitor in a skirmish for example this should be reflected just a thought
yes i understand but how is the game mechanics able to read these achievements and how would this relate to the shares share  real value achievement  nothing investors are intrested in only 1 thing profit that it easy as piebut to trow you a ball how would you see this happening
while i really hate docked war targets there are ways to get them out it includes not actually being in their system smack talking them in localyour idea is horrible ive heard worse ones but they involved committing felonies on goatsstation fighting is fail eve could perhaps fix it by changing the docking timer to 2 minutes that might fix it or it might make people even less likely to fight could go either way
wasting your time are they forcing you to sit outside the station and wait for them to undock while theyre afk youre wasting your own time if theyre playing docking games why dont you just ignore them no this means you have people in your corp that are stupidhowever i do recall what it was like back in the day when i was a newbie and my player corp got war decd by griefers and i felt that the system was flawed something does need to be done and as mentioned in another reply  something as simple as increasing the aggression cooldown by another minute would help i think
as another poster said the issue you raise isnt really about high sec war its about station games in general your proposal goes a bit too far in my view longer aggression timers might help but could also have unintended consequences such as  you shoot at a can flipper while mining and now you cant dock for 15 minutes as for high sec wars your missioners and miners can avoid being killed fairly easily move to a system far away keep your watch list up to date and watch local a fair fight against your wts is just not going to happen unless they want one
hmm no love for this idea my thinking was they fight like guerillas so this might fit i guess notits good to see that others are not happy with docking games though this is a broken aspect of eve across the gameas far as the stupid people being stupid yeah thats correct but they are no longer members of the corp i fly with they got kicked for being stupid but still damage is done and the aggressors have all the reason to keep looking for moreand you cant make people undock not with smack talk i know our wt use alts to know whats coming they arent stupid
play approach find a corp that has a pos in high sec then wardec them and then bring out the max dps ships and take out the tower
highsec war is for people who dont know how to pvp and in reality wars in highsec should have their cost increasedwanna make highsec war interesting make is cost lots more then the current no more herp u were random corp 207 u get war deccedwars will take planning calculation and risk
attempt at making high sec war more interestingsimple move to hisec and do it for real
oh god yes i was thinking this yesterday while salvagingneed either a module skill bonus to ship but we need it a noctis is a ship made for this purpose as much i love having one and thanks ccp in finally getting round to making it it feels like it isnt finished without such an option
you would still have to go fetch your noctis and fly to mission areastep currently1target each wreck2tractor each wreck3loot wreck involves open a can selecting all and dragging4salvage wreck5repeatsuggestion effect1 target each wreck2 tractor each wreck3 salvage each wreck4 repeatit only cuts out the open wreck select all drag drop sectionif there is huge botting exploit i am missing sorry explain if you love open 40 wrecks and select all drag and drop dont support it the suggestionnow if you have constructive criticism ill listen but driving down salvage prices is bulli dont have to loot to salvage so wont affect salvage the only thing it will affect is sub tech ii module prices perhaps and perhaps mineral market which could use a shot in the arm after ccp clamp down on botscheerslowkey
an even better solution imo would be if it was possible to assign keyboard hotkeys for quickly opening a wreckcontainer and moving the contents to your ships cargo hold select the wreck press your loot all hotkey and then your salvager hotkey
1 yer lazy i hope they take away the f keys so you have to actually click on each wreck from now on2 my 2nd fav pastime in eve 1st bein tryin to learn how to better asplode people is noctisisingit should take some work to do or do you wanna bot like all those effing miners who afk mine3 actually i do hope they make your noctis but only yours do as you ask so one day you start in on some wrecks and a few what dont belong to you are there and pop you get concordokkened lemme know where ya are and ill pop over and salv yer wreckwhy do so many want to make things so easy they are no longer fun and worth doing lazy lazy lazyi love the new turret effects on the noccy btw
ah something i fer got to addi want combat drones on my noctisbut what i really want is salvager drones and tractor dronesinstead of worryin about three little clicks how about a l4 or sleeper wreck field that extends for over 100km squat yer noccy down in the middle and as you start in on the one you can reach you send yer tractor drones to the ones out of range to drag in all those yummy wrecks and salvager bots to salvage the wrecks as dont have any loot but are out of range like mining drones they bring back the salvage and drop it in your holdnow that ill back
wow paying extra for content i thought that was what the 15 a month per account was foryou sir need to have your posting license revoked i am sure however you would probably be willing to buy it back with some aur
that sir will make eve a bling game no way i will support that go play wow or lineage facebooks no end game games have content to buy go ahead
i wouldnt totally be against it were it implemented since the big nullsec corps have huge isk wallets theyll have a considerable influence over the game should they choose to leverage it which concerns me slightly
read the article failing to find a single thing i didnt agree with you have my voteif anything im votting on this hoping that it will show ccp how much people are unhappy with the changes recently made and the changes people have been asking to be made for the last god knows how long
hiworld of eve is becoming older and older each day almost everybody i know are now flying at least on battleships some are on caps already in 00 i see not so much diversity for instance in battleship class it is an abbadon or tempest as a pvp machines i want to propose a game mechanics concept to make our space and world of eve more diversewe all know that players have sp you can reach it only by lifetime in eve passive or active this is actually a pilot sp not so much connected to a certain ship this pilot fliesin real life we all get quite adopted to cars as drivers in time we get so familiar with the car that we drive faster park faster strafe better and our way of driving can become much more agressive or safethis is not so much working in eve though if a titan pilot is changing his ship to a t1 frigate even after 1 year of not flying frigate he is actually quite same level at shooting things as he was 1 year ago if we go further and compare one guy who flew a frigate 5 years and a guy with just same skills as the first one there would be a draw if they fight each other if modules frigs and timing of 1st shoot and lock is samenow i propose to add up new mechanics  experience in a ship flewn where pilot will have an experience table for each and all ships in evefor instancepilot bob has sp 40 000flewn ships experience1 crow 1200 hours2 heron 300 hours3 raven 200 hours4 badger 190 hoursetcwhats the pointeach flewn hour or several hours days etc should have some influence on the ship and pilot stats with the particular ship he flies the more pilot flies in his favourite badger the more experienced and familier he becomes with that ship and the more ship becomes efficientconsequencesa frigate lover will be a pain in the ass to a dreadnaught newbie or a battleship newbiei never proposed here actual stats change and even stats itself that should be affected by pilot experience with the ship i leave this for open discussion here and to devsi would like to have feedback on my proposal
all that needs to be done is an introduction of ship crews that gain experience as the ship they are bound to is used
people will totally not farm experience 237 by just sitting in a pos as day
already implemented at player levelyou know a ship and how it works and how you can use it by actually using it simple as thatto give you a clearer idea of what i mean  a new player who purchased an old char will never understand all mechanics behind what defensive ofensive capabilities ewar of the ships he can use with his newly purchased avatar without experience experience of the player gives you an edge or a handicap over same sp player who has a similar character in skill points and chosen skills eve is all about hard work ships already perform alot by how much a player understands them
flewn is not a word
good for rp 1
a long overdue changecould possibly call it graduation date
long overdue really
i like it
makes sense
re bathroom as i said just for fun not a serious request and yes there are text cues fr what ship but its just not the same nor anywhere near as satisfyingi do hope the watchin holov in the cq gets added but i aint holding my breathand i still hope ccp hasnt gone off the rails greedwise well see they intro paytowin and thereby let in hordes of children and i will unsub faster than you can rage quit in jita for 1 isktura 
anything like what i proposed would be a great help to ceos  directors
1 im aggree and support this proposal incarna can be the death of eve online but with intelligence we can assure a better future cant they no aurum no free to play methods but an incarna we all need thats it
it would be very exiting if we were able to control joint movement on our avatars so we can choreograph a dance and also be able to sell to other characters for isk so they can inject the information to their desired character like a skill book and other things like designing how you walk on station with stile
are they adding fences with gates
so i can have my character walk like this rather than his current excessive swagger
no one click cargono drag ship outside box to make it activegame results being taking longer to do basic tasksfirstly we need to know if this is a bug or the idea personally i think its done on purpose either because they havent gotten round to doing it or do not intend to which is silly why should the same action not only take longer but be more complicatedthis needs to be looked into
yes going from two clicks to three has accentuated the clickfest nature of this task
we should be able to allow anyone into our fleets from fleet finder yes people might think this is silly but thats surely our choice even if we let reds join i might want to let ppl in my system help fight some hostiles that have entered they have no standings but just want to kill something i might want to set up a roam with anyone whos interestedyes i know they might shoot us and something like that but still its my choice
no i dont want to open my fleet finder and see hundreds of fleets from people i dont know as it is i often see fleets for mining ops  which i may have once used to get a target for suicide ganking
capitals should look likem capitals and not been dwarfed by a bs
i couldnt agree more make them much larger
let me see if i understand you correctly you want banned players assets being put on the market how will that create a larger isk sink than the assets being frozen
it would be more of an isk sink because the npc auction would take the isk from players bidding on the items and throw it into the void the money would leave the game completely which creates a true isk sink
assets on banned accounts are effectively removed from the economy thus your proposal is less of on iskasset sink and thus bad
youve exchanged isk for something of equal value which can still be traded thats not an isk sink
not quite correct it would be an isk sink but perhaps not a wealth sink the isk indeed gets tossed into the void but additional value wealth the stuff from the banned account is added into the sandboxi neither support or oppose this just clarification of what is being proposed
sounds reasonable perhaps adding an additional moniker would help avoid typos such as 10 m or 10m and not 10m the  pipe or a space seem a bit more deliberate on the part of the user
this sums it up pretty damn well
i dont mind the neural remaps either  as a noob i messed mine up p very keen to get plex out of the game too since its a way to buy ingame military benefit and pretrained high faction characters with real world cash ughis there any chance of them selling small run clothing blueprints or cq furniture blueprints in the exchangesapph
because ya knowfinding faction poses and stuff thatre offline is annoyini want free iskies 
agreed with turrets
these issue were already brought up several weeks before launch after players tested it on sisiduality nothing happened there these are still changes that need to go through though
i just assumed they needed to pick one or the other in order to afford the marketing push new shooters have to have
more evidence csm is a joke
this csm sucks but they kinda ran on a platform of we suck but we have enough alliance members votes so  off kthxbye anyway so no surprise theretheir buying into the ccp meme that this was all a big miscommunication is where they reveal their ignorancenaivetUFFFD the most weve had more clear direct transparent if involuntary communication from ccp in the last 2 weeks than weve had in the last 25 years that ive been playing thats what precipitated the outrageccp doesnt care how ty they make eve or what commitments theyve made in the past they see their customers as a golden goose and will do everything and anything to squeeze every last cent out of usthis csm is ok with that as long as ccp works on stuff that benefits their alliances fair enough but they dont speak for the players they speak for their respective alliances
ccp must not have gotten through that fable to learn the moral odd seeing how short the book was
do you find yourself as a pvpcombat pilot with default mining or industry skills or perhaps you are a miner with default gunnery  turret skills i propose that a simple and slight change be made to the skill system that allows players to not only inject skills but to uninject skills as well once the uninject tab is selected a caution window should pop up to inform the player that the skill will be uninjected once the skill is deleted off the players skill sheet it will remain in a standby window for 24 hrs after 24 hrs the player can finalize the deletion similiar to character deletions players would not get back sp this would not change game play or affect the main game it would slim down jumbled skill sheets and decrease clone costs please comment
can you as a person unlearn how to ride a bike drive a car how about make a sandwich clones dont cost that much and you shoulda planned better while training your character
welcome to eve you must be new herebecause this topic has been beaten to death harder than a fatman running into a brick wall
id like to make the point that some of us are excited about what we have right now you have to see the potential and not what it is right now i feel alot more connected to my character then i was before and i know alot of new people looking at the game will like it much better like before incarna how many people have you told about eve online and once you told them that you never leave your ship did they lose interest right now its small but soon you will see the whole grand experience just be patient it will come im not sure what the need besides just the roleplaying aspect will be in leaving your ship but i would highly suggest ccp to really brainstorm some ideas
seriouslyif you feel like that why not just stop playing eve and go on with your lifei dont see why people emorage over things that they dont need to get involved in if they dont want toi agree that the minute ccp makes it so that game mechanics get changed becouse of microtransactions its gonna kill the game but we are not there yetso why not put your virtual torches away for now and use them when and if they are neededseriously people ccp is a company and if they can increase their earnings ofcourse they will try and milk as much out of the playerbase as they can why wouldnt theyits not like they are holding a gun to your head and forcing you to throw your money at themchillmy 2 centsedit typos just to tired to type correct 
ccps hands weve been done for a while now 
care to put down a date when you all finally finished and handed it to ccp it would also be nice to know who did what when they started those minutes and when they finished themseems like you all ignored them for a couple weeks after the summit before starting on them procrastination is bad didnt you know just think if you guys had did them right after the summit like you should have the players would be more informed about the current situation perhapsam i wrong
it looks like some of the csm dont have time to mess around with this communication thing with the community too boring and beneath them i guess if it is a too big a chore or you dont want to dirty yourselves with communicating to the unwashed masses then resign and let an alternate csm member give it a tryyes we want minutes and a couple of weeks after the meeting not a couple of months
a few weeksif the community doesnt get something concrete within a day or two of the meeting there will be riots i dont think most people realize just how precarious the situation is
how many months from now before we can expect them maybe we will be into the next expansion can you tell us time in the measurement of monocle you know like for every 38 months equals a monocle so we can expect to see these minutes in four or five monocles
with all the recent events im even more interested in seeing what is being discussed the csm meeting minutes ceased with the end of the previous csm the iceland summit was a month and a half ago and still no minutes it seems we get more information from kugu than the eve website these days i cant imagine ccp is okay with this
as soon the csm member return home maybe this sunday night is possible to organize a new fireside chat to discussclarify the recent eve issuesthanks regards
sunday might be tough we will certainly have one at the latest by next weekend
and can we get a text transcript of it pleaseim getting a bit irked that noone from csm seems able to at least respond to the request from a deaf player to get the fireside chats in a format that i can usedo they not check the forumoh wait no theyd rather communicate through other channels
screw the fireside chat  post to jita park
i like the concept of fire side chatmaybe it would have to be after ccps press conference on tuesday though 
bring bak ship spinning cq should be optional
i think its pretty clear what the player base wants the csm to attempt in their upcoming meeting with ccp i wont add any more to that listi will add this viewpoint to the csm members although you have no real power with ccp you still wield a rather heavy club if you are brave enough to swing it if you are not given satisfying responses from ccp you can yell loudly about it to the community ccp may ban you from the game for doing so but thats where the bravery part comes in stay strong the community is counting on your not taking any crapslightly off topici dont know if anyone else has noticed the flaw in the logic of worn vanity items being destroyed when the character is podded before we undock our clones climb naked into a goofilled pod these clothes and other worn vanity items are left in our quartersjust sayingi do agree that ship skins would be destroyed
how long have yuo been playing this is eve causing the game server to lag because of protest against mt is the wrong way to ventget it in some forum threads that 2 of the community read lololo
handlebar mustaches are overrated if you cant make a monochrome avatar
this post is more relevant than ever to be honest
even if we have to pay more
1 buff gallente enough said on the topic for years now2 nerf autocannons autocannons are not only the weapon of choice on minmatar ships but also on most calgal turret hulls moreover they are preferrable on any amarr ship lacking a rofdamagerange bonus on lasers punisher maller prophecy  same base damage no cap usage at all compared to a laserfit tremendous advantage  even with controlled bursts v  maxed cap use bonuson the hull easier to fit better tracking free choice of damage typeop autocannons are also the reason behind the rifter being the most powerful frigate the rupture being completely out of line with any other t1 cruiser lowsec being canevagaland and all angel ships being ridiculously overpowered blasters should receive better tracking than acs because they simply cant track any of their supposed targets in their own optimal  not even megathrons with their tracking bonus due to their very limited range they should maintain the highest overall dps pulse lasers should do far more dps than acs  enormous pg requirements no choice in damage types insane cap usage which makes a cap consumption bonus on laserboats mandatory whereas minmatar ships have something useful like a rofspeed bonus instead wasnt it for scorch on zealots and abaddons the entire weponclass would be just as useless as blasters compared to acs hell  and even on abaddons you find projectiles just as often as lasershint have a look at the area under the curve in eft dps charts at different transversals whilst keeping all other ac advantages in mind3 nerf tier 2 bcs  they are dirt cheap especially after the introduction of different rig sizes and can be fitted to hold as much tank as some bs  moreover their effective dps often is better than that done by a bs due to better sigres and tracking on guns whilst being tremendously far mobile even losing the rigs on a bs costs more than losing two entirely fit bcs similary they pull even with most hacs at a fraction of the price4 buff large weapons see 3  outside of blob fights bs are hardly viable anymore especially after sniperfleets became obsolete since the introduction of easy instaprobing5 shorten siege cycle time on dreads to 5 mins increase scan res of locked targets and tracking whilst sieged
boost caldari capitals or make caldari viable in more than just drakeblobs and mission s seriously anyone who is competitive in null knows youre either amarr erebus or dead there is a reason that amarr is overrepresented in the nullsec communitycaldari carriers suck at life and making them cap stable is a sacrificial trickcaldari dreadnaughtsloldo low comparitive dps require ammo have less ehp and generally suck in most aspects even compared to the other dreadnotscaldari scis there actually a reason anyone would choose this over its counterparts seriouslycaldari titan  useless bc shield gangs are just drake blobsseriously though lower overall resists on shields lower pg capacity cap stability issues missiles lol lower total shield amount compared to armor and the lack of ability to tank and use mid slots make caldari lultastic for anything but missionsfvck even gallante have a head up on caldari in bscap area
proposal dedicate an entire patch to scrapping all the old ship statistics all of them and redoing everything from the ground upkeep the basics minmatar fast caldari slow use racial weapons already in use same with tanking but change everything armorshield hp speed agility sig radius bonuss everything all the way down to slots and pgcpu and balance it all do the same with the modulesmake it so that its combat only im tired of seeing the destroyers used as nothing but a beginners salvage boat
im sure the major issues have been repeated enough but i like to discuss effectiveness for pricemeaning if you are paying a certain amount of isk for a ship the result you get from that purchase should be relatively close to its counter parts only minor varying differences in style and module differentiation should be acceptablei mean whether in pve or pvp eve combat isnt as exactly reaction based when compared to other games like wows arena it is more planning knowledge and proper execution knowledge being the most effective so to balance each ship and module player skills nonsp wise shouldnt be as much of a factor relativelywhich brings on the ultimate point why dont everyone just rack money up and buy the best ship in its class for the highest isk well theres your balance issue right there whats the point of having crappier stuff no one is ever going to undock with how are you going to hard is ccp trying to balance diversity in the same classi dont know i sometimes fly a ship for the love of it decision to fly it regardless of what the chart or stats say i love the legion as much as man can love his internet space ship and hope to see it balanced with other tech 3s as a selfish point
prices are market driven and have nothing to do with performance most of the time but with availability and lpsprime example for that are those faction shuttles and a lot of those navy shipsi got myself a widow just because i love the paintjob on the new scorp hull and no other reasonbalancing stuff on a pricetag would make ship sales through the npc corps necessary and im dmn sure none of the ship builders especially t2 will ever want that
i presume youre all aware that1 this thread is over 7 months old2 the op has sold his character and semiragequit in protest3 ccp doesnt give a crap about your words only your actions countright
nullno
no
nolike one of ccp said its more important to look what people do instead of listening to what theyre saying or similar  that if 50 people buy monocles and 5000 slap you in the face for doing  this statement is absolutely stupidccp can earn more money by making the game more attractive for more players so they have no reason to be greedy and microtransactions are just cheap and nothing else you can buy yourself a flipping awesome computer in the real world and play the most advanced games on it but you can use a really bad computer with really advanced skills of your own to write a piece of software which could empower you do conquer the world
no
cosmetic onlywho knows one day i may want to paint my ship at least after ccp gives raven a new really awesome hull

1 maybe have a fee of 1 aur each time you decide to leave the pod so ccp is happy
yes
i fully support thisone should be able to choose between old hangar screen and the new cqfor those who like it the door can be included as well 
yeah only makes sense to have the station hanger and then exit to cq otherwise a big waste of time for a pilot in war or doing quick dock droppickup type operations which is most times the way we are i can see in the future of incarna the likelihood of spending more time in stations bars dancing girls games etc but even then the day to day functions are quick docking and undocking for mission ammo market drops and other quick business maybe i go to the cq while a blob sits outside have a drink and play the pacman table game hehehseriously the way it should be 1edit just realizing they said the hangar view will be put back in the new dev blog after csm meeting makes me happy  hopefully it will be done similar to what you say with the cutscenes though
hopefully ccp will consider this
1i was talking about it somewhere myself
10
a bigass 1 on this
this was one of the biggest issues i had with incarna and something that annoyed me immediately when i tried it on sisithe old hangar view needs to be returned not replaced with something of similar functionality
all for it both for the sake of immersion and that it was hell of a lot faster
10
i dont want and have never wanted to use incarnastation barbie crapi want a client like the one from 3 weeks ago a client that actually worksyou said it woudl be optional and now your ing about implementing something that could be easily sorted with a button to enter qc in the old station viewwhy didnt you add a button in the first placeare you really that dumb
1there is nothing to do in cq right now they should just revert to preincarna until they fix cq
1 with amendmentive argued elsewhere that forced decanting to change ammo is stupid as for old hanger back frankly i dont really want it back if an even fasterloading alternative with the same basic functionality can be created ship spinning
just sick and tired of things added which make this game too much like hard work docking session timer switching ships session timer undocking session timer was frustrating enough without this new crapolla station environment that adds more time to doing anything with your ship whats next geting dressed brushing teeth and eating breakfast before undocking
10
yup immersion should be at the core of everything
supported
the op makes an awful lot of sense and points out blazingly obvious flaws in ccps behaviour which is why it will never be fixed unless ccp is properly medicated 
10
they dont care and they wont do anything that benefits the players they will only work on stuff from now on that they think will bring ccp more money but sure have a 1 for the sake of what eve could be if ccp cared about it or us
1 definately finding names not already taken is hard enough make it easier remove the dead accounts 
just logged on the profile page of an old mmo i played and my char was still alive after 6 years
yes trials only
actually seems like a winwin situation freed up resources for ccp small as it may be and increased immersion of the player base into eve
helloattribute implants in slot 15 are the tools pretty much all of us use to maximize our training speed they are available in different pricings all from a couple of thousand up to 100mil isk each since your attributes are the only thing that affect your training speed alot of people want to use as good implants as they canhowever i think there is a flaw to this system that can be changed to improve gameplay to the better as it is now alot of people living in empire will buy the expensive 5 implants to maximize their training speed since living in empire tends to be relatively safe for your pod even though someone might bait or suicide your ship on the other side of the world you have the people living in 00wspace constantly risking getting stuck in a bubble where chanses of escaping with your pod intact is close to nill people living in 00 tend to avoid buying these 5 implants since the risk vs reward makes them a bad choisethis is to me an unfortunate situation for both the empire dwellers and the people living in nullsec the people in nullsec will not train at full speed while the people in empire is very unlikely to explore nullsec for a roam since its not worth jumpcloning out of my 5s for a 1 hour roam this leads to a situation where said players are very likely to never end up trying out pvp since the cost is too greati however have an idea in an early form that could tackle this please consider the following remove attribute enhancing implants completely thats right this would however leave a void that would need to be filled imagine that instead of having an implant use a temporary booster that increase said attribute instead said consumable would give an effect just as an implant with effects ranging from 1 to 5 but is persistant through death however said consumable would be temporary and last eg 1 week or 1 month i havent given duration much thought if a new consumable of the same type is used while time remains on the current one the extra time will be added to the total timethis will create an opportunity to implement another proffesion to eve see it as the legal side of the drug market one idea is to actually make these attribute enhancers use the same materials as boosters which will suddenly make this branch of manufacturing alot more interresting as demand would increase and gas harvesting might not be something even miners laugh atbut what should we do with implant slot 15 they are only there for the pirate implants baby said implant sets would lose their attribute bonus but players that previously wanted to own a low grade set but choosed not to due to the weak 2 attribute bonus are very likely to invest in these heck i will probably get a slave crystal and snake set if this was the caseso where does this leave us we will end up with a situation where the market is stimulated while attribute enhancers becomes a commodity built by players sold to players instead of being seeded into the game as mission rewards or sold in lp stores but ultimately it will let the nullsec dwellers train skills at max speed without having to worry about paying the cost multiple times compared to a person living in high sec at the same time the people living in high sec might be alot more willing to explore the universe and try pvp when they dont have to worry about losing implants worth several times more than the ship the fly and should they have expensive hardwirings in their main clone they are likely to be more willing to jump clone out of it as long as their skills wont train any slower
i rather like this idea it would be nice to finally not have to worry about losing my 4s so i can go on a roam whenever i want although more frequent jumpcloning would probably be easier still a thumbs up
10
spice mentat and mentats why not
i like this idea only problem i could see is compensating people with implants already plugged in especially the people who spent billions on pirate implants1
pirate implants could stay just remove the learning attribute function1
probably a good idea this stuff is just barrier to pvp and encourages ship spinning lately avatar spinning and doll dressing
i like the idea so it must be terrible
totally like the idea
10
i like it
ideally players should be able to build all ingame items if we cant have the ops idea give us bpos for all implants except the fancy crystal  omega  what have you ones
ppl living in jita will crash this idea
i love this idea i havnt used my expensive clone in months cause of pew pewing often the only downside i can see is just remembering when you need to update your weeklymonthly attribute enhancer injection but thats just lazy peoplemaybe keep the permanent implants and just implament these attribute enhancers also this will get the game back to being more pew pew orientated
love it 1 support
totally agree since they nerfed the jb system we have to jump through gates yup startgates sometimes theres even a bubble with some dudes on it and they kill me and my implants wtf1 out in null safe as in high
i dont personaly live in nullsec fact is my character logs off in jita even though i spend most of my active time roaming arround the world and if you cared about reading my entire post instead of breaking out pieces of it you would notice that i dont want to make eve norisk at all personally i would probably risk even more isk if this is implemented than i do now the only thing i want is that your characters progression should not be decided by where you choose to live
you could maybe ask to ccp to create boddy salvagerswhith those salvagers you could salvage implantparts from a dead body in station with special jovefacilities and then recreate new implants with the appropriate bpo  materials you salvaged coupled with some pi items to make pi even more used1 implants bpos 15mio isk2 implants bpos 30mio isk3 implants bpos 45mio isk4 implants bpos 60mio isk5 implants bpos 75mio iskso you could make a cheap set of bpos and make implants easier to generate and by then more implants on the market prices goes downmike aka psy
no longer will i have to stick with a cheap 3 set to go pewpew more isk to buy ships that dont suck 1
you cant force all the empire carebears out to null sec quite a few of them simply avoid it on principle at the same time i quite like the fact that when destroying someones pod i could potentially be wiping out billions of isk yes carebears may have their skills train faster than 00 pilots  however null sec ratting and null sec mining pull in isk vastly faster than running level 4 missions in empire space and mining in empire spacebecause of this most empire carebears never will actually get a full set of 5s because the cost is simply out of the question
10
why not have both a consumable and implants none stacking of course in the end  at least for highsec it be cheaper to live in 5s but nullsec can take consumables i like the idea but i think both would be better variety is good implants will be cheaper in the long run but if ur ganked ur sunk like now except with consumable option you get pvpers the ability to train at max speed without risking to much everytime they log in
i never said i wanted to force anyone into null i said that i wanted people to feel like they can do it if they want to without losing out on 24h of boosted training personally i go out anyway but i have several friends that will not do it because of thisone of my friends gave me a number stating that he pushed 100milh doing high sec lvl 4 missions this was before the buff where all agents were considered quality 20 and combat agents only giving combat missions i have personally ran high sec incursions scoring 100mil pure isk per hour not even counting the lpto beat these numbers in 00 you will need to run as pimped ships as you do in high sec but the risk is far greater and the majority will not do this claiming high sec dwellers not being able to afford 5s is pure bogus no one in eve no matter if he live in high low or null sec should have any problem affording a set of 5s if he actually tried to get them the difference as i have said several times is that the riskreward is not worth it to be perfectly honest a player who dont know how to come up with 400 mil for a set of 5s who wants charisma anyway no matter where he live is doing something seriously wrongedit and before someone points it out let me make it clear anyone can afford one 5 set keep buying them as you lose them not very likely
thats a pretty good idea nice for confort of cloning and nice for the market
this would be nice im tired of looking at this nice colored zero every time i open my wallet really if they brought back my station view and got rid of me having to see aurum everywhere id have no real problems with incarna
do this do this now
got my vote i have no idea why ccp doesnt at least place the aur amount to the left of the isk amount or better yet isk on the left aur on the right so it doesnt take up a whole new horizontal line of blank space at the top of the wallet just another sign of chronic ui design failure at ccp shakes head uggg
1 and another option that says check this to show old ship hangar instead of door
i dont see a means of voting so i will simply say no to aurum we have a currency and it is isk no to the noble exchange no to the introduction of microtransactions that offer any item that has a buy to win effect iegold ammo etc the game has already been tained by being able to buy gtcsplex for cash that can be converted to isk do not proceed any further down this game killing slope
no to aurum and no mt
yes
basically my idea is simple  institute a process whereby people who post here asking to buy skillpoints i win mode ships nonvanity mt items and any other request for an easy mode that bypasses having to actually play the bloody game are identified and then gently assisted into another game that is more suitable for them eg hello kitty online island aventuresits strange that the necessity for such a process even comes to mind but bizarrely there are actually people who persist in playing games they clearly do not have the time commitment or ability to play since these people seem unwilling to move on themselves realise their easy mode requests would ruin eve or are simply too selfish to care about the consequences i submit there needs to be a process by which they are helped to find another game better suited for themthey would be happier in a more suitable game and we will be happier without them whining constantly about eve being too hard and not being able to buy their way to flying a supercarrier on a new toon its win  winas for the process itself perhaps a special subset of well trained isds could be created who are familiar with other games and able to provide quality advice to these people understanding that these people often wont move on peacefully it would also be good if gms have the power to forcibly hasten their departure from eve after they post threads asking for an i win button in eve more than say three times
something you do with frequencytranslation i contradict my self regularly so as to sound reasonable however if i think you do because i am too ignorant to know what you are talkng about i will accuse you of it and call you a politicianin other words your time matters more than someone elses time simply because it is yours selfish muchwhich is exactly what you donot at the expense of turning eve into a theme park for dopamine junkiesin other words you dont know what you are talking about
obviously my time matters more to me than your time it would be utterly crazy to even suggest anything to the contrary now all you need to do is to explain how that fact relates to the discussion at hand
hello time to present you with a kickass analogy courtesy of ben yahtzee crosshawin minecraft you have to find your own entertainment whether that be skipping through the wilderness picking flowers or building an eightyfoot golden  and balls  but then again part of the appeal of minecraft is the effort involved in gathering the materials that eightyfoot  and balls wouldnt be so satisfyingly turgid if it werent for the entire continent you had to turn over to find the ore  minecraft is a responsible parent it knows that youll swiftly get bored of your golden  and balls if it just gives you one so it pays you five dollars a week to wash its car so you can save up and gain an appreciation for value so when you finally have your golden  and balls youll love it all the more until minecraft sends the suicide shrubs to demolish it because you also need to learn that sometimes life will just  on you as it will when your boss finds out what you spent your entire workday onthat sums up my view on the issue quite succinctly
lets as a purely academic exercise assume that some readers dont get how the active gathering of resources in minecraft the dangers of doing so the risk of 100 loss of those resources is a valid analogy to the completely passive task of gaining sp in evehow would you explain to those readers that in your opinion actively playing minecraft is the same as logging into eve once every week to set some skill training
youre the one that brought it up you answer it
quite simple the means of generation in this case is irrelevant though it may be relevant to the concept of nonvanity mt and yes plex but thats not the topic now i will post the most important excerpt of the pieceisk and sp summed up quite nicely if you ask me a big part of eve is learning to make do with what you have while youre waiting to get something better if you automatically have the something thats better where is the deire towards it a large part of the satisfaction of skill training is the journey as such i wouldnt be against a means to speed up your training a little through active participation but direct cash to sp will do more harm than good no matter what you might think now
a big part of eve currently is forcing you to make do and go get another hobby while you pay subscription fees and wait years for your toon to level so you can fly a new ship or use module i gotta tell you most people dont have the patience for that i sure as hell didnt i hated eves restrictions and quit twice because there was no options to grow faster as soon as i bought a 100mill sp toon the game opened up i went to 00 joined a pvp corp and am engrossed in the game loving every minute of it with big plans for the future of one day owning a super or running a corp of my own i didnt want to wait years to achieve this im a successful business owner in rl and i want to get ahead fast and achieve my goals not have some stupid time rule put on me that says go play another game cause your actions nolonger have any impact on your characters levelreally think about it your playing a game that says you cant level any further by playing this game anymore or less just go away and come back in a weekmonths timegive me a break you cant say thats a good thing for the game
im for selling skill points as a microtransaction would make entering the game the game so much easier for new players
i didnt compare my time with your time you didi compared money with my time if i by means of spending money can save my time then i will gladly spend money as would most professional adults who value their time and who have disposable income available to themheres a simple example to illustrate the conceptif one needs 380 mil then one can grind them or one can buy a plex for rl cash and sell it in game if one can make 15 irl faster than one can make 380 mil in game and if one does not find entertainment value in the grind then a reasonable person who has the resources available will pay the 15 insteadthe same i value my time concept applies to sp for rl cash if one finds no entertainment value in playing this game in the low sp range and one has the resources available to shorten the wait then its reasonable to do sothe answer to that question should be left up to the individual to decide and chances are fairly good that there are any number of reasonable answers to itjust because you would not enjoy such a circumstances does not mean that others wouldnt and more importantly your personal preference should not become the mandate for everyone dont want to shorten the wait and buy sp then dont no one would be forcing you to buy in you can play the game any way you likehowever i do want to drive the point home that waiting is never part of any learning curve because waiting is inherently passive before someone jumps in and says that waiting teaches patience and builds character let me stop you right there and mention that it is not the responsibility of the entertainment industry to teach me patience when i am paying for entertainment
there are any number of reasonable answers but only a few that are best for the playerbase direct purchasing of sp via plex is not one of themheres the kicker i dont like waiting at all its annoying as hell however i do see the need for it even though i can see what happens because of it ill still make use of it because we are ultimately an instant gratification species this isnt a matter of self control or elitism its a matter of basic human nature why wait for something when you can get it faster and yet we come to another section of my quoteso when you finally have your golden  and balls youll love it all the morethat is to say things only remain desirable as long as they are out of our reach once we have obtained them they become mundane and you quickly get bored of them thus once everything in eve is within your reach why bother playing anymorei wont say that because its s as i mentioned earlier in this thread id like noobs to get a small present of 50100k sp to start them off getting all the modules they need once they have all they need they are stuck with the long training queue what does our noob do then he either ragequits because he wants instant gratification or he finds something to do with the abilities he does have nothing is a thing but its a choice just because you cant get the highend content doesnt mean everything else is worthless and in doing so shows that he has the right mindset for the gameif you think the mindset needs to be changed then you misunderstand the values which set eve apart from generic mmo games hint its not the game itself the game sucks if its viewed as a traditional game
why do people think they have to have high skill points to do stuff if they have such a massive hardon for insert high level skill here let them buy a character trained to use it  that they can already doalso  your reasoning that vets  didnt work for their skillpoints either they merely paid for them and waited for the training to be completed is utterly moronic you really think longtime eve players will accept fools like you with more money than brains or willingness to go the distance buying their way to high levels skills they took months or years gaining reallyand what if you do cry and buy your way to flying a supercarrier for example do you really think longtime players will be impressed or trust youll you to know wtf youre doing or believe youre willing to stick through the bad times as well as the good do you really think youll get any respect because well all seen fools who obviously bought their way to high levels and we know better than to fly with thembut sill  the biggest flaw in your reasoning remains that new players can be in useful ships to any fleet within days yes you might be only scouting tackling hauling etc but if you dont know the value of good scouts for example youre even more ignorant that you just made yourself sound
it is not reasonable to do so at the expense of everyone else they have also invested their time their time is as valuable to them as yours is to youheres your statement i dont want to buy status i want to give money to receive time because time is my most valuable and very finite assetsoon as you say my youre making a distinction between your self and everyone else you did indeed bring it up deal with it there are lots of other people that have invested their time you are not concerned about their time much less how skill training time for sp in eve fits into the structure of eve and impacts everyones timethe larger impacts have been expressed to you but you continue to remain selfishly fixed on your goal and not eve at large time is very important in eve it limits the rate at which wealth enters the game the sandbox isk it self is an expression of time and effort an abstraction of labor purchasing isk with plex is a purchase of time as expressed by isk but that isk was paid for earned time and effort spent in the past with someones time by injecting more time into the sandbox with short cuts such as buying sp for cash or nonvanity microtransactions imbalances will be created you dont care about the imbalances you will create for everyone else only about capitalizing upon the imbalance for your selfin this thread any time someone has shown you how the idea of selling sps outright will create imbalances you have attempted to dismiss it with irrelevant minutia and when you are pointed out as incorrect you start getting all emotionaleve may not be the game for you
do you think you cant do anything when youre new because i could do an awful lot of things with minimal skill point investment why cant you
it has nothing to do with work its a videogame it is about growing a character becoming meaningless skill points are the definition of a characters strength if players can purchase skill points then isk can purchase skill points then isk becomes the definition of a characters strength and the focus of eve will shiftnice way to ask ccp to destroy the core of the game just because you cant tackle on day 1
the irony here is you can actually tackle on day one the op is clearly an awful player and thinks being in a supercarrier will somehow stop him getting blown up
you all forget that there are people out there who are succesfull and dont want to wait many years to fly all ships and use all modules ccp only offers a character bazaar where they can buy toons but buying a alien toon with 100b sp is not the same as have one created why not let those who are willing to pay to pay for this  most of those who are against plex for sp would also prohibit all special services like 5 star hotels porsche cars and hunt yes let us all live in soviet union and nordkorea  wait  what about freedom  what about individual purpose  the right to do what i want to do  why i should i drive a vw golf if i can afford a porsche  why should i sleep in a hostel if i can book a suite in a hilton  just because the 80  of people do it  a clever businessman always see a possibility to maximise the profit  its the only true reason why we have all those special services in rl  because there are people who are ready to pay for it so wake up from your idealistic world view
how about this then what about you buy the skill points but must also purchase enough plex to purchase the skill books to train up said purchased skills shoot some books are hundreds of millions of isk each so instead of 15 for the 10 mil sp or whatever you have to pay 50 for the plex to get the isk to buy the books to validate the skillspeople with patients who have played the game as it was meant to be payed for the skills not just in time but with isk as well to be able to learn those skillsanother any skills acquired through mt upon being podded a percentage are lost just like t3 skills when losing a ship as a penalty for your eager quick to win waysjust an idea not that it matters
this can be best summed up as too fing bad characters specialize they are not gods they shouldnt know everything using one bad mechanic to justify another isnt a good argument keep an eye on your strawman lest it blow away seriously you are either a troll or a moron i cant decide which would be more favourable in this casein context of the game you dont have the experience needed to fly it its not something you can realistically pay for a better analogy would be paying to be fasttracked into flying a jetfighter without doing all the prerequisites properly it just isnt going to happen your freedom is irrelevant you are free to fly whatever you want but you arent going to be able to fly it if you dont know howso just because were willing to pay to spoil the game for ourselves and others we should be allowed to id definitely pay to get sp hypothetically and everyone else would too what would that do to the game
freedom individual purpose the right to do what you want to do those are just fine things but what you propose gives you those things at the expense of someone else there is no liberty in that
as it was said above the skillpoints dont make you a superior in game you just have more opportunities if you want to skill in a actual way its your decision let others skill faster if they want do you loose somehow if a small percentage of eve playerbase will skill faster  let them be  or are you afraid that some bums will loose their empty bottles or mushrooms they collect and grow to sell on black market those are the real evil in the game rmt and ebay traders bums who destroy the nice partyclub meeting but wait did you see someone protesting against it althought everybody knows that this is happening  i dont in a simple way if ccp implements sp for plex it would hammer toon growers they sell either toons on ebay for cash or for isk and then sell this isk to ebayone root of eve destuction would have gone the other bigger evil  isk farmers and bands of greed players who give systems for rent would also soon loose their profit as the plex price in the game rises their profits fall
empty bottles and mushrooms i dont understand the metaphors youre using sorry english is apparently not your first language so i suppose i am misunderstandingwhat i get out of your two recent posts is that ccp should allow players to buy sp for rl moneyplex because that is fair but is it fair to everyone else it will cheapen the experience for the majority so that a few can have this freedomfreedom for some at the expense of others is not freedom it is subjugation we will all be subjected to entering into the sp race veterans in the game will spring ahead of new players is it now fair to all those come behind us to be forced into a position where they must also buy skill points to be competitiveyou will counter that they have the choice to not buy skill points and although that may be true on the surface the necessity will be there nagging at them just like you feel there is a necessity to have the ability to purchase sp so that you can catch upas for all the red herrings keep them ive already had my breakfast
what on earth do you or other individuals lose by me gaining a few skill points for real money on a new toon whatever logic your trying to muster is just overrun by emotion about all those people who have more than you in real life buying what they want and your one claim to fame in life is a high level toon in eve by the sounds of thingsim wealthy and i bought my way into a higher level character than you own most probably 103mill sp so what can i fly most ships yes but not all can i fly them well nope i suck no big deal im learning but im not taking anything away from other characters who leveled their toons slowly or from others who bought characters skill points are just restrictions on what you can fly not what you do im flying around in 00 and there are 1000s of high level toons all flying battleshipst3s or whatever whats so bad with a few more will you nolonger feel specialone thing i wouldnt do is buy more sp as i was happy with my toon and happy having the massive restrictions taken off me so i can fly the ships i want and now enjoy the eve i want to play as in fly t2 cruisers in pvp one day and tengus the next running exploration sites behind enemy lines i had to dump a lot of money to get this toon and people can do this already so why is it a major issue if a few newer players to get the option to buy their way out of noob boredom instead of rage quiting and going to play a game that lets them control their own progression like every other game on the marketlooking forward to your failed logic reply filled with emotion of why it would destory eve
awesome argumentationof course it completely ignores the fact that games are fun because they enforce certain rules and every player is playing by those rulesonly a complete moron would argue that a game of chess becomes more fun if you can replace all your pawns with queens by paying 15 i mean after all the queen is in the game already so where could the harm be omfg stop limiting my game experience
lol thats it go in for the personal attack in fact assume you know to whom you are speaking and their station in the real world they must be poor rl because they do not agree with my position of being able to spend real money on internet space ships hehehe yeah im emotional all right lmfaoas for what people loose i and others have expressed their views to you a number of times in this thread that you reject them or fail to comprehend them isnt really my problem if you have specific questions about what i have written feel free to ask but i feel no need to repeat myselfi dont care if you are wealthy if you are poor or what color you are or your political party of if you can fly around the moon ok well if you could fly around the moon i may care about that i dont give a damn if you have 5000 sp or two hundred million but as for the rest of it no one gives a crap but you any jack off can come on the internet and claim any damn thing and even if it is true it makes no difference to the discussion at hand i see that this is making you quite upset and that you are forced to hide but do be careful someone might see your alteve isnt like every other game on the market if you like them so much go play them as for explanations i have done it more than once in this thread feel free to go look them up in fact have your personal assistant do it for you and have them study economics so they can give you a brief run down with regards to the matters at hand you do have a personal assistant dont you and next time you need to be emotional feel free to do it with your main
sabre tek is right it happens everyday by selling and buying of toons in character bazaar does it bother anyone  no so why the hell sp for plex bother you adunh slavy  let the players have their freedom in fact sp for plex is more friendly than a bazaar method why  in bazaar you have to pay the whole price and cannot be creative  choose name etc purchasing sp you pay lesser price you can buy exactly you want its like a hire purchase  ie you can pay 1 additional plex per month or 5 additional plex its your decisionin bazaar you cannot buy a toon hire purchasing and pay each month 3 plex a whole year but for those who cannot pay the whole price for a toon in a bazaar but want to participate early  for them it would be the best thing in game
well of course he is no one wouldnt expect supporting statements from your um groupthose past characters those in the bazaar were in the game they contributed to the sandbox with their time and their efforts as they gained sp they gained the ability to have a larger impact upon the sandbox by their characters abilities the slow steady gain of sp acts as a governor upon the economy of the game this does not limit abilities of their rl controllers that is what makes the sandbox come alive make it breath feel and think your rl impatience is your problem you wish to impose the unintended consequences upon everyone elsethe purchase of sp for plex will create short cuts across the sandbox in order to overcome the rl impatience of some at the expense of everyone else you are free to choose to be impatient or not that however does not give you the right to impose your desires on everyone else if sp can be purchased for plex everyone will purchase sp for plex most everyone will be required to purchase sp for plex to maintain their position in the pecking order that is society the weights upon the governor will have been removedas for the consequences you do not care that is not freedom that is greed
if you play chess you should know that the forces in the beginning of the game are equal and change only if a player makes a mistake comparing chess to eve would mean that every player should start with the same material conditions and those conditions could only vanish if you make a mistake playing chess you gain experience to think many turns forward and see combinations but your ability to use the figures dont change your king always can move only 1 square in eve you also get to know how to react to the enemies strategy but your skill operating the figures also change you can use t2 guns special modules atc in chess it would mean that by acquiring some master grade you are able to move your figures in other way that a chess amateur can 
ive a radical idea here so maybe sit down for it how about playing the bloody game instead of whinging to get an easy mode implemented its just a thought im out there i know but i think playing the game could actually work
this is a real good argument i must admit purchasing sp for plex will create a mass of highskilled characters who werent there before but how it will ruin the gameplay  the strategy and cunning still come with game experience i can start as a tackler with 1m sp or i can start as a tackler with 50m sp in second variant i will be able to fly t2 ships and use t2 modules i can try more combinations and have more fun so the 2 variant has more comfort
have to hand it to you its awesome how you can formulate an answer and violently ignore the argument at hand id say youre trolling but its just not smart enough for thatthe argument isgames have rules players ought to play these games by these same rulesas with chess every character in eve starts out on equal footing  and you can develop it from there using the same set of rules as everyone elsenow you argue you want to pay 15 to break those rules and pull assumptions out of your ass for why this is not detrimental to gameplayyou are using the fact you are already allowed to bend the rules for a price as an argument for why you should be allowed to break them altogether instead of thankfully accepting the options laid out before you you violently argue the game should be broken to suit your personal preferencesso yeah go and play the effing game
im imagining these people who ask for an i win button in eve were the same who as small children upended board games when they started to lose the other kids back then would stand for them cheating and we adults still wont stand for it today yet they keep on trying having tantrums and trolling when they cant get an easy mode and things dont go their way
lets separate two things first1 paying money for skill points but being unable to purchase them by any means ingame2 paying money for skill points in a way that can convert to isk such as by using plex or aurif you think the latter is a good idea and believe that allowing any means of trading sp for isk wouldnt significantly rewrite the game youre really not thinking it through lets put this idea down to a bad joke and leave it out it doesnt really need to be explained because ccp surely already know its a terrible ideaUFFFDUFFFDUFFFDfocusing on the point 1 then like i said in my original post the issue is that a grown character has meaning and the op is suggesting selling out that meaning no you dont make a game better by letting players buy the important parts of the game skill points and the way they grow and the way we compare our sp to the sp of every single other character in the game are a core part of eves gameplay yes you can buy isk and thus ships guns and what have you but in terms of growth what is the one thing that has real meaning in eve that every character is fairly bound to skill points you want to take that away just because youre impatient that is the game skill points are the same battle that everyone competes in if you dont like it dont play it thats a better idea than suggesting we break it for everyone just so some can trade money for personal advantage in the one thing that means mostthe whole reason a concept such as gameplay exists is due to deliberate restrictions of freedom pretending freedom is an argument is nothing but typing it out for the buzzword that it isUFFFDUFFFDUFFFDyes you can buy characters meanwhile if a 100 million sp character is bought a 100 million sp character is also sold no difference occurs in eve at all that character all his skill points and all the meaning of those skill points was already there and thus no player is going to begrudge that because no character is getting ahead for money the player does yes but noone cares about that because their eve hasnt been dampened by itUFFFDUFFFDUFFFDa final point is just to kind of say wake up if you make any mmo game and allow the defining measurement of a character of that game to be sourced by real life cash it reduces the experience for everyone who doesnt pay cash i understand that some games are like this and they do work but in those games the problem is still there the experience is still being reduced the important point here is to ask yourself what does a player do then if they dont like the concept they dont play those games were that way from the start the players of those games knew how it worked when they started and if they didnt like the idea they accepted that the game was not for them same with eve only the other way around because hundreds of thousands of people have accepted and signed up for eve as one of those games where they can compete with all other players not their credit cards that is a big deal to me and if you dont like the idea dont play it
the entitlement is really thick in this threadim rich and successful therefore the world owes me what i wanthow about this skill points being trained over time is two fold first it makes money for ccp when you decide you want to train to fly a widow because it takes months to do so and you have to pay the subscription fees ccp is a company that needs to make money this is how they have chosen to do it and so far it works dont like it dont play evesecond and this is the part the i deserve crowd cant get through their coddled brains skill points level the playing field among all rl financial situations whether someone can afford a single account or 30 accounts everyone is limited by this one factor it gives the guy in a crappy apartment looking for a way to escape his dead end life the same advantage as the 22yr old inheritance bratif you cant deal with those two points eve is simply not for you just because a person is rich doesnt mean they have a right to demand that every company they come into contact with bend over backwards and change their product to make their life easieri wouldnt be against giving newbies a preset amount of unalocated skill points not enough to fly a battlecruiser but maybe enough to get them started on the career path they chooseanything else just sounds like people want gankinsurance again if you cant deal with a 12 year old podding you in low sec and then talking smack in local about it then dont play eve being rich doesnt give you the right to any more entitlements than anyone elsethe argument that your time is valuable is flat as well skill training happens on a 247 basis log in for a minute a day or in higher skill cases once a week and adjust your skill queue you people are an embarrassment to those of us who are successful and understand the idea that success doesnt equal entitlement
it will create imbalances in the sandbox and those imbalances will be particularly hard on newer players who are unable to as yet afford to purchase sp via the plex method fewer people will produce the ships and modules new players need fewer people will be able to help noobies or even care about them the gap between new players and older players will become even more wide the purchase of sp will become a necessity and not an option just like learning skills used to beas for your t1t2 tackler example thats a rather subjective argument comfort and fun i am sure there is some new player in eve right now that is having more fun than a lot of other people i am sure there is a new player out there is who very unhappy and not having fun just as there is some older player out there with 60 billion isk and unhappy because he does not have 500 billion isk fun is what one chooses is fun in eve there is a lot of room for not only making your own fun but how to even measure it by creating an sp race to the top a lot of that choice is removed because a new necessity is created removing choices removes freedoms
what imho needs to be stated or restated is that ultimately everyone who continues to gives ccp 15mo wants the same thing eve should remain successful for years to comemany if not most people realize that this success can only come true if players who currently do not play eve have the ability to enter the gameby that logic those pilots who have 100 mil sp would all be quitting eve because its not worth playing anymore since they can fly all there is to flyill answer your question because eve players do not play the game for sp gaining sp is not an ingame goal its merely an attribute of the character i think that we can all agree that most players play the game for the social aspect of the game wait dont hit quote yet i know what you and others are going to say you can be social from day 1 as isyes you can be social from day 1 as is no one ever denied thatwhat you cant do from day 1 is have the option to participate on a more equal footing while maintaining your individuality as player by creating your avatar which now matters more than it ever did picking your own name and allocating your own skillpointsto all those who say omg the sandbox balance will be upset tell me how do you feel about a character sale coming with the ability to change your name appearance and reset all your skillpoints so they can be reallocated nothing new would be introduced into the sandbox the balance would remain right riiiiightthis is a very valid point i applaud you for thinking about actual implications of sp purchases rather than just hop on the antisppurchase bandwagon and ride along one way to address this would be that you simply cannot train certain skills with purchased sp at all similar functionality already exists in the game preventing trial accounts from training certain skillsalternatively and perhaps even easier to implement and more meaningful in terms on ingame economy would be to simply prevent sp to be allocated to train level 1 of any skill that way a player has to purchase all skillbooks he or she wantsin addition it could be a combination of the two where a player has to purchase the skillbooks and can not allocate sp to certain skillsthe predominant attitude of the opponents of this idea is that players should not be able to purchase skills because the opponents had to wait for them as opinion that is perfectly valid but when it comes to decision making its irrationalwhat would be much more valuable to the discussion is to think about tangible rather than assumed drawbacks of allowing sp purchases and ways to address those just like heroltior did
are you arguing for something other than buying sps now
negativenice way to avoid answering the question though you are one of the most vocal people in this thread about not adding things to the sandbox because it upsets the balance the above doesnt upset the balance so do go ahead and answer the question
what i see is you changing the subject why if you are not arguing something different what is the intent of the question are we supposed to waste time chasing your straw men and your red herrings aroundare you arguing for something other than buying sps now
so have nonvoting shares
to avoid this only 49 of the shares are sold on the stock market the ceo retains 51 of the shares since they are the ones who started the corporation
i propose a rank list this list would determine the value of a corporations shares points would be awarded for a corporations assets as well as they war victories if they gained enough points they could move up in the rank list say from 10 corp to 9 corp this would then affect the value of their shares by the way i meant to quote you and i hit the report button by mistake my bad bro but i like your ideas so feel free to add to my suggestion
i support this ideaa good thing would be to sell stockoptions in contracts for those who dont know  options are a kind of security against market risk but holds also a risk for speculants for example im a miner so i need to sell minerals i say in a contract at xx xx xx date i sell x ore for 10 isk per unit if the price on this date is higher the buyer make more profit if not i make profit but the main thing is i can be sure that i will be able to sell my orenormal players could build kind of fundcorporation to collect isk and invest it in this buisness also it would be possible to construct capitalships this way much easier if 1000 players give each 100m to a fund then the fund is 100b big for this sum the foundation builds a titan or aeon and sells it on the market every member get a profit of the investment maybe its exist also now but it consist all on trust  with implemeting this in contract system would be much better
i forgot about sharesid totally get into a new purposeful corp share system
yes for shares can be a new class of shares if this current system can not be adapted current ones are class a have some voting rights etc and new ones can be class b and get listed on some exchange maybe charge 10000000 isk for the listing so that not every rinky dink corp like mine goes up thereps bond system too working on proposal for that btw
you need to make a log in bait  log out 20 ships and then get a guy to pretend be afk and then bam all log in ing ownage
ccps devs answer every question threadi have been patient due to tournaments incarna patch and other stuff going on  but it seems ccp is letting their own thread die it went great for a few days and some people got into it later  but then they just let it die with tons of questions not answeredbut can we plz have ccp live up to their claims about players being important
i guess you really have no idea how much work answering these questions is along with how busy ccp is they will answer when they have the time to work on it this issue does not require csm intervention imo
i should probably have said modified clicks every time i tried to bind ctrlleft click to lock targets the game only recognized control and refused to accept controlclicki just tried it again and found that to not only be true but that there are also other issues for example when binding controlclick to target or target toggle not only does only control get bound but target toggle doesnt toggle worse when binding mouse4 to either target lock or target lock toggle it gets stuck in the toggle mode and stays there finally when using mouse4 for either command binding i can also use mouse4 to untarget an object when i use control however i cannot unlock a targetannoying either way you slice it with not being able to use the old combination and having both shortcuts being functionally identical with the only difference in function being based on the key bound and not the intent of the shortcut
thats why i changed target to f has a bump i can recognize without looking at at reasonably close for f1f4 and qweasd not bound to shiftalt of course its more like a workaround and the fact that the hotkey is a bit bugged doesnt go away
they did not do there jobs they did not give old hanger back or say yes or no to rmt they only hide behind legal terms ie it is ccps plan that the noble exchange nex store will be used for the sale of vanity items only there are no plans and have been no plans as per previous communication and csm meetings to introduce the sale of game breaking items or enhancements in the nex store that is not a no but not as of now all says
you know i agree we dont need these ccpinfluenced yesmen telling our gaming company our views on things we should just play the game and ignore what ccp does to it sarcasmi realize this may be hard to understand but the people in the csm do love this game and try to represent it as best as possible they sacrifice a great deal of time and effort into coming to a consensus on various issues and all they get out of it is a chance to see the ccp offices which is nice but nowhere near the vacation a lot of people make it out to beim definitely not a goonfriend and disagree with a lot of their tactics and gameplay methodology but i appreciate mittani for what hes done even when i was on the csm board i disagreed with the goon candidate quite a bit but the csm works together despite disagreements and crushed feelings with few rare exceptions pattern et alif you dont like what the csm have been doing then in the eve vocabulary gb2wow not supported
i never played wow but might try it some day i respect your point view but i just feel that csm sold out and did not do there job show me one thang that they sayed that not a mabby or in time to many qualifier in i been in eve 8 years and i never seen it sink so low
can you guys have a real look at the statement issued by ccp and find anything of any real substance in iti cant find anythingabsolutely nothing has changed since last week unfortunately hope has blinded too many players to the smoke  mirrors used herewhat about the famous goon lawyers
what is it that your looking to hear exactly
are you serious holy crap a lot of you guys are whining about things like you have no intelligence there are some basic very basic requests from the player base1 allow us not to take part in the incarna walking in stations immersion until theyve resolved the effects it has ie higher resources uses lack of content and lack of usability vs the original hanger we had2 do not allow for microtransactions to make eve another pay to win game where those that can simply dump rl money into the game can become the dominating power do not replace timeexperiencecommitment for rl money3 better communicate your ccps intent to the player base and respect the fact that our voices and opinions do in fact matter so much so that if disregarded eve may not continue to existbetween the video and the dev blog i think we can safely say those points were greatly discussed and ccp has openly stated they will adjust to meet our requests in those areas
so right now you anchor the egg and then fill it up and then build it you do this 10mins before downtime for no riskhow about a 6 hour build period and then it goes invincible and the egg needs to be invincible before it can switch over during downtimeduring that 6 hour build period however theres global alert factor like cynos everyone can see the eggs in the map
you want less development of 00 not supported
yes i do believe people are complaining about too many stations
this is a good idea in similar note looting could be improved in general with a simple hotkey much like autotargeting with ctrl click this would not at all benefit bots because you still have to clear level 4 or anom in order to get a screen full of wreaks to salvage if a bot is used to do the former then that needs to be addressed directly and not make the game extra cumbersome for human players many other mmos have autoloot functions ones btw that you dont have to deal with as much stuff to loot
this would enable a subcap counter to capitals and supercapitals these torpedoes would do very little against subcaps keeping it balanced it would also help solve the issues of smashing high sec poses
yes its possible that null sec alliances and the super rich could skew this however youd hope that the csm and ccp developers would take this into account when composing the listto the point of but i pay my subscription  no way will i pay for feature xyz  and why am i paying to develop dust514 and emo online anyway unfortunatly as eve is ccps only product any funding that they use for emo or dust must inevitably come from eve subscriptions but thats another topic of discusionby implimenting this functionality players who want to and can afford it have the opertunity to fund functionality they want  above and beyond what they would get from development funded only by subscriptionit offers a more constructive outlet for players feedback rather than do this or ill biomass my character and quit although thats a valid form of protest it gives the option of feature x for eve  how much is it going to cost

amenspeaking as a dissatisfied customer im not a protestor or one of the raging special people on the forum the buck stops with the ceo for the exceptional execution of a brilliant pr campaign that is highly likely to result in far more income from new customers than is going to be lost from the 7 people who actually go through with cancelling their accounts even if the alleged 5836 accounts in this thread have actually been cancelled theyll still make far more than they losefrom the point of view of the directors and investors the ceo needs a bonus not firing

hi have not been playing eve that long about 45 months now and i was leavign a station the other day to get shot at losing my ship and many othere items costing me a small fortune to replace so here is my question if you set up a bounty contract on some one do they know who set the contract up cos last thing i want to happen is for the person i am thinking to put on the wanted list to come back after me cos i do not have the skills to have a battle with the said person in question think there is about 3 and a half year diffrence in playing time thanks for the help yankoff69
dont bother with bounties its a broken system if you must have revenge hire a mercenary corp to hunt him down as always however the best way to take revenge is to take it personally
not supported  already introduced at player level also people would just afk sit in ship of choice in highsec or pos shields all day long
thisyour paragraph was painful to readalso i would only see this as entrenching which ships people would fly not diversify new eden
as said already people will just afk all day
this 
but ccp cant sell it for aur so not a  show in hellstill supported
it does seem odd that people would be flying ships at birth either make this change or make everyone an infant when they start playing the game
makes perfect sense to me you dont start flying a spaceship at age 0
and you did a bangup job too it makes me long for the days of pos warfaredont suppose you want to take credit for supercaps as well while youre there
i am not ready to give up on csm especially white tree seems like he is serious communication could be better even if its a have patience posti am very curious as to their ability to get thru to ccp i dont think they will as ccp is very convinced they found a winning formula and they have new content equals  that they screw over player in the process matteres less fix the hybrids for example what the fck am a guy to do when both rail and blasters fail train minnie
lol fatman running
roll back to predominion
if you really want to boycott ccp  just dont log into eve and unsubscribe your accounts its really that simplei saw nothing in the joint statement that convinced me that eve is where i want to spend my money in the forseeable future so i have no reason to do other than let my accounts expire for a 2 day meeting they sure accomplished a lotta nothing even if one wants to take their word regarding no game affecting nex crap  was anything said even dealing with the future of eve the game not a single thing at the very best eve is no better than it was prior to the most anticipated expansion ever
i dont get the nda businessi mean if they tell the csm anything then that should be passed along to the players thats kind of the whole point of the csm i thought player communicationthe chewbacca defense comes to mind as that does not make sense
on the other hand  how can they discuss about something  with this kind of infos nda not signed 
i say has anyone seen the minutes of the csm6 summit held a couple of months ago i dont seem to be able to find them
vile if its done then you folks need to hold ccp by the nose and kick em in the ass to get it out the door make em understand they are doing no one  least of all themselves  any favors by sitting on it and figuring ways to weaselword stuffenough is enough release the damn minutes release the damn results of the last couple days no more prevarication or delays
what a andbull line the whole purpose of having unedited minutes is so we can make up our own minds as to each persons stance we dont need anyones crappy sanitizing weve had quite enough of that thank youalso no update at all on your blog since thursday when you know the playerbase is anxious is fail get a hold of yourselves jerk off and get it over with so you can release your version of events to the unwashed masses thanksedit jerk off being used as a verb here not referring to a person
soon tm
i would really appreciate an unedited version as well if this ends up being a publicity stunt where every controversial statement was removed andor altered by ccp to serve as a damage control measure rather than open communication it is utterly useless to me
the purpose of minutes is not to record events but to protect people dont expect anything to be presented in a way that could be unflattering to ccp
just a wild ideawhen a ship is down to structure the aggressor could have the option to launch a boarding party at this point the ship becomes invulnerable it is then queued into the dust alt game where people can either join to attack or join to defend the ship the setting would be the inside of the ship with its miles of walkways and rooms and the gameplay similar to call of duty the final outcome would either give the pilot 30 mins immunity or turn the ship over to the aggressors with the same immunityi know its a bit far fetched but from a sales and marketing point of view i should think that most pvp corps would also purchase this game too just so that they didnt have to rely soley on mercs to save their shipit would also give a much closer relationship between eve and dust
dear csm first off thank you for your efforts in talking to ccp and helping fix the incarnamess while i never shared the sense of doom most people seemed to have it is certainly reassuring to see things in printwhile reading the dev blog one thing struck me again that has been irking me for quite a while ccp must understand that dev blogs are not press releases because sorry to say at least some dev blogs read like press releases at least in those cases when ccp wants to make double sure the message is not diluted and to express a clear positiontake the recent dev blog what prevented them from simply saying we realize we made some heavy mistakes were sorry for the grief it caused on both sides instead we get hogwash like ccp acknowledges that communication surrounding the launch of the virtual goods store should have been better yes i know thats nothing less than pr for shucks we done messed up bad but thats the point particularly when we are concerned that ccp upper levels have lost touch with their playerbase a healthy dose of talking like the people helps make you one of the people at least to some extent could prove very beneficial and i do not mean they should get a gm to do translate their pr into common i mean it in the sense of if they stop making things sound good they may see theyre not goodtldr ccp please talk less like politicians and more like honest people pr verbiage was created by and large for the purpose of making it look less like youre admitting a mistake when you admit you made a mistakediscuss maybeps this is not meant to bash ccp or the latest dev blog i know were in the same team
please do not feed them any more before releasing the may notes
i understand the need to redo and update auras original basic training tutorial known as crash course i think the aura npe new player experience is much better and a step in the right direction compared to the old basic training however the mission series the endless battle was completely different even though the agents offering it were known as tutorial agents there was no need to retire those agentsthe way it used to be for a new player entering the gamecrash coursebasic trainingplayers could repeat this at any time in 1 of 12 3 per faction specific solar systems aura would train players in ship and station controls in 2 different locations within that solar system in space players were sent to a specific training site to destroy a single npc in simulated combat no damage to player after that while still in the training site players were instructed to do some mining where a couple more training npcs would attack after destroying them and mining some ore players would then return to station for instruction about the various station servicesno corporation or faction standing incurred for completing that aura would then refer players to 1 of 60 15 per faction event agents known as tutorial agents who offered the 2part mission series the endless battlethe endless battle2part missionthis was the new players very first real mission which could only be completed once per agent in the life of the character part 1 was a simple encounter mission against a single npc which when destroyed would drop a small specific item to be returned to agent part 2 was a simple courier mission to transport a small specific item to a nearby solar systema small amount of corporation and faction standing incurred for completing that the agent would then refer players to 1 of 60 15 per faction career agents for more advanced training on the various careers availablebasically the incorrectly named tutorial agents didnt give any instruction or information to new players other than refer them to the career advanced tutorial agents the old tutorial agents were actually political liaisons for their specific faction those 60 agents were a good source for gaining a 1 time faction standing increasei propose 2 different options for the 60 tutorial agents 15 per faction and their mission the endless battle 1 simple and 1 complexoption 1 simplebring the old tutorial agents back out of retirement and change their title to political agents have them continue offering the endless battle mission with a slight change to their ending dialog so they dont refer players to the career agents currently done by aura npeoption 2 complexhave the new political agents 15 per faction split up into 5 different agent levels 3 agents per level from level 1 to level 5 have them all offer the endless battle mission series but have the mission difficultly and reward increased to match the higher agent levelsthese new political agents and their mission offers can only be completed once per agent in the life of the players character just like the old tutorial agentsthe code is already written and with some slight programming option 1 could be implemented very easily option 2 would of course take more time and work to implement but is still doablethank you all for taking the time to read this proposaldmc
guess i could support my own proposaldmc
i support this as well its well thought out and doesnt appear to have any gameending standing balance issues i like itdx
currently living in sov null convected to npc null i am now aware of a major problem to any industry in sov player ownedrun nullsecis the huge lack of decent stations or multiples of them even if mineral yields and productivity improves for making items and lower taxes it still will not work because the lack of decent stations to produce things or do much of anything for player owned stations you have a choice between production reprocessing science and offices compared with npc stations that can do just as much and more in different areas at the same station having to reprocess minerals in one station and then haul it to another is butts and makes for a horrible factory add to that the hard and arbitrary limit of one station per systemone npc system can have 3 factory stations all with reprocessing capabilitys in addition to plenty of slots for each one that can sustain a small alliances needs stations in null sec should be just as good as any in high sec to start with and upgraded even better and multiple in the same systemif ccp is serious it cant be the same old same old for stations in the near future we can walk in stations but the whole issue of them sucking in null will remain the same stop nerfing and making the end game content suck and well it will be more livalbe

obviously 1 kudos to ccp for trying although cq must be reworked in a way that keeps all the old performance and likeability keep ship spinning with the option of entering cq when desired  a necessity when able to walk in station gladly the csm emergency meeting had good results the latest dev blog mentioned returning ship spinning soonapparently everyone got ccps attention this is a big lesson for them to talk about exactly what patches will be doing before implementing themalso the community atlarge should be involved in thread discussions before development on big patches starts just so that ccp never finds itself going in the completely wrong direction
damn right we want it back
also sex
trial accounts only
do it in a kestrel
interestingi like
this would work 1
the current system works just fine not everything in this game has to revolve around pvp you knownot supported
on first reading this i thought erk but after some consideration this is acctually a good idea for the reasons outlined by the op and for alot of the same reasons as removing learning skillsthe idea of learning boosters is excellent especially if the better ones at least are player manufacturedim not convinced that you can leave slot 15 only to the faction sets its possible that you might need to consider new task based implants for these slots pi si manufactureing incarna more combat implants are just some of possible alternate uses for these slotsalso support the idea of implant bpobpcsmore combat is good and the loss of a pod will still sting from the clone fee  and whatever combat implants you have in and the boosters floating in your pod goo
1 opalso its both amusing and sad that none of the naysayers managed to either read the entire op or atleast understand what he is saying mouthbreathers ftl
either this or shorter clone jump times1
1 to removing jump clone waiting periodapparently i cant spell clone btw the igb has lag when typing has anyone else noticed that
1best post in a long time hope ccp gets this
very good idea supporting
1 great idea
and it doesnt supported
this is what the devblog after the csm meeting had to say hmm why does ccp have to make it so difficult just add the old station hangar back and replace the customize avater button with a disembark to cq buttoni am hopefull after this ccp statement but still now the csm statement made me doubt again uhm so we will get ship spinning back but only for a while altho last bolded and underlined part suggest it will stay again hrm we need some definitive answers on this 
exactly this

okay so can someone please explain the logic behind me getting gcc for rring an alliance mate who is a pirate but not currently gccfrom what im understandings ccp is telling me that as a pirate i cant use real fleets that involve logi bc they get gcc for repping me outside of combat situations wtf and people wonder why we have to blob on gates to achieve anythingccp when youre done breaking nullsec come break i mean fix low sec mechanics please
good luck
i would like this feature back asap
these remedials can endlessly infer whatever they want in regards to your proposal humpink fwiw very well said you dont need to defend it its a logical step in the right direction for increasing revenue for ccp without breaking the game which is really what this thread is about trolls will troll regardless of if they even understand what they are trolling aboutyour correct in your assumption that indifference andor nonresponse to a heated topic is essentially acceptance older character players wont like it but too bad reallythis gets my vote 1
no i am not i am merely establishing that your reason for opposing sp purchases is different from your stated reason which affects the credibility of your argumentit would have been trivial for you to answer the question yet you are dancing round and round to avoid answering it because you know exactly that either answer would pin you down into taking a position that you do not want to takei am in full support of in principal being able to purchase sp for cash straight from ccp with the understanding that details and limitations need to be worked outyou made the argument that such sales would upset the sandbox while at the same time stating that character sales through the bazaar are sandbox neutral i am asking whether you would support character renaming ability to change appearance and reset of skillpoints every time a character is sold on the bazaar since according to you all those things would be sandbox neutral
its actually about 1mill sp per 17th day
ok lets put this in perspective so i have to work at my job making widget x for 4 years in order to be better at making widget t last i checked practice made perfect not linear timewait irrespective of effort not meaning to cause insult here think about it in the context of just what you state here the more you do something at your job the better you get at it yes timeeffort an example comes to mind i can imagine very few folks played swg here anyway i played a year or so at first release and they had a multi tiered if player fires the pistol and the code looked and saw if you have 0 points in it then you have a 1 chance to increase a point at 20 points a 10 chance etc on until you got full pistol then you could go work on rifle and gain in that proficiency etc that is closer to real life if we are to use real life examples to compare against if i played more then i got more proficient at something quicker than someone else no that does not equal purchasing sp that wasnt the point just pointing out that waiting x time for a sp pool to fill is not really anything but a game mechanic to give a player a means of having something to look forward to that put everyone on the same playing field of everyone has to wait the same time to get x skill problem isnt on a 11 basis the problem more relates to how ccp gets more players interested in the game like it or lump it me included ccp has to do things that we arent going to always agree with in order to attract more business there is always fall out and negative response but those margins dont hopefully compare to the positives that is the gamble that ccp has to take and makeas an aside fwiw swg finally closes its doors this dec for making a catastrophic game mechanics change they lost all the major guildsplayer base of the oldtimers over the last 2 years and didnt manage to attract new players they tried to compete with wowor perhaps vets have given this some serious thoughts and are trying to look at both sides of the argument and find too many pros and not enough cons we talk it out and if some good rationale shows up to support how the negatives would be permanent in nature rather than temporary influx of balance changes then sure id be persuaded more to the negative viewharsh and emotional response some of us like the concept of sp sales but not outright here buy bazillions of sp for 1 kinda thing i am talking about severely regulated limited in scope means of jumpstarting n00bs into a drake at most sort of thing then charge them an arm and a leg to do it give them something that closes the gap a little so my buds arent so annoyed as to walk away but give them more than just enough to hobble in a cheap t1 frig give them a chance to spend serious major bucks years worth of sp costs a years worth of dollars limit on cant spend purchased sp on this skill regulationsi can imagine in some folks eyes your statement then applies to everyone who buys plex for isk infusions or the bazaar high sp char purchases they cheated the system by having a high sp toon instagrat for play or whatever
except buying sp gives you 100 control of where it goes you also get the benifits of choosing how the characters name and looks buying sp outright is the superior choice
slap in the face of long time vets hardly they are too busy busting balls in null making tons of isk and are playing for freeanyway the whole time based skillingthe biggest reason for lack of sub retention is just to milk as much money as possible out of the game in the grand sceme of things they would have made more money if they sped up the time to catch up to 6month players like every other mmo does
arguing on the internet may be like the special olympics but its still pretty funok lets do this psychedit takes several decades to learn all there is to learn and fly all there is to fly it doesnt matter how long you play theres always something else to train for and try many people are so rich in isk that they could very likely max out every skill before they run out of cash and those that arent that rich can still get all the important ones they want but again why should we let them skip to exactly what they want without properly experiencing the game first this game requires a specific mindset and the players have to fit the game not the other way around thats the way it always has been and thats why i supported giving them a reasonable pool of skillpoints to spend to get started rather than being able to pay your way past the oldest vet such a pool would decrease the barrier of entry while at the same time determining if the player has the correct mindset eve is a niche game altering it to cater specifically for mainstream players will just alienate a lot of the old playerbase cosmetically its not as dramatic as the swg nge but they made big changes to the foundations of the sandbox too and look where that got themthis is irrelevant to the argument but ill address it anyway another reason why the playerbase as a whole accepts character transfers is that you often cant get exactly what you want with them so there is a price for taking a shortcut namely that you may be able to have another face but youre always branded by your name and the choice of sp that came before
dear humpink omaristosyou have outright dismissed the general attitude of the player base and circumvented any argument made against your idea by simply calling them shortsighted or telling the people they are lying to themselvesso allow me to present my side of the argumentyou are a stupid man and this is a stupid ideahope ive helped no need to reply because much like you there is nothing that can be said to change my mindfortunately my mind doesnt have to be changed this isnt in the game it hasnt been in the game and it wont be in the game no i dont care what you say sales of alts dont count were back to the part where you are stupid shut up no one caresperhaps theres another game youre looking for since this one doesnt suit your tastes
correct me if i am wrong now your argument is that those who play the game for pvp and have maxxed their skills for the ships they want to fly get some sort of sense of accomplishment from continuing to train industry skillswhy dont you just go ahead and admit that your reasoning that having high sp removes the sense of playing eve doesnt follow people play the game for whatever their reasons are but the passive feature of unattended gaining of skillpoints isnt close to the a reason for many if not mostyou say waiting for a few years is proper i say that it isnt see where we are at with that the term proper has no real meaning because it is 100 subjectivemy answer to your question is 1 because if implemented sensibly it will result in a larger player base hence more people to play with and more monthly income for ccp and 2 because they will pay for it also more one time income for ccpyou cared enough to reply looks like i got a rise out of you without even trying thanks for bumping this thread
yesnonever said it was a reason if anything it is a moderator to stop people from experiencing all the content there is to experience at one timethe term proper is also irrelevant to the argument removed the argument still has the same overall impactfor how longi agree with grath you are the shortsighted deluded one
oh i see you were trying to play little games and now youre going to try and tell me what my arguments were arent youyep pretty much as suspected i didnt take any position because your little gambit was transparent moving the goal posts around is against the rules do try to keep upoh  youre doing a fine job of establishing a lack of credibility it just happens to be your self to whom you do itim against it there are no details to be worked outand i refused to answer you and i still refuse to answer you your behavior in this thread has marked you as anything other than a honest debtor do not now be upset that your behavior haunts you
its just that you dont get to tell someone who pays for entertainment which way that person is supposed to enjoy that entertainment that makes no sense any which way one would look at itin terms of income for ccp thats irrelevant since they pay up front for the skills at a premium over those who acquired them over timestats read elsewhere have shown that new players tend to not make it past 6 months and i will go out on a limb by saying that it has nothing to do with the monthly subscription or the community but everything with the fact that a player who starts today is bound to be frustrated between the two choices she has pay to wait or pay to buy second handof course you do no answer necessary its obvious whats going on if anything i find this amusing because here you were with your pseudo intellectual think of the children  erm  sandbox attitude when in reality you are just like most everyone else in here who is opposed because they dont want someone else to have something instantly that they had to wait for i almost feel bad for having you called out like that but oh well life goes onin ccps latest pr stunt they said the followingnotice how it says that they will not introduce anything but vanity items for the nex store crafty isnt it that paragraph is specific to the nex store not to eve in generalthe second part is even more telling given that plex are already being sold ccp clearly does not define the cash for isk as an unfair advantage when i read that dev blog my smile was bigger than jokers it obviously is an advantage that one can pay cash to get isk but ccp doesnt find it unfair because the opportunity presented applies to all players equally you can buy isk or you can grind itsp wont be sold via the nex store they will just put it into account management to get around contradicting their own statement then they will come out and say that sp for cash wont be an unfair advantage because everyone has the option to pay for sp wait for sp or spend isk for sp via bazaarthe latest dev blog is bringing us one step closer to sp for cash 
no on skill points for  it is an exploit which will break the game
i never gave you my answer one way or the other you have no idea what it is you are making assumptions because it fits your preconceived notions you just want to insult tell people what they think and play your little straw man games sorry kiddo but is you who are getting called out nice try thoughbtw when did you stop beating your wifeas for your assumption about sp for cash because of the wording you must really be quite desperate for some emotional points for your little ego to try that feel free to get your hopes and dreams all stirred up the sooner you are frustrated and back to whatever theme park you came from the happier youll be
harvest brain biomasses a character and making half of the sp availible to your other charactersthis way no sp is created out of thin air for examplei buy a 120million sp character i harvest his brain and the character is destroyed i then get 60m sp to distribute on my other characters on that account
new and old players buy characters of the bazaar already buying sp outright gives you better control of it and other stuff so your point is irrelevant
so humpink omaristos i take it youre too much of a coward to make this suggestion by posting with your main character figureslets face it this is a laughably stupid idea for the umpteenth time if you feel entitled to an advantage in this game because you have piles of money then buy plex sell it buy a character like everybody else there is a deliberate well thought out reason for this  ccp makes money from the plex you buy the guy who buys the plex from you for isk benefits and the guy whose character you buy benefits do you know what massively multiplayer meansi agree with grath  youre an idiot for suggesting this
its the plex vs aurum argument in the case of selling a character no extra sp is being injected into the eve economy in the broadest sense of the term a characters ownership  license to use to be precise is basically the only thing that changes hands in the case of buying sp however you create sp from thin air essentially  just like running a money printing press  causing inflation of the value of sp in this case and it will mean a great disturbance in the force gamebalance wiseso a big resounding no to this proposal
the game is already badly unbalanced due to general ship issues and a large portion of players with loads of sp if anything it would slightly balance it
youre implying that players with loads of sp are an imbalance to the game and have it accepted without thought get it under the radar so to speak not gonna work
technically they are two equally skilled pilots with the same ship fight each other the only difference is 1 has 6 months worth of sp and the other a year who wins with no cap it takes a long time to reduce the impact of that other players 6 month head start and obviously much longer vs a 1 year head start that causes imbalance
anyone selfish lazy and stupid enough to support this p2w crap needs to be removed from eve as i would scuff off dogsht from my boots after being unfortunate enough to tread in it
we already have pay to win pay ccp money for plex buy toon  win no it equals pay for freedom from limited sp and years of boring limited gameplaywe already have this the only reason were suggesting it as a good thing as it will help the new player base get involved in eve more instead of rage quiting cause eve sucks for new players which it does
all im hearing from you is i ignore reality and want easy mode regardless of the consequences wah wahhhhh i dont want to have to play the game wahhhhhhh i want to cheat wahhhhhhhhhhhhsorry no  you dont get to have your way with everything youre going to have to play the game just like everyone else you are not a special snowflake and you will not be accorded special treatmentsighs this is what happens when you raise a generation without being told no and given honest answers about their limitations they think they can have their way whenever they like and when things dont go their way they dont try to adapt or learn from their experiences instead they blame everyone and everything else but themselvestalk about massive entitlement issues uggg disgusted look
dont have our way with everything what else are you referring to or are you talking about some rl issue you are facing and you cant stop yourself from bringing it into the gameits not special treatment when it is available to every player that should really be obvious
its special treatment when you think you have the right to ruin eve just because youre too lazy selfish or inept to play it as for your lame attempt at turnabout wellll it was just lame i guess laziness infects all aspects of your life if you couldnt be arsed to think up a better counterso im sorry im not actually  its only a polite saying but no no no no you may not have easy mode go play an ultracasual mmo if you cant hack it in eveonly a spoilt brat with massive entitlement issues would think destroying everyone elses game instead of moving on to something more suitable for them is acceptable behaviour
originally by toovhonall im hearing from you is i ignore reality and want easy mode regardless of the consequences wah wahhhhh i dont want to have to play the game wahhhhhhh i want to cheat wahhhhhhhhhhhhsorry no  you dont get to have your way with everything youre going to have to play the game just like everyone else you are not a special snowflake and you will not be accorded special treatmentsighs this is what happens when you raise a generation without being told no and given honest answers about their limitations they think they can have their way whenever they like and when things dont go their way they dont try to adapt or learn from their experiences instead they blame everyone and everything else but themselvestalk about massive entitlement issues uggg disgusted lookyou want me to adapt and learn to live within the limits of a system i dont like you suggest i accept when someone says no to me and just live with the rules im given wow you just told me a lot about yourself right thereyou just do what your told in life uh do what your boss says i know you dont have a business dont question authority and believe everything your government and the news says is the 100 truth and just be happy with the ruleslimits people put on you make sure you dont try to break out and be something different you might achieve something well done your a sheepi as a snowflake as you say do feel im special if being special means im a person who doesnt want to play a game over half a decade of my life just to play the endgame content i didnt want to play your waiting game and so i spent a couple of days income on a buying a 100mill sp toon tax deductible business research so no i dont have to wait yes i did get special treatment and yes this is already part of the game mechanics and rules my efforts in the real world were a far better investment of my time than spending years waiting in eve and running low level repetitive game content or checking on my skill training daily and going and playing some other game while my ingame character levels by itself without my interaction which when you think about it is absolutely stupidjust ask any of the 10 million players in world of warcraft if blizzard put in the rules that their ingame grinding had zero benefit to their level growth as a character and that to use that new sword or shield they simply had to wait 25 months in the real world even though they could afford it now do you really think blizzard would have as many players blizzard cater to the new players with a wonderful advancement system whereby gamers can advance at a pace they are happy with based on their effortsknowledge  skill they do not have endless limitations on their game play like eve does hence why they have so many gamers sure eves a different game but the basic game play concept is the same if blizzard put endless restrictions on new players of wow and new players were stuck in 110 level game play for 1 year the average new player would hate the fact they cant advance their character in any meaningful way and quit as happens with 100s of new players quitting eve dailyweekly for this very reason
man so many people seem to be behind your ideaoh waitits funny that you talk about how only a tiny portion of the community use the forums and an even tinier portion like less than 10 support your ideaglad this one will never make it on the csm listhave a nice day
heres a tissue so you can wipe the foam off of your mouthits pretty clear that to you this isnt about sp for cash theres an underlying issue that gets you so riled up you are the less favored sibling arent you your parent handed everything to your brother but made you work for it and whatever you did was never enough while he didnt even have to ask and they just gave him everythingman thats quite some baggage to carry around but theres no point in bringing it into the game yes you are probably the smarter one between the two of you but hes not socially awkward and thats why they favor him over you then theres the emo rage issue which really isnt an appealing character trait so you really cant be too harsh on your parents for loving your brother moreanyway ineptitude doesnt apply since it doesnt take expertise to train skillpoints lazyness doesnt apply either because it takes no active action to train skillpoints selfishness sure wanting a character which will fit ones preferences for name looks and skillpoint distribution is selfish you will not find me arguing otherwiseruining the game all the evidence the opponents of sp for cash have is some magic 8 ballheres some evidence the supporters have that demonstrates that the sandbox easily deals with anything thrown at itt2 bpo nerf or if you are ccp you call invention a feature of an expansion how many people took to the forums and predicted the complete collapse of the economy if everyone had the ability to build t2 we are still here years latersov 4 nerf  titan dd or if you are ccp you call the changes a feature of an expansionrecall the rage about the inability to build titans in absolute safety eve was supposed to be doomed yet there are more titans than ever and players are still in 00 en masspi or if you are ccp you call players making pos fuel a feature of an expansionit was doom and gloom on the forums depopulating of 00 was predicted mass unsubs the fall of eve obviously none of it happenedthis isnt 2003 lots of other activities compete for ones limited leisure time the current sp for money  time business model is no longer viable anyone who is able to rationally look at it with long term sustainability in mind recognizes that
wow this thread is 7 pages deep and the thread starter is still here arguing his point cudos to you sir cudos indeedpersonally i am not entirely decided on this issue but i also lean heavily towards selling sp for cash at least to some extent most of all for the reason that the realtime learning is quite a detriment to bringing new players to the gamebut obviously an allout sale of sp could prove harmful still i think there are ways to do this without bringing down armageddonsay sp are not sold directly but rather as a buff to sp gain per hour that way even the uberrich person with a house full of cash that everyone is afraid of wont be able to jump into his titan right away well yes he can he can just buy a character but anyway and the new players can decide to shell out some extra cash or isk and get a little sooner into the more interesting gearalso say sp are not sold infinitely but only to a certain limit that could be either only to characters below a certain level of sp or it could simply mean only a limited number of sp can ever be bought by any one character or account whether thats 1 mil or 5 or 10 or whatever is a matter of fine tuningfinally say sp are not cheap i really dont know how to balance this properly but i think the op has a good suggestion by offering sp for the same money theyd have cost when learned during a month of subscription mind you i think when buying sp directly you get less for your money than when investing the same money into a subscription and training the slow way because you miss out on the gameplay that accompanies growing into better ships and gear and of course if a noob were to shell out 10000 just because he can and buy a titan and a pilot to boot that only means one thing usually a titan wreck a podkill and lots of ridicule in local and on the forums and a lot of salvage and loot for the market
yea this is pretty much the reason i really dont care is sp is sold or not experienced and proven pilots will always fly the big ships over some one who bought the sp as we both have already stated it doesnt solve the real reason more people dont play this game
this idea will definitely add another dimension to the market and as such i support this
i appreciate the thought thats gone into this and would add that extra missing dimension to the game that corporations have been lacking
1 it be nice have stock market
very nice
i have wanted this for a long time
as it stands you receive gcc for rring corp mates alliance mates and fleet mates who are pirates 500 or lower even though they are not gcc now that is a problem considering this makes gate guns shoot you even though the pirates are innocent at that time this is a big factor for low sec players bc it adds wasted time having to wait out gcc for repping your tank ship after a fight or a mission that is 15mins everytime you have to spend at a load waiting 15mins just to move on without gate guns shooting you everytime you enter a new system not to mention if youre moving to the next fight that happens 5 jumps over and youre gcc bc you repped an innocent pirate starting at half armor or shields as a logi jumping into a fight is just plain stupidwhat needs to changeremote repping mechanics need to change so that you only receive gcc and therefore gatestationconcord aggro when you rr someone who is currently gcc
does remote sensor boosting also give agro i ask because if the same mechanic applies it may impact more than just friendly reps
all assisting modules put on an outlaw player will give you gcc in highlow sec
as an antipirate i am running out of the small gang pirates that my small gang can handle i have many friends who are full blown 10 pirates and they of course would like more prey as wellthe problem we need to get more people into low secthe classic suggestion nerf rewards in high sec or buff rewards in low sec people talk about removing ice from high sec or removing level 4s that wont work by itself as a parts time carebear i wont take a pith xtype fitted faction bs or maurader into low sec i wont mine in my defenseless hulk in low sec that is just asking for a gank however i would as a carebear get into low sec safely and undock from a station safely i surely would bring a t2 fitted bs or maybe even a faction geared one hell some people will still bring some nice stuff in as they see the riskrewardwe need to buff gate guns to the point they will wtfpwn anything that goes gcc at the gate or station inluding cap ships maybe even concord only at the gates and stations for uber nuets and ecm these concord will not scram but will web you are allowed to get away and it is not an exploit you might warp off and dock if your ship can survive the few seconds before you dock or you can hide at a safespot until your gcc runs outthis sounds like a pirate nerf it isnt lazy incompetant pirates camp gates and no one likes station games everyone wants more quality pvp if more bears will haul thier goods into low sec because they can get in the markets will be populated more for mission runners and miners and whomever to actually live and risk thier ships in low sec miners still wont go to static belts in low sec thats dumb but i would scan down a gniess site and take my hulk and just watch for probes now that they are on overview and as a combat scanner i know i can still sneak my probes in and catch someone who is slippin and get my probes off directional before they even knew i scanned them downthen you can remove level 4s from high sec and make comets scanable and you mine ice from them scanning will be something pirates will have to do but at least they can kill stuff and i can set traps more targets more pirates more anti pies better evediscuss
definetly low sec needs a buff i find low sec the most ricky part of eve still this needs a good brainstorming
i like this approach to increasing the population of low sec also note it would increase the number of carebear types moving through low sec on their way to somwhere else an interdictor along a gategate axis would be a very interesting trap
1gate guns should also web scram and ecm as well as oneshot titans
yes the bigger part of the crisis is over give them a chance to find their feet again so to speak remember that whatever you think of the mittani and the other reps theyre not stupid they wouldnt have been elected if they were
i would start using hotkeys if this was implemented
this1
supportedits bad programming practice not to have hotkeys working both ways
this is the formalized proposal of the thread from eve general discussion board
you sir are an idiot not supported
this is crazy you sir are misinformed and just raging
captains quarters we discussed the hardware and lighting issues within the cq and we were satisfied that they were being addressed we were pleased when torfi announced that the current disabled incarna door will be replaced with an environment that will provide similar functionality and performance to the preincarna hangar and this environment will be available until incarna performance is similar to preincarna performance while the final details and timelines have not been worked out ships will once again spin all over new edensource
was drunk at the time i posted this after solbering up and rereading dev blog i close thisnote self stay off fourms when drinking
helloi havent contacted csm before and was wondering what might be the best way of reaching out to you privately about an eve concern the issue involves and exploit that ccp seems to be ignoring or condoning several pilots report having been given the run around or straight blown off when filing petitions we have also recieved multiple varying and conflicting responses about the exploit and about when or if it will be resolved we as a community dont want to bring this onto the public forums as we think it will inflame the abuse of the exploit can i talk privately to a csm member to explain the situation in game evemail will suffice thanks
evemail them look for contact info on their blogs or dm them on twitter
has the csm had any meetings with ccp other than the emergency one last week as there are no minutes for meetings for this year as the last were in 2010 in the past 3 years by mid year there have been 2 sets of minutes already is the csm not actually communicating the results of meetings or are the csm too busy to write the meetings up or has ccp just not had any meetings with the csmjust curious
well its very safe to say that in my opinion at least that csm have been slammed against the wall so hard with whats been going on that its just too much to keep up with right now rest assured though those minutes will be released 
we have expressed our deep concern about potential grey areas that the introduction of virtual goods permits and ccp has made a commitment to discuss any proposals that might fall into these grey areas in detail with csm at the earliest possible stageafter the cq ccp wil introduce community areas aka barshow much aur do we need to spend to even think about enjoying that iteration 
i thought you said something else
not gay bars
before i even think about getting some new hardware and possibly renewing my subs which is doubtful i was wondering if anyone could clarify or link me up to the answers to the following questions1 are extra fittings or any other grey area items being considered as vanity items could vanity items have a clear and concrete definition from ccp2 why should the word of ccp be trusted now when just last year we were told no microtransactions whatsoever or as another poster aptly put it whats the expiration date on that promise a year from now3 you formerly charged a subscription fee to access all the content of the game now youre charging a subscription fee but limiting access to certain portions of the game i dont care if you call them vanity unless people pay extra on top of that subscription fee how can you do that and not feel like total bastards how did you expect people to react to it i expect that sort of thing from a f2p game not from eve not from the eve i used to playnot paying another cent until questions are answered in more detail and no you cant have my pixels
methinks youre just mad you wasted so much ammo protesting nothingccp said no on paytowin items they said theyll address the performance concerns with cq they said theyd bring back shipspinning somehowthe only thing youre right about is that nothing has changed since last week
as per csm thread awhile back the opposite is the direction ccp wants specifically they want more industrialeconomic selfsufficiency in nullsec which in the current system will mean more outposts on the other side people want nullsec to be a barren frontier where you can go days between meeting other pilotsyou cant have both with the way the game works now although ive got a reform package up that should make both the proindustrialization and profrontier perspectives happy
i propose that ccp allow shares to be bought and sold on the market instead of only given away this would allow for the creation of an actual ingame stock market along with the items market we have now if shares could be bought and sold with isk players could invest in corporations the players could also directly affect the price of a corporations shares by their own actions this would include corporate wars monopolies on resources etc to determine the value of a corporations shares there could be a rankings list where a corporation was ranked on this list would be determined by points a corporation would be awarded points for their assets along with their war victories however only 49 of the corporations shares would be sold on the market the other 51 would remain in the ceos possession overall i believe this will allow for a more dynamic and real stock market in the eve universe
you see if this was posted in 2003 you would had tons of replies problem is all these people are gone and there only monoclers and 2007s and these are not hardcore scifiers mostlysomehow eve is not the game anymore part of what made eve the game for me was the anticipation that someday eve would expand to become the space game we all wantedits not going to happen not with ccp on the helm
put money into eve and not elsewhere
supportedid like a client that works not something shiny that i cant play the game on
when you think about what you wrote for a moment you will come to realize that it has to be incorrect unless current users miraculously expand their circle of people they know current users simply dont have anyone else to tell about the game anymore it has already been done and the word of mouth resource is largely exhaustedtotally new players dont stick around because frankly the game sucks for them in part due to mechanics in part due to the communityshiny new stuff attracts new customers who were previously outside of the area of influence of existing customers it is inevitable that in order to maintain growth eve has to move further from the niche and close to mainstream because mainstream is where the money is it doesnt matter if they lose your 15mo if they pick up 150 mainstream dollars a month instead that should really be obvious
this topic was startet 20110418did something happens after that no its like i told you
this is thread is still going here is my idea for the thorax
thanks
no
no
no
no from a rather new player dont bring in that stupidness
10
i feel very strongly for these points for me it has nothing to do with computer power as many people are emphasizing its just the integrity of the game that matters i actually really like cq i just dont like how trivial it is for the capsuleer
10
i support this
i support this i dont need the cutscenes even though they would be nice as long as you could skip through them to bad that the recent csm meetting has revealed that even if they put some sort of hangerspinning view back in a couple months which we may have to access from the cq for all we know it and this is the big part will only be temporary until they fine tune the preformance issues ccps view on this point of forced cq kinda tells me all i need to know about where theyre heading and how they feel about us 
eve is a sandbox world that needs constant and focused developmentits not a scripted game that you can leave to go develop other things
well i read through most of the posts in detail and scanned all of them and didnt see any mention of this so forgive me if this ends up being a rehash because i missed somethingive been playing for about 2 months now have set up an alt account and have to date purchased half a dozen plex and the main factor thats got me ready to quit is the quite obviously broken suicide ganking mechanicive read hundreds of posts on here and on other forums about it so i know this has been an issue for at least 4 years yet it still continues and my experience today is a perfect example of how this longknown issue is a deal breaker for a relatively new playerso im out mining in highsec in my retriever which i set up a paid alt account to train up the mining and industrial skills to be able to use while continuing the training of my primary account which is more focused on combat i know quite well by now that i lack the skill points and finances to survive in pvp against seasoned players so im trying to bide my time in highsec while i train up to at least have a prayer of survivingi also know that at my current skill level i can barely survive a pair of npc rats long enough for my small compliment of drones to dispatch them so im dualboxing with my primary character flying a bs armed with 4 large blasters remote shield booster and 5 heavy assault drones and were fleetedso along comes some opportunistic ahat who steals from one of our gscs on which id foolishly neglected to set the password and ejects my ore in his own container which i recognize as an attempt at can flipping so i simply call it a noobish loss and go about setting my passwordswell first off im fleeted and i have an asset on station more than capable of dispatching this threat but unfortunately the gscs in question were the property of my mining alt whos flying the retriever she gets kill rights immediately but i dont dare attack with just the 3 drones equipped on the retriever and alas my fleeted and heavily armed escort has no kill rightsso once the aforementioned ahat realizes that im not going to be foolish enough to shoot first in my paperskinned retriever his buddyalt comes along in a thrasher suicide ganks me gets promptly concorded and the original ahat scoops up the dropped loot and persists to try to goad me into attacking with my bs and getting it concorded so he can scoop up the actually valuable lootand now im left sitting there in my battleship completely unable to take any action against this fktard who just blew up my 10m isk shipfitting without getting my much more valuable bs concordednow whether or not highsec thievesgankers are ever made fair game for any players inclined to blast their aes into oblivion or not which they absolutely should be this is a shining example of why kill rights at a bare minimum should extend to all players who are fleeted with the recipient of those kill rights at the time of the offense quite simply without this mechanic fleets are completely useless in highsecits all well and good to be considerate of how the ui and the tutorials affect the npe but it is unfathomably shortsighted to not also consider how allowing such a longstanding and welldocumented abuse of the game mechanics turns off players who have made it past the introductory stages and are paying to toil long enough at pve in highsec to stand any chance at all in pvp or lowsecif you suicide gank an almost completely defenseless player who refrains from engaging you in a fight they know they cannot win but wont engage their obviously armed and fleeted escort who already has you targeted there is no denying that youre a bully and a coward and it is precisely eves tendency to tolerate and even cater to such a mentality that i believe is unquestionably the most detrimental aspect of the game to the npe this very forum is full of examples of exactly this
1 a real useable uior just open your api and let us make it2 text large enough to be read3 something like 500k skillpoints free to distributewith shorter trail time or more resctriction on skillsthese alone will help a lot4 and maybe a more involved aura with a 3d model like they have in starcraftwho can sayincoming transmissionmailtransaction or play chess with me
eve is 11 years old clean up the god damn skill books and streamline thempackage them then go back to cluttering up the skill book section then reduce the time multipliers dont give me that learning patience and wanting every thing quickly crap unless you live just like your grandparents didthen a bunch of what every one eles have saideditbasically noob t1 skills should train faily quicknothing over 8 hours then easing the player into the real time grind
make lv5 skills optional means no equipments or ships no matter t2 or t3should require skill level higher than lv4 as prerequisite make lv5 skills totally optional proficient they just make noobs desperate
supported
supported for changing the stagnant onetimepay system of attribute implants into a continuous investmentand for the possibility of creating a new legal profession pharmacist
good thoughts but i dont see a problem in the current system you can have the consumables for your no implant 00 clone and 5s for your emp clone where is the flaw in that systemone thing you failed to consider is that if you did away with the implants though you will make 00 clones more equivalent to empire clones you just removed all differentiation between the rich and the poor beginners who cannot afford 5s i think that is a far worse game balance ruiner as you know the skilltree is not linear and a lot of the higher skills really require implants to be able to train in reasonable time it would really suck if i had to keep feeding consumables to my clone as i train for my carrier
it would affect pve as well by helping convince some of the more adventurous carebears to consider going into lowsecnullsec to do missions ratting andor mining
10
what how the hell do you think now really explain to me
i think a better solution would be to make jump cloning a 12 hourly cooldown or even less no new system needs to be enacted and it provides most of the benefits to your proposal right now the 24 hour cooldown is overly restrictive without doing much if anything for gameplay
the more i think about this idea the more i like it while it may be simpler just to shorten jc times shortening does not also create more opportunities for new jobs nor does it really protect implant investment just circumvents the problemthis idea solves quite a few problems with extra opportunities to boot not to mention an isk sink of a sort which has to get ccps approvalsupported
they actually have a similar system in place already for new players that buy the boxed version of the game they get a booster that increase their attributes and some combat stats that have a 10 day duration if my memory serves me righti love this idea
i completely support anything that encourages pvp
supported after all i suggested something similar a few years ago the best way i feel would be to keep both systems 24 hours stat boosters for people doing dangerous things and implants for people doing less dangerous activities the components for the stat boosters should come from gas harvesting most or all of it done in low sec00 and they should be balanced so that 3 months of continuous use of the boosters would be roughly equivalent to the cost of a implant of the same strength the boosters should cease functioning if you get killed to keep them working the same way of the implants but as the single pill will be fairly inexpensive it shouldnt be a big problem
i think they announced that they are adding this back so i think this topic can be closed guess the csm works afterall 
ok i think i have an idea on how you can have both the hanger and captains quarters it a simple system where in the client settings you have a default station view it both a check mark and a drop down allowing for neither or your choice of loading by default either the captains quarters or hanger also another button that allow a player to jump between the two without undocking
i dont wanna play space sims or spaceship barbie
while youre at it please allow an option to disable the industry button on the neocom i never use it sarcasm this whole proposal just sounds like a passive aggressive way of folks to protest the nex honestly lets move on the topic is getting a little tiresome i really think that ccp has better things to do like add back a ship spin option
its pretty tacky actually agree check box option
okay this is meant as a discussion only so i ask that you please refrain from trolling or flamingthe topic is no doubt going to be contentious and going to cause a lot of heated opinions and perhaps maybe against the current eula but thats why i would like to put it up for discussionpremiseallow market botsorcompletely enforce the nobot policy now that i have your attention let me present to you both sides of thiscurrently i do not think that the enforcement of nobot policy can be achieved 100 its an uphill battle for ccp to track down botters and it makes market trading unfair to those who arent using bots any visit to jita will illustrate how impossible it is to keep up with a standing order on the market in an environment where your order will be beat every 5min with one that is 01 isk higherso what is the downside of allowing market bots in fact that is exactly how rl markets work live broker markets are a thing of the past and the world runs on trading algorithms nowadays banks and hedge funds have their own proprietary market trading algorithms which compete with live traders all the time trading algos have pros and cons pros being that they can react faster than humans cons being that they are static strategies which can be exploited by smart human traders i do not see a downside to allowing both to live in harmonythe current trading skill progression system is geared towards bulk order watching which is not really feasible for humans to handle if you max out your skills you can have 305 open orders at that level checking all your orders systematically is very time consuming and a live human can no longer compete with someone with less orders to check lets assume that both are continuously checking and updating orders as fast as they can if we assume a conservative 15sec it takes to check and update an order it will take a human 1 hour 15min to go through all their orders now that means that they no longer can compete with somebody who has say only 5 open orders to watch this creates a obstacle and disadvantage to those with more orders open which creates an artificial barrier to improving your trading skills why bother when you cannot gain any advantage to do so instead traders will stay to a low number of higher margin orders instead of more orders with lower margin this completely makes these trading skills useless you may argue then that this high skilled trader should just put their standing orders closer to the mid taking less profit in order to dissuade the 01 iskers from beating them that will work but then their orders will fill a lot faster thereby negating the need for skills that increase their open order count in the first placeso what if we allowed bots to make the electronic market opponents would be quick to point out that it would edge out all those casual traders yes it would but what if we only allowed it at one exchange say jita in the real world each exchange sets its own rules you can trade electronically in certain exchanges and others not at jita lets say we allow bots to create the most efficient market for order takers thats you the consumers perhaps at amarr as well and the other trade hubs in the empire this is where you will get the best price as a buyerseller as bots will continually update orders at the fastest speeds other places bots will not be allowed so manual trading will still be possible for those traders who do hauling and interregional tradeslets discuss please list out any pros and cons that you can think ofsummarypros make current higher trading skills not useless and actually worth something for order placers make a more efficient market for order takers at trade hubs  make managing 305 open orders actually possible take away the advantage of the 01 isk order bumperscons tricky to enforce nobots at nonhubs
you will be hard pressed to learn that there are capsuleers who will refuse to allow botting of any form to flurish in new edenof course you are correct to assume that the war on bots is an uphill battle but regardless of the odds we the hardworking capsuleers chose to become the check and balance against bots we spy on them petition them and if possible gank themi commend you of course for bring up this topic just to debate the pros and consoh and by the wayfixed it for you
why do you think this
you have a point and eves economy has grown to the point where sophisticated traders would want to use botsccp should not ever allow people to run 3rd party mods with evebut if it designed an interface where people could program market bots that would workone problem with designated exchanges is that it would fix trade hubs ccp didnt make jita the biggest trade hub the player economy did its possible that at some point in the future jita wont be the big trade hub and possibly not a trade hub at all i cant imagine how but its possible if you fix exchanges for market bots then you make these places permanent trade hubs
not supportedi do understand where you are coming from since i also have to invest a reasonable amount of time maintaining a large buysell order portfolio with my trade alt but i cannot support this proposal allowing any trader including myself an unfair advantage through the use of bots is only opening the door for the eventual legal use of mining hauling and ratting bots let us not forget that the time spent trading is part of the investment you make in this game as is that mining hauling and ratting if any activity is something a player finds boring then they should do something different not have their cake and eat it by automating the process
fixed it for youid like to addrees thesethe first may well be true if careful safe guards are not put in place i do not want to encourage mining bots or missioning bots they do not suffer the same problem as trading as trading involves a strategy even if bots are used what level to match the price etc etc trader still needs to decide what to trade and how far to chase an order bots are just executing the instructions this is exactly how equity trading algos in the real world work you set the participation rate or the slippage from vwap that you are willing to accept before taking the market etc etcthe second statement needs some supporting evidence i do not believe it will take away any player drivenness of the market at all for all the arguments above what it does take away is the tedious nature of order matching tasks that even real world traders do not do we pay brokers to do this why is the brokers in eve useless in this regard in real life i can ask my broker to match any order up to 10 of my limit and nobody will argue that the equity markets are any less driven by real players
well i have to say that i agree with your statements i do believe that it is something you need to do but do you not agree then that the higher trading skills are useless why bother upping your open order count if there is no way anyone would want to maintain 300 open orders and to do so will actually hinder your profit margins better to just open up another trader alt instead seems to me like the system is a little broken if i was a business tycoon i think that i would want to delegate some of the order watching to junior traders in my corp but the system does not allow me to delegate an order to another will it if it could then i think that i would be happy with that solution as it stands i dont see any good reason to train up trade skills higher that 50 or so orders
very good points we would want these hubs to have their trading rules stated plainly so that everyone would know perhaps have public votes or whatever as it stands it seems pretty close to impossible short of some cataclysmic game mechanic or event that jita will be dethroned as where people go to buysell most of the time its own popularity is what ensures its continued popularity jita is also special already in that it has its own node server so yes there will have to be some sort of vetted process by which electronic exchange markets are allowed and i agree with the sentiment that there should be an ingame client to do so or a well published api for those who want to design their own algos perhaps ones that will trigger on technical signals etcyes its quite a radical change but the markets are creaking under its own weight now and manual order editing is not really that feasible for tycoon level traders so either allowed for a controlled access to market algosbots via api or client or allow us to delegate open orders for other corp mates to watch for us
no botsthis is a game for humans not afk humans running bots which is exactly what would happen a player that puts in the extra time to watch his orders to make the little adjustments and profit from playing the 001 isk game should be allowed to profit from the extra effort allowing bots takes away the competitive advantage of being willing to do the extra worki myself am a lazy trader i predict trends and let my orders sit and adjust them every few days as markets shift i am at a competitive disadvantage to the person that puts in the extra effort if i can hook up some bot then were on even footing and i gain at someone elses expenseccp we would hope also isnt going to start to say this kind of bot is ok and this kind isnt it would end up a big huge mess of conflicting positions and rules with which i doubt anyone wants to deali do understand the perspective of the proposal but it would lead to unfair advantage for some and remove opportunities for many not to mention it is a huge can of worms
modifying orders cost something like 01 of the total price that will solve everything price competition at 001 isk on a million level order is just ridiculus
the things that make bots so effective are also what makes them so easy to find ccp isnt lacking tools or ability to find and eliminate bots they either lack manpower or the will to do it in the first place
botters pay for accounts same as you do ccp has no incentive to remove them from the gamealso botting is trivial even without fancy memory injection and whatnot just load up auto it deploy eve to a virtual machine and have at it its so easy a caveman could do it parsing market data is the only thing that requires minimal thought but even that can be done by anyone whos reasonably intelligent
when looking to give corp mates the ability do manufacture in your corp you have to give them a role called  factory managerwithout this role they cannot install jobs for the corp using corp materials inside hangers however this role also will give them the ability to cancel any job installed by someone else in the corp if that happens the entire bill of material is lost forever someone could easily abuse this role however there is no work around for allowing corps to let members produce items and keep a good security system in placeplease reference the eve wiki on station service pos roles
yes it is dengerus and not secure for corp you cant check every member and trust every member in corp and eve not gives eny mechenics how to check members if hee is trustull or no or hee is red spy or tief or wath everi tink that factory manger need to have simply ting that you cant cancel job that instaled by that manager or anoder member off corp if only that job its finisched canceling jobs can do only ceo or dierctor that role no nedto request a full wallet acces to the to make manufucturing jobs he cant take out iot transfer money form corp wallet but can use money to make manufucturing job only try that windows hee can acces the weallet to creat a job but not transfer or do enyting elseve need to have more mehanics to protect corporation property how its now in game
bump i really believe ccp needs to fix this
the only workaround at present is to do all your highvalue manufacturing jobs on alts in a separate corp this is far from ideal especially for wspace dwellers who have to do a lot of manufacturing at starbases ie via corp jobsthis can only be done as part of a much wider revision of the corp roles system but the sooner the better
agreed a number of the roles have dual purposes the whole thing lacks granularity factory manager is one of the troublesome ones i know its a big job for ccp to do a security overhaul that does not remove the need for improvementssoon with establishments possibly captains quarters open to visitors corp wis offices dust contracts and who knows what else from dust  more and more is going to be put on the old system a system already overburdened with more than intended its going to get worse before it gets betterdecent corp security granularity may very well help with younger player retention as well corps may be more welcoming to new players if some of the roles were not so dangerous and more gruanular control were available
as an antipie even i think the current mechanic is ridiculous
this needs to be fixed
gcc should only apply if the target you are repping actually has gcc flagged himherself supported
let us train multiple characters on the same account yes i know its been suggested before  but its just as relevant today as it was then ccp is suffering a budget shortfall and this is a service that players have been requesting for a long timeyes we can purchase multiple accounts no not all of us wish to do that a second account means either a longterm investment doubling subscription fees or a twoplex transfer feewith aurum we now have a level of granularity for our purchases we could sell a month of training time for the full 3500 aurum or perhaps offer decreased times at higher rates  such as 900 aurum for one weeks trainingas a person with two accounts already i could use this service to train a cyno alt on each account without delaying the progression of the primary characters on that account im sure im not the only one that would take advantage of this serviceit works within the existing plex system it doesnt let us sidestep the training mechanic like plex for sp would and its additional revenuesurely this would put a nice spin on the past week i know id feel a lot better about the nex store if it offered a few helpful services
yes please i like secrets and surprises and all that but its just most of us would like to know what to expect in the next few months1 for me
yep and while we are on the topic what about the minutes that were supposed to be getting nda checked and released from the may summit we are still waiting on them too
supported
i would like to support this but first does anyone know why it was taken away in the first place was it being exploited
sooo we are waiting 
there is a bunch of reasons why doing something like this could imbalance the game say for example sp could be bought and most people would want to buy sp all the npe content for the game would become pretty much unused as people would buy their way out of having to play it for little isk rewardthere would likely be a decrease in market demand for noobships ie frigates destroyers t1 cruisers meta 4 modules and an increase in demand for higher end goods t2 bs  capital ships supercapitals etcthis would also most likely bring about less diversity in ships that people choose to fly as people generally conform to certain fleet docterines when flying ships therefore fleets would likely end up pretty bland as a result of this this can allready be seen in alliances that are strict with pvp reimbursementsany sp for isk program would inflate the market price of plex making plex harder to aquire for those that buy them if plex prices get to high ccp will lose subscribers as people start to shut down alt accounts etc there is also a lot of subscribers that arent really that active ingame eg players in military in rl and only keep themselves subbed in order to keep skill queues going while awayit would close the skillgap sp wise not skillwise of carebear alliances vs veteren pvp alliances not a bad idea in itself but could possibly bring about a new form of elitism with in certain corpalliance circles where recruits are required to have lvl5 skills in all requested disiplines to jointhe character bizarre prices would collapse as people could custom create theyre own this would  off many of the high sp vets who can currently get 40 bil  for some of the top end toons better way of buying sp without adding widespread rl money for sp would be something along the lines of this topic
bad idea this will make eve into something no better than farmville or those other sleazy mmos that advertise on the sidebar of facebook sites
it also may mean a titangoonswarm fleet running rampant this suggestion is about as silly as the government subsidizing underperforming mortgages in the effort to allow every american to own a home yeah great idea
how do you figurethe above could be a concern if the main purpose of people buying plex for rl cash is to sell the plex for isk to buy characters based on my experience over the years people on average buy plex for rl cash to get isk to finance their pvp losses or market activity if that is true then the impact on the ingame plex price will be marginalone could even argue that plex would become less expensive ingame since all those people who bought sp for isk dont have the long time experience in how to create isk in game and would thus resort to selling plex for isk to buy the shipsfittings they are now able to flypro tip when going for a rl analogy make sure it fits before postingin the sp for cash scheme no one would be subsidizing anything on the contrary those who buy sp would have to pay a premium so yeah its nothing like what you wrote feel free to try again though
the analogy is meant to illustrate the stupidity of the premise primarily and secondarily as both inflate and add volatility to the market adding a new way for noobs to pilot a titan without putting in the time so it fits pretty well i thinkthe mortgage crash would be when all the noobs get blown to bits because they do not have the actualy skill in playing the game and all that was achieved was to artificially inflate market prices for all these rl rich noobs who wanna go pewpew immediately
except that it has been stated numerous times in this thread that there would be mechanics in place to not allow players who buy sp to progress instantly to a titan its also been stated a couple of times that there are plenty of titan pilots what limits the amount of deployed titans is the number of actually available shipswhat does inflate the market mean from where you are looking same question for volatility its pretty easy to make those broad claims but when you take a minute to think it through and truly consider all reasonable outcomes especially in comparison to what the sandbox has already seen in terms of changes then theres no other way than to come to the conclusion that the sky isnt fallingbuying sp is about getting new players into a place where they can choose from a range of ships and be able to fit them well its about allowing you to roll a trade alt if you want it and willing to pay for it its about giving every single existing pilot the ability to just pay up and get those armor and shield resists to 5 that they have been putting of for so longskipping a couple of years of skilltraining does not create an i win button anyone whos at the very least halfway reasonable will see that especially if there are sensible restrictions on how many sp can be purchased when and on what they can be allocated
skill systems do suck and an average player wont like a game without any hope of being equal to vets but the game is simply not well made enough to make players stay without hijacking them with skill system ccp need to keep players in illusion like this will turn fun only after i can fly xxx if you give players all skills lv5 instantly many of they will realize within a month and shout out oh god the game does sucks and leaveanyway still a good idea for ccp because those who leave already paid the same amount they supposed to instantly
fact is most of you ignore the fact that rich players can come in buy 120 mill sp toons and titans already heck someone can buy 10 of em if they want to drump 50000 down big deal its not happening and its allowed already in the character bizzaryour all saying everyone would have super elite pilots no they wouldnt people would play at a rate that let them level and enjoy their game play experience i wouldnt buy more sp if i could for my current pilots as i dont desperately need to fly a minimatar battleship ill fly a caldari tengu till my skills train up naturally ingame and most will not buy mega toons and dump 5001000 because they already have that option and most do not do this only a small percentage of the eve population buy characters so your whole would ruin eve cause everyone has high sp toons is just wrong people can buy them now they dont want them they do want to get over 34 week humps in their gameplay where they feel restricted and then quit if you give them a small option to get over that hump to that new ship and new ingame content they will play for longer
sorry all these pages later and still  no you may not have easyultracasualbuymywayintoagiantshipbecauseinmyignoranceithinkthatstheonlywaytohavefunmodebut hey continue to refuse to deal with your entitlement issues laziness and selfishness and go on whinging in what has to be one of the the most unpopular threads for its lengthalso utterly fail to notice the massive protests only a week ago over mt and fail to realise asking for ubereasycheatmodeviamt a week later might be the dumbest move yet recorded on eve forumswell done sir
real life exists horriblesdeal with itshades
obnoxious name assumption attitude post even text colour subtle trolling much d
vets with more sp than noobs is as unbalanced as a sixgrader being further ahead than a firstgrader in other words not unbalanced at allall yall fail at economy 101 really
not supportedhaving to wait for something that you trained for makes it more worth while this would destroy that and much of what makes eve worth playing
absolutely not supported this whole thing about a small vocal minority of players not liking microtransactions is absolute rubbish its absolutely true that most players dont participate in the forums the same as most players dont participate in the csm but hardly anyone wants to see microtransactions that allow real money to be a substitute for effort and time in the game
going to echo again the complete ludicrous nature of this proposal which seems to be posted by impatient players from wowearn your isk rmt is a bannable offense from ccp and essentially your proposal is exchanging real usdeur for implants the amount of game inbalance that this metagame leak will cause are numerous as isk flows already have leaks in plex the last bastion of exploit free mechanics is the sp system now proponents want that exploitable as well why not turn eve into a rts while we are at it then we can get some starcraft gamers to join too 
hell no
hell noi could probably support an improved sp acquisition for newbies to a degree but certainly nothing beyond cutting off the difficulty of the first 6 months and certainly not for older players
the learning skills were removed to help the newbie already no need to add to that
let me preface what i am about to say with that i didnt say that vets vs noobs is unbalanced someone else did howeverhonestly you fail at analogies for the second time and all on page 7 comparing vets and noobs to sixthgraders and firstgraders makes no sense at all because unlike eve players they are not limited to being stuck on the same playgroundso your argument is that because a small number of players compared to the overall number of players spoke up against mt its clear that hardly anyone is in support my argument is that those who were opposed spoke up the rest didnt care one way or another or are in favor if a person isnt happy with something a service a purchase whatever they speak up they dont continue to pay a company for a service if they dont agree with the way it is performed i have logic and reality on my side what do you havethanks for being the first csm to actually post here kudos for thathowever csm action on this issue isnt required nor would csm action either in support or in opposition have any effect on ccps decision to implement this feature or any other featurei realize that you are spending your time on what you perceive to be the betterment of eve and for that i notion i do thank you ill leave it at that because this isnt the place to discuss the value of the csm as a whole
lollll youre a ing idiotccp isnt implementing this game breaking nonsense get real
sage
brilliant because of the 50 conversion rate it avoids fotm remapping concerns instead of hurting the character bazaar is will actually increase demand no sp inflation in fact it reduces the outstanding amount people get to maintain attachment to their character i would love this
okay i support this thread in principle but your proposal needs more work the idea above wont work i dont put money into apple because they are cooler i put money into them because i can make a profit on their shares artificially creating a price for shares of a corp on something as fuzzy and not related to asset value like acheivements is going to end in market crash or people to game the achievements model example off the top of my head corp is formed isk is moved from a parent corp everyone ganks for a week or whatever makes a ranking dumps the shares makes a profit for all members and disbands corp rinse repeat do it once and people stop trusting the price of the shares on the market and the whole ranking thing becomes a jokein fact weve hit on the fundamental reason why this proposal has been proposed countless times in the past but has never materialized its because most people overlook the fundamental foundation of a equity market a credit system without a creditbankruptcy system and accountability laws anyone can make a corp pump and dump the stock and make off like corp thieves with the publics money hey you americans should know how that feels like now you would think the financial crisis would have taught you a lesson or 2 you need a banking system to value companies and a system to hold companies and banks accountable for their actionswithout this stock prices will be manipulated hey we have a free iskitem transfer system in eve with no accountabilitysee my past proposal about adding money laundering laws the first step in installing accountability to the financial systemmoney launderingmost of the responders are clueless when it comes to the real workings of the financial system so it didnt get too favourable a response but some actually did point out some good game mechanics reasons why this would fundamentally be difficult to implement in eve but i do think that they can be worked around
this is a necessary idea and keep national pilitics out of this it is a game that is very tacky it does need work that is why it has been proposed to be talked about and have the kinks worked out
to solve your little problem their would be a time in business requirement necessary to make the rankings list to move up in the ranks would be determined by assets time in business and the number of with corporate membership this would solve the issue of trust since only long standing massive membership corporations would have the publics trust see problem solved wasnt that easy next
a computer decides the stock value of real life companies it wouldnt have to be any different in eveanyway the corporation would have to decide to go ipo to be publicly traded the percentage of the shares in the ipo should be customizable up to and including 100 a new corporate function for publicly traded corps with more than 40 shares on the public market would be to have a board of directors that consists entirely of the top 5 7 9 or 11 shareholders including the chairman the ceo cannot be on the board the board is essentially the representative body for shareholder interestsnobody can gain more shares after ipo without paying for them including the ceo and directors unless there is a split or a compensation plan that awards shares for performancethe stock exchange would be a submarket similar to the current market but separated from it entirelypublicly traded corporations would have to run the books like a real corporation to remain tradeable a given corp would have to retain 50 of the public share value in the wallet at all times
since when im not stock expert but as far as i know there are rating agencies that calculates the value of company when it goes publick with its shares and after that the price is only buysell orders like our eve market so no computing of value or anything like this the price of a single share is what you can buysell it for now it is true that once someone calculates that the company iis no longer worth 1b but lets say 500m than this gets published in a yearlyqueterly report or some press article so it affect prices if shareholders will panic and start to sell dramaticallyjust my 2 cents
which is done with complex formulae that are left to be crunched by computersthe value of the shares are calculated to be the price at which they are trading currently not necessarily the actual value of the company eve market is not currently designed to handle a fluid price system like a stock marketdaytraders are what really affects stock prices since they are constantly jockeying for position on the market the vast majority of stockholders are not that infused with adhd and any significant activity by them as a whole will affect the price the stock trades at moreall of which is handled by a computerized system running complex formulations
currently drone sec while able to make money in does not have the money making potential of other null sec zones via a test the other day i did two hours in each area total value of the sanctums i ran in drone null sec equated to about 40 mill this included salvage and the drops from the dronesdoing the same level of sanctums in wicked creek region for the same amount of time total value was 130 mill counting salvage and bountiessadly at 40 mill for 2 hours of work i could stay in high sec and run level 4 missions and make more then that value in the same amount of time this needs to be changed and updated to allow folks that take the time and effort to move into drone null sec to make a profitthe disparity here is way to large i am not saying that drone sec should be as profitable as those other zones but to have such a large disparity is wrong the value of what i get from the sanctums should be close to equal right now drone sec is dying slowly but surly while indys may stay in the area i am watching more and more folks move out of the areas due to being able to make more money in high sec then in drone space for the amount of time put indue to this i propose the following changesincrease the amount of mineral drop from the dronesadd a small bounty to the drone kills nothing to compare with the value of serpentis bounties but a small bounty will go a long way to balancing the value of the kills amounts as a suggestion frigate class 10000 isk cruiser class 20000 isk battle cruiser 50000 isk battle ship 80000 isk or a bit lowerjust by adding in about 10 more minerals to the drops and the addition of a small bounty drone sec will become more balanced with the other null sec zones and be more profitable then high sec
the cause of this issue is not an intrinsic imbalance in drone space but the nerf of drone compounds and the inflation of minerals in highsec due to rampant botting
i have to ask a fundamental questionwhy should all null sec regions be balancedwealth disparity is what causes demand to be in other regions its what causes population distribution variance and variety its what causes wars in the end war is good as it fuels the economyfor instance a potential good thing about a low paying null sec region may be that it is a strategic deadzone which is relatively safe from alliance battles all the time
booting in fdrone lands havekly drops down mineral prices in high sec drone need to be nerfed not boosted need to change the way that drones ntio droping mineras biot that drone poo you can sell to the npc how its is with sleeper data liberys etc thet will stabilize abit market and wil give normal non boter miners agein soem job to do ader ways mi9ning itsl ong time regiculus ting to ern isk
when thinking drone regions you have to look at more than isk in pocket look at the lifecycle of mineralswhereas everyone else take their isk and go shopping for minerals in highsec which then have to be hauled back out in the form of compresses blocks or carriers loldrone denizens only really need extra tritanium and can thus skip a large part of the hauling and even make isk by exporting excess midhigh ends to highsecdrone regions are not well suited for groups made up of lots of individuals as the area very much encouragesfavours planning and a collective mindset  one might say it was meant to be ruled by russians as they are far more collective oriented than their egocentric western brothers myself included but then i really am all that so its justified 
new turrets are cool new icons are terriblethey violated the first principle of icon designingreadable and recognizablethey are same black blob on black background hardly anyone can tell the difference between turretstractor beamssalvagerthe old icons were just fine clear and cute please csmtell ccp to bring them backand at least try to avoid making mistakes at this level again it will cost them nothing
gate guns should be able to move around system and also across systems gate guns that are outnumbered can call for reinforcementsa pirate who has repaired his sec and is running missions in high sec should have a random chance of a gate gun uncloaking next to him and ganking himalso gate guns should occasionally float down the captains quarters gangplank and start messing  up in your quarters
when we log in there should be an aur fee that if isnt paid we should be ganked immediatly by the guns even if they have to shoot there way through the station to get usthere should also be required gate gun prayers to teach our children
gate guns should bump afk cloaker and tractor beam them into jove empire
as a feverish pirate hunter myself i must support this idea but i suggest to take it a step further i hope one day to command a gate gun with my pod inside it that way i can end those evil rifters with 10000000 tracking gun even faster then today it will be cool because i wont even need to purchase transport with a alt long distances and risk rigged battleships on gates to get kills on low sec gates which can be countered at any time by other players due to the fact i can add extra dps to the gate gun
19000no
i think your measures are a little too extreme but i support this discussion in generalgate guns should not be instapopping pirates it wont make much sense storywise that guns in lowsec gates would be more powerful than those in highsec oneswhat you are trying to achieve is just to make gate camping lowsec gates less appealing for pirates right well then what about thiswhat if we just made the sec aggro policy more harsh in lowsec no buffing guns no adding police forces but make gate guns activate for lowsec rating pirates just like they do in highsec im sure most pirates will avoid camping if they were continually under firecurrently gate guns and police forces will aggro pirates on the following scalehere is a brief list of your travelling options according to security status players with 20 or worse will be attacked in 10 systems players with 25 or worse will be attacked in 09 systems players with 30 or worse will be attacked in 08 systems players with 35 or worse will be attacked in 07 systems players with 40 or worse will be attacked in 06 systems players with 45 or worse will be attacked in 05 systems  it would be simple to extend this in a balanced way to players with 5 or worse will be attacked in 04 systems players with 55 or worse will be attacked in 03 players with 60 or worse will be attacked in 02 players with 65 or worse will be attacked in 01 players with 70 or worse will be attacked in empire 00
of course we will need some mechanic so that pirates who are loyal and high standing with the prevailing faction sov in the lowsec system not to be attacked by them for instance you are 60 sec status but 4 with the syndicate you should not be shot at by the gate guns in syndicate lowsec gatesof course this implies that some penalties be dealt out to those who blow up ships of players who are also loyal to serpentis by affecting their standing exactly what happens when you blow up npc rats of a faction this way a lowsec pirate loyal to a faction should be able to operate freely in this factions lowsec and also have a disincentive to gank other players loyal to this faction as it will affect their standing and if they do it too much they wont be able to avoid the gate and station guns in the factions lowsec anymorehow does that sound any loopholes that anyone can find
i believe in the concept and principal though i dont necessarily believe in the solution i dont particularly have one myself so ill listen until i hear something reasonably to what i personally would consider a more apt and accurate solution before i voice a further opinion
even pwn capitals  you serious sentry issues are related to them not having been buffed in ages even when ship ehp has doubled or tripled in the meantime so you can now use buffer cruisers with light rr on gatesgates are chokepoints and should remain as such strategic elements but is should not be as easy i have managed to gank a bomber in a slicer and make it out in hull double damage to account for ehp increases and give sentries sleeper ai so they dont cycle repeatedly ignore drones and go after logistics more will need some tweaks to how to handle threatlists but shouldnt be too difficultstations are owned by states within the states eve corporations are immensely powerful but allow miscreants to run rampant on their front porch upping station guns could be argued to threaten normal traffic due to glitches so instead reduce docking ranges to a easily identifiablecommon range of 25km in all directions extend this outside dock point should be just enough to allow a stop ship command to work in high lag scenarios designate the docking range as a pos bubble perhaps with a new graphical indicator like perimeter space buoys  removes interaction withinwith docking range thus eliminating station camping all together blockades in null still possible due to bubblesin short getting people to ls requires much more than making entrances less hazardous it couldshould be part of a bigger revamp though
hmm i think the super powerful gate guns that can wtfpwn a capital is going too far but i like this idea of concorde or some type of npc showing up to keep the peace i think these npcs should scram sometimes based on the security level of the system and the aggressors security status they should also ecm and web or anything that might help but only sometimes so that you cant predict what youll face and of course they would be destroyable at a huge cost to your sec statustraveling through gates in low sec generally doesnt bother me because im either in a fast frigate and i breeze past gate camps or im with a big enough escort that gate camps run but undocking in stations can be worrisome once in space its up to me to be vigilant to keep myself safe and i accept that i have some control over the situation if i get jumped there were things i could have done to stop that so its totally my fault
i still like the idea of having a different approach to low sec we need a way to increase its population even though not necesaraly make it safer
lowsec already has the best stuff the best ice the best minirals the best rats the best pi the best looking stations etc if anything highsec needs a buff
my humble take on the matter pimpin mah threads
thank you for starting this discussion as a admitted newbie and carebear i am a little confused what the purpose of low sec is 1 empire  pve except for consensual wardec duels and so on2 00  fights for sovereignty and serious resources3 wh  kind of like 00 but manageable for smaller  focused corpslow sec it neither allows sovereignty and with it the security to mine nor does it allow safe pve environment it is hence pirate land only and as such  imho  oversized wrt harvesting  i believe that only serious groups of wellorganized teams can harvest in low sec with a pvp escort haulers and so on whilst fun i assume this is limiting the space to few players who work in this environment also confusing to the newbie is the security rating system if i understand it right i can be shot down by anyone for any reason in 04 and lower the only difference between 04 and 03 is the quality of the rats  ore that seems needlessly complicated and confusing maybe i dont have this right  please let me know  but i fail to see the real reason for having low sec at all why not roll low sec into 00 and be done with that make it so that sovereignty can not be gained or gained only for a limited time or subset of space eg a belt comments and edification most welcome
get rid of the gates 
id rather just get rid of the gate guns entirelythough given the choice id much rather have guns that ecmd rather than did actual damage give the guys getting jumped a chance to get away or make the campers fit eccmand as a pirate i wouldnt have the hassle of repping myself up every time i changed systems win
1 nerf pirates
gate guns need to have 15au range and be able to shoot down pesky pirates as they warp in on anyone with a higher sec rating than said piratealso they should be able to auto deploy drag bubbles should be able to multiply their numbers by at least 4 times enemy fleet  have remote shield transfer and or armor repair available to repair the attacked vesselsalso cq needs to have a plot safe course through lowsec button that allows careb people with high sec standing to autospawn concord vessels along their route and the option to pay aurum to autopilot through lowsec 0 distancesoim sure one of my ideas is at least as stupid as yours
gate guns are not the problem with low sec gates are starjump replacing gate travel would immensely improve the game overall
tldr
signed supported also matrix cgi is nice p
add a top hat to the noble exchange storeit should probably be a bit cheaper than the monocle but not too much in conjunction with the monocle it will help to truly separate the real life crappy poor players of eveonline from those who are not horrible at being successful
i have to say thats one store item i would buy along with a real monocle and a goldplated ebony walking cane
all we know is that there is a rumor of smuggling be changed and that players them selves may become the enforcers so far all we have is the rumors it could be fun or it could be completely useless depending on how the changes are implementedone thing i would not like to see is smugglers take an immediate security penalty andor faction standings or isk fines when they are discovered penalties should come upon being destroyed or stopped not on suspicion innocent until proven guilty  if some joe cop wannabe cant stop me then what proof does he have some faulty craptastic scanner he got from a dead rat i think not your honorfrankly being blown up and loosing your ship should be enough what we dont know is how all of this will be done maybe soon as you undock youre a red blinker or at first jump or something so that no one has to scan thats all fine too id just like to avoid the silly standingssecurity and isk fines just because someone got off a lucky scan no better than the current customs agents the point of getting something smuggled is to do it secretly so if you can deliver it then some amount of secrecy was achievedany other thoughts
as long i know they will get answered eventually im happyi know it takes time and resources and i for sure did not call anyone stupid you guys are incredible tbh im not asking for anyone to ask anyone else to do it now its just important to make sure ccp wont forget about it
these answers are just pathetic anyway check out my sig for the referencethey could have been running this initiative every month but given the quality of answers i doubt that it would be of any good for most us
ok i think i have an idea on how you can have both the hanger and captains quarters it a simple system where in the client settings you have a default station view it both a check mark and a drop down allowing for neither or your choice of loading by default either the captains quarters or hanger also another button that allow a player to jump between the two without undockingyes i didnt post this on another forum threat but i think it should be it own
its already done and we call it pos
most people here are missing the important issues in this response on difficulties of multiboxing clients with the new incarna environment all they have said they will do is alter the stated minimum hardware spec on the website on incarna environment always being optional ccp seem set on forcing you to load it their current position is that once they have reintroduced ship spinning the option not to load station environment will be removedcsm could you please work to improve this situation im sure lots of things were resolved during the summit but now it is over it is time to call ccp to account on these unresolved issues
i hammered the first point during the meeting the upcoming alternative hangar is in part a response to that performance concernthe 2nd point depends on performance if ccp wants to make incarnacq mandatory my condition is that the performance is what it was before id rather not have to use the avatar but ccp thinks it an integral part of eve and fighting against it is a lost battle
can we get clarification as to why ccp thinks that using the avatar and wandering the cq is an integral part to the game i actually played a few years ago on a trial and then came back recently to give this game another go theres some newer stuff i noticed and that cq was one that i didnt really like or feel was necessary i found it more time consuming for no reason than good
this is actually a fascinating prospect and it seems almost void of insider trading so cheating it would be a lot more difficult than it could be and also could be another form of obtaining isk
agreed if eve had a stock market it could add an intresting layer to the economy i support this motion wholeheartedly
csm6 should announce a public ultimatum towards ccp concerning the nda check on their minutes in order to get them publishedwhen fail csm6 should step downpersonally i love ccp and am i not a fan of csm6 extreme csm2
i feel he is totally right with this statement i think that would be a sweet idea and a load of fun but i dont see it happening sadly especially if the ship is a randomly chosen map where nobody sees the layout before everyone spawns unfortunately the forums arent as populated as they should be with a game this popular im seeing
actually boarding parties may be a intresting change to the way we fight having a specific troop transport ship that launches boarding torpedos and considering specific ship classes probably have the same internal layout it would be easy to make maps to fight inside them then you could either destroy the ship or take it also this type of ship could be used for supporting other dust related functions and possibly other types of planet to space interaction i support this
i understand and agreehowever when issues arise such as this one that are very serious the friendlier type of communication that allows for jokes and tongue in cheek comments has to leave place to a drier type of communication that addresses the issues lest people think ccp dismisses their concernthis is something even the csm part of that devblog suffers from to a degree because anything less than serious business tone would be poorly received by manythe video published with a devblog should mitigate that feeling you have other than that you can also feel free to contact your favourite representative csm member ingame or through evemail for a more chatty type of statement
post 500 d
1 but just for numbers purposes i dont think ccp will ever fix it
op here 
why cant pos modules be part of a single structure and fitted similarly to a ship also centralized hardpoints for clusters of turrets or modules again fitted similarly to the way a ship is fitted
a lot of amazing ideas here but one thing i have been frustrated over fo some time is the issue with off line poses i know a few have mentioned it already there have been many threads about it in the past the most recent one i read seemed like it was on the table to fix but never got done off line poses are getting to be a big problem especially in high sec and wormhole space where you can not bring in dreads to pop them of line poses lose the bubble but still have full shields this makes no sense if the tower has run out of fuel and has no power then where is the power for the shield coming from it makes no sense for an off line pos to take the same dps and total damage to kill as a fully operational pos i would be nice for off line poses to degrade with each down time say after a week the shields are completely gone another week later security goes off line to the point where someone with maxed hacking skills and possibly a new pos hacking skill with hacking 5 as prerequisite can hack into it and any anchored modules to steal any loot left behind a week after that a hacker can unanchor it a week later it unanchores itself and a week later it degrades and selfdestructs make it worthwhile for experienced players to hunt down off line poses and make them much easier to kill for players that just want the spot currently you need the same fire power to take down an off line pos as you do to take down a fully functional but undefended pos i have wanted to put up a pos for some time but all the areas i have checked have no open moons yet there are many offline poses that are doing nothing but taking a spot where someone else could set up a pos i currently run my own high sec corp but even with all 4 of my accounts in battle ships it takes hours to kill a small off line tower i would be fine with spending 46 hours to take down an active small tower but to have an off line tower take the same amount of work just does not seem right i might as well find a small online tower with good modules anchored and attack them same time investment but a chance of some good loot even a advanced lab that i can scoop after popping the tower is worth a few hundred mil off line poses are generally one of three situations1 some one forgot to fuel it or cant afford to fuel it yet but will either take it down or refuel it soon give them at least a week to do so other wise they never should have set it up they were unprepared and deserve to lose it2 players have abandoned them and do not consider the cost of the tower to be worth taking it down and selling or storing it it is wasted space and there needs to be a way of eliminating them that does not require the same effort as taking down an active pos 3 it is just a place holder pos some corps anchor posesussually a small tower with no intention of ever bringing them online they do this just to keep others from being able to use that moon or to claim the moon to sell to someone wantint to put a pos there give me 500 mil and i will unanchor the tower for you this should be considered an exploit it would be tolerable if off line poses were easy to kill but as they have the same ehp as an online pos e every high sec moon i have checked has at least a small off line tower anchored there i can not do enough dps with only 4 accounts to take down even a small tower this should not be the case make off line poses much easier to kill than online poses at the very least make them lose there shields a small tower is managabel for 34 battle ships if it only has its armor and structure about 1 mil hp each if i recall correctly and not the huge shield buffer make them degrade slowly to give the owner a chance to get it back online within a resonable time but if they do not let it die if any work is going to be put into poses then this needs to be addressed along with any of the updates that are equally needed
nocosmetic items should be free content unless the game goes f2p
thats no from meand no from him my 2nd accountkinda moot point atm ever since the upgrade i cant even launch eve i know get a new computer  well i cant im saving up for a bloody monacle
1 bring back immersion
rich can afford to keep 5s in poor cannot rich presently can have clones with both implants and boosterspoor may only have 2 and boostersdo away with the implants and you have both rich and poor with boosters the nonlinearity comes from the fact that implants cost go up a lot from 1 to 5 boosters or any consumables wont be as expensive as any perma boosting implant flattening the divide between richpoor
if you define the rich as someone who simply consumes 5 booster spices or uses 5 implants then youre scope on this subject is pitiful more so because the rich pvpers would want slaves halos and snakes not 5swant a divide between the richpoor then become a supplier explore the virgin spice market expand the spice business and exploit the poor masses that will rely on the new spice namely by force or marketeering its for the latinum baby
the empiredwellers have a nice income if they care enough to read up on how to run missions with practically no risk i dont see a problem with that it is way to easy to make isk in empire as it is noone should be able to complain about being poor and living in empire those that want to reduce the jc timer need to rethink that it would create more problems than solutions
05 i like the idea of player crafted boosters replacing the attribute implants however i would like to see the effects destroyed upon death just make the resourcesmanufacturing for the higher level boosters 5 skills available only in null sec so wh
i like the direction this is going
intriguing idea
dock to original preincarna hangar disembark button just above the undock buttonsimpleedit just worked out how to do the thumbs up thing
1 theres no need at all to know how much aurum you have in your wallet tab display it on the next store the same way as loyalty points are no need to force  on us we dont want
pretty sure you guys are making a mountain out of a mole hill the current location is just fine if having a zero aurum balance staring you in the face is that offensive maybe its time to stop being cry babies and put some aurum in your wallet by your mentality because i dont do industry stuff the industry button on the the left of my screen should be removed get a grip already
i see what you are getting at but you are missing out or some much better alternatives ways to go about this real life markets have lots of interesting ways to deal with changing prices stops and options and futures and even buy orders that can be programmed a bit more advanced than the current ones the exist in eve so in one sense i think we should add into eve some botlike capability which would be available to everyone in the game and quickly put an end to botters on the market when everyone can have their market orders update automatically and beat each other by 01 isk up to their per set stop point you will be a much more competitive market the auto updating will run the sell price right down to the buy price very quickly and virtually eliminate the entire point of trader bots in the first place
agreed i would be happy with this
i respect what you are saying but the problem is that for nonlazy traders managing 300 orders essentially makes us lazy traders because no human can update that many orders fast enough 1 updatehourso did ccp just make a mistake in adding those skills that seem to have no practical use in the gameor are they saying by way of game mechanics that they dont want any nonlazy traders with many orders out therei dont mind it as long as i can either1 delegate some orders with precise instructions to a bot2 delegate some orders with precise instructions to a human friend3 able to set precise instructions to update orders in the existing market interface so that i can update orders faster that once per hour
you say that someone with 305 open orders is at a disadvantage because he cant update his orders fast enough to compete with some who has 5 orders open that he needs to be able to update near instantly with a boti say someone with 300 orders open is at a tremendous advantage over someone with only 5 open sure the guy with 5 may sneak some buyingselling in while yo update your 300 orders but you have 295 orders that he doesntyoure making your isk on sheer volume at that level and like a  ton more of it then someone with 5 buy orders upall allowing boting would do imo is make it so already very well established traders have even more capability to drive out smaller competition and corner regional markets 237thats the other thing about bots they dont sleep someone with enough capital and a bot could very easily lock down some of the small regional markets 365237 the only thing holding them back at present being the fact they cant be loged in all the timeso no no bots its just a bad idea
honestly ccp should just build more market tools that are opened by skill training that will take over the functions people are currently using market bots to do evens the playing field what are the downsides to that it definitely makes the game more realistic people can buy automated ordershipetc software in modern times i cant imagine my serious business spaceship pilot wouldnt have access to such software
right but what you are saying is that the more orders you have the less able to stay on top of them you should be but thats okay you have more orders out therefore you make more money all that is true save the last part more orders do not mean more money generally speaking you have have 10 orders of 1 unit or 1 order of 10 would be the samei would be happy with a bot that only worked while i was online and not afk if you figure out a way to ensure thisor just let me delegate to a personto spice up the discussion i belive that most overlook the negatives to the user of a market bot almost always people think that bots are one way boosts for their users therefore is a cheat yes mining and missioning bots are but market bots have both good and bad sides for the trader using them they are simplistic and therefore can be gamed and manipulated by a human you can push prices up or down have them follow then dump onto them etc etcwhat im saying is that the users of trading bots will be burned sometimes as a downside along with the upsides its not an i win button for traders
while i agree that its not an iwin button by any means i also fear that it would become something of a requirement to compete on a large scale even between higher volume traders since two people with 300 orders to update one with a bot one without engaging in 01 games well obviously the bot will win that every timei do rather like the idea of being able to game a bot through driving the prices and then dumping on them though brings to mind ideas of buying low in one region hauling in slowly driving the price the bot is buying for up then dumping hard on himafter rexamining what youve said i have to say im not 100 sure it would be a bad thing the only real misgiving i still have is 365237 bots if they found a way around that which i find doubtful it might not be all that bad
lol i cant argue with that for me though that does not justify the introduction of botsccp gives us tools we decide how to use them suppose you did have a full rack of 305 orders you dont have to update all 305 you could be lazy on 290 and only focus on the 15 moment to momentsome of mine take months to cycle some i turn in 24 hours depends on my mood and if there is a spread that can be exploited at the moment1 i think we can be pretty sure ccp isnt going to allow market bots2 sadly this doesnt work and even if it did i wouldnt trust most people not to screw up anyway 3 yes a different type of order call it a move order that automatically shifted along with the high buy or the low sell as the case may be would eliminate the need you describe it would also have the effect of squashing spreads that may or may not be a bad thing as a lazy trend trader it would be good for me but would end up as bad for the people that do not mind updating all their ordersmaybe shift your strategy just focus on the things with a decent spread and good volume chances are that opportunity will shift around anyway
i agree with your opinion against botting but you are missing one key point jita is already dominated by bots it is currently against the eula but marketing bots are almost impossible to catch and if they do catch them they need solid proof before they ban the account or they will risk banning someone who does not use a bot but is just very intelligent and dedicated however the botting is bad enough now if they made in acceptable then it would be 100 times worse i say leave it as it is and keep trying to eliminate the bots i do like the idea though of making the market more complex with more skills allowing more detailed market orders and trending make the market more interesting and more challenging the true traders will love it even more
its all been said here
it would be nice to have that a twotier role1 start jobs only2 start and cancel jobssupport
makes sense however would a corp member with just roles to start their own jobs and not to cancel others jobs be able to cancel corp jobs that they themselves started
this easily fix just look jita they neut can rr you pirate should sec up no griefonly dumb go low sec

dude if youre not making enough in 00 or whs or even many highsec activities to fund another account with plex youre doing something wronghell even setting up a nearly totally passive income research alt will fund itself and a second or even third account with plex bought via its datacore and blueprint research profitsi mean this is not hard yes  it requires an initial rep grind and training time omg i actually have to play the game to achieve what i want but once setup it requires only a few minutes maintenance per week and the isk rolls in i should know  cause its exactly what i dopeople need to stop whinging and do the hard work to get the reward later on bunch of lazy selftentitled crybabies ugg
the ops suggestion is actually very useful for alot of reasons lets say you need a cyno or hauler alt that dont really require alot of skillpoints it might not be worth to keep plexing a new account for this simple use but paying a one time fee on a plex for a 2nd temporary training slot wouldi actually like this
hopefully its not too much later id like to get some operations going soon this is going to make the payout much easier
im interested in this program please send me an evemail with the details
that is so much more polished than mine how are you getting prices here is my source
that makes even less sense the number of old characters on the bazaar would decline completely as they are all harvested for their sp
omg youre so arrogant you dont care what the playerbase thinks you dont care there were massive protests against mt recently you dont care ccp acknowledges themselves mt for nonvanity items would be harmful to eve you dont care about simple economics and to top it all off you treat csm meissa anunthiel in the most arrogant condescending manner possibleyoure so arrogant its incredible laughs in disbelief how does someone get this arrogant and self entitled do you even comprehend youre revoltingly arrogant
oh yeah sorry i forgot that instead of 1200 players in jita on a normal day there were 2000 players total some of which were protesting against mt yet mt has been implemented and its here to stay unlike the protests which fizzled as soon as it wasnt fashionable to shoot the monument anymore so yes you are right i dont care that some people are opposed to mt which is the same attitude you have for not caring about the people who are in support of mt got anything other than that to hit me withccp has merely said that they will not sell items that give you an unfair advantage in the nex store the fact that ccp is selling plex already proves that ccp doesnt consider spending rl cash on ingame currency which is then used to purchase characters as an unfair advantage do you know why that is because for every 20 bil character that was bought with plex ccp made 900 in cold hard cash twice once for the original subscription to get the character to the sp and once from the guy who bought 60 plexes to pay for itin addition this thread isnt about ingame items like ships ammo bpos etc its about skillpoints and someone who obtains skillpoints via cash which is already possible today does not have an unfair advantage over someone whos been gaining skillpoints at a normal ratesimple economics are that according to the qen q4 2010 plex is the item with the highest trade value on any given day and the trade volume of plex is growing constantly let me put it into simpler terms for you lots of people want to dump money into eve and ccp wants that money those are some pretty simple economics and i do care about themwhat i did do is thank meissa for his service even though it is meaningless that the csm is irrelevant isnt meissas fault the csm is a marketing tool to manipulate customers into believing that they have a stake in what decisions are made but the reality is that ccp does what ccp wants to do whether the csm agrees or not
so you ignore that the protests were against nonvanity mt being even considered by ccp do you think anyone here missed your lame attempt to try and ignore thatif it isnt clear to you that people being able to buy their way to whatever high level skills they want is harmful to eve then you dont understand the whole point of games and why things are high level in the first place disbelief do you not understand what games are the whole point of games ill give you a clue  its about overcoming challenges and the reward that brings  not buying your way to everything with zero efforti have no idea what on earth youre trying to say about plex above but the reason plex is not harmful to eve is and i repeat myself here as so many have you already you arrogant moron a plex required the original buyer to pay ccp with rl money so ccp still gets paid for the sub and b plex bought ingame requires ingame player effort and time to earnuhhh yes they do duh how exactly is buying your way to what others had to spent time and effort on not an unfair advantage how please use logic and reason to explain why because no one here with any brains can work that one out not players not csm not other notable players not the press not ccpsimple economics are that according to the qen q4 2010 plex is the item with the highest trade value on any given day and the trade volume of plex is growing constantly let me put it into simpler terms for you lots of people want to dump money into eve and ccp wants that money those are some pretty simple economics and i do care about them
let me lay out some mistaken assumptions that many of then proponents of this thread seem to havei am going to avoid quoting any specific response as it seems some people on the thread have a penchant for going off topic into personal attacks or irrelevant arguments so hopefully a generic response will avoid triggering any testosterone kneejerk reactions misconceptions1 a new player in eve you should be allowed to catch up with vet players who have been playing a long time this is sometimes called the rubber banding ai cheat in racing games the basic premise is that people or ai cars who fall far behind the leader gets game mechanic boosts in order to level the playing field allowing them to catch up this is neither a desired feature nor a necessary one in eve not desirableeve is a complete economic sandbox it tries to be a mirror to rl where it can you dont get a boost when you start working at mcdonalds because you started 3 years later it would be unfair to the people who started 3 years earlier and are already managers best you should do is make some manager friendsnot necessaryrich players or vet players are not competing with beginning players they are not ratting in highsec or mining veldspar they are busy building their empires running their alliance or strategizing about which null sec sector to move into as you move up the corporate ladder you do bigger and better things your life doesnt necessarily get easier mind you a beginner may not be able to match the skills of a vet but skills dont mean everything they only are important in a fair toe to toe fight and if you find yourself in one you did something wrong you can always outsmart or get the jump on someone with higher skills2 its a just a vocal minority against mt etc etc all the arguments in this bucket are irrelevant as they point to either  people in jita number of users who actually read these forums etc etcboth sides are guilty of fallacy if you are making any argument based on this premise instead think of it as a havenots vs haves discussion what this proposal amounts to is a metagame method by which you can improve your gamein the real world this is called corruption using a friend of the family to get you that promotion bribing politicians to get your bills passed insider trading etc using means outside the boundaries of the system in order gain an advantage in the system now i have pointed out many times already that yes these metagame loopholes already exist in plexisk but a why justify making another loophole b plex prices are at least governed by some other supplydemand factors selling sp for  at a fixed rate is a level of magnitude worse as it is direct and at a fixed pricehaving both an isk cheat and an sp cheat is so detrimental to the game community it should be obvious any rationally minded person3 whats the harm in this change what if we did allow beginners to jump ahead in skill points it will be good for the myopic yes sure we all want more beginners to enjoy eve but you have to remember that any beginner only boost will either be grievously unfair to those who came before that did not have the option to speed up their learning or it will be used and abused by everyone just because it can be used for good for noobs doesnt mean that isk rich players wont use it as well and like an arms race if you can fly that carrier before your enemies then you win so everyone who can afford it will start buying sp like pancakes on shrove tuesday who loses all the casual players who dont want to spend 50usd a month just to keep up congratulations that probably is mostly the beginners and noobs that this proposal was supposed to helpyou have effectively made game balance a metagame controlled contest going to whoever wants to spend the most usd bribery
continuedlmao  so you treat csm with contempt and its all a conspiracy against players like you who if only allowed to buy your way into easy cheat mode youd be fulfilled and would have won against us nasty players who like to force effort and challenge onto you in gameshow tragic youre forced to play games that are competitive with other players willing to abide by the rules and succeed it must be awful to finally be in a situation where everybody doesnt automatically win as with al past games in your life where your parents made sure little humpink was never exposed to challenge or the possibility of failure it must be extremely disturbing to you to discover you actually have to work hard to achieve and even then you may not succeed or be able to manage everything under the sun how appalling youre now forced to realise you and life has limitations and you cant do and be anything you wantreally  i feel for you it must be so horrible to deal with what games actually are you poor poor thing it totally excuses your extreme arrogance laziness selfishness and condescensionthere there there there
you have a misconception about the misconception perhaps others in this thread have but personally i am not advocating that a new player can catch up to any old player the comment about cash allowing one to buy an advantage in my first post was merely to get the discussion goingi do think that any player new or old should have the ability to create a new character which allows the player to experience a larger portion of the game from day 1sorry to say that your analogy with rl employment fails thats three for three on the analogy side the comparison to mcdonalds fails because skill training is completely passive all vets had to do was pay and waitskillpoints determine which parts of the game one can experience to what degree new players or alts or younger existing players are denied access to aspects of the game simply because they due to no fault of their own havent been playing the game for as long as othersthe flaw in eve is that skillpoints can not be gained through effort the rate at which they are gained is fairly constant within a range in other mmos you can progress faster if you put in more active playtime in eve you can not this is by design but its just to illustrate that players are powerless when it comes to gaining sp beyond the 2400 sphr or whatever the max issorry again the comparison just doesnt work because buying sp for cash is nothing like corruption irlits much more fitting to compare an eve character to a nice 2600 sqft house with a double wide detached garage and a pool in back you can build the house on your own time a few hours a day after work and on your days off and it will take you a few years to get it done alternatively you can pay a contractor to build it for you and have it ready in just one summer its more expensive to have someone else build it but to the buyer that expense is worth itits not a loophole its an intended and highly profitable feature it wasnt introduced by accident and its not something that till be fixed it was created with purpose in mind to address the needs of the consumer thats what businesses do they find out what consumers want and then come up with ways to make that happen and make profitlets just give the proponents the benefit of a doubt and assume that they arent all total s i dont see how it would be detrimental yes there would be some emo rage but apart from that actual reasonable detriment still needs to be pointed out it wouldnt be unfair since the option will be available to everyone times past are sunk cost if you will they have no bearing on the current or the future
you fail to realize that gaining skillpoints is not competitive skillpoints are gained at the same rate for everyone allowing minor variations in sphr depending on attributes and implants player skill has no impact on gaining skillpoints all a player does is pay for the skillpoints and waitif you want to make an argument against buying sp for cash then make one that at the very least makes some sense because describing skillpoint gain as a competitive activity makes no sense at all
look at wow every player there is at the level cap or is desperately grinding towards the level cap so they can start playing the actual game people below the level cap bah theyre useless in everything nobody wants them at all for what they are excepting as level caps in the making so wow despite being an rpg with levels actually has very little to do with experience and levels at the real meat of the game this is what wed face herewhats that you havent ground to level 5 in amarr supercarrier yet you havent maxed out all your skills youre useless p1ss offonce more it would come down to equipment but theres not enough variety in pve or even the selection of equipment available to make that worthwhile an exaggerated example maybe but my bet is wed start seeing this kind of thing within weeks of the ability to grind sp coming in
indeed also for the umpteenth time i point out that one of the great things about eve is that even a very new player in a low level ship can be useful as part of a team eg scouts tacklers haulers or solo it is not necessary to be flying an insert very high level ship and fit here in most roles its not even desirablethose with massive entitlement issues in this thread need to get over their hard on for high level skills and just play the bloody game or better yet just move on everyone else is playing the game and the vast majority are getting by just fine without years of skills under their beltscry me a river you cant do xyz high level thing in eve yet diddums youve still an entire sandbox of options the vast majority of which are open to anyone with a couple months training time under their belts if thats too hard for you then you need to either harden the  up or  off stop ing whinging here
you know what  youre 100 right and make total sense skill training time is utterly without value there is nothing competative about the effort required to gather the resorces and build the infrastructure to utilise those high level skills in the highest levels of industry and combatthus i propose every player be given 10000000000 skill points upon account activation its not right they should have to do anything but fly the very highest level ships equip the very highest level mods and run the highest level iundustry and research jobs from day one ignoring how useful all those other ships and jobs are and the sense of value players get from having taken the time to train high skills i think every player should get every single skill handed to them on a silver platter awesome ideamy name is toovhon and i endorse this grand idiocy 
maybe you should stick to console games thenmaybe you should stop wasting time trying to figure out the problems with my analogies and more on figuring out why your proposal is ridiculousyou say flaw i say by design really your analogy relies on you using money to get the house built money that you earn in rl to use on something in rl that is not the same as using rl money to get you something in eve economy please look up the definition of metagaming before you continue with any analogies
so what you are arguing is that you start wow and you should be able to buy that super 10 armor and vorpal sword 20 just because you are a rich brat whos daddy gives you 100 a month allowance what a horrible world new eden will become if every rich brat could get whatever they wanted when they wanted i think it is sufficient to say that the argument has been made and proven beyond any doubt here i dont think i need to say anything else on the matter
ow dude friendly firetry reading it properly and look at the inflections and word choices and then see whether i support this idea
oops sorry im neither dude nor american so sorry if i missed sarcasm
im also australian not american if thats what you are implying
outside of tacklers and ewar ships its t2 or gtfo if you want to have a successful roam so yea its basically whats that you havent ground to level 5 in amarr supercarrier yet you havent maxed out all your skills youre useless p1ss off already
au contraire sixthgraders and firstgraders are both on the same playground namely school the former just happens to be way further ahead of the latter yes the sixthgrader has a clear edge but its not an any unfair advantage his advantage just stems from having been in school longer in terms of eve the sixthgrader is simply in a different league hes dealing with sovereignty and supercaps while the newbie just lost his first destroyer in a lv 1 mission yet each player has to go thru the exact same motions of completing skills without the ability to buy himself into a supertraining pack for aur thats what makes it all balancedadd to this that the difference between a vet and a newer player is mitigated by game mechanics that are available to the newer player as well if you can fly a scorpion and you can ecm a bit you can jam the vet nothing he can do about it except use his brains and experience to prevent such an encounter perhapsso i reiterate that some people having considerably more sp than others does not in any way shape or form make the game unbalanced and no aurforsp should ever be introduced for the purpose of rebalancing said sp differences
sp means nothing and vets are so afraid of being catched up they call it cheat if others bullet cause the same damage as theirs do really sadvets have advantage in real life they also get old and die so the young eventually catch up do you want that happen to your character so stop talking about rl its just game design and i must say that as a game design sp is a terrible failure its nothing about justice or necessity or any theory it is a failure because that as a game design it does drive newbies away newbies have so many better choices than getting bored out waiting or playing vulnerable prey for someone they can never catch up to have the chance to fight backan average player does start a game with some competive mind no matter it is correct or not to you and they do leave as soon as they realize that there is no chance of equality what will be your choice if your only choice is either play constricted content or get blowed up and trolled in a video game i prefer real life where at least robbers dont get insurance pay and sixthgrades are not free to beat up the younger this problem is so predictable as i wonder how could ccp made this mistake at first if they intended to run the game in longterm
newbies as you say can only be useful for scouts haulers tacklers and then after 3 months maybe a really crappy drake pilotwow are you guys dense to see the hold back new player skill limitations are and why it makes most newbies quiti could care less about skill points for people over 50 million sp what im saying is new players are lost daily to having no options open to them to progress upto a level where they can really be useful and enjoy eve in pvp and enjoying high level missionssure skill points are an incredibly useful part of the game that builds growth and things to look forward too but new players really should be cut some slack so the new player quit ratio is lower amazed ccps let it go on this long how many people joined and quit after they hit some 3 week brick wall in training and didnt want to run low level super repetivie level 3 missions 100000s thats how manysay what you want you cant deny the new player experience sucks and loses the eve universe a huge amount of new players because its too harsh and too freaking limiting and boring
then youre joining the wrong roams i regularly fly in fun roams in ships not requiring more than a couple months to get into suitably decent fits ive also seen many corps and groups of friends running roams that include month old characters yes  their choice of roles is limited at that point but so is what you can do at the beginning of any rpg mmo or not i dont recall running molten core on a level 10 druid in vanilla wow eithermore likely your use of you havent ground to level 5 in amarr supercarrier yet simply shows you have no idea of the variety most roaming gangs fly or fit if you think thats the only suitable option im sorry you have such a low opinion of any other role but dpsing supercap but all that says to me is eve is really not the game for you
althought im for sp for plex there is a very good argument against it  in opposite to bazaar method the amount of high skilled toons could explode if this happens it could force a skill race ccp has to fall a decision  freedom of individual purpose vs less freedom and more or less equality like we have it now you can find good arguments in this discussion for both proposals this decision is more of a moral kind its like is greed good  if you seek personal freedom you say yes if not no i choose yes
yes there is equality among their peers people with a comparable sp count and they can level the playing field and even win skirmishes when using superior numbers andor smart tacticsand btw what do you think vets are there have all been noobs too at some point and yet they didnt run away either did they so if you mean that eve is not for the instantgratification crowd that wants to play in the major league today then youre right it isntso all a new player really cant do is fly a supercap yet but within his own league he can be every bit as competitive as the vet in his nyx thats the charm of eve
good on ya for totally ignoring everything you can do and everywhere you can go as a new low sp player gosh its such a closed off universe isnt it well at least it is when you see anything less than flying a supercap as having fun dit didnt drive me away but then i didnt foolishly see doing something requiring high level skills as the the only thing worth doing stuff i did in my first monthlevel iv missions as part of a fleet during my first couple days ingame in fact  great fun  my ceo taught me how to play and handle myself so i didnt die too often and knew how to handle basic fleet mechanicssolo missioning up to level iis which also meant getting my first cruiser  a vexor  and drones love pet classes grins miningmy first venture into lowsec guided by a more experienced mate i made in my rookie corp  scary but funsalvaging other peoples mission  the isk was rolling in now some low level exploration  thank the powers for the youtube video on how to probe hehnone of which required high level skills unless you count the ability communicate and meet people willing to game together and all of which were great funmaybe you should stop worrying about what others are doing and start enjoying what youre capable of right now if you take the attitude that nothing but insert very high level skill is worth a damn of course youre not going to have fun in eve or if you associate with people who only ever say that  same resultive never stopped having fun in eve right from day one to now when im flying a typhoon fleet issue the most skill intensive t1 noncap ship in eve in missions various navy frigates and stealth bombers in roams t2 mining barges for ore and ice run research operations spanning minmatar and gallente space etc etci still cant fly a cap ship i dont care that i cant fly a capital i havent even bothered training towards flying a capinstead i took my first ceos advice and took a shorter term view towards having fun in eve i first worked on training up battlecruisers as the bc is the easiest way to start running harder content  even wormholes in a gang later i built on those skills to get into battleships but only after id spent a couple months getting my bc skills up to a decent level which helped a lot when it came time to run my new bs as a lot of the skill bonuses applied to my bses fit tooi also spent a lot of time building up my mining industry and science skills as those were areas of interest as wellbut the point
is that i didnt try to train to fly a capital or any other high level skill immediately i didnt even try to fly a bs till i was several months into eve was i making less isk than cap pilots in 00 was i taking part in smaller less important operations yes and yes was i still having a bunch of fun and earning more than enough isk to fund my new ventures yes againyouve got a massive hard on for high level skills andor youre associating with eve players who either dont want more low level players or foolishly look down upon them well im sorry if this sounds harsh  but thats your fault take some personal responsibility and get rid of the idea you need to fly a capital or be earning 100s of mil per day to be having fun and stop associating with people who belittle you though frankly im inclined to believe this is a mental issue of your own makingim telling you and heaps of other players will tell you the same there are plenty of opportunities for new players in eve and players more than willing to group with and help them outfor that matter  im really rather curious would you mind telling me why in your case you think lower level skill activities in eve are not fun for you i really want to know perhaps i can help you see there are other fun options that dont involve ing eve for everyonefinally accept you will not succeed in ing eve the vast majority of players wouldnt stand for it ccp wouldnt stand for it it is not going to happen so deal with it please stop whinging and start being proactive with your own experience
and thank you toovhon for putting into words what i could only descrive as a feeling of horror at the concepts being expressed in this thread
ha thanks zephy its a rant thats been building up since the mt riots brought every forum troll crank fool and whinger to the surface a couple weeks ago im just glad it turned out semireadable though realistically i doubt it will have much effect these cranks and whingers seem more interested in whinging than being proactive in their own play still i feel a bit better having said it all hehsee ya starside
hii hope the op still reads this thread in a nutshell the massive difference between plex for isk and then isk for charactersingame items and plex for items or skillpoints is injectionccp have plex being sold to players for ingame currency because the currency is generated at a normal pace the same goes for selling characters they were trained at a regular paceto sell skillpoints or items that were not created by normal means time investment looting etc is the fastest way to break an economy like eves it will also quickly change the dynamic of the game if thousands of people can quickly buy their way into a particular type of shipi hope that explains why your idea while theoretically fine is fundamentally game breaking
didnt read whole thread but imo they should sell partial respecs instead of sp like 1m sp respec of skills of choice 2m 5m max or so onetwo months delay between respecs no full respec though
i agree with humpink that skillpoint sp should be allowed to be brought with rl cash even if one buys sp one still needs the isk to buy the skillbooks ship and etcthe reason i support buying of sp is purely personal i was unable to play eve due to rl issues these issues have are gone now and i am back playing but i am a full two years behind on sp training i would love a game mechanic so i could catch up on those skill point training
well you dont really need to worry about me that much or try that hard to argue with me the game didnt bother me that much i subbed and moved on just enjoying some last whine while dying outi understand your point although there are many unplesant in the game you chose to overcomeor enjoy it with your patience and optimism etc thats good personality of you you r a life enjoyer and i chose to simply unsub it is not saying that i dont have the good personality as you do it is just i dont see the point of using my patience and optimism in a video game i pay ccp not the opposite and i pay for some simple entertainment of flying spaceship not for some harsh lesson to learn you see a game as the best place to use your good personality while i dont so when i realized that it is 3 years ahead of flying the ship i like and one can never have a revenge to the sixthgraders i blame ccp rather than quited playersto newbies it is simply not 15 dollar per month worth entertainmentactually i personally as a player can go with the skill stuff i quited more because the game has too many broken stuff to be merely called finished as somewhat a designer myself i will be very shamed to sell these crap ui and flawed system to the customer and i see skill system as one big money disperser too thats why i reply here
respecs only make sense to me in games with a fixed skill point allocation eg wowif you train as a miner in eve and then decide to train as a missioner or researcher for example your mining skills have not become useless nor are they stopping you from training something else youre simply not using them right nowtradeoffs and choices are a key part of gaming and life in general do i go left or right in this fps level do i bring my exploding cherries or walnuts in this plants vs zombies level do i train to fly a freighter or a stealth bomber in eve i have to make a choice which to prioritise if i could respec i wouldnt have to make these choices or tradeoffs i could just throw my sps into one skill and bump up its relevant attributes to maximise training time then later i could put those sps into whatever i feel like at the timeno having to make difficult choices no having to live with your choices that smacks of easy mode to me and i dont play eve to have no choices or challenges and i say again its unnecessary given you can can switch your training any time and once more  you dont need to have skills at a high level to enjoy eve
little humpink is far too impressed with wealth to have actually grown up with it
this is not a flaw in eve it is one of the selling points of eve it is also one of the selling points of dust according to one of the blurbs its a flaw to you because you cant use your welfare check to pay for sps
well i still think youre overlooking an awful lot of fun that can be had with lower level ships its not just an optimistic attitude on my part truth be told im actually quite a cynical person d certainly i was highly critical and downcast about ccp during the recent protests over mt and incarnas shoddiness and focus on fluff and new features over fixing and improving current featuresbut anyway  some of the best fun ive had in eve was flying the smallest ships big ships in big fleets are not actually that exciting most of the time seriously small gang roams in smaller ships have been some of the most heart pounding frenetic fun ive ever had in eve i agree 100 about ccps general crappiness when it comes to buggy code testing listening to testers and feature and commitment adhd i myself am taking a break when my current sub runs out in about 40 days as protest against this as well as recent attitudes towards customers that were revealed in leaks leading up to the riotsi am pleased by the results of the recent emergency csm summit but id like to see some action from ccp before i start trusting them againi also admit a break from eve is a great excuse to play some of the other games that have piled up unplayed while my mmo addiction runs rampant  not to mention some rl projects that have gone neglected too for long hehanyway go well and i hope you find an mmo that better suits you did jumpgate 2 ever come out
trololololol
not sure what game you are playing but if you are talking 00 alliances thats what is largely already happening if you cant flyfit a fleet fit bs then you are in many cases not allowed to join less than 10152025 mil sp nope sorry go back to empire noobunless you never leave empire you will run into discrimination based on skillpoints all over dont make me link recruitment threads to illustrate the point just have a look at it yourselfthe bottom line is that it should be up to the player to decide which ship he or she finds necessary or desirable to fly preferably without having to wait a couple of years to do sothe thing to consider is that it isnt 2003 anymore back in the day there was very little true competition for good games today things are vastly different ndp released their 2011 gaming report stating that over 40 of all game purchases were made from mobile devices the gaming population is extremely fractured between pc consoles and mobile devices in addition people tend to simply have less time in 2007 ccp released some stats saying the average age of the eve player was 27 years old thats working adults people who have to think about how to spend their very limited entertainment time to their maximum entertainment benefit those selfish bastards when looking at it from that perspective then eve is simply not a good choice while some vets may have their head in the sand ccp is well aware that eve holds very little appeal to the casual gamer selling sp for cash in some controlled fashion would raise the appeal and the profits
not sure want blurbs you are reading but dust will be 100 mt based want a better gun or better ammo pay for it
blurbs such as the ones you ignore you do have this habit of ignoring whatever it is you do not like
first of all i wouldnt want a new player in a serious 00 fleet fighting over sov even if they could easy cheat mode their way into a decently fit bs right off the bat i doubt they could fly it for more than five minutes without it turning into a pretty ball of plasma andor ing off the fc by not knowing wtf to dosecondly once again you treat anything that isnt 00 fleet warfare in big ships as some kind of lesser activity lacking fun not ime not in most players experiences i repeat  ive had some of my best moments in eve in small fleets of frigate to bc size ships in lowsec highsec and wh space my times in 00 by contrast have not been as exciting so far if you really think massive fleet warfare is some kind of crazy nonstop joyride well im sorry to be the one to tell you this but by and large it isnt for most pilots involved its enjoyable yes but hardly edge of the seat like the small gang warfare ive taken part inthirdly  if youre not having fun yet its no ones fault but yourself you can try and blame it on not being a big ship in big fleets but sorry  thats not really why see my earlier posts in this thread for more on that subjectonce more with the dismissive attitude towards ships and activities requiring less sps and the bizarre idea that letting every noob immediately fly bses and caps is going to work out well if nothing else instant gratification in mmos works against the very idea behind mmos  the whole point of progression is to give players something to always work towards without goals and rewards over time mmos die a quick death as players burn through everything in a flash then leave boredthis is not a game that lasts two days and then youve done it all its a game where you can play two years and still not have scratched the surface  which is as it should be sighs you really dont get what an mmo is do you
if eve holds very little appeal to the casual gamer then wtf are you still doing here despite it being spelt out to you by ccp just a few days ago in the devblog on the recent summit you still seem to think theyre going to start selling nonvanity stuff like sps in eve im sorry but its beginning to come across as a rather pathetic delusion at this pointthe playerbase is against your absurd gamebreaking ideas ccp is against them csm is against it simple logic dictates your ideas are utterly wrong for a game like eve but nothing seems to register for you what exactly would it take for sense to register for youbecause so far youve tried to portray the vast antimt majority in eve as a minority lmao csm as irrelevant who do you think elected them and made clear what issues matter to them d well and you speak like you think you know what ccp really believes even when your words fly directly in the face of what ccp has said multiple times most recently under great pressure from a very annoyed playerbase an exasperated and more than a little frustrated csm a pr disaster and a stream of unflattering media coveragebut still  none of it registers for youyoure either a super annoying troll or seriously in need of therapy because you sir are badly badly out of touch with reality
noob frigate point mwdfcking hero you do not need to be in a bs to be of use to a fleet or gang all you need to do is listen and learn by doing
ccp tagline eve is realq what is real about instantly being good at whatever you want to learn a nothingin real life things take time to learn and become good at i cant instantly buy zomg brilliance at astrophysics it takes years of studylearningtraining hard work and researchso if ccp wants eve to be real training time stays
on this subthread of corporation worth does it even need to be that complicatedsuppose the shares when you checked on the info market graphetc also showed a dividend history if you see a corp not paying dividends then dont buy it we can calculate pe heck the graph or a new graph could show historical pe along with market historynice data to have would be price dividend history outstanding shares shares owned by the corp largest ten holders how widely held total capitalization leave it up to players to decide if the offering is worth anything or notthis sort of information should be enough to allow wise people to see if a stock is worth its price and in eve since its so easy to scam and shift assets around will having a calculated net worth of a corp be of any real use anyway i wouldnt trust it with your ten foot pole assuming anyone here has a ten foot pole gutter mindsthe information i listed could not be faked but still leaves lots of room for the evil games people like to play
adding another artificial solution to the problem doesnt fix anything it just proves that we can go on and on finding loopholes and you coming up with patches for them i really dont think that this line of argument will be fruitful but just to show you that we can go on foreverso i start up a holding corp leave it running for 3 years day 1 i issue stock to my friends of this corp day 2 i put all the money made from my wh alliance into it the whole bank this includes the treasuries of many corps in my alliance stock price shoots through the roof because stock price is determined by some fixed formula shakes head day 3 we sell our stock make lots of isksuck out all the money out of the holding corp put back into alliance price drops we dont care we sold all shares alreadystock prices heck any commodity cannot be set by a formula it doesnt work if you managed to figure out a way that this would work then you would have invented communism
a step in the right direction but still the problem is that a corp can liquidate all its assets without any say from the shareholders thereby making shareholders essentially powerlessa good start would be to allow shareholders to vote on important corp decisions and having a periodic financial report but this is a sisyphean task as long as directors can pull money outin at will and as long as money moves without regulation in the galaxy there can never be enough trust in the system for people to buy any equity sharesas much as i would love to see this it just wont happen in eve without some big regulatory changes to install trust in the market in credit both personal credit and corporate credit
one of the problems is that money should not be able to flow into and out of a corporate wallet on a whim there has to be a legitimate transaction of business an investment of capital a product purchase or sale or a compensation plan for employees it isnt realistic that a ceo has total control of a corporation without any sort of checks or balances in placethe power should be in the shares not the position if you are a ceo with 100 ownership than that is fine but any corporation trying to sell itself needs to have some sort of accountability in place and i dont mean the honor system kind
even at 100 ownership there are legal restriction on how corporate assets can be used to the people talking about rating agencies lulwut are you talking about bonds there are news companies that specialize in giving people insight into what corporations are doing so they can make mildly educated purchasing decisions when it comes to their stock portfolio but as far as price goes it is based on the going rate the going rate is a supplydemand thing people use many different metrics to determine their own valuation of a stock current ratio pricebook debtequity peg ratio shortfloat short ratio roe and many others to get an idea what direction the stock price will be going in the x timeframe they plan on holding an investment some will forecast future value based on these metrics then run their favorite npv calculation to determine which stock to purchase the calculations are often automated buy orders and sell orders based on changes to these numbers and of course the actual list price the reason we do not have a stock market in eve is because there are no regulations or intercorporate checks and balances such as the locking of assets that can be verified by stock holders and there are no trusted external audits of corporate finances most importantly there are no exchanges would require fairly heavy api traffic if they were playermade and would require a financial incentive to build such a thing
as it stands theres just too many ways for an investor to get screwed with little to no repercussions for corporations or individuals if they do implement a stockmarket it would have to be locked down pretty tight with a pretty transparent money trail
i focus on the data and not on the rules for the stock thing the more rules we request ccp to code the less likely they are to do it setting up data views of things as i suggested is easy setting up some votes to allow the taking down of a pos or moving some cash between wallet divisions is asking more than we can reasonably expect point being the less we request the more were likely to achievei often make this error in my suggestions too id love to see full stocks bonds etc myself what is the minimal needed that can ccp can reasonably deliver
so many threads going on now about the acrid new players experience in eve has gotten me pondering on this topic though many of the solutions suggested in the other threads are not viable nor effective the ones that basically amount to cheat boosts for noobs i believe the problem is a valid one what if the game as in npcs were to award players with medals for achievements carebear stuff for faction empires kills and pvp achievements from pirate factions something like the medal system in fw make these medals visible to all what this addresses is that newbies lack direction or a goal in the beginning they may be coming from linear progression games like wow or other simple mmos they arent used to the sandbox they are overwhelmed with all the choices the career agents go a long way but the sense of achievement is still a little lacking give them trophies for mission grinding for being a good miner etc i think may go a long way to give beginners something to strive for at least until they get their sealegs and venture out on their ownsome medal ideasmissions done by departmentstanding level achievedtypes of asteroids minedamount of asteroids minedfaction loyalty x mission for a faction etckills achieved by enemy npc capsuleercourier contracts completedopen to any other ideas commentsthis is very much an idea only any constructive criticism appreciated
i agree wholeheartedly
yes please while they look great as detail in space as icons they are just blobs
ffs yeah

i doubt it will happen but supported
edit changed the title so it doesnt dance around the topic it gets right to iti actually had an idea somewhat recently for plex to do more without actually deviating from its original purpose game time the idea actually banked on game time but in a different way than it has i was thinking of how you cant train more than one character on an account what would be the reaction to the idea of allowing a plex to unlock the ability to train a second character on the same account for a limited amount of time not only would this be invaluable for certain players but it keeps with the idea of plex for game time and ultimately isnt gamebreaking or altering or whatever from what i can tell but id let my fellow pilots be the judgenot to mention it means another way to consume plexes besides just extending your accounts play time that doesnt involve a secondary currency i figure it could allow anything around a full month adjusted if needed worth of dualcharacter training time per plex especially since its more restricting than having two accounts only one can be active at a time of course but ultimately youd be paying the same amount i imagine the amount of time it affords would have to be finetuned for said balance against both dualboxing subscriptions and maybe even character transfersbut suffice to say i prefer to use one account and essentially pay this would only be appealing to those who can afford plex in isk since dualboxing would probably be more costeffective with real money for a second to allow parallel character developmentalso inloreuniverse for those who are rpconcerned it would be as if the other character was renewing his pilots licensewhat say my fellow capsuleers sensible already suggested and trouncededitpulled from one of my later posts i personally like the idea of training a secondary character on the same account for not necessarily all the time just often enough to get a few useful skills for a secondary character but still being able to use it even if i havent given him extra training time which i couldnt do with a proper alt account admittedly it has selective use but it could be a useful feature to ease someone into wanting to use a proper alt or it could result in people consolidating accounts if they have a vastly large number that they just cant reasonably multiboxbesides i cant imagine this taking that much work to implement but maybe its just that hardwired into the account systemi also reworded the part talking about the amount of time dualtraining  suffice to say the system would need to be balanced in such a way as to be considered useful even when compared to multiboxing as i also stated in the original post and have now added emphasis to
i think its a great idea alejan clearly as you say the cost to training benefit ratio would have to be worked out if the cost were the same as running a second account then one might as well run that second account and then have the benefit of accessing that character in a dual box situation however if the cost were less than running a second account then you would essentially be achieving accelerated training per isk for the alt characters over a normal subscription cost so logically there would have to be a penalty applied to make it only worthwhile for those seriously wanting to drag their alt characters upperhaps ccp could create a place for alts to train like a mobile laboratory but for brain cramming then they could sell another piece of equipment plus the cost of entering said crammeror perhaps keeping it simpler a plex for a fixed period 20 days maybe but you cant access your alt during that 20 day periodbut i think the concept is a great ideaedit after having read the later posts than my original i totally agree with the practice of getting multiple accounts running to enable the training of your alts concurrently if i were to be starting the game from scratch with that information i would probably consider it  although if i were starting from scratch being new to eve then id probably not see the benefit of the multiple characters at that point in time anyway i cant imagine too many new players opting to buy three accounts straight up when there are three character slots to fill in the first accountbeing one of those new to eve players once i fell into the trap of populating all three character slots on my shiny new account then found the shortcoming of only being able to train one at a time so within a few weeks opened a second account to be able to train two at once now though with the original sub alts sitting there on my original account with their meagre skillsets it would be good to drag them up toofor others like me who jumped in feet first creating characters without letting some eve experience sink in idiots maybe but not alone i would think the idea raised in this thread by alejan of perhaps paying some fee to enable multi training seems like a good ideabut with the commonsense comments made by others and being against the pay for skills ideas being floated in other places which conflict with this suggestion i will seriously consider buying another account and transferring one of my subs over so they can train up legitimately interesting debate once the money is spent on a legitimate account or a ccp invention to enable multitraining one account the bottom line is reached we pay to train i personally dont have the mental capacity to multi box more than two characters so thered be no other benefit for me to a third account other than paying for extra trainingmh
i dont get the point you can already use plex to fund an alt and why wouldnt you want that alt to be able to login at the same time even if you dont use it for multiboxing yet but even if the alt is never ever used for multiboxing eg a research agent alt its still simple to logout and login to another account and to fund that other account with plex earned from any other accountso yeah  im failing see any reason why ccp should spend time adding functionality that duplicates existing functionality only in a more limited form
as unlikely as this may seem id have to agree with toovhon on thisif you are willing to spend plex for sp then you may as well do it on a second account and participate in the lively discussion over in this thread its time for ccp to sell skillpoints for rl cash
the thread where humpink continually asserts he wants to buy his way past having to play the game to achieve anything no playing games for him he demands easy mode d
its a good idea but as others have said you can do this by starting a second account as an added benefit of starting a second account rather than training a second character on the same account if you use the buddy system to start the second account you actually get 20 days free game time from the buddy trial on the new account plus a free month on the account that offered the buddy invite if you use the option to convert existing game time to plex than use that plex to activate the second account getting a free month on the first account you basically get 1 month 20 days for free on the new account before you need to start paying for ityou can always pay the 10 bucks later to get that new character transferred to your main account after they are trained after all the training didnt cost you anything so 10 bucks to add a character with almost 2 months skill points enough for a cyno or research alt to your main account is far cheaper than what you are purposing buying two plex to train two months on a second character would cost about 40 this almost sounds like a exploit but as far as i know it is legal it only uses intended game mechanics
i support this although would like to see some more respeclike solution with some kind of sp reimbursement even if with huge penaltyanyway some type of skills deletion is must in this game no point in punishing ppl for their newby mistakes of past
there could be permanent ecm bursts from gate whenever someone aggro
gate guns be able to warp anywhere to hunt you down in high low 00 or whs then proceed to hunt down everyone else in your corp anyone youve ever private chatted with and then the gate gun should use advanced language ai to hire a rl hitman to take out your momonly then will you be able to traverse lowsec without thinking and keeping your eyes open
low sec is where pirates still get a sec penalty for aggro there is a place for it but until drug trade starts up the part it plays is muted sov should not be transferrable in lowsec it is owned by empire or pirate factions after all its not and shouldnt be player claimable space
cynos
do what you like to gate guns well still see you in rancer
ohh thats a good idea you should send that idea into ccp
what about them
so you want low sec to be high sec on gates and at stations i dont see any benefit from this i see this as carebear land extending without any consequences for lazy carebearing
i like the idea but we need to keep in mind that low sec is owned by empires but is contested this means the owning empire does not have full controli like the idea of boosting gate guns but do not link it to security status like in high sec there is no concord in low sec and never should be it is low sec but it would be cool if the navy of the occupying empire did police low sec not uber powerful invulnerable ships like concord has but just normal ships comparable to what players fly if you get attacked at a gate or station in low sec and have a high enough faction standing with the occupying empire they will come to your aidwith the current mechanics low sec is far more dangerous than null sec and that does not seem right to me in player owned space there is no concord but the player corps and alliances that control the space do there own policing making some null sec areas very safe if you have good standing with the players controlling it low sec should be the same but policed by the empires navy this would not only add some security to carebears and other players just passing through but could also add a huge amount of depth to the game this can be done by putting a lot of faction npc ships into low sec these ships would represent the navy of that faction that is there fighting to control the system if there is no empire fighting for control how can it be contested space these ships can then be farmed for tags and to increase your faction with that empires enemies at the same time they will come to the aid of players that have high standing with that faction if you think about it does it not make sense to see empire ships in low sec this is supposed to be a contested area so this should be where two factions are fighting each other for control this is where the wars between the empires is supposed to be happening a huge potential here for missions and players participating in said wars if this was done it would make low sec safer for those that have good standing with the controlling faction not near as safe as high sec but safer than null sec as i understand low sec should be the faction ships would give pirates something to shoot while waiting for their next victim yes it would put an end to low sec gate camps but as some one else already said these camps could just be moved to somewhere along a gate to gate warp path and set up a camp with a interdictor there you can pull them right out of the warp tunnel and into a trap this would be a risk for the pirates if they trapped someone with high standing to the controlling empire the empire navy will warp in to assist just like concord in high sec however the local navy will not be near as effective as concord just normal ships the pirates will just have a few extra ships to kill add to this a chance of faction loot dropping and the pirates should be happy with it maybe even make it so the number and size of ships that come to help scales with faction standings it would be cool on both sides for someone with 9 faction to get ganked and have a dread or officer class ship with escort warp in to help gives a good defense to the player with the high standing maybe they can get away while the help keeps the pirates occupied the pirates still get the benefit of popping the faction ships if there intended prey get away and a huge bonus to the pirates if they kill the player and the faction ships and get officer loot from the elite navy or dread ships i think this could really bring some life and activity to low sec for all sides involved
i support the idea of significantly tougher fire support in low seca bs bc hac caps will pretty much laugh off the those guns i pirate sometimes in low sec at gates but they are really nothing to worry about for even a semiserious pirategate  station security needs a serious boost in damage about 500 more and should be able to attack 34 ships simultaneously
how about gate dmg depending on sec status10 pirates get instant death 5 chars get the dmg nowadayseveryone happy except for the regular lowsec campers
i would like to know why there is no difference in the price of the costmonth in euro or us dollarscurrently 100  144210usd which means that when europeans pay for lets say 1 month they pay 1495 while americans pay for that same month 1495usd  103665now for 1 month this only bothers me a little cause this means that americans pay 45835 less but if you look at this on a 1 year basis that comes down to a difference of 55002now i dont know about other people but id like to spend that 55002 on something other than discriminationi hope this gets looked at because it is outrageous and insulting
also canadians forced to pay more than americans to play eve onlineus currency is so weak right now its not much of an issue
buy gtcs for usd and use those
its called controlling your game better known as america f yea
the only one problem is in a situation where one system is lagged due to a huge battle those in the battle can call for reinforcements who might be able to play at normal speed until they join the battle giving them a timing advantage they would not have otherwisebut then again weighing this con against an unplayable game makes it a worthwhile alternative the metagaming ability to slow down a battle to ensure reinforcements is a worthwhile tradeoff plus it might encourage even bigger more epic battles and they will be playable
supported
then give a thumbs up please
idea approved will be in next patch
at the moment the corp finder doesnt let you filter by rp which i believe you could do before i might be wrong though having that filter would make it a lot more useful at least for me since finding the few corps that have rp among all the others from picking one of the other filters takes a lot of time and effort as is the corp finder isnt useful for anyone wanting a roleplay corporationnot sure if there are other filters people feel like should be there but im pretty sure that the more specific you can be the better the finder becomes
its a good idea but as others have said you can do this by starting a second account as an added benefit of starting a second account rather than training a second character on the same account if you use the buddy system to start the second account you actually get 20 days free game time from the buddy trial on the new account plus a free month on the account that offered the buddy invite if you use the option to convert existing game time to plex than use that plex to activate the second account getting a free month on the first account you basically get 1 month 20 days for free on the new account before you need to start paying for it this almost sounds like a exploit but as far as i know it is legal
reply to topicthat would be a better subject line imo
incarna is a tremendous step backwards in giving the game more functionality the entire content release has been about making things look pretty when i first learned of the option to disable the station environment i was overjoyed every single person ive told about this felt the same way the station environment adds no functionality to the game and in fact detracts from the functionality of the existing game extra load timeso my plea to the csm and ccp is to realize that us players us loyal customers play this game not because we can see flashy  but because we can build we can kill and we can conquer youre trying to make eve like other games ccp but that wont be good for you you dont have a subscriber base because you beat other mmos at what they do best you have a subscriber base because you do something completely different from those mmos say no to peer pressure
posting in a troll thread yo
exactly i dont see how its so integral to be made to walk around if i was a capsuleer i would just sit in my pod and take a nap inbetween runs i would personally feel no need to get out and if they think ship spinning is bad because it breaks immersion cant we just say the capsuleer is using the station security cameras to monitor their own ship taht would make sense to me
its not an integral part of the game its an integral part of making more money if you can see your avatar you become more emotionally attached to it making you more likely to spend money on it thats why they released the cq along with the store people wont spend money on monacles they cant see
honestly the whole idea that we elect csms that are then subject to a complete media blackout due to a nondisclosure agreement is ridiculousrelease the videos release the minutes in the video where something is discussed that cant be revealed to the general public black it out with no sound or tell us how many minutes of the video are missing let us see our csms in action let the players see and hear they are fighting for their electors or be revealed if they are not not letting us see actual discussion has lead most players to believe our csms are straw menccp could have two people dedicate a day each to watching the videos and editing them like this as well as check for nda issues for the cost of a couple monacles this could be done ccp has delayed this way too long we dont want sound bites we dont want colorful mediafriendly quotes we dont want minutes so edited and sterilized they bear no resemblance to the meeting they are from we want to know wtf is going onnow2 subscriptions cancelled until the last 2 meetings are posted in full
edited minutes of meeting your almost as bad as ccp at politics
i too make the request for all minutes and recordings to be made available to the public with no editsccp shouldnt have to approve the minutes to be released the csms are our elected representatives political meetings behind closed doors  voters getting screwed
get lost idiot
alt post 4tl
ieg 4tl tbh
great idea  but certainly option 2 is my favorite having different levels of these agents makes it much more interesting for me you got my vote  option 2 please
no
no
no
no
no
no
no no no i would voter cosmetic only but it just opens the doori have seen this in to many games before it starts with cosmetic then moves on to boosters like buy an implant that will increase skill point training by xx before you know it they will be selling items that affect missions or mining then items that everyone will need to stay on top of the competition in pvpand eventually custom ships and modules and anything else worth havingi will cancel my sub the day this goes beyond vanity items
1 deftcrow youre spoton with this statementits such a simple thing really for three reasons1 players that want to experience wis can and generally wont be the impatient type whereas players that dont want to arent forced to just like wormhol
agreed ive always found attribute implants to be nearly as silly and irritating as learning skills were no matter what clone youre in you feel like youre getting screwed because of your choice
i was illustrating a point but sure if the use of snakes or other more expensive implants pleases you then feel free to substituteso in a long winded way then you will agree with me that this change will flatten the richpoor dividethat is game balance altering and although not all game balance altering changes are a bad thing they need to be well thought out in a procon basis i see nobody on this forum considering the conslet me throw one out just off the top of my head do this then what happens to all the storyline missions which give out juicy implants you gimp them to give out temp boosters instead booster blueprints not exactly the samewhat about everyone who currently have implants do they instantly disappear do people get paid back for them if yes then at what price what about the people who in the game who are training for super caps and are happy to just leave their character dormant and training for 3 months are you not rudely imposing upon their freedom to do that now they must log in every 2 weeks to freshen up their booster i support this discussion going on but i encourage more people to think about the unforeseennegative consequences instead of just basking in the glow of the positives
if theres an option to use boosters that last a whole month think of people on vacation but leaving their character training i might stand by this but also a daily solution would be invaluable for nullsec pilots they would just have to keep a stockpileultimately though i think i like the idea of having both in place and making it so the boosters are incompatible with the implants that give the same bonuses to counteract the boosters and implants advantage some posters have expressed concern about  if it is deemed necessary at least or just have a maximum attribute boost hardcoded in so that someone using 4s for instance could maybe take 1 boosters onlyi still support the classic implants because theyre a solid investment you pay the premiums you get consistent nomaintenance training boost but i also wholeheartedly agree on an alternative especially if it makes good use of an underutilized market
considering that skills train based on the attributes that existed when they started training this is a nonissue reallyeven if the booster expired once you started the skill the entire train time for that skill would still evidence the boosted effect
ah that helps so that means when remapping your current skill wont be slowed down if you are remapping away from its primary or secondary if so this greatly simplifies my issues around remapping timei still think attribute implants can stay in for those willing to risk it for the convenience of not having to keep using the boosters but as i said they either shouldnt be able to use boosters or only gain up to the current maximum bonus
well i havent personally tested it but i think remapping forces your skill to stop progressing you also have to stop your skill progress to add implants but jump cloning out of your 5s while carrier 5 is ticking down for the next 3 weeks will not result in an increase of training time
eve is sadly becoming like second life  giving you shiny nice clothes to wear and taking hard cash for it  next thing you know they will be selling all moons and planets for millions hate the aur  wont have any  ever 
apart from raising this from the dros of cq and the leaked emailanything to balance the playing field and make invention worthwhile in a lot of fields would be a step forwardrather than carrying peme forward from t1 wouldnt it be more logical to allow mepe research on t2 bpcs derived from a successful invention but limit the increase to say 6 stepsthis means that a 6 mepe bpc could be raised to me0pe0 and a me3pe1 could be raised to me3pe5this wouldnt affect those with t2 bpos as they can research them as much as they likeit would also mean that people inventing t2 industrials could build them and compete in the market place as opposed to not botheing as those with t2 bpos just set their price to the max the market is prepared to pay and reap 300 profit
t2 bpos need to be removed or an in game way of getting one needs to be added this will at least be a bandaid
i support the legalization of market botsit would allow the trader to get rid off purely mechanical tasks and instead focus on actual strategiesit would create a new and intellectually highly challenging minigame around algo tradingit would probably improve the overall efficiency of the market and help to bring down buyask spreadsbefore you contest the last point with rl examples consider that we are trading in commodities that there is very few information to process on your average trading day in eve and that we already have time limits on updating ordersif some price changes rapidly the bot author would almost always be right in the assumption that it will return near the old equilibrium soonthere is little information that could justify a rapid price change the occurrence of events that could generate this information is extremely rare patch notes sisi changes  a large part of the market is driven by consumption which should stabilize things considerably and we dont have institutional investors who are forced by policy to cut losses at arbitrary pointsi dont see any real danger of having a flash crash in eve on anything but the most obscure items
exactly my views as well that last point i would go as far to say definitively bring down bidask spreads and make a more efficient market for buyersi play eve just to trade the fact that its one of the only virtual markets in existence is a unique thing we should leverage this on a similar but slightly parallel vein i would love to see a commodities futures exchange open up in eve with pi and manufacturing putting real economic risk on producers wrt spot prices futures contracts would be popular i seem to have forgotten to support my own thread fixed
this would give to much advantage to traders with many skills and isk to invest effectively maing the rich much richer for a whole lot less effort and blocking out new players from the marketits a very bad idea but i can understand why it would be appealing for some
this seems like a really silly ideafirst of i have approx 250 orders out at occasion i have maxed out my orders even if i havent had the opportunity to update all of them at 5 min intervals i can say that most of them was set up with a profit margin for mewith a bot i wouldent have to choose what order i want to really compete in and i would be just as effective across all of my goods hence i and a few others would cut the profit margin to a minimum and effectively closing the market for others to operate in as it is now i cant control all of my orders and some can come in between and make a profit thats why we have the market pvpif i had a bot doing most of the dirty work for me i would probably accept margins so low as 1  05 how many new traders with a few hundreds million isk would think it would be reasonable to invests their earnings for such a low roialot of the playerbase would be cut of from the market sure the mission runners might be able to buy their goods at optimal price levels but is that really why we want to tradei have several accounts i can assure you i would have market bots on everyone of them being able to update 1000 orders would be to good to be part of actual gameplay all i had to do was log on and stay online while i am at work or sleeping that would be the least of my problems we can discuss advantages given to player in different tz as being able to log in after dt and start your bots would be a huge advantagedont think for a second that i would be the only one operating like this to bad for those of you who dont have the isk reserves to be able to hold on to goods for several billions but are dependent on selling stock as fast as you get it more or less 
im with this guyif everyone were allowed to use market bots then eventually everyone would use market bots result would be all buy and sell prices converging and newsmall time traders would have no chance at all it would be a buyers marketwhat i could possibly accept is a hybrid solution with a built in function in the client where you get 1 automatic update per 24 or 48 hours to keep you in the price range if you want to compete more aggressively than that youd have to update your orders manuallyalso the automatic update should not renew the order timeout time so after 3 months on automatic without any manual intervention it should be removed from the marketedit come to think of it the automatic update should probably cost money to use the longer you use it and the more costly the order it gets exponentially more expensive so running on automatic for a week perhaps would be reasonably worth it but if you let it run for 3 months it would be extremely expensiveor allow fully automatic updates but with a much higher broker cost when it changes the priceall of this of course means the mechanic must be added to the clienttldr automatic updates of orders are allowed but much more costly than manual updatesthe longer you have an automatic order and the higher update frequency it has the more expensive it gets

edit changed the title of my thread  its now proposal plex for dualtraining on same accounthey how come i didnt notice this before i made another thread on the same topic only halfaday later with a bit more descriptive a titlerequoting and linking my threads op with minor edits to pull out my introductory leadin on the topicproposal plex for game time but different  alternative to mt
indeed the most useful experience of my first month in eve was being taken under my first ceos wing and given some guidance on how to handle myself in a fleet and common firefights so i didnt  up too badly once real ops beganand as baaldor says  give a noob a tackling frigate some decent instruction and theyve all the potential to be the hero of an encounter young players in cheap ships can and do make a difference 
ive never understood this argument perhaps you dont realize it but it implies that eve isnt hard at all it just takes a long time just because something takes a long time doesnt make it hardthis is a point ive seen people argue in every mmo ive played in this case its quite amusing because to consider training sp in this game to be hard is laughable
i have been keeping an eye on this thread and its amusing to see how various folks are trying to insult the op and he just doesnt take the bait and instead sticks to his message for a forum warrior thats pretty unusual as they tend to be easy to set off loli have been playing the game since the day the first retail copy made it onto the store shelves i am currently down to four accounts with the lowest character at 71mil and the highest at 119mil i would appreciate being able to buy sp because while i dont need a titan pilot i could use a few more jf alts and a few skilled covert cyno alts i would probably buy a couple more trade alts as well i dont have enough room on my existing accounts so i would likely pay for 2 more accounts to hold those characters yes i can buy characters on the bazaar and i have already done that on numerous occasions my issue with the bazaar is that i dont want to pay for skills i dont need call me frugal its not that i cant afford the asking price its that it just rubs me the wrong way to pay a couple bil extra for something i will never ever use i cant stand thatthe injection argument is valid selling limitless sp would break the game for sure but i dont see how limited controlled sp sales would break the game the eve economy has already shown that it can survive controlled injection just fine invention is that controlled injection and it didnt break the game all invention did is lower my profits and i was sore about that but i dealt with it i can see how some people will be sore that others just buy sp but just the same they will deal with their emotional issues and move on the game will be fine
good job ignoring how mmos work with progression and keeping players interested and inspired to play by slowly unlocking new content and kit dont worry  nobody noticed you skipping over this i promise giant flaw in your argument unnoticed totallyalso  if waiting isnt hard why cant you
yes i was also impressed how the op totally rejected all sense time after time way to go op youre a winner only not in logic and reason it seemsthen why dont you undersand how mmos work after all these years hint it has to do with keeping players interestedyour case where apparently you have to keep buying character after character and gosh darn it isnt that a hassle is a bit out of the ordinary to say the least im not sure what youre doing but perhaps youre in the wrong corp or game gestures at sp games over there if youre having to do everything yourself
i really do understand how mmos work i just think that eve is totally unlike other mmos for example in wow once you hit the level cap there is nothing else to do you are limited to raiding the same zone over and over to eventually receive marginally better gear in eve reaching the skillpoint cap does not result in the same outcome the way i see it is that in eve the relationship is inverse to that in wow in wow the higher your level is the less content is available to you because you cannot go back and have a meaningful low level experience in eve you can easily fly that rifter even if you have 600mil sp wow  more skillpoints  fewer options eve  more skillpoints  more optionsthere is no harm in having high sp i believe that people will be more likely to play the game and stick with the game if more content is available to them earlieri agree that my case is not the normi want to be selfsufficient and i want to keep making that isk to me eve isnt as much about pvp as it is to see really big isk numbers its about making profit where everyone else said that it cant be done or that it is too complicated its about being able to just pay for an outpost when my corp is considering to build one but is unsure how to pay for it or being able to reliably run the alliance ship replacement program or any other number of logistics tasks that need to be done i make a lot of isk and i also spend a lot of it on things that dont necessarily benefit me personally being able to do that is what eve is about to me it is were i get my kicks and funi could easily get help hauling or with cynos or even with trades but i dont want that help i want to put in the effort and do it myself i never had anything handed to me in game i paid for my t2 bpos instead of winning them and i never bought a plex for rl cash i know how to make isk and if sp sales would come through i would buy plex with isk and apply those to get aur to buy spthe reason i posted here is to point out that there are people other than spoiled brats with daddys credit card who would have reasons to buy sp for cash if that option were to exist
then youve not been reading very carefully or you are reading selectively and you vote for the proposal so we can draw our own conclusions
it would still be an unfair advantage between the have and have nots think of that poor bastard that can barely pay for condomsbut yeah it is unbalanced it directly affects the game it becomes a race to see who can get something faster better etc etc and you still have no fcking clue how to play the gamemost peeps who buy characters to avoid the progression of the game dont know  about how to play the game and then later rage quit because they get pwned by someone with half the sp but twice the game experience
you say you know how mmos work but then you go right ahead and suggest giving players access to anything right off the bat is fine so i dont think you really do know how mmos workif you really think theres such limited content in eve for new players then i have to say i think were playing two vastly different games as a new player i could have done something different every day of the week i didnt need high level skills for that
the only reason i as a player tolerate plex sales is because in the end i am able to pay for my game with isk introducing a new sp faucet subject to some fortunate individuals income which i dont care how they obtained or how much time they spent obtaining letting them rapidly build super characters in a spaceship game where i and many of my fellow pilots feel spaceship skill and longterm decisions should be key elements in building your ingame persona would ruin something important in the rules of the game for us many have spent 6 7 8 years meticulously plotting their training paths adapting to changes and events what you have or are willing to do irl is irrelevant to mei would rather see plex and character sales removed than direct sp purchasing introduced i would even like to see new proposals for sp accumulation that might solve the lack of interesting or useful stuff for vets to train and most importantly i would rather stick to the statusquo than move in your directioni fully support giving nubs more sp to start though it used to be 100k then it was 900k to help noobs catch up and now its 50k which is complete bull

exactly what i said lack of regulatory body a real scc lack of any form of fiscal prudency money transfers are free and unrestrictedbonds are a good point there is no bond market in eve read in same problem its risky but at least a bond has a coupon and some form of rating though not in game if bonds which are less risky than equity cannot manage to get traded in the game then equity cannot oh they can do this simple enough i think but this will be what will happen1 stocks all go into the market the prices explode upwards2 prices crash and new companies join continuously3 people who are screwed by the corporate manipulation of share prices give up4 stock exchange becomes a dead unused feature no better than a gambling game called tossing a coin
those are certainly risks and could happen could happen no matter what safe guards are put in place the more data and relevant data exposed the more informed a choice can be as with most scams in eve there is always some little detail that doesnt add up i suspect youre right many stocks would just be scams the exchange would have a rough start im also of the opinion that over time well behaved equities would stand out eve would get its own collection of blue chipsbtw here is the bond discussion i was hosting
there is a stock market y kno
thanks for the link a good readone thing that is the problem though is that in real life think about what equity means it means that you have a share of the company what is the fundamental worth of this share sure you can use indicators like eps ebitda etc but these are just markers indicators what is the fundamental worth of a share of stock1 the dividend income stream the company chooses to issue2 the worth of the share when the company is bought out by another mergers and acquisitions1 we have in eve2 we dont there is no mechanic by which a company can have wholly owned subsidiaries and have those sub companies balance sheets all roll back up into a parent company also why do companies acquire others in the real world in the first place they want to take their assets their systems their peoplein eve assets and people move freely and without cost companies have no assets which are not instantly transferable like official bond ownerships debt computers perhaps the only thing would be poss and outposts and office rental contractsof course the biggest elephant in the room is in the real world if your company is going to be taken over you would think twice about stealing company assets and making off with them in the chaos you would be found out and thrown in jail eve has no working judicial system so people would just tear a corps assets away and run for the hills if they were going to be taken overthus take overs would not be donetherefore the price of shares will have no fundamental worth besides dividends payoutshaky but i suppose it may work but it will be no more trustworthy than the current off market bonds that are sold
all good points and i am sure there are many other unknowns as well reasonably ccp isnt going to code all that and if they did with all due respect something about it would be less than ideal so if it is a simpler system to start let players figure out how to use it and abuse it then fix or enhance those thingsif it is a second class of shares as well then ccp doesnt have to potentially break the existing system either

it agree with the author
personally i rather like the fact that the new icons allow me to tell weapons of the same typeandsize apart like say neutron and ion blasters for cruisers because they have a somewhatdistinct profile apart from eachother nowthough they couldnt hurt to make them more distinct either that or you all just need to adjust the saturation on your monitors or video card settingsi do remember getting into a bit of a discussion with a fellow vet where he was saying he had trouble telling the difference between the salvager which has a distinctly greyblue shade from a small tractor beam which seems to have a rather distinct yellow patch on top of it  also has a different profile as with turretsi think i could stand behind using a different angle to portray the turrets in the icons so as to make said somewhatdistinct profiles more distinct but id rather not go back to is this a 150mm or a 200mm pause to read

id be happy if they just made it a little easier to see no need to bring back the old ones if they did then there would be a visual disconnect between the icon and the mounted version in the fitting window which im sure would also break some good gui design rule

actually it is somewhat different i personally like the idea of training a secondary character on the same account for not necessarily all the time just often enough to get a few useful skills for a secondary character but still being able to use it even if i havent given him extra training time which i couldnt do with a proper alt account admittedly it has selective use but it could be a useful feature to ease someone into wanting to use a proper alt or it could result in people consolidating accounts if they have a vastly large number that they just cant reasonably multiboxas for the buy sp  i still argue against this method personally but ill leave that to those who know the reasons not to implement it better and can make their case better suffice to say dont troll my idea with yoursedit besides i cant imagine this taking that much work to implement but maybe its just that hardwired into the account system
curious i could have sworn you dont get the plex reward for the buddy unless the buddy converts the account from a trial into a paid account so youd need another plex beforehand anyway essentially paying 20 right away for this endeavour and then the transfer fee which isnt it 20 itself so its ultimately not more costeffective from what i see unless they changed the transfer cost down to 10 since last i checkededit yep its 20 though i suppose you do still get the free plex to apply to the alt character or you can just get multiple free plexes for inviting friends and getting them to pay or helping them get a plex of their own and apply the plex gift to a sameaccount alt using the proposed mechanicadmittedly this is partly because i have an alt already generated i like his bloodline name etc and would rather not have to regenerate him on a new account ive had him so long hes actually gotten a decent amount of reimbursed sp from the learning skills removal since he started with decent learning skills with how early i generated him nor do i want to stop training my main just to make him more useful he may even have more than enough sp by default to counteract the benefit of a brandnew character with 20 days but i suppose thats rather unlikely
thanks for the vote of confidence in text mind editing or reposting and checking the support this topic checkbox so its more than just intext its under the preview checkbox and above the character dropdownnobody else willing to add their input to this any of the people ive responded to in the threadproper want to give further feedback
you are correctyou dont get the plex until the account is activated but you can convert existing game time on an account into a plex you do not need to buy one i pay in 3 month increments so this works for me even if you spent 20 to buy a plex for this you would still get 1 month 20 days training time rather than just one month so it is still worth itand that plex you bought will add a month game time to your main account when used to activate the buddy account so really 15 of that 20 you would have been spending next month anyway my bad the character transfer is 20 bucks i though it was 10here are the steps1on my main account i will convert game time already paid for into a plexim sure i saw this option in a conversion menu available in the in game options menuesc key2i then send a buddy invite from my main account to myself via email3i accept the buddy invite and start another account with it that gets 20 day trial4i then transfer the converted plex to the trial account5 i use the plex to activate the trial account making it a paid account6 i receive 1 month free game time from the buddy system on my main account basically restoring the game time i used to generate the plexwhen activating a trial account the paid game time is added to the remaining days in the trial but the account is instantly changed from a trial to an active account without losing the 20 day trial time so you basically get a free active account for 1 month 20 days this is enough time to train a cyno alt or researcher if you transfer enough isk to the new character to buy a full set of implants and use you remap wisely you can almost get a character into a hulk or train a great marketing alt in that time then on the last day of that account pay the 20 bucks to transfer that character to an account you actively pay for or if you want after having the extra account for almost 2 months you may want to keep it and just start paying for it i have 3 active accounts but may use this to get a few mil skill points on the alts on my main account without losing training time on my mainthe ops idea is still a good idea i think it is far less hassle then my way i think a lot of players would use it my way just gets an extra 20 days training and a temporary additional account that can be mutiboxed you have to activate the account right away though you can not mutibox a trial with an active account i have tried it does not work
do you somehow imagine repeatedly bumping your own thread somehow makes your pointless idea better
i got it you were part of eve uni you got one of every skill book under 1 mil isk they have some free skillbook policy because you are an ex wow player and like to take it to the max you injected all the books and now have a character with every possible skill attainable for level 1 you realized after you started playing eve that this was a little premature as you realized that having a skill for say mining lasers is not going to make you any better at your now chosen profession and you want to clean up all the extended skill paths in your character sheet and the silly certificates that clutter up your bio as you are a rperwas i close
this is a very good suggestion and well thought out and as a bonus it fits into the storyline and makes sensethough i still like the idea of gate guns working on sec status like highsec just because concord isnt here doesnt mean that a global criminal label need to be ignored by the local navy faction i mean its a global rating given by the global police it means something and as i already mentioned this sec status will be altered dependant on your standing with the local faction so that angle is factored in a global criminal who is friends with amarr will not be shot at by gate guns in amarr lowsecis just a little extra drop in the bucket from your good suggestion of having faction navies patrol and as gate guns arent that powerful as they are its not a big deal to add this
so long as outlaws get dmg boosts against 5 characters to compensate
no to wtfpwn gate guns low sec already sucks beyond belief among other reasons because it severely restrict the type of ship you can use in sight of gate  station guns lets not forget that unless traditional ship guns these sentry guns have perfect tracking and deal full damage even to small drones or a quick moving frigatemake them even more powerful and the only ships pirates will be able to use will be superbuffered bs and capitals stupid idea
bs used to be the only viable ship choice for anything other than a quick gank on gatesstations then we had the blanket ehp buff logistics revamp followed by rigs and suddenly you can sit in cruisershacs almost indefinitely with 12 logis presentnot only does it make camps a lot more effective as locks are faster but they are cheap as hell to establish and hard as hell to kill because the subbs hulls can run that much faster than the fat bsotherwise you are correct they do indeed have infinitracking and omnidamage
remove gate guns in low sec youd see more pew pew

hello ladies and gentlemen of the stellar council chambers i do not currently and have never frequented this place though i found myself talking to some alliancemates about a somewhat bothersome issue an issue which has bothered me for some amount of time but for which i never thought to bring up here now i am here though and hopefully this proposal finds some supportthe local chat tab is a very handy tool not only is it handy for allowing you to chat with the locals but even more importantly it allows you to see who is present in your current solar system this is especially important if youre involved in a declaration of war are the recipient of a war declaration or just happen to be roaming around in lownull security space i imagine that pilots of null security alliances might also be able to relate once i explain the issueas it stands you can only see who is in your local area by having the local chat open unfortunately there is a minimum width of the local chat which is rather wide if you are one using it as an observational tool and not as a means of communication if you want to have the maximum viewing capacity of local persons at once you also have to make it fairly tall this is very nice and almost completely necessary if you happen to be in systems of over hundreds of pilots unfortunately having a very tall local tab with the restraints of the minimum width tend to create a giant block that clutters your interfacethis is how i organize my interface currently please visit your user settings to reenable imagesi was thinking of ways to get around this issue and came up with another layout while it takes less space and gives more viewing capacity it has the limitation of being unable to grab the slider bar to scroll up and down the list quickly meaning you have to click a portrait and then use your mousewheel to slide up and down and view everybody in local an added bonus is the inability to be baited into smacktalkplease visit your user settings to reenable imageswhat i propose is something to make this very painless and simple i photoshopped more like microsoft painted this image to demonstrate what i am proposing although i expect the finished product would look a little better it should at least get the idea acrossplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesmy proposal allow an option to completely remove the chat from local chat tab only display portraits with their standing icons and have a slider bar which allows the player to scroll up and down swiftly in this way people can ignore local chat while still viewing pilots in their system thus minimizing the amount of space used on the interface
pretty straightforward thanks to the crappy font it is sometimes quite hard to say if some system name has an o letter or 0 number make numbers show in green or red or something like that in overview and make it optionalof course with custom fonts that would not be an issue but lets not go there
great idea m8
or change font so o and 0 actually look different enough i like the old style zeros which had that line in middle to tell the differencejust supporting because this needs fixing
simply put the font is terrible ive had a bit of education on typefaces and it may look cool but it ultimately has poor usability as a typefacewhat is the name of this accursed font anyway i think futura would be a better choice or one of the gothic sansi can read it most of the time but i must admit it probably took my brain a bit to work out how to differentiate a better font would probably save me the trouble of correcting fellow corpmateshow about this one zekton free 3000  the 0s are just a bit thinner than the os as is proper with a font and the 1 is clearly distinguishable from the l and i the l and i are the only troublespots from what i can tellthe most important aspect in a font for readability is telling these pairs of characters apart 0o 5s 2z li 8bthat site seems like a good repository this threads got me scanning through it for good technofuturistic fonts that actually have such readability however a good number of them dont even distinguish between capitals and lowercase
well they certainly dont want to charge europeans less and are too afraid to charge anyone else more to equalize the costs and probably rightfully so so youre most likely stuck with it on the other hand if you find it to be of great concern you can probally work a small bit of money magic and pay with usd instead thus paying the lower rate but id venture the guess thatd probably be too much bother
when the subscription rates were set the american currency was still worth something that changed the subscription price didnt
europeans earn more tooin terms of ratio its the same isnt it
short answerccp is a game developer not a currency market speculator they do not care to readjust the prices every time there is a shift in exchange ratesitunes store does the same as do most electronics global companies hey you say what about mcdonalds they adjust their prices to suit the local economy they also have most of the cost of running the shop paid in the local currency and thats the diff
exactly op is missing the point that the extrawhat 55eur is not money that he can cash in any more than he can cash in the fact that he should be getting more salary now because eurusd rate has moved you can only cash in the difference caused by exchange rates by either playing in the xccy market or travelling to another country and using your eur to buy things in essence the two are the sameso no the 55 eur is not your money if it makes you feel any better its not ccps money either ccp actually is losing that money i think iceland is using isk and the 55 eur they gain from the increase in value of eur to usd is lost by losing exactly the same value from the usd side as they have to change both in iskso long story the 55 eur diff is meaningless in fact doesnt even exist
yep when your average income and cost of living drop to what north americas is we can talktill then the prices are fair
europe  america in every way that mattersbetter more affordable educationbetter more affordable healthcarebetter consumer protectionbetter judicial systembetter legislative systembetter economic systemactual history ie no need for worlds biggest ball of yarn to foster a national identityetc etc i kind of feel sorry for the poor wayward colonists sometimes they are living real life like it was a game of risk where only military might matters  kind of sad methinksso lower subscription fees are the worldsccps way of saying keep on trucking there is light at the end of the tunnel
this should only bother you if you are living in europe but get paid in us dollars that is unlikely but if this is the case then you need to sit down with your employerfurthermore even though the us dollar tanked in value as an american i still get paid in us dollars its not like my employer will magically decide to pay me in something else that means on average americans make less money so even though the value is less it is the same ratio of my income as yours
lol  everyone else the eu really needs to work on making a couple more greeces if they want to be as monetarily awesome as the us even absorbing iceland wont save your currency muhahaha
ironically they are trying their best to avoid being as monetarily awesome as the us ie national bankruptcy
totally true you know just 72 years ago europeans started the largest war mankind has ever seen dont be so short sighted
the captains quarters are awesome i love sitting on my space sofa watching my space tv but take a moment to spare a thought for all our space buddies who are stuck in supercapital ships and unable to enjoy such things they will never know the joy of the long walk down the disembarkment ramp never stop to admire their olympian pyhsique in the mirror never see the timely notifications that a new pilot has started their careerthis is why i would like to propose the supercaptains quarters instead of seeing the boring old space view when they log in supercapital pilots should be presented with the bridge of their ship should they wish to navigate in space they can walk over to the navigation display and send commands from a floating holographic representation of nearby space want to target those pesky low skillpoint scrubs rattling their impotent lasers off the hull of your almighty behemoth just saunter over to the targeting computer and pick your foe then another brief walk to the gunnery controls to open firebut what if those irritating proles actually pose a threat to your fine spaceship well then you can just take the lift down to engineering where you will be presented with similar consoles for activating your defensive modules all within mere minutes walk not to mention a nanite paste vending machine that dispenses small portions in return for a small amount of aurumnow obviously by this point youre thinking that its not fair to restrict such wonders to supercapital pilots when everyone could enjoy walking in spaceships but you have to understand they are more important than you their dedication to eve online entitles them to a standard of game not available to mere battleship pilots this is why they truely deserve to be the frontrunners in mandatory incarna integration

how about letting alliances that deploy stations pick a station model in the same racial line as the one being deployed from the various ones available in eve and pay for the customisation in aur this has no effect other than cosmetic and it breaks the boring line of player deployed stations
definetly yes dont care much about the monocle but this could be coolwould also want the option to resize it if i wanted a minitop hat instead if full size and maybe later on a ringmasters circus uniformit is vanity for a reason no rich people can afford to be ecclectic and ridiculous

not if the user experience is anything like i had using cq admitted i am one of the awkward squad running under linux but if the framerate is down laggy and takes an age to load then an alternative of say ship spinning should be available after all we are the paymasters and if ccp gives a damn about keeping their user base then it would i suggest be a good idea to give the players a choice of an agreeable alternative to cq not the dreary static picture currently on offer

i agree with calyp5o spinning the proceedings is not serving the primary purpose of csm you arefor better or worse our representatives with ccp get a grip and let us know what really was said and agreed otherwise you are just shills working to ccps agendaslightly offtopic i know but related is this business of ndas now as our representatives you should be in a position to fully inform us of everything said and done at meetings with ccp if there are things and topics that ccp decide should not be divulged to the peons then you have no business finding out what these topics are put simply if we are not allowed to know then you have no business finding out only ask about things deemed open to all as a commited linux user i am i suppose more averse to ndas and their like than some but this has really rankled and lowered my opinion of the whole csm exercise oh as to the time taken to publish the minutes as a former secretary to a large voluntary association if i had procrastinated for as long i would expect to have been on the end of a very vigorous rocket from the members
i was going to post a big serious postnow all i want to say is that any minutes will be edited but recording should be considered i want to know how many times us subscribers are discussed in a bad way and the general feeling towards the eve community when it comes to planning andor decision makingare we cattle or comradesi have to stop typing or ill textwall this topic with my views restraint 101
yes about time the stock market was started this proposal has my full support would love to see the value of the goons
yeah in aurum value d
hello to everyonefirst  i apologise for any english errornow to the point lately i noticed frequent eve cluster disconnections i must precise my location is in europe  and i didnt have any internet problems during the time i speak of so why ccp doesnt inform players about service disconnections can csm members ask for an aditional site in eve websites with news or info about these interruptions i mean no info that can damage confidentiallity but something like  eve servers are in trouble and will be back soon or service will be back in 30 minutesim asking this cause i loose some time to gather info about this issue and i asure you its not entertaining like calling my isp support checking internet connection waiting something to happen or check reykjavik newspaper websites for possible disasters like the last hacker attackbriefly can ccp use a little corner of eveonlinecom to broadcast this kind of info to the playersthanks fly safe
lol tell it like it is
oh yeah well csm6 isnt a fan of extreme what a terrible band
looking at the bs lineup for the four races i noticed that amarr and caldari ships are set up for ranged slugfests they have large shieldarmor tanks and can use their weapons at longer ranges however they are slowon the other hand minmatar and gallente ships generally have shorter engagement ranges and less protection so balance that with greater base speed and smaller signatureif gallente ships cant match amarr ships with armor ehp then that needs to be balanced out with a smaller sig if their weapons have smaller engagement ranges then the ships need to be faster to compensate same goes for minmatar vs caldari regarding shields but i dont think its as glaring a discrepancy

two months ago i would have said cosmetic only but now that i no longer trust ccp to keep it that way i say none at all

im one of those filthy rpers that insists on the immersion of the game being immersive no jarring transitions from flying spaceships to walking in stations please
im with you on the roleplaying thing immersion is important right now it feels disjointed and broken it does not feel seamless as they try to describe it1 for this i support this thread
do it right the first time
id add option for first person perspective if you wanna know what the very definition of an immersion breaker is for me just read back wasd controlled puppetsi want to see the world through my eyes not some micro camera whirling about the back of a cartoons head ala wow evercrack etc etc ad nauseum infinitumthe camera view while in podgotcha and it even makes sense from the podlore the camera view out of podgive me an everloving gamey break if i want to look at me ill find a mirrormy 2 cents
fully supported it never made sense to me that iw ould go out of my pod every time i docked in a stationto give a idea from the last eve book the capsuleer that had to go out of hit pod hated it it made him feel weak very weak because he no longer had access to his ship all the data you name it
i was about to make a topic about just thispersonally i feel eve is an extremely fast paced game but it can also be very very slowa few things i have noticed as i am certain most of you have as well you cannot drag and drop a ship to change active ships nor can you simply double click the hangar area to open your cargo bay this is extremely detrimental to piracy and other forms of fast paced action im sure theres other things that have also affected the speed of combat but i have not discovered them yeti would personally love it if we automatically loaded the original station environment with an added option to enter cq i mean the ship has to dock somehow as the op stated there is also a deep emotional attachment to ship spinning but chillin on a couch could also gain an emotional attachment when nothing else is going onpersonally i just want to be able to enjoy fast paced combat without having to load cq and focus on combat when i want to eve is after all a sandbox

lets get some more votes keep it bumpedwe need an answer from ccp
1 gallente have only been getting the stick since i started playing back in 04  05 with my 2 gallente main accounts i now only fly gallente in level 4 missions when i have a couple of others along to make up for my total lack of dps coz my drake out t
millions of useless sp in galente  wtb trade in for laser or projectile skills and minmataramarr ship skills
rails too
its not that id never want to go into cq or station but not everytime i dock my ship for every little thing it takes longer to load and it just seems illogicaljust add a disembark button i bet more people will enter the cq instead of outright disabling this feature

ill chime in
no and why do all these male characters thumb up this topic its not as if you can enter someone elses quarters anyway man boobs
this would be very nice to put into the game since it would make female characters more realistic when youll be able to mingle in the npc stations see jiggly breasts and whenever they do unlock the station youll be able to see everyone i think in the dust 514 trailer i think they added breast physics lol
thats why it would only be allowed at major hubs like jitaat these places the little guy has no chance anyway
your imagination seems a little stifled if you cannot imagine a bot which would allow you to select which orders to watch and which ones not toyour point of timezones is moot because everyone can use these bots there is no exclusivity here from the billionaire to the smallest trader with this auto order watching then the ones with more open order count can truely make  or lose more isk as bots can be gamed as i already mentioned
but what you forget is that real life currency and commodity markets have both bots and live traders and traders beat bots all the time well i cant assume this will always hold but the current state of the art algos cannot keep up with traders none of the apocalyptic fears that you mentioned occurs i dont see any fundamental difference in the eve market that would indicate it would be different especially since the bots which are being proposed here are simple order matching algos to call them algos is a little of an insult even which is nothing more than an instruction to beat the order as long as it is in this profit rangei real life banks use much more complex trending algos etc etc and still traders have the bots for lunchand besides i proposed that these bots will only be available at hubs like jita places where the small time trader is already swamped with illegal 3rd party 001 isk bots best to make a sanctioned one to even the playing fieldin so far as bots can be gamed easily by live people
a few thingsfirst of before you going after my imagination i havent seen anywhere that you said you wanted bots with order limitations in a market run by boots that constantly 001 isking each other why would you want to limit your bots to just a few orders as long as they are in your price range you would still want to be the lowest seller or the highest bidderhow can my tz point be moot not everyone will be at home or awake after dt to start up your bot so those people who are will have maybe hours of botting making isk compared to others and this is regardless if they are actively trading or not they just have to turn on the computeri belive that those traders that just have gone to work when dt start will disagree with you they are effectivly missing 10 hours of trading compared to the guy who live in a tz just an hour awayyour comparison to rl market is a bit far fetch i think that traders beat boots isnt an argument for implementing them in eve first of eve is a closed system we have very little effect on goods from famine natural disasters civil unrest we cant invest long termed in rd and hope for future patents there is no creative destruction only destruction there is very little secondary market effects such as the bank crisis in eve the market isnt very innovative in eve it is much more about buying high and selling low thats what boot are doing very well analysing the market going after personal interaction or processing real life event that happens in the world is something a trader are better suited foryou can probably win a prize or two if you could come up with a bot that understands the effect of home bias and can correctly come to conclusions how to act on its orders on the marketno matter what happen in eve the real effect on goods arent that affected you can manipulate to get an affect but nc losing soverginity in space dont affect the price of cargo expander muchwhen demand and supply evens out something that will go much faster with bots adjusting prices 237 there are people that are ready to have the smallest roi who will be left on the market other people will move up in the food chain tech ii and the same thing will happen there it is just a matter of time before everything gets bought and sold at a smallest  profityou also trying to devalue the bots impact by claiming they can be manipulated yes they can but as the number of boots increase and so the amount of goods they are trading in total it will most likely become harder very limited experience with boots i can admitif they are so easily manipulated why are people using them do you think they help them earn isk and why in gods name would you want something that is so easily beaten by a trader in jita where you will constantly be competing to rl traders who will flock to jita in order to so easily beat your bot and take your isk
dear mr tom haganif you carefully read all the previous posts you will see that one of the suggestions was to make an in game automatch order this order matcher can presumably work even when you are not logged on thereby making your dt arguement moot as this is a discussion not a proposal its just a matter of using your imagination to think of something that will workso the point here that is worth discussion farther is where you mentioned that the eve market is closed and not this same as real life i contend that it is closer than you think sure it wont have famines etc but we arent trading in wheat here are we the commodities that we are trading in eve are weapons and materials of war these can indeed hit famine and surplus cycles as alliance wars ebb and flow the arguement for bots and i use the word in quotes as to dissuade you from unnecessarily attacking some perceived flaw in one inferred implementation of it is that the market as it is has room for more sophistication in trading strategies not continually butting its head against the ceiling of mechanical limitations the trading game now is 50 brains 50 hovering over the update order button like a well trained monkey i would like to think that if we all had such a monkey to use then we can concentrate on the part of trading that requires a human brain to excel atso am i arguing that well trained monkeys should be edged out of the market at the big hubs well i guess i am 
i would like to see a faction miner hulkmack just add to it a little bit like they do with the other faction ships
1never understood that
first off i dont care if this happens or not with that said i dont see this ever happening1 second accounts cost the same as main accounts currently you have to have a second account to do this why on earth would ccp create one smaller revenue stream to to kill a much larger revenue stream 2 some players train up alts and then transfer them to their main accounts when the training goal is reached both the training up and the act of transfer cost money which nets ccp profit take in to account that a lot of these people pay for the 2nd account with plex so in reality that second plexed account nets ccp even more money than the main the only way i see ccp doing this is to make it cost the same as having a second account which would be silly on ccps part because it would cost them development time and money to create a system with 0 chance of company profits
its sad to see this on the last page good topic i would love to see somthing come of this
my experience was not that skill points were a limiting factor at all however if that is true for new players then selling sp is not an answer fixing the game mechanics that keep them interested is the answer one thing i noted as i began playing eve was that time at the keyboard had zero effect on my game progression other than earning isk i also noted there was an extreme amount of repetitive grinding and that everyone was trying to kill me cpp should consider creating a playpen inside the sidebox an area that new players can compete against themselves without interference once their sp and accomplishments reach a certain level they are removed from the playpen this area should have lots of kids toys such as competitions for battle industry etc sp accrues but can not be used until they graduate from the playpen once they are out in the real eve world they can now spend their sp on the path they decided on one reward in the playpen could be isk another could be sp for winning competitions the playpen should of course be named something more user friendly like eve school or new eden university people quit any game because they feel they are losing in real life we are losing all the time so we go to games to escape that to find a place where we can win in eve it is very hard to win anything and keep it for the first year i often feel like im playing against every single player in eve except my corporation and playing against cpp right now my home tew is having its second incursion in a month i dont have the skills to play in the incursion which means i have to leave the system until its over if i want to do anything meaningful in eve i will lose about 200m isk just like i did the last incursion last month partly because of my own choices i will likely log on for just an hour a day to maintain the basics of my personal economy maybe log on for a couple of hours to mine at my backup base get bored curse my luck for having picked a system that sufferes an incurion a month and wonder if i really want to play this game after all as a note ill be playing a lot more wow this week until the incursion is over i have no interest in buying plex i pay for my subscription annually i want to win eve by at least feeling that i am progressing if that feeling goes away then ill quit playing and wont renew my subscription its that simple and though i wouldnt bat an eye at paying out 10000 us for anything it must meet one criteria  value for a game value  fun fullfilment escape an even playing field if i can just buy my sp like anyone else and it gave me game satisfation i would but as ive found buying your way to the middle or top gives zero satisfaction you are left with whats next i believe cpps challenge is to provide that whats next from day one until they want to go out of business selling sp is not a solution playable content for all the players is the solution
the older a game becomes any game the less relevant long term decisions become eve will not be around in 6 years counting on being able to do something after learning skills for 6 years from today is misguidedbefore you go all ape on my saying that eve will not be around in 6 years look at the current vets many are jaded to a degree that they only play eve on the forums anymore anyone who has spent any amount of time shooting at sov structures pre and post dominion knows that basically sov is irrelevant sov is merely a proxy for purpose except that there is no purpose it doesnt matter whether you hold or lose sov that has no bearing on the actual goal of the game which is to provide entertainment value more an more people whine that there is no pvp to be had outside of blobs either yadda yadda yadda the bottom line is that eve absolutely needs new players and lots of them
a few hours you mean or minutes  t1 frigate propulsion jamming  tackle frigate after that they can train a few weeks to keep getting better at doing that same thing level 5 in frigate propulsion jamming engineering electronics mechanic hull upgrades energy management etc these support skills will make them better tacklers but they wont add more ability to activate a warp scrambler or disruptor just the ability to do so more efficientlylonger why sell sp for cash directlyi would like to see items sold through nex being ingredients or bpcs not the final items this way every mt purchase benefits a greater number of players and improves the game for everyonewhy not tie in sp gains with a new booster type the booster requires certain ingredients only sold through the nex thus providing the real money sink the booster needs certain materials nullsec wspace gases and a hefty production chaindifferent grades of booster will increase your sp gains by 50 to 200 for a period of time such as 30 days then hit you with a drawback of eg 25 sp ation for another month having a decent drawback means the users will be tempted to use morebetter boosters or just accept that they got to their goal of minmatar frigate 5 and assault ships 4 so they can now fly that jaguar theyve been lusting after a month early but get slower sp gain for another monthso for one game mechanic weve introduced a nex component industry components targets for military action the production chain such as reactors in poses targets for vigilante action boosters are contraband and something to do offgrid in stationsselling sp for cash directly would only provide benefits to one pilot
having played this game for 4 years and being able to fly most ships i took a break and have started with a new toon now i can see from a new players perspective that 50k sp and 5000 isk in the bank isnt very much of an incentive to carry on playing and the thought of taking another year before i can fly a ship proficiently is a long term investment personally i quite like eve but for the newcomer they dont know what eve has to offer in the long term so they wont stick around luckily i have pals that will help me get back up and running otherwise it would be a long hard slog and i doubt i would want to do that on my owni think new players should at least start with a few more mil to get going maybe a training boost for the first year just so they can enjoy the game abit more as we all want more people to shoot right 
no read what those against this idea say we must teach these new players patience and to realize they cant fly most ships in the game unless they play the game for many many years of their lifewe must drill into them that they should feel lucky that t1 frigates for tackling dont take too long to train and they can have fun in pvp by flying tackling t1 frigates for the first year of playing eve watching while others fly real shipswe must teach these new players that they must accept their lot in the game as a permanent noob who has no control over speeding up their own development and to just accept being a pleb with no freedom except to look at all the fun ships in jita market they cant fly and the multiple year training required to train themwe dont want new players unless they are willing to write up multiple year toon training plansare you mediocre in real life great we have a game that forces you to be mediocre in game watching others fly elite ships while all you can fly is crap
a bit of an over exaggeration you think or are you just a bit emo because you are unable to pay someone to hold your own  for you
the use is very limited but its therefor example being able to train 2 chars on the same account for a month would allow you to get 2 decent cyno chars without having to train them on a different account and pay transfer fees or pause training on the main char or if you notice theres some skills you want to add after getting that char on the account one way or the other
for quite some time now i have been extremely interested in userside modifications look at dare i get burned alive for saying this the user side customizations for wor worrrr worrrrrrrr i cant say it i vomit a little when i attempt toanyway user mods are a huge part of a successful community even though its not a mmo look at oblivion hell look at morrowind 612 respectively years old and still getting modifiedif i recall correctly the eve client uses python if ccp were to separate the user interface from within the client if that would even be required they would protect their systemspecific information yet allow for 3rd party customizationsfor example custom text custom target boxs custom button locations custom window sizes the possibilities are endless and none of them are truly game breaking most of the stuff we see in the client is already client side with server connections you would not be able to delete a required window with a custom modification to the interface however sorry no sneaky localdelete mods will be produced
reserved space for idea picture linkspost links to possible ideas that could spawn because of opencustomization to the userside client interface
read this before going any further with your idea
i believe you are horribly mistaken at what i am suggesting the link you referenced is for 3rd party apps i am talking specifically about ui customization from the local side which would of course require modification of local client files for the most part
that would potentially open up eve to exploits and bots
local modification of ui would require the use of an api or it would make the client hilariously easy to manipulate for the creation of bots and hacks
if by buff you mean reduce damage then yesotherwiseplease visit your user settings to reenable images
i believe that op has really good approach to the issue i would improve the original idea by tweaking gate gunstation gun pwnage with the systen sec level 04 should have very powerfull guns and 01 very weak guns04 stations would get plenty more supply and pirates would get easier access to modestly priced gear more trafic would eventually bring more cannon fodder to pirates also and lowsec would stop trying to be nosec
what about the sentry guns in 00 systems no damage at all
the game would be better without sentry guns
i agree remove gate guns from low sec also remove local from 00 buffing gate guns would only provide safer gates and less fights
make lp tokens that can be bought for lp eg a 10000 lp chip that costs 11000 lp traded on market and redeemed for lp again getting lp and trading them observing the market for niches updating the orders adjusting prices in 001iskincreasegames etc are 2 different professions
boooooooo
yes something needs to be done about thisccp needs better quality control
agreed
there is a proper process to do this rather than whine on the forumsfile a petition via the website and request that the petition be escalated to a senior gm or dev for the investigationplease include the name of the gm who removed the isk from your wallet and the reasons why and why there was no evidencebut whining on the forums will not accomplish anything
this is outrageous and unacceptable we expect ccp to treat their customers with respect and openness this looks like that is not the case here
exactlynow go away and cry somewhere else because every time i see these posts i always think oh look he got caught and now is crying about itpleasecliches are getting old around here
i like the idea but removing the chat portion of a chat window defeats the purpose of having it as a chat window in the first place separating the character portraits alone from the chat channel is a nice idea but on a functional level it makes more sense to keep them togethertheres also the problem of implementing it in wormhole space and i can dream in 00 at some pointits a good idea and something id normally support but it seems like something that ccp would be loathe to implementps aedun sole is terrible
hmm maybe but chat in local is useful though but i do like the idea of noone turning up in local but i think that will never be doneps aedun sole is terrible
what about names this would be a decent userside option only if it also displayed names
the overall gist of the change at least from my comprehension would be that youre able to use the local character pane to show whether people are blueneutred without the bulk of the chat interfacestandings are linked into the character portrait system you get the nice little indicators above the character portrait linking that instead to just the names would seem silly in comparisonps aedun sole is still terrible
i think that local could display a summary of the total numbers of reds blues and neuts that are present in system if that info was displayed at the top of the list then local could be minimised and still be useful without using up lots of screen spacein null sec id suggest that local only displays that summary but not the identities of the actual pilots present that is important if you operate around the same areas regularly and get to know who else is about i think that would be a nice half way house between the current system showing you everything and the hardcore option of removing local entirely there would be less certainty of what youre facing without scouting but not severe enough to scare half the 00 population back to empire
i would like to be able to minimize it a bit with smaller player photos and sort option of red at top instead of alphabetical if i really want to see their picture ill click on them being able to see 30 or a even more at once would be better than the current large portrait setup
i was having a browse through evelopedia today checking out the history of the csm and so on and so forthnow for the previous 5 csms there have been a good deal of resources added to the wiki for example5th csm candidacyhowever the sixth candidacy at present is rather bare6th csm candidacyit may be that not a significant enough time has passed for information to become availablehowever i emplore the csm to keep this resource up to date and do make sure that this resource is then made prominent to the eve playerbase by the csmit would be a great benefit to both the csms reputation and for the knowledge of the eve playerbasekind regardslaiceps can we get tshirts designed saying i survived monoclegate 2011
the dearth of communication is due to the csm chair trying to run csm like a secret squirrel nullsec alliance their communications are entirely through a skype chat channel since wikis and the forum are apparently too hard
then you know why ccp doesnt give a damn about the csm and with a perfectly valid reason but hey nothing of value was lost so who caresthinking about it i nearly lost a merlin to gateguns tonight that would have been a tragedy
oh look its this thread againthis thread had popped up every so often for the past 4 years or so the best suggestion has been to use the russian client texttypei dont have an actual link at this moment russians post a link to your superior eve client fonttype
eio0o
after installing a recent client update on winxp configsys was corrupted easilly fixed problem for myslef thought youmight not already know but best to post anyway 
there latest csmccp devblog adressed the problem with much higher cpugpu usage of current client compared to preincarna client it also stated that new hangar with preincarna client cpugpu levels would be implemented to the game soontmnow this is of course really nice and will remove the actual problem for those who like to keep their client open most of the times for chatting occassional market pvp setting skills or industry jobs and so onhowever it would also be great to keep station enviroment enabled most of the time for this reason i wish that any from following solutions could be implemented1 dock  enter low cpugpu hangar  choise to leave ship and enter cq2 dock  cq  choise to leave cq and enter low cpugpu hangar3 some kind of low cpugpu terminal what can be accessed from cqalso unrelated to this try to stop screen rendering and most unneccessary functions while client is minimized and when pilot is in station
ok ther is a few things that need to be changed more than somelocal chat window should have the option to alter who is shown like nuetralsbluesreds etc when you have like 1000 ppl in local and your trying to fine 1 person its rather difficult maybe you could set to current overview settings idkrefining in 00 is beyond stupid it needs to be changed the intesive refining array has no use unless in a wormhole even then id rather not use it  the cycle time is stupid  you can only do one type of ore even tho you have 3 types of one ore you can only do 1 of those refining in stations the stats are pretty crap i mean all the isk involved and hard work into holding space in 00 you should be able to have decent stuff like good refining stats in stations and most defitnatly the refining arrays need tweeking alotwhat is the point in having level 5 infrastructure upgrades ppl see the level and go camp the area in cloakys now im a pvper that has done this but the upgrades should have some privacy before incarna if i turned off station enviroment on my alts and left it on my main character it would stay like that and i never needed to change it again  but now with this super shiny station stuff i either have to have it on or off for all of my characters its rather anooyingplease fix these dregards orange offspring
your throwing a fit over your currency and your calling us short sightedscuse me last i checked people usually go to their governments for things like thisshort sighted is right starting with you
you do realise that eu citizens have to pay vat on every online transaction so you indeed have to pay more but the money does not go to ccp it goes to the governmentif you are in a europe country that is not part of eu you can petition paying in  and ccp will switch you to  i know cause i did exactly that
and perhaps the only way to interface with your ship is via monocle
qftthis first step the cq is only to test the technology and to iron out bugs im pretty confident ccp already has a lot of content ready to be deployed we just have to be patient once again
or just take a look at
i like ccp to reinstate their idea to sell neural remaps for plexinsert storm hererationale a eve online exists what 8 years now much as no one likes to hear it chances that it will exist another 8 years are slim ccp zulu has recently stated again that selling remaps for plex makes sense and i think he is right were not talking about a gamebreaking mechanic here just a way to train a little more efficiently in deference to the realization that there are less years ahead of us than there are behind us and that this will become increasingly more true with each following yearrationale b 1x neural remap a year is too little there are many learning tracks like leadership skills that you dont really can justify an entire yearly remap for now ideally ccp would just give us 2 remaps a year for free since theyre into money these days theyre obviously not gonna do that so might as well pay them for itedit this proposal now includes no more than max 4 remaps a year and no less than 2 obviously
forever decline
i thought this old chestnut was well dead and buriednot supportedpass the shovel
when i first heard this suggestion i liked it i still do supportedcan someone who is opposed explain the rationale in opposing this wouldnt be abused too often for myself id like to do a quick remap to int  mem work on some electronics  engineering  scanning skills and then get back to per  will its noy buying skill points you still have to wait its not an extreme shortcut its like train 5 skills get the 6th one at half price
i dont think payign for remaps is the way to go but i would definatly like to see them more often maybe once every 4 months so thats 3 a year that would make a lot of sense to me anyway
a well thought out proposal so supported
supported
nothat last line sums it up
a small bump on my partso far there are a total number of 175 posts that clearly supports my suggestion including my shameless support once again thank you for spending your time providing both your support and constructive criticismone thing im worried about is how the design team of incarna was disembodied from the rest of the player base and the content team within ccp it is entirely possible that incarna would have stayed in this current incarnation if it were not for the uproar from the player base check out nyphurs interview with ccp zuluarnar gylafsonstartnyphur ccp has made it clear that its current strategy involves forcing player to dock into the captains quarters performance permitting can you explain the reason behind that strategy more specifically would incarnaonly gameplay and incentives not be enough to get people to use itarnar forcing players to dock at the captains quarters is a form of what we actually wanted to get through which is making incarna a seamless part of the eve online experience its not so much about forcing people to dock into the captains quarters or forcing people to use features its more about making it a fully integrated seamless part of the worldendi am truly disappointed to see arnar using the word seamless as a mere buzz word by definition the word seamless means being consistent and coherent to preexisting surroundings laws and ideas for a new feature to become a fully integrated seamless part of the world it must follow the fundamental laws that dictate that world ie all eve online users are pod pilots and produce outputs that fit in within the laws of the established world ie i am a pod pilot but sometimes i want to stretch my feet for a while otherwise it will neither be consistent nor coherent simply put for a new feature to seamlessly integrate it has to make sense to the average user who knows the rules of the worldit especially worries me that ccp seems to have given little thought about how the introduction of cq would affect the general populace more so considering the effort it put during the last four years to lay the technological foundation for cq and walking in stations to see ccp making mistakes that single handedly lashes out to the three foundations of mmorpgs the core concept technological foundations and the user community does not make things much betteri sincerely hope this whole mess be a lesson to ccps future endeavors
whoa there have been a lot of supporting posts since i last cheched in excellentim digging this trend toonow back to the top of the list
no their was a posting about this not to long ago from ccp and why and im still strongly against such an idea
op obviously you were drunk one night and thinking of spending your money on eve instead of paying child support you thought spendingyourchildsupport would be a hopelessly cool namewell live with it mate if you felt it was in error you could ha
we all know that drones will keep attacking their assigned target they only attack aggressors when there are no assigned targets even given the assumption that fighters and drones are set to attack the ecm boats a scorpion can effectively ecm from 100km providing ample opportunity to warp in jam warp elsewhere on grid continue jamming tactics can be devised to accomplish the task once the ewar immunity is removedit will take far less than 100 dedicated ecm boats whats a dedicated ecm boat to interrupt the repping chain of a supercarrier fleet given the sensor strength of an aeon for example  150 radar using a scorpion with a nominal 10 sensor strength on each jammer thats 115 chance of jamming each cycle of each jammer thus it is highly likely that a fleet of 8 or so scorpions operating at maximum range could interrupt the lock of a supercarrier on each attempt combine that with some heavy sensor damping 1 module per battleship in the attacking fleet for example to slow down the relock and the  in the armour is revealedsupercarriers with their current statistics will still be phenomenally powerful but they will have s in their armour which can be exploited your argument about titans being able to singleshot an ecm boat every 15 seconds is pointless since the titans will have plenty of targets to choose from  why would they pick ecm specifically instead of the heavy interdictors the bhaalgorns the recons or the other capitals and supercapitalsin addition to removing ewar immunity moving the 2 fighters bonus from the hull to the high slot modules will force supercarriers to choose between fleet boosting logistics or dps a crack cleft or fissure also a slang perjorative term for vherokior  jin mei
i wonder if these small posts even get a consideration by csm and ccp
was about to rage about this idea when i noticed it was for trial accounts maybe amend the header providing as has been stated previously as soon as a trial account goes active even for a month that account cannot get binned  i should think that the flag check for trial is inherently inbuilt into eve and a clean up could be done on an expansion by expansion basis as i suspect this would be a significant db hit to do unless it was built into the auto clean up script for items in space only drawback with that is it calls a different table and flag and has no method of calling if the account has been contacted prior to purging with a delay count in order to action the requestnot a trivial request and potentialy a very high risk proposal but worth doing in the long term given the number of trial accounts that must have existed since eve started
i support the cleaning out of old trial accounts
aye for trial accounts i would say 8 to 10 months old
gets my vote
fix please its a joke atm
how hard is it to change values around and throw it up on sisi for testing how much longer do gallente pilots have beg for a bone
supported even though gallenteans are scum
yes i want to have a i was there expericene please
yeah ill support this mainly cause i ended up going with a minmatar typhoon and later typhoon fleet issues just to get a decent drone boat crazy i couldnt find a gallente drone boat i was happy with when theyre supposed to be the drone specialists
i support this thread
hybrids used to be the bees knees a few years ago then it was amarr that needed rebalancing before that missiles got tweaked im sure it will be something else next week either ccp sucks at rebalancing or some ppl are never satisfied
1 support for fixing gallente issues
one last bump before my subscription runs out in a day or twowhen ccp goes back to focusing on spaceships i hope the interest for me is still alive and i returnfly safe all
yes please im sick of not having an affordable higher dps fof missile for when im being sensor dampened to hell and back
as someone who doesnt use missiles i always welcome a new isk sink
ohhey i hadnt really considered motivations for renaming a character beyond ones own one could even add rank prefixes and change them as you promote id like to explore more of these positive functional aspects
you want harsh 10 loss of sp a  fee only once per character and have a permanent aka blah on the character sheet
lets take it a bit further100 loss of sp no  fee loss of all assets standing reset corporation history whipe etcwhich is just bringing us right back to start a new character
only way i would or could support a name change is with a legit char transfer to another account even then it could be abused and would not be a good idea
i think microtransactions are fine just waiting for reasonable prices
ccp is swimming in s they dont need microtransactions and its probably moreso to be doing the same as the other mmosthe addition of the special currency is a joke wtf are ccp thinking cash to plex to isk should be the only rl transaction outside of the sub itself adding more ways to spend plex is just trying to leachfarm the stupid biologicals of their hard cashstop trying to leach the existing player base and start working on all the things that make players turn away start refining what you already have stop wasting time on crap that does nothing to promote internet space ship piloting and stop treating the player base like its your personal farm yard to leach
signedthough if i had my way theyd remove plex as well
fien with removing mts okay with vanity for isk or even player made vanity i dont like fixed prices by overlords weather its a nationstate or ccpid be okay with mts if you make eve online free to play will you make eve online free to play
microtransactions in eve i must have missed that so far ive only seen megatransactions in it but i do want those gone
up to the top
these ships are already faction ore
support now how about a support ship too
seriously  is there anyone who doesnt think the new turret icons are an abomination of ui design and art directionsupport this thread only if you think the new icons are better than the old onesno doubt the above will also be a basic test of reading skills waits for the troll who will vote the wrong way as they attempt to bait people d my purpose here is to work out how these new icons made it into the final release of incarna obviously that they did and if ccp ui design and art direction are not braindead there must actually exist people who thought these icons were at least ok or possibly hard though it is to imagine even better than the old ones
the icon in the show info window and hud will be okay if brighter outlines are added those outlines may be used to indicate the racial type of the turrets such asgoldd4a017 or silverc0c0c0  lasersorange redff3f00  projectiles light blue3399cc  hybridsthe number or shape outlines may also be used to denote the size of the gunpartial small full medium two outlines large three outlines capital etcthose on the targeting interface why are they friggin pixelated
turned off all effects turrets sound and station environment long long ago however by looking at the icons i have no friggin idea what in the hell i am looking at if i hit group weaponsthen i can suppose those are my guns where is the this sucks button
i like them the turrent colors in the fitting screen are too dark i never can tell whether my guns are online or offline without mousing over them now
yes
i like them  in a sense that they are textbook example how ccp is able and loves to screw even stuff which otherwise is pretty fine i mean new turrets itself here
i like them they appear just fine on my screen but then again i use a different layout and design then the default station environment though can be burnt at the stake

id also like to see a dps drone module i dont get why every other weapon system allows you to boost dps but not drones
i want drone implants and i want fighter and bomber implants  im not sure they should overlap as this mite make things a little unbalanced with most of the e war drones considered to be junk this mite be a easy fix
seriously how hard can this be to put in the game
this is the reason why the eve playbase is stagnatingback in 2004 there were very few mmo games and eve was one of if not the only mmo that was subscriber based and worth playingnow there are so many offerings that eve has been left to languishunless your a government you dont hold onto traditions just because they are traditions ibmgegmetc once had the job for life tradition but if they stayed that way theyd have folded by nowccp does need to start looking at the skill system and see if there is room to movepeople dont play gamesentertainment to be taught a lesson they play for entertainment valueif you have a large choice of entertainment your going to make that choice on getting the best value for your time and your sthe world has changed but eve hasnt and perhaps the eve universe does need an anema ccp definetly dont need the money maybe they would be better off in the long run with a complete flush out if rl s for sp achieves that then maybe that will be good for the game in the long run
exaggeration maybe but really not that far off the truthfact is i already paid for my toon and am loving eve with 170 mill sp across 2 toons now it didnt ruin the game for others and just allowed me the freedom to play how i want i tried playing as a new player noob and im too driven to succeed in the things i do to be put under those stupid sp restrictions most new players cant handle the endless boring useless multi month long waiting and quit cause most of eve is locked out from them i only support this because i know how stupidly frustrating being a new player is and all these vets need to go start a new account play as a new player does and see why 100000s of them have quit many for this reasonother games give you freedom control over your characters development based on time in game and what you do in game eve is one of the very few that limits everything you do to time i mean sure lock out some of the higher end content and ships but give the noobs 2030 mill sp they can grind up to in game or sell it to them for instant ccp profit once they have that much they can fly some decent ships and keep training slowly from there this game needs new players not vets who pay ccp in isk for their monthly subscriptions
no bro this game needs you to get out never stop probing your intentions ccp what a lovely survey this isccpfailcheck
what do you think will happen if you open every possibility up to players with cash instead of making them train for it think now what will happen its not hard to work out if you understand how mmos work and the most elementary player psychology
a player with cash already has every option available to them they just buy a 50100mill sp toon for 5001000 and then train normally the other skills while they enjoy all that eve has to offer not many do this so your worried about a few new players buying some sp instead of quiting eve worried about what a few more 2040 sp pilots most do not have money to throw at a game like this or their would be massive bidding wars on all high end pilots nowmost people would just use it to jump past some mind numbing part of the training cycle thats stopping their in game enjoyment like they want to fly a tengu they have trained many support skills for it and now see they are 3 weeks away from flying it but are impatient and want to fly it today instead of telling them nope your screwed go play another game you see you in 3 weeks or grind those level 3 missions till your iq points drop 10 points why not let them keep playing the game they want to play and let them pay ccp at the same time once they are in tengus they play their own game enjoying eve and training normally till maybe they find another hump they just cant wait forreally the logic behind forcing a harsh and unenjoyable gameplay experience on noobs is beyond me not everyone is the same and happy to be patient and grow things slowly doesnt make them wrong or you right people are different
forever decline
why do you need a t3 to enjoy yourself in eve i think youve convinced yourself unless youre flying the very highest level ships youre not having funwell i hate to be the one to tell you this  but ive enjoyed my time flying t1 and faction ships many players continue flying and specialising in t1 or faction ships for years or even all their eve career and myself and a great many others have enjoyed the early levels of many other mmos too  often more that whatever someone else thinks is the endgamehaving to train with only very pricy character transfers as a faster option gives players slowly expanding options so new possibilities present themselves even years after beginning play you want to  all over that im sorry  it has been made made clear to you time and time again  even very recently  by the player majority csm the most powerful andor respected players and alliances in eve and last but not least  ccp themselves  that they will not stand for the eve sandbox experience being ed in the manner you so glibly suggestif you dont like it and are too screwed up in your head to enjoy anything but what you perceive as the best eve is not for you and thats ok life will go on so please please  deal with it
you know most people that do buy those 50 to 100 mil characterstoons  struggle because they have no idea actually how to play the game they get frustrated and shortly quit because they got their ass handed to them by someone who played twice long but with only half the sp with the current manner of skilling your character you learn how to play the game as a steady progression into the oshiny type ships and when you actually get there the reward of learning the how to play pays out in huge dividends i have had scores of players in a rush to get to the next biggest thing buy characters to get there and end up raging because they can not fit or fly any of the ships they have been fapping over and end up wondering why they even play this gamethe only other folk that dont really care about any of that are usually the botters and the station spinners that are too afraid to even undock and play the game
actually let them keep playing the game is just what ccp doesnt want what they want is let them keep paying for the game without playing online to max the profit at the minimized server cost so they made the endless skill system to make you always pay for something in future even if you dont like what you can play now you will not be able to know if it was worth it until you already paid enough to get it which you will probably find not then you make yourself another illusion likei already went to much to give up the game will become fun if i just do this more this is how eve worksif the game was charged by hours or server resource is free to use skills would be long gone
careful baaldor  youll be branded elitest d you want to hold back these poor whinging lazy dumbeffing noobs from flying a shiny t3 or supercap youre just a nasty wasty bitter vet
meh if the public safety message brands me an elitist grumpy old got then so be it tears and hate mail works for me too it motivates me to log in
they already do its called buy a few plexs with your real life cash and buy a toon from somebody else that has all the skills you want
so why dont you just leaveits not like drone space had a major change since its creation its always been dropping minerals and aside from small bits of border regions it isnt a pvp zone either its practically a safe haventhe people who should live in that space are the ones who can capitalize on what it has to offer and that is vast amount of minerals which coincidentally are needed for capitals it has never been an isk making zone even though you can make proper isk there too
move to new space problem solved
yeah i like the new turrets but not the new iconsplease give the old icons back they where awesome for the job they where doing
10
whine much i love the new icons im against
got my support the new turret icons are a travesty of ui design and art direction how utter shte like this makes its way into the final release is beyond me no professionalism
while yes eve is a harsh world it is sad that a person can fly into a system go to a moon or a planet and cloak up and walk away from his or her computer with zero risk then the risk of coming threw a gate campwhile i am not saying that cloaks should be easy to find by any means should a person want to come in and disrupt operations in a system without getting into combat then they should have to stay at the computer watching and keeping them selves safe by warping around and changing spots on a regular basisat no time should they just be able to camp out in a system all day long cloaked while they head off to school work ectwe need to have an option to find cloaked ships target them and blow them up and get them out of our space making probes able to find them and break there cloak would allow this yet it would allow your covert ops folks to still be able to jump into a system and scout and do there job ectwhat that option would be to find these afk cloaks is up to debate but we need something
thread number 657583while ever you have your 100 risk free instant intel tool called local afk cloaking should remain a somewhat viable counter to subvert its usewhat you are asking for is more power on top of what local already provides to you that is not a balanced approach
really so its balanced that somebody that is not at there computer can cause operations in a system to grind to a halt while he is no where at his computer in perfect safety sorry thats not balanced nor is it right if your at your computer warping around and playing the game the odds of you getting caught are still slim to nonewhat i am asking for is to be able to find that person who just comes into the system parks cloaks up and walks away and only goes offline when the downtime hitsall local does is tell us he is there not where he is it wont allow us to target them and it wont allow us to find himany player that is sitting there cloaked paying attention to his dscan will still be perfectly safe as he will be able to see trouble coming avoid being probed and be able to warp to a safe spot long before anybody can get there to kill him this still disrupts activities in a system you just would not be able to do it afk anymore you would ohh my god actually have to play the game if you dint want to loose your ship
you know it would save us a lot of time and effort if you just searched this topic and read the responses that way we can focus other hot topics like top hats barbie accessories and sp for cash programs
this is all mental ships are only dangerous if they are attacking you and you could counter afk cloakers by not doing everything solo in gimped for pvp shipssure its irritating and i totally get that but thats the whole point of the tactic
and while he is cloaked what exactly is he doing to youno youre asking for even more power on top of the already powerful local intel toolno but it tells you he is there while he is cloaked so he already has his covert module bypassed with instant intel given to you by localany player watching local and the overview will have a chance of warping out especially if they are 76 speed aligned
i dont have an issue with the fact that folks come in and disrupt the system even if they are cloaked thats part of the game and honestly breaks up the task of mining my issue is that they do it while not even at there keyboards there at school work where ever and are able to sit there and do it with zero risk to them selvesthem being there disrupting and being irritating while not even there and being 100 safe is what i have an issue with not the fact that they are being irritating or in my system that can actually be a lot of fun to try and hunt somebody down that is taunting you and such it also provides a choice for me to make when we are doing corp ops and such do i risk mining that ice belt today with zero protection so i can get more or do i go ahead and set up protection warp bubbles the whole works and take the productivity loss do i stage the pvp op i was planning in this system and risk him being a spy for the alliance i am about to attack or no do i try to online the pos i was planning on building today or wait for him to leave just by his mere presence he adds a bit of excitement and danger to my plans thats not what i want to change i just want him to actually have to be there in order to do that disruptionmags you made my point for me with your last statement any player that is paying attention to his dscan and local and taking steps like making sure he is aligned to a safe spot is pretty much safe there is a slim chance of catching him and killing him however to be safe like that he actually has to be paying attention to the game and playing no player regardless of how they fit there ship is safe if they get up and walk away from the computer to go to work or school or even to go to the bathroom specially in null sec with the sole exception of anybody that has a cloaking device thats the issue that needs to be resolved not that fact that they are cloaked i honestly could care less if i can find them or not i just dont want them come into a system and have zero risk of loosing there ship or having something happen to themprobing yes would not be balanced but we need to have something done to present some risk to the afk cloaker i would go for something that gives the cloak a random chance to fail and if you dont turn it back on quickly enough your no longer cloaked something like instead of auto cycling you have to click it back on each time to stay cloaked or every 7 to 10 mins you have to type in a random word displayed on your hud to keep the cloak active rp wise it could be explained as having to adjust the frequency of the cloak to maintain it due to radiation interference from the planets and such honestly something or anything to add an element of danger to the operation of cloaking up in a system to disrupt activities and prevent them from being able to do so while afk if your paying attention and playing you would still be 100 safe and be irritating and annoying yet it adds in that element of risk that means you have to play the game in order to pull of said tacticmags i see what your saying about the local channel now and while i can see your point i must say that it is a needed thing or no one would ever mine in null or low sec
even more support
agree

isnt your clothes in the portraiti can see an argument against this as you have always been wearing what your portrait is showingbut i would support not having to repose your portrait after changing clothes with an auto repose or something
i think some of you fail at reading comprehension i want to buff piracy because i hunt pirates pirates have overfished the ponds and we need to get more fish into lo sec i love the link to the other buff low sec thread good ideas there i also like the strength of guns being varied from wtfpwn in 04 to current strength in 01 remote ecm burst lime a sc would be cool too all good ideas

whiners gonna whine about people whining
alternatively give up your obsession with having giant lists of mostly pointless information to stare at that take up large portions of screen space you could perhaps propose a simple functional less screen intensive and overall better standings and status counter for people in local of some sort instead how many wts in local 5483 how many blues 11483 np if you wanted to go completely crazy with such sane interface design you could even get expanded lists with namestags for each element simply by clicking on the appropriate indicatorthat however would have far too much functionease of use and way too little clutter regardless nothing is likely to be implemented considering ccp generally dislikes the use of local as an allseeing intel tool and probably intends to eventually remove such capability along with vague other nullsec changes
i dont think its ccps responsibility to update the wiki personally i think that should be the csms job simply so that they can say that ccp have not modified any statements
ok after long deliberations i decided to share how i got close to world domination its actually only 7 rules1 your attitude matters more than your product with the right attitude you will sell anything2 if you do not get positive feedback create it yourself3 your truth be what people want to hear4 your integrityhonesty be that you will not sell your grandmother for a fixed price but that you auction her properly5 never even think about working get a subject to bring you coffee and youll have coffee for your life get it yourself and youll have to do it every day6 among the emotions you can create in your subjects hate yields the most tangible rewardsthe seventh rule is secret but you are free to guess 
can you as a person learn skills by having them downloaded into your brain how about have a piece of cybernetics implanted into your grey matter to make you better at riding a bike driving a car how about make a sandwich no you cant but in eve you can because its a game steeped in highly advanced technology thousands of years beyond our current understandingi support the ops idea i have a few skills that i inject and trained a day or two that do nothing but clutter my character sheet and increase my clone cost i dont want those sps back i just want the skill gone from my character sheet
i really need more aurums because i get mad watching myself inside cabin walking around like a gay idioti want buy some moving sequences to give my character a mory sexy walking and i am really looking forward to get some position like a set of gorean style slave positions for my subs something like thispositions for captains cabinand i need a brush for punishmentyou know i already quit all my other accounts from eve its just this one here left waiting for the new stuff coming out what eve client really needs
i wonder if there are people interested in having their evemail turned into a regular realworld mailboxi know id like to have my corpmail retrievable via outlookthunderbird co id be notified with new mail on startup and so i could add the evemail mailbox in my phone regular mail appwhatdya think
any news
please discuss and release a csm minutes edit guide v10i would be happy to have the csm meeting minutes filtered and edited as long as the editsfilters were applied consistentlyid like to see a report on the meetings discussion rather than a transcript of the group conversation i dont care about what they did last night etcall im interested in is statements actions and the responsesoutcomesplans
i raised this in one of my first posts on the forumsthe corp share system in its current form is just redundant ccp should just remove the code or actually do something useful with it
sounds good i dont neccessarily agree on the 51 ceo control if the ceo wants to hold a minority holding it should be fine perhaps shareholders could have voting rights similar to the corp ones ie vote to install new ceo vote to merge into another entity etc the added dynamic would add play content for all players in eve highsec industrial groups may vie with each other to attempt hostile takeovers 00 entities ciould be defeated by economic victory instead of just brute force attacks etc food for thought and this could actually be new content that might add tot he game ie instead of spending all that time and rd on a room a hallway and a balcony none of which have any additional gae play
well the thing is ccp isnt into freebies any more so i dont think a proposal to simply give us more remaps a year will make it offer them a little money however and they mightps i do think the amount of remaps per year should be capped though to max 4 or max 2 even if need be
i like the idea and did when it was first proposed it should be limited to a remap every 2 or 3 months so that you still have to make longterm decisions just not to the point when you nerf your character for half a year just so that you can train faster during the other half
i think its a very good idea option 2 is better in my way supported
no
no
nolooking at the statements given by ccp there is too much playroom for introducing gold ammo or shipsthere hasnt been a ferm no to that only a lot of political jibberjabber which can be turned in any direction needed or wantedthese arent the devs anymore i met back in 2004 they went from devoted gamelovers to bussinessmen and bussinessmen dont love the game but the cashflow they get from it

yes please
dear ccp being a veteran pc gamer with over 20 years exp and counting there is something i would like to point out  good game is about gameplay not fancy graphicsfor me just like i think for many other capsulers incarna is nothing more then a graphical pain its like a cut scene with no skip button  very nice but only for the first time 2nd time is boring and the 3rd time it es you off having seen your interviews and reviews of incarna made me feel like i was 5 again  no offence intented to younger generation  and not over 30 what makes you think you know what is good for us  players  cant you see that it is actually us  paying customers who are ultimately paying your wages  as your client i shouldnt say please but im also polite so please  listen read and respond do not assume  just ask before you force anything upon the community go out of your comfy offices and ask if someone actually likes your new ideas and improvements please bring old hangars back and add an opition for cqbest regards to all playersno regards to ccp
and what is the reasoning you cant because you cant and because you cant you never can thats not interesting at allstate why and we can disicuss itthings change  especially lately  and i beleive weve addressed rational concerns
yup
two thingsone it isnt that simple to erase someone from history in eve even deleted characters are still kept in the database to keep it accurate sure a weeker trial who might have only played a day wont really be missed but is the gain truly worth tampering with the databasesecond ccp has to make absolutely sure the autowipers dont delete something else frankly it isnt even worth the risk to delete the expired trial accounts
pretty much this as much as it annoys me that a lot of the really funny troll names are already taken and most of them never activated probably
also remove goons  low sec 10 pirate wannabesoh and huge alliance leaders alliances should be much more fragmented
lets do this
also supporting removal of trial accounts which never got activated 36 months after their trial period ends a trial should be used to try out the game if you dont like it you shouldnt have the privilege of keeping your name for all of eternityhowever this change must be clearly announced in advance so that people who actually have trial alts holding their names can activate them not just oh hi we accidentaly all your trial alts
signed provided its indeed trial accounts only
supported and bumped
i support the original idea and think it deserves much discussion in the halls of ccp but the above tweak has a ton of merit too and would make this idea that much better
i like this idea also i know of many including myself that while in our good clones will almost always shy away from pvp to avoid the possiblility of getting podded though i can see a few variations of this upgraded clone insurance that includes implants but still is very much affordable or like with the learning skills remove them and apply them to everyone in the game now of course i would keep the skill hardwiring implants the same but i think a change of the attribute implants would help more people pvp and less paranoid of losing the 5s

the first thing to keep in mind is the followingthis proposal in no way is intended to be some golden bullet that fixes super carriers solely but a change that would help enhance other changes to how capital warfare worksnow on to the proposalin order for this idea to have any hope of a positive impact two key changes have to happenincrease all eas effective hit points by at least 25drone bays on super carriers are restricted to only allow fighters and fighter bombers to be loadedwith those changes in mind lets go over the initial idea from a recent idea that inspired me torefine itcurrently super carriers are immune to all forms of electronic warfare it was recently suggested that along with the only fighters and fighter bombers that electronic attack ships be able to use their ew on them granted they were including titans and the tracking and super point stuff my idea is only about super carriers and the easat first it sounded great but then i thought about it for a few minutes the kitsune could ecm it even though i think ecm is a dumb ing mechanic at least that was something the keres could warpdisrupt the super carrier thus making it a cheap super point feels like it is stepping on the toes of the hic it could dampen it some but to what kinda meh so what about the other ew from the hyena and sentinel target painting something the size of a small moon would be pointless web you say so you make it go 25 or so meters slower super carriers are not exactly known for their blistering speed ok so sentinel time tracking disrupt what turretsso basically only two out of the four eass would be even worth using i concluded that a simple not immune to electronic attack ship ew would work well enoughhere is how i envisioned that idea refinedelectronic attack ships can activate the ew that the ship gets a bonus to on a super carrier but the affect is transfered to all fighters and fighter bombers under its controlall effects mentioned below apply to bother fighters and fighter bombers here is the break downkitsune  based on the sensor strength of each individual fighter and fighter bomber it has a chance to be jammed so out of say twenty fighter bombers ten or so might becomes jammed for twenty seconds of course racial jammers would have a better chance at jamming the appropriate fighter just like a normal ship a kitsune with great skills gang bonuses and one of each racial has a good chance of jamming the entire swarm from that super carrierkeres  with a warp disruptor all fighters would not be able to follow targets into warp and engage them warpscramble would mean the same thing and all fighters would not be able to activate their microwarp drive thus taking much longer to get to their targets and engage sensor dampener depending on how they are scripted would force longer lock times and smaller orbit ranges increasing the odds of being in smartbombing rangehyena  activating webs on a super carrier would cause all fighters to slow down target painters increase their signature radius for antifighterfighter bomber the combination would make easy targets to blast out of the skiessentinel  tracking disrupting depending on the drips would cause shorter optimal ranges for fighters and make it harder for their guns to track smaller noncapital ships fighter bombers are harder to figure out so i will go with this shorter firing range for the microcitadel torpedoes forcing the bombers to get much closer before shooting also increasing their explosion velosity dramatically enough that they will not be doing full damage not even to capital shipsgranted stats and such would need to be looked into electronic attac
but the ships can still use their ewar on the fighters and fighter bombers anywayso theres no need to change anything
and here i thought highlighting things in yellow would help
rubs eye holy  an actual reason to train eas lvl 5cliffy what heshe is saying is the ew signal would transfer to every fighter and fighter bomber under the motherships control basically you cant stop the signalthumbs up for not stopping the signal
that is actually a pretty decent ideafor the people who complain that a small ship can then completely shut down a supercarrier that kitsune might be kinda too strong compared to the others tbh it can completely shut down the fighters while the others dont come close to that bigger should not always be better supercaps need a weekness they now lackand for those who are afraid it makes them useless we are talking eafs here get a freaking support fleet and they blow up so fast you dont even notice they warped inor lvl 2
practically every super carrier carries mixed fighters and fighter bombers so in order for one kitsune to shut it down by itself it would need to fit ecm heavy sporting one of each racial leaving a loltank any support from that super carrier so much as convoes the kitsune pilot with harsh language and it will explodethat said like what was stated some numbers that might include sensor strength of the fighters and fighter bombers might need to be tweaked
im of the opinion that any character of less than a year should just be started over on the other hand if youve gone an entire year without realizing youve got a stupid name well then tough bananas
ill add that to the pile but honestly is there any ingame reason immersion why there should be a loss of skill points just sounds vindictive to mehmm could you elaborate on what you define as legit and how it would be abusedblack and white arguments rarely fully meet the needs of anyoneits ok i do read your posts thanks for bumping this thread again
legit would be ccp sanctioned character trade threw the bazaarhow it could be abused simple player a is a known ganker and spy no corp will take him any corp that does he steals from and suicide ganks new players ect you name it basically this player is a real scum bag on this toon he grows weary of not being able to get into corps to steal from them and his reputation has grown to the point that everybody leaves what ever system he enters he then makes another account and sells his toon to that account using a different email address and different name one of his kids names or his girl friends or what ever to avoid any chance of ccp tracking it back to him he gets a name change as part of the deal and now removes the reputation that he had he now can go back to being a scum bag with a new rep and other players have no warningthat is the whole reason behind not being able to change the name of a toon currently you should not be able to loose a reputation that you have built on a toon without hard work and dedication to actually changing your ways or changing the repthere are honorable pirates in the game both high sec and low that have excellent reputations for killing other players but being professional about it and always taking the time to give that player some tips and tricks to survive the next fight there are also players that have developed a reputation close to what i described above and the only way they should be able to loose that rep is by changing there ways or appearing to long enough or making a new toon
excesssiveno the aka system provides ingame searchable documentation on name changes in the character info window new tab nothing is removed nothing is escaped there have been many ideas to supplement the aka system and recently i got bored and posted those on the test forum while its still up proposal name changing again that is the whole reason behind the aka system

fsssthere will be players who uses bots anyway no matter what ccps policy isif you want remain competitve you have to have your own botit is just the way it works with current market settingsimho the best to do is to eliminating the 01 isk boredomthere should be price ranges which would eliminate this  and the result of an order would be random selected within that price rangethe difference could be 1 between price ranges  so if you want to compete you would have to lower your prices at least by 1 that shouldthis would be hard to code and implement cant see ccp would ever do thisor just make that changing market order needs to be at least 1 difference  easy to implement and could work or increase change delay to half hour or more need less frequent price changes this would be the least good
bump
helping pirates in any way should be a punishable offenseit is like supporting crimetotally unacceptable you should be podded asap
i agree 1 repping somebody without gcc in lowsec should not give you gccif you rep a pirate in high sec you should be flagged to the faction navy and not concordif you rep somebody under gcc then you shuld get gcc and sec hit
they suck balls  fire the dev team that did them
they are good  not as dark as release day
iam all out dissapointed with this fire the genius that made up this turreticons they blend into space they are ghostlyblurred and they need to be removedgive us back the old ones and stop changing things you obviously shouldnt cause you can not improve them doh
icons shouldnt be blurred screenshots of the actual item they should be representative graphics showing clearly what they are and giving some sense of what they dothe old tractor beam icon was a good example  you could see it was a turret and the magnetic looking field out the front suggested a tractor but the new tractor beam icon how am i supposed to even guess much less see this clearlyccp  will every icon be transitioned from good looking sharply defined icons that suggest their purpose to lowres blurryashell screenshoots or will this idiocy be reversedperhaps you ought to start having csm or a nearby child review your artwork first if this is what you consider ready for release
all you proponents of this proposal have to realize a simple thingeve has no levels no experience point system the only ingame thing that differentiates an experienced player and a newbie is sp and isk balance you can already buy isk if you allowed for buying sp then you are essentially condoning cheatingif you want to fly an orca but cant its because sorry you have to work your way there through mining cruisers and mining barges first want that faction battleship need to fly a regular one first you cant jump levels without resorting to cheats in other games you shouldnt in eve
good points kaelie and people can cheat using multiple accounts to overcome challenges of eve too many ways to cheat the game already
your argument doesnt hold water saying that someone would be in business for 3 years and just sell everthing to screw over a few people to make a little moneycome on after about 3 years if that person hasnt made a billion isk theres somenthing wrong if they did do it it would be for fun not for isk and thats ok loop holes are what make this game great everything can go wrong so i really dont see the problem most people would not do that just because they would use the stock market instead of trying to destroy something that was finally implemented but even if they doso what
please take a econ 101 class and report back afterwardsps the 3 years was illustrative made to show a point if you think its too long then make its 2 years or 1 year or 6 months point is the same besides how hard would it be to make a corp for your alt and let it lay fallow for a while or even better buy a old corp from someone
taken it but that has nothing to do with this game like someone mentioned earlier if you make the economic system too complex ccp will not bother with it this is a game and as such it will most likely not be as real as the actual stock market and if someone is clever enough to find a loop hole and exploit the systemmore power to em however not everyone will do that most will use and enjoy the stock market system
please dont hurry to rage out as soon as you see the word sp trade read the post first and judge for yourself it is not mt it is not cheat it brings no abnomal advantages and it creates nothing from thin air it is just a system to allow you to actually earn your sp like you always like to say yes sp trade is already happening through character bazaar and this plan only makes it works better for everyoneterrible npe stagnating and aging playerbase endless whining and argue on forum name changing plea now and thenthose are problems actually exist no matter whats your opinion to specific issues the biggest actual problem is that these problems exist and a good system that prevent problems coming out at first is always better than telling yourself that you can live with them shutting others up or even deceiving yourself that they are the good part and make you coolback to my plan orignally derived from the idea of ms cassiopeia andromedae i made modification to make it feasible and without obvious flaw the core idea will beallow player a to sell the sp of specific skill to player b for isk in ingame market at the punishment of losing part of themlets say a new technology in eden that can extract part of your brain content to some storage media not sp in general but sp of specific skill that you trained others already injected the book can buy the media from you and inject it into their brain and get part of your extracted sp on that skill convert rate primaryattributebuyer  2secondaryattributebuyer  1 100 that will be theoretically 5189 so the attribute points remain meaninful you get punished for buying skills you train slow and if you sell the skill you train quick and with the money buy those you train slow you actually lose more timeexample player a have 100 sp on skill on the skill amarr industrial and found it unnecessary he extracted it and sell the good amarr industrial sp in market player b injects the book first and then buys the sp from a the attributes of b are 28p25w so he get 1002822510081 skill points when he inject 100of course trail accounts should be forbidden to sell sp but rather than also forbidding them to buy it i think a better and more direct solution to all the trail problem is simply forbid them to shoot at other players firstwhy the plan benefits everyonenewbies will benefit they finally have a way to do something to boost the character progress this mechanism is a must to make any game attractive they now have at least hope to eventually catch up with vets hope itself really means a lotvets will benefit an access to remap your skill distribution either because you are unsatisfyed with your former dicision or just want to try something new immediate alts extra free isk everyday if you do not want to train anything newccp will benefit skill points vanish with every transaction and is not gained any faster overall this will eventually reach some balance point that you can control the infinite skill bigbang when humans get stimulated by positive reward of what they do they repeat it when newbies see hope and can do something to help the character grow they get happy doing the repeat and monotonous lv1 they immerse they may even stay in your broken game how amazingbazaar sellers will benefit a bundle of skillsneeded and not needed patched together with an ugly name is currently price discounted you will surely get more isk with selling skills alone seperately to those need them just extract all skills of the character contract them to your main character biomass the drained zombie and take your time to selleveryone will benefitto be continued
continueeveryone will benefit no need to buy characters bad named and with skills you do not need those characters ugly bad named and no one likes will be drained out and eventually biomassed you can stick to the character you actually like and grow him up sooner emergency money source more noob more prey more lively universe gallentes finally find a path to escape from their nightmare cannot jugde much from the birth date of a pilot uncertainty is good for pvp prepare to surprise or be surprised all the 3 char slots of your account will become meaningful you can train one and buy skills for the other 2 yes immersion
this idea actually has a lot of merit in my book im giving you a thumbs up
supported as no isk printing presses are involved1
hii am 67 million sp character mainly flying a rifter i am still using tech 1 gunsand i dont understand why would anyone want to buy extra spi personally think all this hunger for more sp is just result of impatience combined with having no clue about real game mechanics you can do a lot of things without having tons of spgenerally knowing how easy it is to print isk from thin air id say any kind of mechanic which allows you to get skillpoints with isk aside character transfer will just allow players to create more isk printing characters fastand at the end it is difficult to imagine how all this would benefit any real newbie because they need to learn how to fly ships and stuff first and shouldnt even have isk to buy more sp anyway as a result this would only mean more advantage for bittervets who have too much iskonly thing id really want to ask is ccp promising publicly they will never ever allow sp trading if we go that road eventually developing character and paying subs becomes pretty ing pointless
i have basiclly 0 sp and i am happy flying rifter and you all must enjoy what i like otherwise you r playing the game wrongoh not again please dont get so proud because you know some game mechanic in your worldyou are free to have good time forever in your rifter other have the same freedom to like flying something bigger and it is totally ok whether you understand or not they have the freedom to fly titan once they paid enough subs and without any knowledge about it they also have the freedom of turning their titans into space dust on their first flight for not knowing how to operate them it is their game experience and their own business and it is not possible this can harm you in any way i know you are worrying about noobs print as much isk as you do so you have to trade fair and no more cheap plex for you but this will never happen and you know why if you really understand anything about the game mechanicthere wont be no sp trade promise because it is already happening dont tell me they bought those character because they falled in love with them the plan is just a better way to do it
not supported
how about no
sorry noyou seem to have put more thought into this than the average impatient give me sp now because i wanna fly bigger ships guy but still nogood points against having both isk buyable and sp transferrable is just going to increase character sales if you can do it then so can somebody in china and sell a character to youadding a mechanism to encourage more noobs to join then use as a justification that more noobs means more of them to shoot and kill hmm i think that being shot and killed has a lot more negative effect on someones desire to continue playing than having to wait to train what skills matter to thembroken game how do you figure because it doesnt have as many players as wow etc in 2008 eve had 250000 accounts now there are over 330000 thats positive growth id like to think that eve has gamers that are into different things its not meant as a mmo for the masses and as such i see no problem with the current player base size
no way one person could game this so that multiple characters are training skills with the intent to sell them all to one character you are essentially buying skill points with isk if i have 8 characters they could all exist for the purpose of 7 of them selling their sp to one one character could train skills faster than the game design intended not supportedfurthermore since they are all my characters i dont even lose money i just shuffle it around between characters this was not well thought out or perhaps that is intentional
recently i found myself with a ninja looter and frankly i could care less about that keeps boring missions interesting and half the time i let them have the loot theres always more loot to be had in this case the guy nabbed from a can and went red blinky ok fun time so i run off and get a crow to come back to playso i locked up his vigil and before ya know it in warps an orca and the guy switches ships to a loki long story short one dead crow big whoop i can make back 12 mil isk in my sleepwhat irks me is that the guy is able to escape the consequences of actions with an alt in an orca suppose he was getting his ship beat up looking at the guys profile chances are hed have swapped out to his pod and been free of consequences this was high sec btwneeding an alt to cheat the challenges of single account play is cheap as it is but the advantage of being able to escape consequences and play this sort of bait and switch game should be examinedi propose that one can not swap ships at a ship hangar while under aggrops dont give me your cry moar crap this is not a complaint i enjoyed the fight so to those sorts have a sincere preemptive psis off
yep nerf lokis
while i do like your ideaits has some problems like playing in wh or 00 space where people are dependant of such tacticsso if you could find a way discribe how this would be inplemented without screwing over other players i would love to read it
where do we define getting screwed over stops or starts if you could be more explicit that would be helpful what i propose is if youre getting red boxed you should not be able to swap ships maybe make it dependent on a warp scram being part of the deal or not under pos shields it should not apply thats like docking in a station besides no one is going to chase someone to a gun covered posedit sure you can eject and swap ships but at least the price is paid for the swap
not being able to swap ships  wherever it occurs  just goes totally against the spirit of eve besides soon as you saw the orca warp in you could have warped out your epeen prevented that and you wound up dead no need to change the game for that thoughnot supported working as intended
feel free to refer to the ps in the first post
read it ignored it saying youre not complaining whilst complaining is just a childish manipulative trickhtfu
refer to ps
adapt or die you have chosen death congrats now while he was switching to that loki you had ample time to gtfo and save yourself but you decide to stay and quench your carebear bloodlust and you where stupid enough to shoot a ninja in the first place so whos fault is it that you diedas i said adapt or die please choose die some more these tears are funny
oh look some one trying to be original  off loser
you sound mad are you mad or do you know everything i said is the truth and you have come unstuck you could of gtfo but you decided to fight die and then crynow you have proven to be so much fun im not going anywhere 3
be my guest we can get down into it oh btw post with yuor main or are you chicken 
arr yes your mad and i guess this is your main then well i goto say dear chapwho ever posts with there mains these days that would be stupid on my part letting you know whos coming thats like giving you the cake and letting you eat it too oh nono that wont do at allps 3
so chicken  thanks for proving whos the carebear ya big baby
yup thats pretty much what happened he had ample time to make himself scarce other guy warped in with his orca had to board his loki turn on his mods target in other words op had plenty of time to gtfo he didnt because he thought he could take him  the epeen thingyand then he starts a rather transparent post saying he doesnt want to complain only to complain after all op should just make a note to himself next time bigger fish comes in just leaveyou know i usually defend the carebear side being one myself but this was just player stupidity plain and simple
were you there nope just being a troll attempting to derailccp likes people to commit to fights this is just a cheap way out so go whine and bleat your cry more bull  to someone who gives a 
that carebear would be you you dont seem to understand the true nature of eve while it even blessed you with a small window to gtfoyou also dont seem to understand that im not going to make your life easy and give you free intel that wouldnt be in the spirit of eve would itand you now insult me and call me a coward i do say old bean for a 05 char i expected a little better ohh yesnow please cry more a representative will be with you shortlyas ever 3
post with yuor main 
you sir seem to give a lot more than a such foul language you should be ashamed of yourself otherwise why are you still here crying hopeing for a reassuring shoulder to come along and comfort youbut it will never come dear chap for this is eve not wow you had your chance and you blew it
as i said easy intel easy intel is this going through or would you be in need of visual aidsalso i believe you where trying to call me a homosexual so i must kindly inform you that there are two gs in that wordall my love my dearest
rofl i dont feel the need to treat a wimp with much respect if you dont like it too ing badand if you think i am actually upset youre not very bright but thanks for helping me keep the thread up top
arr calling me a wimp i believe this is called projecting you are taking your own inadequateness and projecting them upon me it seems to me old chap you are the one who dosnt like it as your behaviour and language seem to reinforce this as i see no other reason to cry like thisi do not think your upset as you have demonstrated through your foul tongue and sobbing i know your upset and i seem to be a lot brighter than you if i must say so myself but dont worry i want this thread to be at the top so hopefully someone will help you in a very evely wayas ever my love
nothing more amusing get can flipped well in 4x hulk 2x retriever 1x orca fleet orca ejects a ceptor and a huggin which the 2 retriever pilots jump into thats one dead canflipper
thats quite different from being red boxed and swapping ships what you describe is very legitimate imo getting a get out of fight free card is the issue
but my dear these are one in the same you cannot allow one but scorn the other
whatever troll boy
they are not the same troll boy if you werent trying so hard to defend the tactic youd know better its plain that youve a lot invested in this cheap little trick
im afraid my dear this cheap little trick as you put it is nothing compared to the grandeur of eve but none of less it is in keeping with the spirit of eve and im all for keeping eve in spiritand troll boy what a lovely little nickname my love i will love you forever too
yeah the spirit of committing to fights and not having an easy way out
my darling ill ask you have you ever been in a large fight in nullsec or even a small fight in highsec finding the easy path is what eve is all about everyone wants to get on that road take this scinario for you aye theres a solo ratting carrier how would you kill it would you a tank the hard approach that shows off your epeenehonour and use sub caps but make life much harder for yourself orb drop several dozen moms on it and rip it to sunder do choose a or b and im afraid choosing neither is invalid
not going to play the hypothetical dilemma game find someone who cares about protecting the get out of fight free card orca trick youll get more sympathy
arr you choose not to answer how sweet you seem to care quite a lot otherwise why els would you still be here as ive said eve isnt a nice place and the evey thing to do is use that gtfo free card but due to your own bloodlust you chose not to and you died to a better eve player but you come here and cry then you insult and use foul language because your warped ehonour makes you think that a get out of jail free card goes against the spirit of evei hope one day you will learn the true spirit of eve and start using your own dirty tricks instead of crying about loosing
awww poor baby i didnt go for your hypothetical crap you keep on defending the cheap trick though with the cry more business do that gankbear stereotype proudyou want to maintain a tactic that allows you to wimp out like not posting with your main ill let that speak for it self
you still dont understand even though its been explained to you a dozen times my dear im afraid you are beyond hope
going to need to do better than that try again
local is the whole reason for afking it is the tool they are trying to subvert when they leave the keyboard it only goes to show just how reliant you have become on its usewhile the guy is afk what exactly does he do to you
irony goon csm posts about cloaking
to my knowledge theres no pvpbots yet so when afk cloakers are indeed afk they dont do anything so basically they are just logged in and doing nothing how is this any different from being afk in a station in the end apart from you not knowing exactly where they are and them using a high slot for a cloakalso local
no but thanks for trolling
youre very welcome i just thought that you needed another excuse to support and bump your own thread again
you act like bumping is a bad thing
i had industry and mining  level 1 as default when i created this char so i too support this
im really not seeing the need plus who wants to buy pricy skills again when they later change their minds
has ccp laid off staff i have had a missing items petition in for over 24 hours and no apparent attention paid to it i just had another set of items disappear and again no response from ccp this is not the kind of service that i am used to with ccp are other players having these sorts of problems
how does this relate to the csm
ive had petitions unanswered for 24 days now so i really think youve nothing to complain about
this relates to csm insofar as csm are our advocates with ccp as to waiting 24 days for a petition answer you should be highly dissatisfied
its actually 24 days since the last gm message to established petitions that i keep adding new problems too the oldest unacknowledged addition being a fraction less than 24 days ago thats what happens when you limit a player to two petitions max 
this topic is to enhance player base dialog to csmccp about multiplemonitor compatibility fixes that ive found are needed or desired after the introduction of true multiple monitor support since incursion patchneeded hard to run mulimon without these fixedallow players to move the login page so it is not split over a screen bezelallow players to move the charactercreation  editing screen so it isnt split over a screen bezeldesired can do without but would greatly enhance game play and visual appeal for multimonallow resize of the main game space view window so as to allow 1 screen to contain only space and the other 1 screens to allow no spaceview and only dialog  menu panesallow resizing  better docking control of windows currently most windows are dockable  sizable but others are not easily moved to allow for control between screen bezels results in less seamless multimon viewabilityi know im not the only longterm player in the community that would like these revisions done and id say in my opinion it would be nice to see these attended to before further incarna features are brought onboard carbon ui is great but it is fairly useless to me with a dualscreen client when everything is split over the bezel
i suggested in my own abeit now burried assembly hall thread pretty much what youre suggesting obviously im going to give my supporti know my idea still means you end up getting a new photo every now and then but it sure as hell beats needing a new one every single time you change anythingedit shameless self promotion  any support to my own thread is also appreciated its more about changes to the nex store than it is about the character creator
the thing that makes botting possible is gameplay that doesnt require an actual brain trying to defend against the problem by keeping the client complicated and private is a massive massive exercise in fail mining ratting missioning are so simplistic with the right ship set up that 90 of it can be performed not with a dedicated client hack or macro but a simple keyboard mouse recorder repeating a sequence of actions people talk about afk missioning as a matter of routine strategy  thats how dumb the game play is in places really if ccp spent time on making pve game play interesting and having thought requirement then botting would not be an economically viable strategy as is stands ccp is far too concerned with incarna and what little time they spend on spaceships is focussed into pvp and 00 that it seems that the defacto model of making isk requires sitting at the computer occasionally pushing buttons but not apparently using your brain and is allowed to be as afk as you like so long as you dont use a client hackmacro the ops suggestion is good it would lead to a vibrant community of people who could fix ui issues far quicker than ccps ever so slow snail crawl toward usability crap gameplay would be quickly identified because youd see client side mods that highlighted which tasks are exploitable by automata it would be fantastic to be able to download plugins to replace bits eg overview hud market window with your own edited to 1 but only with ccp prepared to put effort in as above
i think your idea is good cloora but i wouldnt go as far as to have concord at gates just more and better sentry guns gate camping would still be feasible only now it should require campers to devote far more resources to their camps hopefully making them much rarer and more easily spotted on the system mapideally it would make highsec dwellers feel a little safer when venturing into lowsec perhaps to the point where many would start feeling comfortable ratting or mission running and perhaps  dare i dream  even mining mmm juicy minersessentially i think we need to give the bears the feeling that they have a chance at surviving in lowsec once they can travel around without the fear of gatecamps well see them lower their guard perhaps we can even make belt piracy viable again well need to improve the spawns though
i like this idea
can you sell the loyalty of your dog your girl friend your wife your friendsif so and your gf isnt half bad looking let me know
whiners gonna whine about people whining about people whininginfinity ha
ccp has a history of terrible customer service this is another example of some random crap they have done and cant back up with support 7 months to investigate his account and who knows how long to correct yoursfor anyone who hasnt experienced it they wont understand but for people who have been victims of ccp its a nightmare a game that charges rl money should have rl customer support or be sued by rl legal firms
so has ccp been bugged to get these minutes out id really love to read them
id love to see these nearly two months old minutes to count the number of dev blogs on nonspacebarbie things promised to be published soon
when i was secretary of the csm meeting minutes making used to be take notes during the meeting was a really really tough job taking notes and participating in discussions was difficult secretary comes back from iceland puts notes into something that resembles english secretary sends notes to ccp ccp edits sends back to csm csm checks that everything is ok tells ccp to publish themafter a couple of snafus during csm 5 the revision and back  forth process between csm  ccp has been extended so everyone is happy about what has been said because mischaracterization of ccps stance on some things occuredin csm 6 we now have the videoaudio recording of the sessions made available to make the minutes so the secretary doesnt have to take notes during the meeting thats a good thing but it also means said secretary has to spend an additional time listening to it all again and then doing back  forth and all thatill poke robert about it and direct him here so he can comment but as always its a learning process and the next ones should go faster
its not about spinningthe way the meetings are held and the conversations we have with the devs take place in a manner that is not appropriate for public consumption when we tell ccp they are insert expletive here for doing this or that it takes place within a certain context and an understanding of what is meantthe conversations are also back  forth where people express stances in strong words play devils advocate go to extremes reach consensus etc the community as a whole as opposed to individuals within that community has always displayed a very strong ability to take things out of context and yes spin itso these conversations have to be edited to present the arguments made from both sides and the conclusions reached not provide more venues for people to read what they want to read into what people sayabout the nda it allows us to comment on things ccp do before they do it like provide feedback on the most recent marketing campaign have constructive discussions about possibly unpopular upcoming changes try to have that on a forum it also gives ccp the ability to change plans when they chose to do so when facing a strongly negative reaction from us without having to go through threadnaughts about things theyre changing based on our feedback anyway
the current status of minutesmay done awaiting final ccp comments this has pretty much been the status for the last two weeks if they are not out next week i would be surprisedpeace conference in preparation first drafts of day 1 have been completed
thanks everyone i also like option 2option 1 can be done very easily and should be reinstated asap hopefully with plans to incorporate option 2 within the near future
this blatant exploit has gone on long enough players should not be allowed to have a tactical advantage while afk at any point this defines exploit everyone knows it is a problem it has been for a very long time why has nothing been donewhat is being done about this frustrating problem
htfu
what blatant exploit i see no blatant exploitno this defines exploiti see no problem here but your inability to adaptbecause it isnt a problemmaking fun of you for starters then another thread complaining that afk lol cloakers are ruining my bots will appear again next week and well make fun of that person as well lovely cyclical posting
it is tragic that i have to spell this out for you an enemys presence in a system causes numerous problems for locals in general people will not do anything outside sit in a pvp fleet when neutrals or reds even just one is present in a system this means no isk generating of any kind including mining and ratting without significant risk complexes are out of the question for fear that the enemy happens to have probing capabilities even well tanked ships are potentially at risk because we dont know if the enemy has a cyno so their mere presence can halt isk production in a system here comes the exploit they can have this major tactical ability without even being near their computer just leaving your character logged in and cloaked while youre at work is exploitation of game mechanics when it can so drastically affect so many people explain what counter measures you can employ against this
so go ing carebear in the system next door
you are utterly missing the point
the point is simple if you log into the system the afk cloaker is there when you log in you have to decide to take a risk to mine or rat inside that system and you dont know that he is afk just because he has been there all day doesnt mean that he is afk therefore in order to keep your industry level stable you have to continue to mine in the system to keep your military level stable you have to rat in the system it disrupts the production of ships for ctas and other wars it directly affects the wallets of those in the system the presence of the afk cloak lowers the ability to do this activity with zero risk to the cloaker if the person is there at the computer then hey great its a part of the game how ever if the person is afk he is gaining a tactical advantage and causing damage to the owners of that systems wallets with zero risk while not being at his computer this is what we are asking to be fixed not the fact that somebody jumps in system cloaks up and disrupts the system but the fact that they can walk away from there computer and not play and accomplish the same thing is what needs to be fixed i have no issues with them pulling the tactic to disrupt operations and cost me and my alliance money but they need to play the game to do so not be able to walk away and go to work or school
no one said 00 was safe
nobody is implying it is
i believe it is you who is missing the pointthe point that you are poster number 10032473982723 who says the ing thing every damn time and everyone else including ccp says the exact same thingshut upgo awayand adapt or diethis is eve onlineyou will nevereverget your wishgrow upgrow a pairand get used to itpeople who are cloaked cant do a damn thing except sit there its a mind game and obviously they won since your rage postingso just keep trolling awaybecause thats all your doing
it shouldnt surprise me that you are too thick to see the issue with thisthis statement is so ing stupid i cant even decide how to respond
just allow them to be probed active vanilla cloak reduces signature in half fill lowslots and implant slots with eccm to remain gay active cloak on ship with bonuses reduces it by 75 leaves coverts recons and bo technically still undetectable as intended all other stuff as is cycle times invisibility recalibration etchuge nerf to lolsolo capitals which shouldnt be possible anyway so bonushuge nerf to cloaky ratters so double bonus
maybe you wouldnt be afraid of afk cloakies if you were not afking in your space employ a combat air patrol while you mine have a player constantly watching the overview and scanning as you go about your business swap players in and out of this as the tedium eventually leads to lapses in concentration have your own cloaked ships standing by nearby so a cloaked attacker never knows exactly what he faces etc etcmy point being there are ways to considerably reduce the risk you face having to do these things is the price you pay for being inside unsecured space adapt or die
suresays the alt toon whose too blinded by rage to see past his immaturityfear the almighty cloakerwho sits in your system making you yell at silencejust keep crying those tears
because whenever someone mentions to just fix that problem and remove local a gazillion of carebears like you moan about not being able to farm 110 safely anymorean even more simple solution would be people like you just leaving nullsec you obviously do not belong there
do they now i didnt know it was a problem for the intelligent and organised player
such mobilization is absurd why not also have a supercap fleet waiting on standby while you rat too it is equally ridiculous considering the effort exerted by the enemy none all this just because some dip at precisely zero risk to himself is somehow allowed to continuously apply tactical pressure while he isnt even present at the keyboard your character should not have an impact on other players while you are absent from your computer your character should not profit while you are not playing the game the same reason botting isnt allowed why is this such a difficult concept for some of you
its called using your head tactically speaking amongst other reasons feel free to use your imagination ladies and gentlemenyou dont need a supercap fleetjust a modest simple pvp fleet of 5 to 8 ships ready to go at a moments notice and you keep on your guard and keep your eyes openif you want to mine in perfect peace and harmony with the carebear gods then go to high sec and stfu because everyone already knows this and we all have done it hell go to whs no local means you wont know anywayobviously you havent thats for sureive been on the receiving end and the giving end of afk cloaking its not that big of a bloody deal that you make it out to beyour just crying like a baby because you dont like getting atstop whining and stop being lazyanswering everyones arguments with you dont understand your dumb isnt going to help either
and the problem is what exactly the neutral entering system does face exactly the same dilemma he doesnt know if the people in station are present at the keyboard or not or if they even are in station or cloaked up somewherethese people continually apply tactical pressure without being at the keyboard at precisely zero risk to themselves im afraid your logic does fall flat on its face too bad
keep crying and failing to adapt in ways that are not even very hard to manage or stop whinging and be proactive the choice is yours i wish youd gone with the later myself if only to get you to shut up but of well
you made a categorically stupid statement sorry that bothers you
ok
this is the first counter argument in this thread that actually makes some sense the difference however is that the blues in the system have sovereignty they are there because it is the space theyve earned they arent afk because it provides a tactical pvp advantage nor are they specifically afk to put pvp pressure on opponents
because mobilizing a fleet of multiple players just so a single player can do some ratting is a simple and easy solution especially when the enemy has been cloaked in a system all day and for all you know will remain afk till dt hey guys i feel like making a little isk how about you all spend the next couple hours sitting in a fleet one system over and doing nothing else just in case this guy stops being afk thanks
if they intend to put tactical pressure on neutrals or not is not important fact is they do the same applies to the cloaker it might not even be his intentionfor example i used to ninjanpc to get my sec status fixed did this in a populated system and locals obviously complained i didnt mean to disrupt their activity at all it was just them being too chicken to undock with a single neutral in system the cloak was necessary to be safe in very hostile spacefact is the problem is not the cloaked neutral being afk or the docked blues being afk the problem is they all show up in the local chatlocal needs to be removed and this whole problem goes away since ccp appears to be on this same page as well well have our solution at some point hopefully soon
so adapt group up work together start being proactive theres no reason you cant make a profit while minimising risk or perhaps you just prefer whingingseriously  if youre unable to cope with a lone cloaked ship in system you need to move back to highsec because you clearly dont have the organisational ability necessary to survive in less secure spacealternatively advise me where your system is and ill fly my stealth bomber on over and park it there a couple weeks d
if it was just a lone cloaked ship i had to worry about it would not be a problem for me the problem is whether or not they have a cyno equipped
you dont seem to understand 00 is supposed to be worthless and cause endless streams of tears from foolish people who hold it until you wise up and move to npc space you will keep suffering from this wonderful mechanic
yumyum delicious tears
if he has a cyno surely he needs to be active to use it plus many cyno situations can be negated with a jammerthe thing is your problem isnt cloaks but local intel channel youre misreading the instant intel its giving you and making bad judgements based on your misreadingwithout a change to local cloaks should remain as they are now
yup another i dont leik cloaks becuz i cannot figure demz out why this game no easy like wow waa waa waa thread reaches its climaxsee you all at the next one o
what precisely do i not get about cloaking mechanics
everything thats its no exploit and youre the one failing d
wrong try again
the problem isnt the afk cloaker he cant do anything to you the problem is local telling you he is there at all
val they dont want to hear facts they simply want risk free pveinb4 but theres no risk in cloaking and going afk for hours answering with yes when cloaked everyone is safe until the cloak is deactivated then everyone is at risk but without local afking is pointless as a psychological weapon
the carebear infection is spreading even ccp has it now
i kind of agree although there is a small chance things may get better but im not holding my breathedit just in case you didnt know that can be found in the dev answers thread here
theyll keep crying and whinging unless they feel 100 safe how are they failing so epically to get that low and null sec is not supposed to be safe d
its cute that you gots continuously repeat this but nobody in this thread has implied that nullsec is supposed to be safe
because covops dont exist
to be understood you should at least make a coherent post that makes sense then people will understand what you are talking aboutyou may as well have just replied purple monkey socks tbh
i can think of 3 htfu use dscan to see if they have probes out remove local fixed 
for all the fear there is of afk cloakersi really cant see why people fear them yes they have a tactical advantage with zero risk being unable to be scanned but the fact is you shouldnt be working in lowsecnullsec without protection anywaysif you see five people in local and cant find any of them yeah they may be afk but youd still be holed up because they may be a gang waiting on youif you see one person in local and cant find them grab a buddy to watch your back or five hell have two of them use battleships to mine  the guy if an active enemy wont actually know what you have equipped and will leave you alonepoint is sorry afk cloaking causes stress but its not like they are an invincible hammer of doom waiting to smash on you local behaves this way for a reason  you can guess what kind of threat there is just by the number of people its also a tactical move by enemies well post five or six alts in an enemy industrial system sometimes just to make them think we have unscannable tengus waiting to hit them theyve done the same to us im sureas will all things low and nullsec  buddy system you numbskull  if youre afraid or unsure bring friends if local explodes in a frenzy of people gtfo and hole up local is nice like that you people make this a bigger problem than it really is can you imagine what wh would be like if it had a local nobody would go out there hardly if they all thought like you if youre trying to help out your corpalliance on off hours and solo welcome to the world of lownull its not safe dont solo it if youre afraid to lose it rule 1 of eve  dont fly what you cant afford to lose
um i think a lot of people are missing the point its not that the afk cloaker can do something or not its because you dont know if he is afk and it makes a huge difference if he is afk there are lots of things a cloaky can do to younobody should have unkillable and unfindable status for days on end without ever needing to leave a system they are invincible you cant do  against them thats the whole point and they can keep on being invincible forever and just be a pain in the ass forever and there isnt  you can do against themdid i say that alreadyim sorry but having some guy sit in a system for weeks on end even forever without anyone being able to find him is ed up period if you guys cannot see how wrong that is get a in lobotomy
well yes as things are bound to show up on the market i want those ship skins once they come out getting plexeswhat the hell is so bad about mtsif you dont want to spend real money for a in world currency boohoo grow a pair and wait till someone sells them on the market for 1billion or moreits not like the nex store axe murdered your family and childrensure ccp lied to you but people and so corporations change like you never broke a promiseoh theyre greedy theyre hunting for our money we saw so in the leaked bulletin  yeah real mature ccp does one greedy action maybe more and thats enough for hundreds if not thousands of people to unsubscribe sometimes i think eve is filled with 13 year olds who got a hold of their parents credit cards and their parents wont allow the purchase of 6 plexesalso micro transactions were always in the game plexes you pay for a item in game which can be sold for iskwhy are you making such a big deal out of something that already exists they just expanded it
id settle for the old hanger being returned simply because it was highly functional and ran fast
supported
i would be also happy with a modified non navigatable model of the ship hanger from the view from the cq i know many here are adamant on the old ship spin but i personally would be okay with the cq view with no character model overlooking the hanger i personally like the sense of scale of the ships is the cq perspective betteranything is better than the door
pondermeh i wouldnt mind this it is a bit of a pain to use a jump clone to not risk my implantshowever i would like it if there were boosts that lasted an entire year so i didnt have to worry about it that often
i like this i think the barriers the op describes are real so im giving it a 1 however there are alternative changes that would give the same effect including reducing the price of attribute implants so that say a 5 is the same price as a current 4removing just 5s from the gamelimiting the legality of implants by sec statusallowing more flexible balanced clone jumping presumably extra jumps per 24hrs for a fee or invalidating your medical clone
interesting but how exactly would you reduce the price on something in a completely market driven economyeither it was on oversight or you misunderstood how prices of things are determined in eve
while i am very interested in where this discussion is going to end up i am skeptical the unsaid con of this proposal is that although people would pvp more each pvp winloss would be worth less therefore dulling an otherwise exhilarating or painful experience to something about the excitement level of a chess game nothing wagered nothing won means less of an experience in general personally if i blow up an enemy the experience is made sweet in me knowing that he lost a lot of isk in implants now if implants were cheap or free or insured then that takes a lot of the fun out of the killhow do you propose to mitigate that side effect
the side effect will be mitigated by the fact that alot more people will see the use of pirate implants in slot 15 especially the low grade ones that are very cost effective for their bonus what stops alot of people from using them today is the weak 2 attribute bonus
if these are so cost effective i read as meaning cheap then how exactly does that give me the satisfaction that i just wasted  of my enemies isk
cost effective  cheap it means that they give a good bonus to your ships considering their price if you want to feel satisfaction about podding someone you will probably do that more believing someone had pirate implantsthis idea is not perfect since im not a person working with game balance but as you can see in the thread people like what the idea stands for character progression is the core of any mmorpg and the fact that the people experiencing combat andor explore the world should be penalized is in my oppinion wrong in eve its contraproductive to do things that would yeild you more experience in any other game it seems like you have made it your personal crusade to keep talking down this thread im all open for suggestions on how to improve the concept but when you just keep trying to grasp at straws to talk it down please just keep out
that should have been done 3 years ago
emote supports this
i would humbly suggest that in order to make this vote statistically significant we need control cases which is a similar vote to buff say caldari amarr and minmatar ships just speaking from a scientific point of view 
im having serious doubts about ccp actualy using this forum i got a feeling they have very special one  their own  very internal one where only ccp can post and praise and reasure themselves this one was made for us capsulers to allow us to blow off some steam and live on thinking ccp actualy responds to our opinions steam gone for the sake of this post lets assume half of your customers likes cq and the other half dont i realise it is impossible to please everyone but doesnt it make sense to at least aim in 100 customers being satisfied in this case its very simple  add an old hangar option for the half that doesnt like cq and not some crappy looking door why dont you say  hey we have made a mistake treating you in this manner let us fix it for you capsulers instead you are trying to convince cq good for us thats just insulting how would you feel if half of your customers cancelled their subscriptions steam gone againlastly  i fully support the idea of choice in the game choice is the thing which makes eve a special game choice makes eve a very personal experience to each one of us limiting choice will eventualy make it linear sidescrollers are linear please bring old hangars back  as a default or an option do not try to improve what doesnt need any improvements best regards to all eve players
consider yourself extremely blessed to have my seal of approval i was actually working on something similar and talking it over with some alliance mates so either this idea of yours is totally coincidence or you stole it from me considering how close it is to my idea except a few changes i would say you stole itin the spirit of not having multiple threads on the same thing i will simply thumbs this one up and walk away like a gentlemanfair warning to you though if you steal an idea from me again i will hunt you down and destroy everything you own you will not have a ship to spin or a two modules to rub together i will crush you crystal clear on thatthats what i thought thief
pretty sure that is gonna be pretty damn difficult to implement if even possible at all without major changes to how ewar modules are applied to targetsi like the idea its a pretty creative approach to the supercarrier problem and also gives at least some kind of purpose to eafs but its not gonna fly unfortunately
the only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible  arthur c clarke
thats a nice quote but besides the point it isnt about impossible or possible it is about developer resources and feasibility
cant stop the signal
obviously for this to make any sense the effects would have to work on regular carriers titans and triage carriers aswellthe concept of jamming the ship controlling the drones and thereby jamming the drones makes sense to some extend but fighters are iirc sposed to be mannedeven though the suggestion might help with some much needed ballance on the supercapital warfront i  personally  would like to see a more logical solutionafterall if jamming the mothership meaning the ship controling the dronesfighters results in potential jam on the drones every ship with a dronebay ought to be affectedthe way i see it one of the points of an external weaponsystem such as dronesfighters is to avoid thisin the same regard i feel the suggestion that limiting scs to only carrying fighters and fighter bombers is illogical it is supposed to be the biggest baddest drone carrier out there why shouldnt it be able to launch the most basic light scout dronesi feel that the main problem with scs and titans tracking bs like inties track cruisers aside for that matter is the sheer numbers i would like to see an increase in vulnarabilty ehpslot nerfslave compatability before changing the mechanics that from a logical standpoint should affect almost every ship in the gamethat said eafs do need love and supercaps do need a severe battering with the nerfhammer but i must say i dont think this two flies with one swat solution however elegant is the way to go about itgah hope i ended up making sense psmurf

i have about 10000 or so bookmarks on occasion i need to reorganize them into folders due to a reinstall every clickanddrag to move a set of bookmarks into a folder however takes several seconds if i try to open the folder as a separate window and drag the bookmarks to the folder window title bar then it becomes horribly slowi suggest that ccp write a devblog about how bookmarks work internally and give some consideration to improving bookmarksthank you in advance
i like the new turrets and the icons incidentally youve implied one response with your topic and another with your questions in the thread youre going to get people who do support the turrets not supporting the thread and people who dont support turrets supporting the threadif you want clear answers then why make a thread worded this way
i like them but i also agree with others who suggested that they can have some color cues to make them racially distinguishable
you like icons that fail basic ui guidelines which is which turret please visit your user settings to reenable images d
come now dont be mean you asked in this thread therefore everyone is entitled to their opinion not fair to bait people to answer just to smear them with itthey could use some improvement yes and until that happens we will just have to read the names yes is it more of a pain yes but still no reason to advocate going backwards instead of fixing them
sorry im being mean by posting pics like this please visit your user settings to reenable images blink why would anyone defend ccp for changing from good icons to clearly awful ones that isnt progress
im just saying that you should have made the subject of your thread fix the icons instead of trying to tease out people who like them just to berate them thats just mean
there is nothing wrong with turret iconstheyre awesome dark balls of mess so no one can tell what module they are activating its cool now theyre almost as bad as all other icons in game just look how descriptive those ship icons are on your overview you can immediately battleship
the turret icons could use some work they are rather hard to see but thats due to their detail in such a small icon not much you can do with this though  in time people will get used to them just like the new icons for mwds blueprints etcthe turrets themselves are great which i dont think anyone disagrees with hardly i personally wish t2 still had a distinctive look from the t1 turrets but oh well
upper is tractor beam lower is salvager if you cant see that you either need to tweak your monitors color saturation or something or go to an optician perhaps for a description and then head to specsavers
i mean its not like every single other software company does manage to push out some kind of a roadmap i dont see why ccp cant to me it looks like they dont have one the features we get are either adhoc on a devs whim or part of the greater master plan pi incarna of other games some features are discussed and then silently dropped  the new neocon bookmarks in overview t3 frigs  are they on hold or permadeleted should i retrain from galante because the hulls and guns suck and the drones are bugged or are they going to address it in the next 12 monthsin terms of expectation management yeah some things dont arrive on time everyone knows this  no doubt some people would rage but they probably rage anyway at least with a roadmap you can see what they are working on even if its release point is a guestimatesupported
supported soe is releasing a 3 year roadmap for planetside 2why cant ccp do that for eve dont give specific release dates at most give a rough guesstimate based on quarters the roadmap could be published as a wiki type blog where things can be added removed modified deleted and timeframe goals changed as internal expectations change
cant have a roadmap if you already went off the cliff
contradict yourself muchi think what has been sufficiently established is that there are proponents and opponents to this suggestion just like to pretty much every other suggestion ever made anywhere about anythingin the end neither side will change their mind based on arguments of the opposing sidewe will just have to wait and see whom reality proves right when ccp makes a decision how to deal with sp in the light of a diminishing eve user base my money is on  well  money at the end of the day ccp is a forprofit business and its decisions will be governed by what creates the most profit for the company i have no doubts that selling sp in a controlled fashion will generate the most profit and those of you who will quit wont be missed
listen to yourself lol yeah sure  ccp will totally destroy a large part of mmos that keeps people coming backdiminishing eve user base lmfao  eve has done nothing but grow since day ing one dyoure so full of  its really quite remarkable you wont even accept that theres a majority of players who dont support eve being ruined that csm matters because they wont stand for eve being ruined so course they are utterly irrelevant to everyone in your deluded mind and ccp who has repeatedly stated most recently just a week ago eve will not be ruined by game changing mtyoure so arrogantyoure so full of youre so delusionalits just ing sad at this point
i bet you 1 plex that we are right and you are delusionally wrong 
i giggle every time somebody and there always is somebody shows just how little they know about the real world when they cite precedence as justification ahem i mean excuseso we have black market knock offs of prada bags made in china already so why not sell them enmasse in bloomingdaleso we have murderers and pickpockets in the world already so why not make murder sanctioned and do away with private propertyjust because you have some people who buy toons already akin to overthecounter bespoke derivative contracts why not have them securitized and traded on a electronic stock exchange great idea hey the 2 are exactly the samehey we have a leaky toilet hey may as well knock out the pipes altogether and poop into a bucket
eve has grown over the years but that growth stagnated in recent years as is clearly illustrated by the concurrent player count not surpassing the record set back in 2009 yes 2009 thats two years ago see 51675 pilots 50k pcu barrier smashed since then eve sees upper 40k on a good day and often just in the upper 30k players online at any given timenow we could believe what you are saying that the game is growing or we could believe what i am saying that its growth has halted i have the concurrent player count to point to what do you haveincidentally another niche game managed to set the world record of concurrent players on a single server merely one year after the open beta of the game started world of tanks recently topped out at 91k players online see world of tanks sets world record thats just the number of players online at any one time not the total number of customerswhat keeps people in any game is the entertainment value the game provides eves entertainment value in comparison to other games is not nearly as strong as it once was when there were few other choices this is especially true for totally new and younger as in eve age playersyou can stomp your foot and pull your hair out all you want the writing is on the wall and ccp knows it the mmo industry has collectively embraced mt because it is profitable much much more profitable than subscriptions its only a matter of time for eve to go f2p and sp being available for cash in some form or another
not sure if seriousif youre that content on skipping the lowskillpoint phase of the game buy a charhell you can even fund it via gtcsproblem solved
your numbers are nice but doesnt support your argument that there is a problem so what if the numbers in eve are less than some other mmo as long as ccp is still making money and those in the game are still enjoying the game then is it really a bad thing to have less players id like to think that like my handbag analogy eve is a luxury brand with quality customers and appeal to a relatively niche market of the greater gaming community we dont care for nor need the mass appeal of your run of the mill mainstream cash cow glitzy mmos so unless you can show that this elitist model of the game and its players is going to be end of it all then i think that this line of argument isnt going to hold any water
yes stagnated growth is a bad thingthe goal of any business is consistent growth its not just a matter of making profit its a matter of profit maximization making the most profit possible that is what drives businesses the market and the economy ccp is privately held so we dont exactly know how much pressure they are under to meet quarterly expectations but we can reasonably assume that eve profits paid for dust and some of wod development in fact eve is the wod alphabeta test when it comes to carbonso to answer your question no just making profit is not enough it never isthe reason for that is that theres opportunity cost why commit your resources to a venture that makes less profit than a different venture could when utilizing the same resourcesprofit is essential consistent growth is essential especially in a market that isnt capped out yet eve could easily have more users if minor changes in how it works were to be implemented
its people like you who think profit isnt enough but constant high growth is needed that has resulted in nearly all mmos becoming braindead casual games not to mention the growthallcostsideology damage to the real worldregardless eves subs have continued to grow since day one and while its not fast growth it has been steady enough to increase the userbase and reach new max concurrent user levels every year eg on january 23 2011 a new record of 63170 concurrent players was set
youre all pretty far off track by now mayby we should just thread
yep
indeed then im going to presume that you either are telling a tall tale for the sake of argument failed said econ 101 class or have not played eve longer than 1 year everyone who has lived in new eden longer than their trial account knows that when there is an exploit there will be people to exploit it look at jita there are still constant scammers in local looking for easy marks if you really think that people will be honorable mostly just take a look at the bond market there isnt an ingame one hmmm i wonder if that is significant and bonds have real worth ie the funds that were deposited for debt if these fail to find a market in game think about why and then ask yourself why equities which are basically worthless might fair betterif you cant figure it out then i will support this proposal i would love an equity market based on fictitious prices that i can manipulate to make money off suckers  then ill start a isk pyramid scheme while im at it
i dont think you read what i said at all let me post it again and if someone is clever enough to find a loop hole and exploit the systemmore power to em
okay i dont disagree with you on that one but the issue then becomes with so many existing flubs in the game that need fixing like the fw system the bounty system do you really think it wise for ccp to push out another one after all the threads about commitment to quality and stop rolling out crap directed at ccp in this and many forums i think that sorta sums up this thread good idea no practical way to yet implement properly lets wait and fix the core issues first at least that is my takesystems that arent working as intended because people found ways around the mechanisms breaking them leaving them pretty much unused
since character trade is already legal i cannot figure why it becomes bad just because the seller is from china whats the difference except your prejudiceUFF1Fnot to say that i am right my opinion is that most noobs dont quit because they get killedplayer in everygame get killed and lost something they quit eve because they see no hope 2 years before fly the ship they like and free to enjoy the game basiclly implys never in a game and when they get killed they found that there will be basically never a chance to revenge then they really dont see the point to stay sp from bazaar merchandise will be much cheaper so it is not necessary that he do so it makes no difference whether the alts are his own or others and others wont deliberately train alts to sell sp because they must pay more to ccp first and simply selling plex will give them more anyway people are free to have alts now as long as they pay for them in this case they actually pay more for the same actual useable sp thoughthank you 2 for seeing the different side and telling it i will accept it honestly when you find some real flaw refuting with logic is much much better than repeating the happy rifter crap again and again which is really getting old and disgusting
so you want to provide instant gratification and the ability for people to use alts as sp farms you want to remove the need to plan make choices and tradeoffs and face consequencesive had fun from day one in eve and i still fly t1 ships most of the time what do you think youre suddenly going to be fulfilled everything will be wonderful all your problems will melt away and youll start having crazy fun if only you can fly a very high level ship okeve is what you make of it its a player run game in terms of most content if youre not enjoying yourself now having a fancy ship isnt going to change thatand making posts that ignore all the serious downsides of sellingtrading sp isnt going to change eve
intradasting
nor is making posts that ignore the one argument for it namely that eve may not really have that long any more certainly not 8 years 2 maybe i therefore support any proposal that allows redistribution of sp that doesnt involve printing sp out of thin air
keep ignoring reality  ie that eve is growing and has been since day one no one who matters supports ruining eve with sp tradingselling and simple logic tells us removing progression destroys mmosthe delusion is powerful with these fools
alright by your own logic we should remove fleets aswell because as any whiner knows fleets are unfair because it makes it more then 1v1 and bringing in an orca to swap ships is the same as if he just swapped out with a buddy in a fleet by moving out of combat rangeyou really need to learn better you had a window and should have known your ship couldnt take it its a legitamate tactic shoulda either a warped out or b called in a buddy to either rep or help you out with dps though with your attitude i doubt anyone would come fact is you did neither you chose to die
actually i like the idea just make it apply to high security only its like the old west when two persons agreed to a personal duel know as a showdown which the sheriff would let happenglobal criminal countdowns such as shooting a neutral are handled by concord sheriff which is done very quickly getting a personal criminal countdown stealing towards another player is asking for combat showdownif someone in high security transgresses a neutral player and gets criminally flagged for stealing they should not be allowed to switch ships during the 15 minute timer if the neutral player responds and initiates combat they can not switch ships during that 15 minute timerthe reason is because the player made the decision to transgress a neutral while in that specific ship and was caught red handed so to speak and is looking for a showdown if the neutral player shoots the transgressor he too becomes locked out of switching ships in that 15 minute timer since he decided to participate in the showdown however if the neutral player doesnt shoot or agress the transgressor that neutral player can switch ships and then enter into the showdownboth players can also run and hide dock in station after starting the showdown if they desireof course both players can also have their corp gang members jump in and do remote repair but they cant shoot unless shot at first this could lead to some very interesting showdowns happening sorta like showdown at the ok corral it wouldnt take much to program this into the code mechanics and it wouldnt break the game actually i think it would make the game more balanced and also level the playing fieldthats my 2 isk worthdmceditadunh slavy you can edit your original post and add this idea if you like it also you can post support to this proposal when you post a replythose that say  you made a choice bla bla bla this will break the game mechanics bla bla bla etc are just trolling which i see happening a lot in this thread just ignore them
it is against the design philosophy of committing to a fight if you cant tell the difference then youre not as insightful as you pretend to be
not being able to swap is a bad idea you just need to be faster to catch him in his original nonthreatening ship and not stick around when another ship warps in
they are attempting to defend the tactic because they use it the cry more stuff the carebear crap is one of the oldest games on eve forums just the typical gankbear whine and attempt at intimidationas for your idea that sounds as though it may be more complicated that the current flagging system can handle what i am proposing is quite simple a player can not switch ships at a ship hangar while they are being red boxed they can eject deal with the session timer and then switch ships but not a direct swap while being red boxed
its not about me being faster or slower its about someone getting a cheap way out of a fight a way out that goes against a design philosophy that ccp has been promoting for years  having players commit to fights
so that excuses you not being smart enough to run away when the odds turn in the other players favour as if most can theft isnt a setup anyway d
im going to bookmark this thread on how a op can quickly lose all credibility with the public audience once he gets all riled up and caught up in personal attacks and irrelevant argumentsas for the actual proposal i dont think this is a good idea so somebody is aggroing me that means i cannot jump out of my ship to change ships to come back to kill him sounds like a birthday present for gankers and pirates to me
good for you just add another personal attack in there while youre at it the proposal is that you cant swap ships into and out of the hangar array you can eject warp off and come back and get another ship once the session timer is up
has nothing to do with me it has to do with the commit to a fight design philosophy sorry but fail try again
it certainly sounds like and behaves like an exploit ccp just need to identify it as one
so you failed to see the situation change and get out now you come on here complaining and then cry when others point out your failurei like this thread already carry on
so not actually denying hangar swaps but rather maintenance array swapsas long as it applies to highsec only i see no problem with itclean up your post lifestory is really unnecessary  and remove the mention of hangar for support
no referral to your background no referral to your name race upbringing or social class or experience no unfounded assumptions about you only the evidence of the past posts on this threadactually sounds to me like i was just stating facts it seems that the problem may be that you take many statements as personal thus setting off a derailed argument which is a digression from the actual thread which this branch is soon in danger of being if we were to continue this metadiscussion about how you take things personally
lol you can play the innocent little lamb game someplace else if it bugs you that i dont take crap on forums and throw it right back then feel free to ignore me other wise deal with itsince youve nothing to add to the topic you can now be cited as a hypocrite thanks for playing
has nothing to do with me it has to do with the cheap little tactic to avoid committing to a fight thanks for trying the cry more tactic refer to the ps
x adunh slavy made the opx adunh slavy talked about himself and his fail  i said cry morex adunh slavy cries a lot anyway  cloaks were mentionedx adunh slavy seems to be upset  profit was hadgreat thread will read again
yeah except he didnt avoid the fight did he he switched ships and you got pwned btchyou moron you fell for the oldest trick in the book even 3weeks old noobs know better than to blindly jump on a canflipper and yet you went for it your choice your consequences he could also have called in his corp buddies to warp to 0 on your ass that is just one of the risks you run for taking the baityou are pretty shameless really most players when they make a booboo like this just shake their heads smile at their own stupidity and then move on not you apparently
not ccp either actually the idea of unscoutable forces is something they want to get rid off and is one of the main reasons for cynos probably being changed soonlast i checkedheard the maintenance array trick is complete consequence avoidance as even if a victim is prepared and beats the crap out of the griefer he can just store ship leaving an unaggressed pod which brings concord if attackedit is like playing kickcan and then carrying the can around
citation neededthen he just shouldnt fire at the pod doh  but thats problem here isnt it the op apparently cant control himself very well and i bet he would petition it too if he shot the pod ugh
this thread is hilarious dthe op is dumb enough to attack a bait can thiefthe op sees an orca warp in he keeps trying to kill the no doubt well tanked baitthe bait ship enters the orca the op does nothinga t3 pops out of the orca the op probably tried to attack it d certainly the op still didnt runcue locking soundspop the ops sad little ship vanishes in a cloud of plasmain summary the op had every chance to prevent or later disengage from the agression he was clearly beyond being able to cope withbut instead of learning an important lesson in eve the op decides to get on the forums and start wailing that those nasty wasty pirates wont follow marquess of queensberry rules dwhen the ops nooblevel mistakes and stupidity are then promptly pointed out to him he starts pummeling his little fists ineffectively on the ground cries more and continues on his epic fail to get that eve is street fighting not boxing in a ring with rulesmy question is how is someone suffering from near total braindeath able to turn his pc on much less play eve
such typical eve tough guy bravodo this is why i put the ps in the first post because all the internet tough guys come up with the cry more crap they some of you dont care about the issue and that it is against design philosophythanks for helping me prove the point of the sorts that defend these lame tactics of course no matter what i say the mentality will always retort with cry more or u mad its too difficult to discuss the actual issue its too dangerous discuss it for some of you who wish to divert attention from such a cheap little trick and attempt to place all the blame on the messengernone of you are objective enough to face up to the fact that this lame tactic goes against the commit to a fight design philosophy youd rather whine and waggle your fingers at me just another lame tactickeep making my point for me 
was a flurry of dev activity on nullcyno improvements back in february if i recall just regular posts in different threads so finding it with the broken search is not something ill do without being drunkdruggedcyno delay cyno displacement mobile jammer and so on were the thread topics i thinkdont think he shot the pod but you are missing the point rather badly the array trick allow us to completely circumvent aggression mechanics  the very same mechanics that people want made harsher by extending dock aggression and making rr subject to itthere is no reason whatsoever for maintenance arrays to be excluded from the aggression mechanics but ccp in their infinite ignorance probably dont know how to fix it so hopes it goes away on its own
keep failing to admit you got yourself killed through your own stupidity you had several chances to avoid your destruction and then to avoid being mocked here but you didnt take a single one of them as i said  this thread is hilarious d
there was no pod to shoot the other player borded the new ship straight away from vigil to loki with no intermediate pod session change involved
awww look another lame attempt at attacking the messenger and not the message thanks for the bump
your message is that you should be protected from being stupid no thanks your stupidity is too funny 
actually im quite satisfied at having you prove my point exactly which was incidentally if you missed it if you didnt come across so angry and looking to punch back at any response you may have gotten more supports to this thread
during the old scan mechanics the time for a scan was much higher then what is present todaysniping was a possible tactic but you could never stay on the same spot for longer period of time due to people getting a spot on youthen the mechanic we have now got implemented and sniping as a viable tactic kinda disappeared probes deployed meant they would have a spot in 5 sec so there was really no point going sniping since anyone could get on top of you really fastenter the unprobable setups this made us and other groups able to use snipers probes in the water didnt mean you would get 30 peeps landing on top of your head before you had aligned that it was impossible to probe out in general was just a pure bonusmy proposal increase scan time for scanning down player controlled ships this can be done with increasing the scan time with the combat scanner probes and deep space scanner probesit makes sniping a viable tactic even if there are probes in the water but it makes it a hit and run tacticalignment time for a average bs is around 12 seconds thats from a stand still point then add up the deceleration time from coming out of warpscan time with combat probes around 5 secondsconclusion sniping with probes in the water is kinda equal to hitting self destruct when you are initiating warp
gladly supported 1
change mininum warp distance to 250 km
agreed bring small gang pvp back
i can suppport this
yep yep yep fix pvp
hate burn eden actually they suckbut they are fun to fight and they had a good set up strategy with their snipersgive em their toys beack
nomake minimum warp distance farther but do not make it longer to scan someone down this would have been fine when you couldnt put a filter with probes on your overview now that any decent pvper or low sec mission runner can see probes on directional it already made probing people down in space that much harder before they leave

didnt ccp say in that devblog on the turrets somewhere missiles were on the slate with the other modules like tp and ewar and stuff
i recall them saying that no we wont get missile launcher animations like the turrets
ccp could you please have your economic adviser read this thanksplayersbefore you throw a fit please read the whole thing this suggestion is not meant to take away your ability to throw away money it will just prevent you from doing it at other peoples expense as wellone would assume that a market should be based on supply and demand of goods and price should increase or decrease according to these laws not only based on demand and supply but on the intensity of each after 3 years of observation and extensively playing the eve market i came to the realization that this is not the case what actually drives the prices is the peoples lack of desire to maximize income and their ability to change the prices arbitrarily which they do not do in real life because in real life you lose real money before you jump with objections im going to give you my reasons why this is not the casenow please tell me who in their right mind would take a 15 price cut on their shares in the real world and give up 15000 for every 100000 they sell answer nobodyhere are the symptons of the irregular and chaotic market1 people with lots of money who can cause a market price crash because they are willing to take huge losses for the hell of it who does that in real life not even the richest billionares2 ignorance or spite driven enormous price drops kills the ability of real cost conscious manufacturers to make a profit3 huge price drops in very short amounts of time which are not driven by supply or demand but rather by 1 personmy point here is not to make things more or less profitable for anything or anyone in particular but to balance the chaos which is the eve market today which under normal circumstances would be self balanced by fear of losswhich in eve is nowhere near as rl money and must be enforced by ruleshere are the main causes of this imbalance1 first and foremost eve is treated as a game and thus prices not regarded as money consequentially the eve market cannot and will not behave like a real money market because its notreal money its isk and treated as such now ccps goal is to make the eve market as realistic and balanced as possible but they have missed a few key controls which are necessary as people dont really care about selling at the highest possible price but just cashing in their loot or production even at a loss2 secondly the price of goods is not dictated by the need for them or the supply by rather by impulsive individuals this wiliness to forego income which cannot be controlled at the moment in eve is the reason why the market does not work well 3 the ability of 1 person to cause an instant price drop on any 1 or more items by any amount and the ability to set an arbitrary price or a market order what nutcase would sell crude oil for 100 usd  barrel when the price is 110 nobody in rl would in eve they do simply because they dont care and can set any price for a sell order4 supply and demand playing a minor role overall and prices are being driven by the above factors instead of economic ones the price increase and drops should be governed by the speed of demand and supply rather than by 1 person deciding to put up 10 megathrons at 2 million below lowest market price by speed of demand and supply i mean by how active the market is going down meaning you have 1000 people dropping their price by 001 every 5 minutesthe price will plummet but its a collective trend driven by supply and demandnot by 1 person who just screwed the whole market if supply is tight this will be unlikely to happen however it does happen in eve if you have 12 megathrons for sale at 90 million and the daily deman is 50 megathrons you will again have some guy who decides to sell his megas faster at 80 millon each taking a 10 million opportunity loss on each one who in their right mind does that in rl answer nobody
in a real market economy people go broke and lose their shirt in eve they dont they just drop prices below cost without knowing it messing with the market prices beyond beliefso long as the above conditions exist the eve market will not behave as the real marketmy suggestions to place some controls and balance the market a bit would be as follows1 regulate the amount by which players can drop the prices of an item on the market i would put a maximum limit price drop of 010 of the lowest region price per order meaning you cannot set a price lower than 9990 of the lowest region price so if the lowest price for some item is 100 isk you cannot put yours up for sale lower than 9990 isk now here one would tread carefully as there are different prices in different regions of regions so if you are selling in a system where the lowest region price is farther than 5 jumps away then your new benchmark price becomes the lowest price within 5 jumps this would let you match prices that are higher in your particular part of the region in the case of minerals and other low priced item the increment will be a maximum of 001 isk drop per changed orderso this way prices would drop only if you have a lot of people willing to change their prices very fast by 010 or 001 isk basically a sustained collective trent instead of giving 1 person the power to screw the market prices also prices would rise if a lot of buyers are buying up the orders faster than the prices dropwhich is what should happen but doesnt it doesnt happen because people are willing to undercut other people even in very high demand secenarios thus causing prices to drop even then2 create a contract type called wholesale where players can set lower prices for multiples of the same item they wish to sell at a discount instead of selling it on the market and screwing the whole market dynamics here they may sell only 1 item type per contract and must sell a minium of 2 units here these people can set any price you want for your items give them away for free if you want without affecting the market trendsyes the result of this rule would be consistently higher prices throughout eve in my opinion the above rules would1 prevent 1 person from driving the market prices2 give people who are willing to take a small loss and sell their stuff the tools to do so without screwing everyone else who is willing to play the market game3 place price controls which only allow drastic price movements if they are genuinely driven by market forces instead of individual preferences4 remove price dumping from the marketwhich is illegal in most countries afaik
to quote myselfmaybe you wouldnt be afraid of afk cloakies if you were not afking in your space employ a combat air patrol while you mine have a player constantly watching the overview and scanning as you go about your business swap players in and out of this as the tedium eventually leads to lapses in concentration have your own cloaked ships standing by nearby so a cloaked attacker never knows exactly what he faces etc etcmy point being there are ways to considerably reduce the risk you face having to do these things is the price you pay for being inside unsecured space adapt or die
well there are ways to to reduce the risk right but the effort of both sides is inbalanced in my eyes and btw its not unsecured space its player secured space so it canshould be saver then high sec if people care of itthe afk cloaker jumps in warps somewhere and activates a module and goes afkhe can come back every time and maybe open up a cyno thats everything he needs to dothe other side needs to look at dscanoverview every 25 secondsthey need to be aligned 76 speed not possible during mining or uselsess when warp scrambled by npcsthey can have a fleet on standby that needs to react fast so they have to stay alerted and in range maybe 12 jumps awayi would like to see a way to find cloaked ships in space cause i think every undocked ship should be killable somehow but it should take some time to find someone so cloakies are not completly useless maybe 25 minutes so if you cloak with a rattingbs on a moon or so you have some time to call reinforcements and the others wont have to wait to long to be able to kill youjust my 2 cents
as cloaking devices are a specialist item they should require a specific fuel to run the main aim of this proposal is to move the use of the device to a more tactical basis rather than just another module fitting the device would this provide a benefit hiding at a small expense refueling periodicallythis proposal does not prevent the tactic of shadowing systems as a cloaked afker per se but would require the cloaker to refuel periodically as a tradeoff for the cloaked interdiction of a systemfuel usage can be scaled to the ship that the device is used on with advantage in fuel usage resting with specialist craft such as covops then scaling through recon type vessels all the way to capital ships covops could run cloaks in the hours whilst capitals could only run it in the minutes
this is a terrible idea its already hard enough to evade well manned and well organised gate camps even with a covert ops cloak its only because camping a gate is so boring and people getting lax as a result that cloakies can slip by nownot to mention how this would hurt scouts and spies as well as blockade runners ferrying good long distance out of dangerous space etc
this has already been proposed and discussed i dont think we need to hash it out again
why
lololololol
this change would fix a couple things the problems right now with balance1 active tanking is horribad for pvp unless it is 1v1 or some other small gang stuff and even then cap warfare turns it off fast 2 gallente ships are bonused for active tanking with repper bonuses they are hardly used and this is a contributor to gallente being underused in pvp3 buffer fits are extremely popular because they work for logistics and just general staying power however buffer armor fits are slow buffer shield fits dont suffer as much as a larger sig isnt as bad of a penalty to still being quick and having more hpmy proposal is thisactive tanking modules add buffer as well not as much as their extender and plate counterparts but half as effective a lar will add as much as an 800mm plate of the same meta lvl mar  400mm platesar  200mm platewith the shields it is a bit more complicated being that there are 4 classes of sub capital shield boosters and they have some overlap on what size ship they are used on for instance xls are used on bses and some bcs but i dont know of any popular armor rep fits were you use a lar on a bc also the biggest shield extender is a large and micros are rarely used you use larges on bses down to cruisers and mediums on frigates and maybe smalls but other then that there is some disparity this is flavor and shouldnt be changed imoso i think an xl booster should add hp to one large extendera large booster  medium extendermedium booster  small extendersmall booster  micro extenderi think that active tanking also needs to be reduced in capacitor consumption by 15 if this makes running missions too easy increase dps in missions accordingly i know a lot of programming work but imo rats are too easy and i hate the whole my super ship ca destroy hundreds of yours rawrlastly reduce fitting requirments of active tanking modules by 5 so it is easier to run multiple reps or oversized booster right now the only viable active tanking setups utilize drug boosters with multiple reps for armor or oversized booster for shield along with command ship bonuses this will also allow gallente to use thier bonuses and speed into range and apply thier blasters which suck right now because the great speed rebalance change and webber change this would help alleviate that problem
i obviously support my own idea
neuts will neut
wow great contribution to the discussion yeah so should we nerf nuets no i think that my idea helps alleviate some of the downsides of cap warfare
actually yeah i think neuting should be made harder or have a skill added that makes you more resilient to neuting per lv
that is a whole differant topic and also nuets work well right now ever try nueting a cap ship how about now he has your imaginary skill to resist neuting yeah thought sonerfing nuets should not be the answer to buffing active tanking i used to live in the days of noses always being used and no one used nuets until the nosferatus got nerfed we need buffing not nerfing
i can already tank my active boosting missions capstable thank you why should i take an increase in dps
while this is an inconveniencetheyre an outlaw and such they and their friends live with those consequences i doubt ccp will change these mechanics  otherwise pirates could be repped in fights against antipiratesvictims meaning that they cant fight the logistic ship without taking a unfair standings hit and gcctaken from that perspective thats why the mechanic works as it does now the workaround youre looking for is this1 a criminal player is repped by a noncriminal not engaged in criminal activity ie no gcc present repper therefore gets no gcc2 a criminal player is repped by a noncriminal while engaged in criminal activity ie he has gcc repper therefore gets gcc for aiding criminal activity note the difference from playerin this setup the pirate can receive neutral aid when hes not under the effect of a gcc ie he hasnt engaged in criminal activity for lack of better phrases its a good samaritan clause  patching the wounds on a murderer isnt bad  patching those wounds that were gained while murdering is bad this enables pirates to interact with neutrals more easilyi personally dont think they should be able to  being a pirate is all about taking the hard road and carving out whatever the hell you want when you want it and accepting the consequences of doing so if you benefit a criminal that is a criminal activity  therefore you gain a gcc 50 players are basically in a state of constant gcc passively thats my two iskedit spelling
it was removed because ccp are trying to shove cq and wis down our throats and are badly out of touch with what players want
agreed for me its a simple issue of performance i use an older laptop to play eve because i am in the military they dont pay us a whole lot and i move around a lot i dont plan on building a new system just to play eve the new ui does nothing to add to my play style and in fact detracts at the very least give us the option of remaining in our pods for basic play i am a long time player i now have 2 paying accounts and simply put i cant physically play the game at this time so unless a change comes along soon to make the wis optional i am going to have to stop paying for my accounts
really is that what i came across as implying actually what i find hilarious is your need to continually bump and plea to everyone to support me every couple of weeks while occasional tooting of your own horn is normal the flagrant nature and the amount of vigor and energy you seem to be putting into a proposal that few even see the need for is humorous most wonder just why you are so galvanized in your resolve bumping this just to see what you will say next is almost worth the rhetoric
i could not agree with you more on that this game has many other issuesstill this question on uninject skillpoints has been brought up way too many times new players after 6 months at least have 2 to 4 skills they wished they didnt trainso a thought to make players  ccp happy campersadd an item in the nex store called it something fancyi can think of two ways to cost it in aurums1 per skillpoint some fixed price in aurum it varies with plex prices2 sell in tiers ie 100k 250k 500k 1mil sp at a fixed price in aurumreally if you think about it it is just a vanity issue with cleaning up you skill sheet if players want to do it make them pay this way ccp gets something out of having to add the feature to the gamejust a thought to make both sides happy it is in no way ahead of other problems in this game which we all know abouti only have 7 skills109172 sp to be uninjected so not really a big deal on time for me but would like them off down the road somehow i would at this moment use the nex store for removing skillpoints out of all that is there nowo7kytps forgot to say that in no way is this new nex item game breaking
3 letters for you ocd and yes i wouldnt mind ridding my sheet of some skills i once injected but never actually plan to train they just look fugly on my skillsheetuninjecting is tricky business though some skills may be prerequisites for other skills like what if i wanted to uninject caldari cruiser it would seemingly be harmless unless i suddenly wanted to train caldari strategic cruiser up one day only to find out i no longer cani foresee tons of petitions waiting to happen therefore sadly not supported
sounds like a good idea
i dont read much of the forums usually but one thing besides mt keeps coming up local chatjust wondering what is the problem with it is it just a lownull sec problemand if it is such a problem why is deleting it the only way to be rid of the problemwhy can it not simply be modified in some way such as when you cloak you disapear from it or even while in a mission site you cant be seen in it eitheragain appologies for the rehashed question but most of the other topics ive read are derailed 3 posts in by anger responses and the real problem never reveals its self as a result could even be its not a problem but from a personal perspective wont know till i ask thoughthanks for reading and if you take the time to reply
its more of a null sec problem you see local was never designed to be the powerful intel tool it is todayin fact the showing of standing in local chat was a direct result of a client hack that was used some time agothe issue with removing local is what exactly will take its place if they ever change local in some way it will have to be a part of a package of changes which could include a change to cloaking but cloaking could be messed up in wh space with any change so its a very tricky situationthis is why even though ccp want to make a change to local nothing yet has been done they simply cannot find the right package of changes to implement
before you guys say anything yes i know alot of more important stuff is outt here right now and it should be attended to firston to the topic the jukebox not enough music for one the login screen music for incarna i personally love and would like to see it in jukebox at some point as well if possible some of the mission music like when you warp into a mission to fight some minmatar i dont think that music is in jukebox looked hard couldnt find itthats pretty much it i gues my point im trying to bring attention to is that music is half the immersion in eve which ccp seems to really want and alot fo the music that i like i can only seem to find by missioning for 2 hours to find a mission zone that has it
yes one of these days i must turn sound back on in evethe music was nice but got old fast and there were no game sounds i needed more than being able to listen to other music tv and podcasts while playing
seems to me that you should be far more upset than i am good customer service is in my experience timely customer service if there are more cases like yours then it would behoove the council to see if ccp will devote more resources to something like this that directly affects our gaming experience furthermore it seems to me that ccp being an entity that survives by providing a service would be heavily focused on making sure that their customer service experience was fair and timely
oh im pretty damn sure im more upset than you are d ive already cancelled my account what two weeks ago now and in that two weeks nothing has happened to make me want to reverse my decisioni still get to stare at the ing door i still have eve crashing every time i jump while tabbed out been happening since incursion and sometimes also when eve is the active app i still have the x vanish when i try to click it to close a window i still have lousy performance and major stuttering when the new turrets fire im still not getting responses to my petitions fixed window mode still hasnt been put back in eve for mac i still have no station id above station services i still have no way to quickly see what ship im flying and a way to quickly interact with it i still have muddy indistinguishable blobs for turret icons i could go on but you get the idea
incarna is the first brick for a new dimension in eve the upcoming milestone will be full stationshipplanetruins exploration on foot skills fot foot combat hand weapons vehicles foot combat like halo or mass effect of course if a player wants to stay in the ship all hisher life it can be done there is an option to turn off the cq at all times in the graphic settings about the difficulties of multiboxing id say boo hoo for them most of them had the bare minimun for a single client even before incarna was launched heck im sure they are the same who was rage fighting when the updated graphics pack was launched
why would we want to read a doctored version of events stop treating us like children ffs
because half the people on the forums do act like children and take things out of context also meeting minutes for most companies are sanitized so discussions cant be taken out of context by people who were not there text comes out very differently as you should know and so there has to be some consideration to what to release to put it in the correct light of the verbal discussion
take wh space then  you can do the exact same thing there and never know it yet that person is still invincible you have to admit that the only reason an afk cloaker is a problem is because you actually know they are there what about hisec local shows them you know theyre from a wardec corp but you cant find themthe fact is that you cant do anything about it as youve already stated and youre not meant to be able to do anything about it sec space has the advantage of local  you at least know they are there in wh you dont even know who is watching you unless you constantly scan for probes too popping a dscan every so often is not that difficult nor is acquiring a few friends to watch your back few  like three topsyou have yet to provide a concrete reason why having friends dscan or the eve rule 1 doesnt cover why afk cloaking is ok i wont even touch the fact afk cloaking really only directly affects two things people too paranoid and weak to do anything about it and botters  which are really just the first thing if you want to solo in lownull youll have to accept that afk cloakers are there you are misinterpreting the usefulness of local as a stressinducing problem not intel that tips you off to potential attackersas a side note  its not griefing consider eve in general it doesnt violate eula and that is one more account making money for ccp doing nothing at all or maybe plotting your demise both work really cloaks are designed for a reason  mess with them and you further degrade black ops if even possible as well as severely harm the intelgathering side of the gametldr you havent provided a concrete reason why having friends dscan or eve rule 1 dont handle cloaked ships afk or not nor have you explained how they are more of a threat when viewable in local as opposed to being unseen at all in wh space
when even simple sarcasm flies over your head i have to wonder how you managed to even get the game installed stay in school kid
i cannot help but notice you only respond to the insults and trolls in this thread not those constructively arguing why afk cloaking isnt a problem if you want to be taken seriously start by responding to your actual opposition by avoiding the valid points made and simply insulting the insulters your proving yourself only as a trollexplain how this is different from wh space where you cant see them at all also explain why having friends dscan for probes and the inherent rule of dont fly what you cant afford to lose isnt enough for handling afk cloakers be they one or several
if i had one tear drop from every whiny  who started one of these threads i would never need to buy lube again this is far from an exploit get over it and maybe pay attention while you bot
so youre saying you went into unsecured space knowing it wasnt safe and now youre whinging because unsafe things happenedsorry am i missing something here is their some kind of bizarro logic i need to comprehend before i can understand why youre crying about lownull secs lack of safety when you knew it to be unsafe in the first place
i suspect even if local was removed this op would still be ing about it even thenqftw sums it up nicely
for sarcasm to work it needs to be a sharply focused ironic retort you simply added words pertaining to the topic without any focus placed upon itdo you even have an argument or are you now only going to show how poorly you use the english language
thisits not a hard thing to do and if your corp or alliance isnt organized enough to have this sort of system running i suggest you find another afk cloaking is not a major problem and has the beneficial side effect of keeping bots out of action which i feel more than makes up for any minor annoyance it may cause those of a more fragile disposition
re bflats answer suitable for wind instruments and generates a soundwave  get it id like for the safety net to lose quite a few strings as well but for all sides as the state of unsafe for one easily translates into safe for another most cases make cloaks probeable see prev post remove local in player sovereign space npc null should be excluded to keep the allegedly superior pvp environment it has tweak scanner mechanics to avoid carpal tunnel brought on by paranoid scanspam allow owner greater control over local ex nonblues always show by sacrificing other tactical tools like jammersbridges etc
wh space difrence1 trafic not so big and not posible big one cov ops cantt do a  suport gang can do a so afk clouckers are not there to sit on ader ppl nerfs2 in wh space not posible cyno in reinforcments form ader systems so ussles to afk scouting and wait for easy target and posible protect your self from small gangs with boddysso thos 2 difrences its verry big between wh space and usual 00 space if you wish remove local from game than you need td remove gates to and remove cov ops cynos to
ownership of a system in eve is determined by the barrels of your guns not meaningless words in the corner of your screen the system belongs to the people in space not the ones cowering in station if you want to use their systems resources i suggest that you mail one of them for a tenancy agreement
turn off local chat
its been said and said again there needs to be one class of ship a frigate with negligible combat capacity with just one ability scanning down things that are cloakedit wont be able to warp directly to them just in their vicinity and will have to continue its snooping anticloakwarfare to detect the ships sig then approach it decloak it and do whatever it needs to doit needs to have the ability to overtake a cloaked ship at speed while it itself is cloaked it cannot scan uncloaked except for uncloaked things once it is within decloak range both ships are exposed and a covert ship may be able to then destroy itan afk cloaked ship will be easy prey and will rid the system of the metagaming tards who delight in disrupting all activity while theyre at work asleep or otherwise screwing off elsewherean active pilot will usually be warping around scoping out juicy targets or at the very least alert enough to respond when theyre decloaked eve wants active pilots not afk macros and afk cloaking is the same as macro activity imo
510 average troll
exactly what i was thinking
so go rat in pairs or threes if you cant cope wit 1 freakin ship ina gang of 3 you are pretty useless ofc theres the risk of a hotdrop but then i would say this is far less likely than a quick gank attempt on the ratters and well it is zero zero its not supposed to be risk free despite the efforts of nullbears suchas urself trying to make it so
organising a group and combat support is beyond these whingers so far as i can work out they prefer whinging to being proactive and doing something so they can still be active in their space while threatened by the ominous lone afk cloakie d
the afk cloaker is the only counter to botsthe only person who is reasonably affected by an afk cloaker is a botterevery other person is capable of asking for help from corpalliance if the cloaker turns out to be active
wh space is not like null space cause you actually have to work to find things to do you dont have an unlimited supply of things to do upgraded null offers belt rats instant respawning combat sites and grav sites galore therefore it attracts those who only want the easiest way to generate the most isk for their wallets and want to do so with the least amount of risk to themselvesthe need to use renters to pay the bills have made a new class of people in null that have done nothing but pay a bill to gain access to their systems however the landlord does not give a rats arse about their safety and makes no effort to hunt them down on the way in or out the landlords care and defend only a small section of null nowon the other side of the coin null makes it very easy to find people since belts are on overview and all the combat sites can now be found using an onboard scanner that can be used while cloaked add in the fact that its impossible for an active player to get any element of surprise since everyone in local knows they have arrived before they even finish their jump into the systemso we have people living in null that do so only to generate the maximum isk possible and who are risk adverse we have no ability to attack them without them knowing we are there and this interferes with their vision of the sandbox as a mass influx to their walletat this time with perfect local intel on who is around there is no way to for a small gang to effectively disrupt your operations without sitting in system 2357 and most active players have no desire to do so if you want to nerf cloaks then tell me what you are willing to give up so that the scales are not tipped solely in favor of all the null sec carebears 1 give up instant local delay it 5 minutes oh you dont want that because then you wont get notice of a huge hot drop or some other whine you already get a cyno on overview anywhere in system is that not enough2 make an active module on your ship that is a high slot active module will when active tell you all the ships in system but will also show your location on overview same as a cyno beacon kind of like an active sonar you give up your position by blasting a crap ton of energy into space but you get to know whats in system heck even make a ship with the ability to use this module and pin down the location of a ship with skills what ever you like but you give up your position by doing so3 make a probe that can be anchored anywhere is visible on overview and will tell you approximate ship class of anything passing within 200km of it cloaked or not make it fairly easy to destroy and costly can anchor that near a gate or wormhole and then you will know when something comes in system however it can not be anchored in asteroid belts of combat sites as there are to many things to interfere with the signalso really if you want to nerf cloaky ships which is the only counter to bots and all you skittish little carebear mice that run to your burrows everytime local goes 1 then give all of us pvp players a way to effectively hunt you when we are activei am ready to entertain your ideas of how to rebalance this game mechanism that does not further tip the scales in favor of the null sec carebear mouse
that right there details why afk cloaking is an issue i have no issues with somebody coming into my system making past the gate camp or what ever and scouting the system and disrupting activities in that system that part is a valid tactic and valuable intell gathering sourcethe fact that they can gather this intel and disrupt activities without playing the game is where the issue is at i dont want to see the cloak mechanics them selves changed as it allows for the tactic to be used but being able to use that tactic without actually being at the keyboard is effectively the same as using a bot you are gaining a tactical advantage by knowing what is in system and when there by allowing you to plan an op when there will be little to no resistance costing folks isk by lowering productivity and disrupting or even preventing the upgrade of a system or maintenance of that system level for industry or military areas all this without being at your keyboard or playing the game you do it perfect safety with zero risk to yourself your ship or your walletto be at your keyboard and be able to do all that is fine and doesnt need to changeto be afk and do all of that is what needs to change as it stands right now that person that afk cloaks is able to gather the intell ect he disrupts mining for maybe a couple hours or so till everybody figures out that he is afk then we all resume normal activities it still hurts our wallets and we pay attention to scans and such a lot more and will usually have a few ships for protection but thats it and yes once you hit indy 4 or 5 loosing a couple mining ships to trade out for protection can cause you to loose that industry levelwhen a cloak comes into the system it should disrupt activities and cause all the above effects to there fullest right now it doesntthere should be a danger it should disrupt my activities and it should make me think twice about doing what it is i was about to dosimply put providing a way to prevent the person from going afk without risking his ship and his pod provides advantage to both sides we know that person is active therefore more effectively disrupting our activities and causing damage to the industry and military levels of a system and causing a bigger hit to our wallets it causes us to sit in our pos or leave the system allowing the cloaker to find and bookmark our pos for a future attack it allows him to more effectively gain the intel for targets when or if he has a fleet jump into system causing us to boost our pos defense and actually think about strategic defenseby preventing the afk it allows us to try and keep those industry and military levels higher and allowing us to more effectively mine or rat when the player is not in system as normal it gives us better experience at setting up pos defense and fleet defenseand most importantly it might actually cause more fleet engagements as systems get upgraded to level 5 industry and folks try to stop it or force it to go back down or make systems more prone to traffic therefore generating more fightsall that by simply putting in a mechanic that causes the cloak to drop if you dont click yes i want to stay cloaked in a random spot on the screen every couple of mins you still cant be found your still going to be safe you just now have to be at your keyboard to do it
if you think afk cloaking sucks wait until you go and live in a wh 00 carebears have local to give them intel and to actually let them know that someone is in the system wormholes dont and people there do fine
you havent answered my question yet
worms dont exactly have the revolving doors that normal space does and it is very easy for a large enough expeditionary force to keep tabs on all comers or even prevent anything that may pose a threat from ever entering by collapsing the holesso yeah great comparison my dear
right an incoming k162 followed by several cloaky t3s is easy to counter please you know you cant live without your instant intel local and that is really the crux of the issue there is no balance in 00 when you know the second someone comes into system and you all scurry like roaches when a light comes onso again how much of your safety net local intel are you willing to give up to be able to address the afk cloaky
gota love the rage and fail also how will probing them help it takes several seconds to get to the target after getting a scan hit in that time a probed ship will be a fair distance from the warp in point making it next to impossible to catch anyway here is my suggestion deal with it you can do the same to the enemy as well so its no exploit
this is not the issue the fact that they are there is not the issue at no time should any player be able to gain an advantage of the other players without being at there computer thats what needs to be fixed with the afk cloaking the fact that you gain a tactical advantage without playingbotting gives you an advantage without you having to be there to control your characterafk cloaking gives you an advantage without you having to be there to control your character you get intel on a system see whos there and who comes and goes outa the system ect all without needing to actually play the game its just like botting and going out a mining the only difference is that you dont need to use a third party program to do itthats the issue that needs to be addressed by removing the simple fact that you can do it while afk as i have stated previously it allows for both sides to have an advantage we still wont be able to find you we still wont be able to kill you the mechanics of the cloak do not change the only thing that changes is you now cant just come into the system gather the intel or other items without being at your keyboardpersonally thats all i want to see change i want you at your keyboard to disrupt my productivity or gather intell on my systems i honestly dont care if i can find you and kill you i just want you at your keyboard and actually playing to gain any advantage perceived or real in my systems you want to take my industry level from 5 to 4 by disrupting my activities great i have no problems with you doing it as long as your at your keyboard doing it you want to scout out my system and find out the best times to attack when resistance will be light or not there great fine just play the game to do it you want to find my pos and take it out great just play the game while you do it thats all i want to see change
the only advantage is the one given by the the guy turtling in the station or posting afk cloaking is not fair threads
no
this is a follow up of a topic brought up in the general discussions forum
why thank you
what can i say snowballs are fun
i remember shooting concord with them and not getting attackedalso the explosion effects looked cool
i remember shooting noobs with them so the noob shoots back and gets zapped by concord many lolz
imo snowballs should be available in limited quantities for limited time that said i would like the have them be available more frequently
yes pleasethis font is terrible and gives me a headache
i like the font size a lot in eve but they do need to be more distinct
pwease
i like the idea butthe boosters should not persist through death  they should instead come in one hour 6 hour 12 hour one day one week and one month increments this allows pvp players to utilize such a gift but at the same time lose the bonus if not carefuleven then would a one month booster user then not pvp for a month the fact is these items would be most effecient with the longuse ones ie four 6 hour boosters cost more in materials and thus price than a single daylong boosterthe idea is sound but needs work which op already acknowledged however a persistent through death is imo not good  because that renders short term boosters worthless anyways
no its not an oversight  you misunderstand where implants come from  the lp store and agent rewards unlike internet spaceships implants are manufactured by ccp who control the supply rate and hence the price
isnt that exactly the sort of resistance that the op is trying to remove the idea that pvp should be cheaper and more immediately available your amendment works well for existing pvp players who can juggle costbenefitrisk but maintains the same barrier to primarily highsec players wanting occasional pvp
i like the general flavor of the idea even though the details should be fleshed out morea cautious support
exactly i think ccp is continually thinking the wrong way about this their rationale is not enough peeps in 00 nerf highsec and buff lowsec like recent plans to move all icemining  to lowsec only sighi dont think it works that way though you only help to make richer super 00 alliances even richer instead if you want folks to go to lowsecnullsec make it easier for them to do so like allowing 2x clone jumps per day for instance or the above proposal
fundamental problem is the risk transition not the reward transition ccp only seem to have one shaped peg to try to batter into numerous shapes of hole
dont we all have that problem 
the only part i disagree is leaving 15 for pirate implant purpose only much better solution would be switching pirate implants into 610 slots and eventually boosting their effect to compensatebecause otherwise having 5 slots just so 1 of population can use them doesnt make sense to me
um no kinda using 610 for other purposes
i wasnt around when mines first came out so i dont know what happened with them but i was thinking that maybe a new system is in order and it would be done using current mechanics meant to be used in conjunction with mobile warp disruption bubbles they deploy from a new class of ship the minelayer they would anchor the same but instead of scramming they would have three damage modes dense standard light and each mode uses more ammominessizes large medium smalllarge minefields would have a radius of thirty kilometers mediums would be twenty kilometers smalls ten kilometers with a central command structure that is linked to the mines and is vulnerable if the command structure is destroyed the mines linked to it detonateammo bays would be varied depending on the size of the minefield larges would hold sixty mines mediums forty smalls twentyammo five types of mines em thermal kinetic explosive and multispectralbomb type signature radius damage reductiondense field a dense mine field would use 50 of the on board ammo in a maximum of two volleysstandardmedium field a standard mine field would use 20 of the on board ammo in a maximum of five volleyslightsmall field a small mine field would use 10 of the on board ammo in a maximum ten volleyseach mine should do around eight hundred damage so the minefields should not be something to take lightly while they are deadly to enter they can be destroyed just like the mobile warp disruption bubbles optional if the command center is destroyed it will send out a distress call to its owners andor it sends out a shockwave of damage farther than the original fieldthoughts and opinions
only in nullsec i presumeand will it be anchorable within jump distance of the gate because if so i could see nullsec alliances instakilling anything that jumps through a gate by anchoring these mine fields
i was around when they first were used and they were fairly much used to block off a jump gateuseful if a gang of frigs all landed at the same timeit was hard to setup properly making sure you didnt set off a mine whilst laying another which could trip the whole field i would like to see mines backyou could mine pos stations and gates they just need to be balanced
id love to see mines in wspacedid those things work with drag bubbles when they where initially available 
ccp already knows gallente ships win at pvp didnt you all watch the new i was there trailerin all seriousness though i would love to see hybrids fixed
agreed seeing aur next to my isk is an insult
yes
this sounds kinda exploity so yeah something should be done i like the evil idea of random system within jump range
does this mean the old online pos and jump just before its online doesnt workor you can no shoot cyno with other t1 frig no
sieged dreadnaughts true story
the super carrier is still unaffected by electronic warfare in the proposalme puts on role play hatthe idea is that the electronic attack ships due to its small size and precise role can hack into the communication frequency of the targeted super carrier using the same frequency the super carrier is using to communicate with its deployed fighters and fighter bombersso it is effectively using the motherships own communication frequency as an amplifier against its own weapons its flight of fighters and bombers just like in the movie independence day in that movie they hacked into the orbiting mothership and injected a virus thus causing all the deployed fighters and such to lose their shieldsso essentially electronic attack ships are not affecting the super carrier but its horde of fighters all at once instead of trying to lock each one individually yes there are other things that need to be done to help balance out super capitals like removing the remote repair range bonus for onei love this idea bouncing the ew effect off the super carrier to its army of fighters cant stop the signal
the reasoning still stands if the effect is transfered to the drones on a sc it should work the same on every other dronecarrierroleplay hat edit if the manned fighters are recieving hacked transmissions from their carrier whats to stop them from cutting off the signalsidenote independence day was okay up until they started on the whole virus thing pretty lucky the programming of two races who never met before is compatible
ditch the only fighters and bombers bay allow a much smaller bay for normal drones and this idea could work the eas change just means eas are even more of a priority target than they already are and thus even more completely suicidal to fly 25 ehp is really not going to make any difference to their survivability in a fleet fight
its not like you already risk the materials and wallet you have to give access to supportedmaybe a log would also be nice to have to show if somebody delivered or cancelled a job
to some extent i agree with you  we have all heard about disgruntled pilots opening cyos in the middle of hostile fleets or fat fingered titan pilots jumping instead of bridgingyou need to look at the rest of the game though  no one can cancel anyone elses jobs in npc manufacturingresearch facilities but you can see that the facilities are busy the same level of control would be nice for pos facilities job installer as a separate role to factory manager so you can install jobs cancel your own jobs see that lines are busy but not see what other jobs are doing and certainly not have the ability to cancel them
so yeah forgot to mention this also affects interaction with corp mates so let me get everyone going with this info you can actively shoot your corp member in highsec and guess whatyou can even pod themso we can pod corp members in highsec but i cant rep or boost my corp members who are innocent pirates wtf ccp wtf
innocent pirates not sure about that  but yeah we should be able to rep people who are 10 in low sec without going gcc a good way to fix it is make it you get the same punishment as the person you repif he is 10 caldari standing you get the effect of 10 caldari standing10 sec status gives 10 sec status penaltyremote repping a war target makes you a war target maybe include podding of course it would only be in effect for 15 mins
obvious troll is obvious try showing the above pic to ten different eve players none i did could work out which is which maybe obvious troll has no friends to ask 
rocks real soon now
it would be nice and i support the idea but i think with their agile clusterfsck policy of not knowing what they are doing until well after the sht has hit the fan puts such an idea well out of the realm of possibility
fairly simple concepton the fittings screen preceding the racks high middle low slots and rigs in those little arrow points around the ship have a strip optionex i want to strip my artillery and equip my autocannons because the mission im going into has closerange enemies i use the strip high slots and remove all the high slot modules at once to my items like a normal strip but all of my rigs middle slots and low slots modules remainex my fc needs my falcon to switch to strictly magnometric jammers because theyve engaged in a fight dealing primarily with magnometric sensor type ships i dock strip only my midslots add the new modules in and goreally this is just a timesaver and convenience as opposed to oneatatime removing modules and their ammo in some cases while protecting your ships fitting in general and not worrying with the stripping of rigs i think a less tedious fittings screen is always a good thing ive never flown capitals so i dont know if you strip the major modules like clone vats or anything like that everi assume you dontedit  another thread was posted for enabling toggled racks instead the link is below for the idea my original intent was to keep it simple and build on what we have but this would be pretty nice the idea effectively allows you to select what racks to strip via a toggle switch then simply using a single strip button  ie strip mids and lows but not highs and rigstoggling what module racks striptldr add to the fittings window rack stripping which allows you to strip all the modules from just highslots midslots low slots or rigs this enables ship changeup to be less tedious by not having to oneatatime remove modules particularly on eightweapon ships or ewar ships that change modules based on the battle
support for easy ui that doesnt affect gameplaydamn you scotty for holding me herespeaking of which what became of our not so favorite docking manager was he reassigned to trying to find a way to make capsuleerworthy air in the stations maybe was handed a wrench from the 20th century to try and open the door from the other side
10
i see no reason why this shouldnt be implemented i would also like an option to hold shift or control while dropping a stack of modules say 7 repackaged guns and have all 7 fitted on the ship this works if you have 7 unstacked guns and mark them all and drop its just a pain in the rear that you cant speed fit if you like to keep your hangar tidy
makes sense
free scotty
not supportedhaving to wait and work for your latest ship is one of the things that separates pvp in eve from the instant gratification of fps when you have had to train and save for that ship and you then put it on the line in combat it means something the risk and loss is much more real than simply being popped and running for an item respawn point also the speed of skill training means you get to know the ships you have already trained as well as many of the basic tactics required for your playstyle i would rather the current progression rather than rich noobs buying massive amounts of sp jumping into an expensive ship they have no idea how to fly and dying in a fire in their first encounter funny as it maybe followed by ragequit the idea is to encourage long term players not instant thrill seekers who only stay with the game for a few months
my darling you still appear to be mad at your own inabilityshave you found the help i told you about yet or would you like us to come to you it would only cost us a few mill a week to teach your entire corp how to play eve
the issue is the break in the design philosophy of committing to a fight that a ship hangar on an orca provides the proposal is that when a player is red boxed they can not swap to another ship directly from the hangar they could eject and leave the ship in space and deal with the 30 second session timerthe detractors of the thread continue to wish to make the thread about me and not about the issue when starting the thread i knew what sort of crap would be headed my way and that is exactly what has occurred the detractors act as if this behavior of theirs is unexpectedit is a common pattern on these forums someone recognizes something in the game is a bit off they give their feelings about it on the forums and those that make use of the imbalance attack the messenger with noises like carebear crymore and various other sorts of insults their goal is to maintain the imbalance to silence the messenger those who have been around for a while have seen this pattern repeated time and time again from nos ecm domi to pre nanonerf right on up through the old doomsday devicean imbalance exists in the design the detractors want to keep it  that is the meaning of their words nothing more or less
if you predict the sun will rise tomorrow will you also expect to get paid often people dont outwardly support threads like these because they dont want to be called names by the self appointed pillars of what is and isnt eve that is why those self appointed aholes behave as they do to silence the message and scare off support it wouldnt matter of i replied in kind or notmy initial post in this thread the ps shows i was and remain quite aware of how this would go i for one find it fun to cuss back at them and watch them get all worked up and make their empty threats even got evemail of veiled threats from them its all rather amusing
 and theres an equally predictable pattern of people getting blown up thru their own gross stupidity who then immediately post to have the other guys tactic nerfed instead of spending a few moments in selfreflection on what they did wrongand you manfriend did plenty wrong you blindly engaged a canflipper not using your brain thinking it might have been a bait you suddenly saw an orca warp in  you didnt warp out you saw the guy change ships  you didnt warp out you died those are the facts you had ample time to get to safety yet for some bizarre reason you chose to hang around and then you died but we already covered thatand then you go post on the forum saying you want the other guy nerfed i dont think soand no for the umptiest time he didnt evade any consequences he enaged you in combat remember the part where you died at his hands now if you could actually dock up inside an orca you might have had a point but you cant he was still forced to face you in battle and he did and you died live with that
oh so original again attacking the messenger thanks for contributing to the typical fallacy again read the first post altering the subject doesnt not absolve you of your stupidity  the mechanic allows people to escape consequences regardless of this particular instanceoh and so you dont feel left out  off have a nice day
let me see if i get this rightyou are mad that after you shipped up to kill his vigil he then shipped up to kill your crowthis is so typical the ones who cry the most always seem to be the ones who are mad someone managed to turn the tables on them after they thought they were the ones who turned said tablethis is not a gentlemens dueling society here this is simulated warfare including piracy and terrorism expecting others to follow your ebushido is going to send you down a path of misery and rage you should go ahead and go back to wow now and save yourself some griefbut you wont which is great because youll provide the rest of us with more entertainment
orcas used in this manner are no different from zero risk logistics at least with logistics they get flagged to you you can make all the eve isnt fair look at nullsec wowz there are fleets in this game comparisons you like but in every other instance of direct combat assistance in this game you atleast have the option of shooting the help that and obviously this isnt a problem in nullsec so the abundance of nullsec comparisons dont particularly apply hurr durri find people defending the use of orcas in this way under the guise of keeping eve hardcore to be the height of irony you would seriously propose that preserving what amounts to norisk logistics available anywhere in highsec even remotely resembles anything but extreme riskaversion or to be even remotely similar to the hardcore nature of eve patheticthat granted this op seems kinda emo so i suppose i cant blame the trollingyes you can and you dont even have to wait 60 seconds either or do you seriously see a difference between docking to escape destruction and switching to a shuttle that will most likely get awaynot that youd care if you lost it anyways orcas are even better than being within docking range of a station you can change ships several times midfightyou can fit 4 lokis in there you know you can 100 escape the fight midfightswap to shuttle and leave and the 60 second aggression countdown doesnt apply to orcas nor will they get flagged like every other form of logisticsyoure free to do whatever you want with an orca by your side the only limit is the 30 second session change timer which is pretty trivial unless youre a complete idiot but that applies literally everywhere immune to losing your ship no problem swap out of the fight at any time you want instant fullhprestore logistics no problem you can fit 4 lokis in here easy you want your logistics to be protected by concord no problem it isyes ive had this tactic used against meno i didnt lose anything i won the fight they ranyes they shouldve lost their orca for losing the fight so badly unfortunately due to a certain riskaverse mechanic i was unable to destroy their orca as i wouldve done if it were flagged just like every other direct combat assistance mechanic in the game
lol its not emo it called drawing in the flies
everyone knows better than to blindly engage a canflipper and why because there is no way of telling what is coming to you you can have 10 of his corp buddies hotdrop on your arse to 0 in an instant and that indeed is part of what eve is your argument that you can at least shoot the help is moot you think his crow would have survived an onslaught like thatand my main point was not that eve is hardcore really rather i pointed out the softcore nature of his predicament to him he had ample opportunities and time to warp out he didnt soon thereafter he diedorca itself is not providing aggressionlogistics even though it feels like it  not directly at least thus orca itself should never be flagged i can see a certain logic in not being able to use orca maintenance bay while under player aggro but id like to stress that i am at heart against this riskaversion proposal calling in help troops whether they be corp buddies or forces being cynoed in obviously not applicable to highsec or alts coming to lend assistance in an orca these are all things that can happen to you when you engage someone you think is alone if you dont want to take the chance then dont
easy just like rr transfers aggro using a ship fittinghangar should also transfer aggro to the orca in this case i dont have a problem with people using alts alts shouldnt be able to participate in a conflict consequence free though
are you seriously suggesting to extend aggro to ships that not themselves take place in any aggressive action doesnt compute and could be abused as well to get someones orca blown up either on purpose or by accident
interfering in a fight by providing a different ship or fitting is most definitely an aggressive action if someone handed a fighter a gun in a knife fight i dont think anyone would have a problem accepting that as an aggressive action you dont accidentally join a fleet accidentally turn on allow access then accidentally situate your ship where a fight is going on the not aggression is the exact same argument that had been used against transferring aggro to an rr ship give me a situation where this could be abused where the ship hangar pilot isnt either complicit or completely stupid to the point of deserving to get blown up and ill accept your point
rring a ship thats engaged in aggression obviously and rightfully so transfers aggro to the persons ship doing the rr this however is a completely different sutuation the orca is not itself in any way shape or form lending support to a ship engaged in aggression all it really does is make its ship maintenance bay available to fleet members thats all what that fleet members do with their ship is no longer the orca pilots concernto debunk your gunknife example yes what indeed if someone was in a knifefight ran into a nearby gun store and came out guns blazing would you now transfer legal aggro to the store ownerthis thread is getting crazier by the minute 
but it is giving support a safe hiding place for that ship docking and jumping gates also give that support but at the cost of a session change and in some cases the 30 second aggression timer no such costs are imposed upon the pilot doing the ship swap in this instance or in the hypothetical case of a pilot docking the ship and sitting there in a pod  ship now perfectly safe and protected by concord while in the orcas hangarno analogy is perfect to stretch one is fallacious of course in your stretch you forget to mention if the gun store owner willing participated how convenient
you know crazy as it sounds i think im going to support your proposal  lolno seriously extending aggro to the orca in the case where one of the ships it had in its maintenance bay commits an aggressive act i think thats going too far but i can see how its reasonable one should not be allowed to dock up in one while under player aggro
oo that was a suprise turnaroundpersonally i just find it rather ridiculous how orcas have become mobile personal stations that completely ignore aggression mechanics making them usable incombatps adunh the aggression timer is 60 seconds
thanksthe extension of aggro does sound a bit too far and also could lead to some griefs and exploits that may not be desirable i can imagine a few
i would love to see that all signatures not exlusivly to wormholes keep their number abc123duting the entire life of the signature this recudes server load server does not have to update all signatures with a new number and it also reduces people finding them again after dt just with another number maby a little of complaining too actualy its verry anoying to scan trough dozens of signatures just to find the new wormhole opening to get outohh yeah i am lazy
not supportedbookmark the sigs before dt now its easy to filter through the garbage to find that new whalso not worth fixing eventually there will not be any downtime
nice topic improbeables beUFFFDs machariels and t3 have died with incarnaUFFFDs patch probably a good nanofit can solve your problemnot support
niceof course the reasoning in the op completely ignores the fact that probing a target has  all to do with tackling themin order to tackle a target you need a hit from the probes and you need to warp in as the ships warping in have to align as well the formula looks like this5 secs probing time  x seconds align time  10 seconds warp time  y seconds lock time  all the ing time to alignclaiming you can not align before someone probes you out and tackles is a completely moronic statement in short you use sniping machariels and want to live in a riskfree environment ok no
pretty easy to do actually will not go into details but we have been able to catch targets all the way down to frigs if they try to warp in at rangewhen it comes to bs we tested and tried on the test server and there are no way for anyone in a bs to warp in align and get out if the people behind the probingtackling have half a brain with themfor proof you are welcome to bring a bs and test this out with us on the testserver at anytime
its to easy to get a position on a sniper sniping is dead atm unless you really want to loose your ship
alright perhaps my reply was phrased a bit lets put it this wayi think you have a somewhat valid concern in so far as it is theoretically possible to catch a battleship that way in an optimal case scenarioas far as i am concerned the problem isnt really the probe timer here but the fact that ships are dropping out of warp much slower than they used to as in they do not move anymore but sit there too long after deceleration has already taken placesomehow i have a feeling the probing changes lately didnt really help eithernow changing the probe timers because it is theoretically possible to catch sniper ships in this fashion ill believe you that it works in your test runs on sisi and basically swing the balance the complete opposite way is really not the way to goit would screw up combat probing  and i really doubt the problem youre trying to address here is much of a problem at all at least in so far as it isnt very widespread some of it could likely be prevented by smart use of bubbles and if that doesnt do the trick ecm supportmaking sniper ships uncatchable or even substantially harder to catch by giving them a more or less guaranteed chance to align out before something lands on them is not allowing you to use them but makes it mandatory to use themcurrently theres advantages and drawbacks to sniper ships and id really like to keep it that waythank you for taking my earlier rather unpleasant rant calmly
increasing warpto boundary to 200250km makes a lot more sense and doesnt negatively impact nearly as much as a combat probe nerf wouldadded tears from the thousands of people with tacticals spaced 151km around a million gates only sweetens the deal
no worriesill try and explain a little betterwhen i was referring to us catching targets all the way down to frig sizes that was done on tq before the eccmunprobable nerf that was not done on sisithe sisi test was us trying to see if there was any way to engage something if there was scanprobes deployedconclusion after multiple testruns was that if there was any probes deployed it would be impossible to engage without loosing snipers the group who was set up to try and catch the snipers basically had a 100 success rate in tackling them
confirming black legiondot dont use sniper hacs muninns yo and that most large fleets arent composed of alpha battleships which come in at long distanceslolwait they do and they areflying sniper setups hasnt changed to be honestyou just failed to adapt and so your way of gaming has died outlive with it or change it and start flying them again in a different way
longer scan times for combat probes will break wspace combat probing everyone is constantly staring at directional scanner around here so making it take even longer to scan people down will suck
always dictors can be brought to block path with bubbles
sad face is sadi wanted them for my minnie shipsbut i do fly caldari too
as an amarr pilot who uses grouped guns it becomes a real annoyance when the guns are loaded with brand new and unused tech 2faction crystals when you chose to reload with used crystals the group mixes up used and new crystalsthis becomes a problem when each gun has different damage on their crystals when one crystal breaks in the group it stops firing until you reload a new crystal i would much prefer that all the guns have equal damages on the crystals so i know when i have to reload it
i agree that it should not do so ideally it may have to do with the sort order or lack of a sort order of a cargo hold when loading as a work around you could use a small can and keep unused crystals in the can drop in a few smaller cap charges to fill up the space
can we have a special forum dedicated to specifically to afk cloaking please  its taking me so much time searching for all those delicious tears that all i manage to do in game these days is sit afkcloaked 
heh  i do similar stuff occasional but normally im not afk i look around for potential targets  or just watch fail stuff
i logged all my accounts today just to afk cloak as many systems as i can
with all the outcry over the monocle and the clothesi had an idea that ccp could let chars have a planet named after them for a feeit would not be game breaking and if ccp need to raise funds then this imo is a far better way of doing itim sure ppl in low sec null sec or wh space would possibly buy into thisits a bit of a mad idea but imo its better than a monocle
nice to see ideas of non game breaking aur stuff however this could be a problem if 2 people try and name 1 planet or if a planet suddenly has a foreign name imagine an fc trying to tell people warp to planet 10 when its now named in russian  kinda nice idea but i dont think it works
this would be the problem however if names where held to a strict standard i could see this idea working
soooooooo lemme get this straightyou want to introduce what is tantamount to price fixing because you dont like how people treat the ingame market as a gameyeah not buying it if people want to ruin the profitability of others because they can let them this is the ingame economic version of lock the victims wreck in highsec if heshe has been suicide ganked
i cant agree with you on thiswhen you see someone list items at a very low price you see it as a negative i see it as someone needing isk quickly or ignorant of the items true value and thus as an opportunity to get hold of cheap stock that can be relisted at a better price shipped to a more profitable market or just stored until the price recovers
i do not support thisi think you are pretty far off on your theory of how pricing and value work supply and demand are only two factors there is also time as a factor someone might sell something cheaper because they need the isk quicker compound this with market speculation as a factor a player might see the impending market crash and offer their product at a very cheap price in order to sell out and cut losses market speculation also affects rising prices like when marketers prepare for hulkageddon but what it all really comes down to is what something is worth sure to some extent players dont pay as much attention to the price of things but its because they have a surplus of isk the same as real money nobody wants isk isk has no value to them they want the things it can get them so they let isk go at a rate slightly less than what the product is worth to them value is subjective though and it works both ways i might have a bunch of product that has no value for me and i need isk quickly and really badly to buy the product that does have value to me while it is still at a low priceyou are taking the stance that market players are taking a loss when they set a low price but you are not looking at it from a subjective standpoint to them it wasnt a loss thats why they thought to do it let them punish themselves for not maximizing their gains the invisible hand will balance it out like usual
some prices dont recover though for example navy dominix used to sell for around 420mil when i first started in the militia then for a while they stabilised around 360mil now youre lucky to get 320mil fed navy comets were at 27mil for a while not at 24 or lessjust means i gotta be patient or smarter and sell drones or modules instead edit or i could go around killing people flying navy dominix so they have to buy more  increasing demand how fast they sell and hopefully driving prices back up
precisely and the op should not fool himself into thinking this doesnt happen in real life i personally know of 2 rivaling video stores nearby one legit the other two doors further down the street set up by a guy who doesnt like the owner of the other store he rents his videos for a much lower prices estimated losses for him around 10000000 a year may seem like a lot of money to us but to some its just pocket change to annoy a rival withhence not supported reason market working as intended
eves market is effectively no different than real markets with the exception of an abnormally high wealth to poor ratio
companies do this it is called dumping in extremely obvious cases companies get in trouble for itmanufacturing in eve has many flaws the main one being the lack of differentiation making most products stuck as large volume commodities which irl are often manipulated by those with vast capital while others get crazy pricing consistent with precious commodities and thus dramatic price fluctuations like we see with precious metals and gemsagain like real life this is due to commoditizationbrokers run markets like games eves market is very realistic when you realize that it is a commodity market like commodities check what is going on with aluminum gold silver platinum diamonds and petroleum right now for real world examples of the market fluctuation you are complaining aboutactually in the real world there is sale price deviation the price you see is nothing more than the last completed sale price in eve any given commodity has less volume mostly due to distributed sales than irl commodity sales so the deviation is easier to see even in jita you find a 510 break between most buysell ordersrather than putting complicated price controls on the market it would make more sense to broaden the ability to remotely buy items thus removing a lot of the distribution deviation thus tightening up sale deviation the next step would be breaking the commoditization of sale items
dont like what your item is selling for buy them out and relist or move your stuff to where you would get a fair priceall im hearing from you is waaaah someone is undercutting the items i want to sell i cant make a profit ccp fix it please waaah
i agree companies do dumping its however not legal and usually results in intervention by the sec in eve there is no sec and no regulation on the market functionality to prevent dumping and market manipulation i was expecting the cash in people to complain people crashing the market because they want to cash in quickly is exactly what this post is about its like you crashing the auto market because you want to sell off your bmw really fastnever going to happen removing quick cash people from the live market removing their ability to affect it is what this post is about so if your argument is that you want to cash in your stock of hurricanes fast do it via contractim not sure how many people know this but large volume special sales of oil grain coffee gas etc happen through special contracts these are special discount or premium plus deals which are done between two or more individuals  companies who agree on certain terms i do this for a living actually and im very good at it and this is why i bring up the subjectselling items well below market prices exist in the real exchange markets but these orders are not public they are only triggered once the market prices reach that price if the market price is 100 for an item you cannot sell it at 95 on the market directly you can only do it via contracts called options what drives the price down on the real market is the amount of sellers vs the buyers not the seller dropping the price but the buyers offering less because of various reasons its the buyer who dictates the pricesyou knowthe bid buyer  ask sellerto answer your commodity market fluctuation eve is not the case large price fluctuations in the real market happen due to special events interpretations and such and are cause by large selloffs or buyouts at market prices which risefall based on the speed for demand or supply of each goods special events cause the speed at which supply and demand unfold to increase 10 times overyou are never going to see someone just giving you a 10 discount on their oil shares its rather small increments moving the price down incredibly fast across millions of transactions its not just one dumbass deciding to cash in quickly which the above people dont getselling items below market prices on a regular basis only happens in what we call submarkets like you trading your games in or selling your stereo that and black markets but cashing in quickly there has no effect on the market in eve it does eve market is the above mixed with a semisimulation of nysepeople needing isk quickly is not a reason to screw with the market prices im not saying to now allow them to do it im saying to remove them from live marketseves market is not realistic for a great many reasons too many to list here im not complaining about price fluctuations im complaing about fluctuations happening for the wrong reasons in eve which ive listed above in commodities markets rules apply very strict rules no rules in evethe price controls i proposed are very simple and would be extremely effective they would prevent people from dumping crap on the market and playing by its rules if they want to participate in it contract it insteadyour comments about deviation has nothing to do with what im talking about the buyers have the right offer what they want seller the same the bid and ask spread is dictated by market conditions and world events not by a single individual which can happen but its illegalbeing a commodity market does not change the rules the forces are still the same read here
this isnt about a fair price or the right price its about mechanics go to school or somethingor stfu troller
the big difference vs the real market is that there is no bankrupcy there is no invisible hand please read my post again
umno looks like you were never working in the real market
youre still not presenting a convincing argument on why the system as it stands should be changedright now all im seeing is this is whats happening in eves market it is bad it needs to be more like the real world markets introduce controls so people cant mess with itso i will askwhy should people not be allowed to play games with or firesale things on the market because it means little to them
oh look its another other players arent playing the way i want them to make them play the way i want them to suggestion
well its kind of like why should people not be allowed to use doomsday weapons cap ships or bombs in high sec both questions have the same answer balanced game environment
you are missing my point the way to deal with this type of behavior is by reducing the 500000 estimate different exchanges people can trade on in eve as the exchanges consolidate the price fluctuations will decrease i mean if you are worried about dumping let buy orders cover constellations by default and the purchases consolidate in the issuing system bang suddenly there are plenty of buy orders to soak up the small market dumps people do besides the market price for things in eve is so ridiculously easy to manipulate with the current system your suggestion would likely create an even bigger problem lets say i want to kill an alliance if i have a couple billion isk i could get into their region buy all their preferred ammo set sell orders and buy orders at a magnitude higher than a reasonable price then invade suddenly they are stuck with whatever ammo they have in their holdshangars suddenly they are flat footed unable to rearm to bash the couple dozen sbus we dropped with only a few billion isk someone could seriously cripple almost any alliance in the game with your mechanic
some of us think that traditional economics are better suited for a hypercapitalist game environment like eve than keynesiandeal with it vov
ummi disagree consolidation of market hubs doesnt change anything the behaviour i was talking about is strickly per sandbox systemregionuniverse having only 1 wont change anything you have the mechanism which allows said behaviorand the scenario you are suggesting is rather silly so i wont comment on it anymore
youre still pushing this look this is such a naively devised notion that it doesnt even begin to warrant the vaguest of considerationthis is hilariously idiotic so what happens when some jita trader with a few billion to spare decides to buy up all of the stock of say warp disruptor iis then puts up a single unit for a billion isk what now someone is forced to buy that unit for a billion isk to fix the up your genius plan caused or nobody gets to buy warp disruptor iis until another 700 orders are placed which is how many it would take to bring the price back to where it presently is to drop the price by a hair at a time and of course everyone else gets to pay taxes on 1b99 1b992 1b993 etc all the way down the line the amount of tears you could wring out of people for the low low price of 5 billion isk would be well worth it and you would eventually get most or possibly even in excess of 100 of the money back what happens when they set the price to a trillion ten trillion a hundred trillionyeah that would be so much better youve totally prevented any one person from doing awful things to the market
yet another afk cloak thread im just going to paste in the same response as i made in the last onethisits not a hard thing to do and if your corp or alliance isnt organized enough to have this sort of system running i suggest you find another afk cloaking is not a major problem and has the beneficial side effect of keeping bots out of action which i feel more than makes up for any minor annoyance it may cause those of a more fragile disposition
the afk cloaker is not disrupting anything you are by being a frackin fearmong
the afk cloaker is the only counter to botsthe only person who is reasonably affected by an afk cloaker is a botterevery other person is capable of asking for help from corpalliance if the cloaker turns out to be active
anything that is done to nerf cloaks has to be countered by an improvement in the ability of active players to hunt you so what are you willing to give up
here is an idea make local low and null sec just like local in wormhole space if you dont speak up you arent listed if a person is not seen in local and they are cloaked then there is nothing to complain about for oen simple reason local didnt tell you they were there in the first place
the only problem with that is there is too much you can find in null and local without the use of probes this would tip the scale too far in the attackers favoreven delaying local as little as 1 minute could allow a single ship to slip in and get to a few belts before he is noticed at least in wh space they have to work to find you
00 is supposed to be dangerous to survive in 00 you cant go it alone  you need a corporation you need an alliance you need friends to watch your back while you watch theirs if you want to go into 00 and solo mine solo rate solo anom then youre doing it wrongthe whole local  cloaking system is broken local provides far too much intel not just in relation to cloaking but also in relation to finding enemy fleets local intel needs to be removed and a new system needs to be implemented1 local should only display people who have recently chatted in local2 implement a module similar to smart bomb but 0 damage that can decloak cloaky ships within x km 2025 km3 implement sentries sentries can be deployed  anchored and have no propulsion of their own sentries should alert the player who owns them as long as the player is in the system of any ships within a 100 km radius of the sentry filterable does not detect cloaked ships does not detect transitions from gate cloak to regular cloak andor whether the sentry is under attack a single pilot should be able to destroy a sentry in about 6090 seconds a player can only deploy one sentry at a time sentries can be deployed near gates  stationsi cant claim ive thought of everything here i am still fairly new to eve but i think the above steps would be a good start in the right directionedit  sentries reporting gate fire is a dumb ideaedit 2  i know the name sentry is already taken by some drones we the concept is still the same
another cloak thread must be the season for themnot supported even though i do prefer this to the standard afk cloaker rant threadpersonally i much prefer this suggestion proposal 100 to capacitor recharge time while cloaked which only effects non covert ops cloaks
as long as i can also have a fuel that keeps me off local chat
not this again no
i guess reading comprehension was never your strong point was it
the easiest solution is to extend the active tank bonus to also be a remote rep bonus making it useful in fleet pvp as well as solo pvp and pve in the same way that the amarr and caldari resistance bonus is useful in each case
i wish the fittings tool would remember weapons grouping i always group my weapons and when i save a loudout with grouped launchers in it for example id like them to reappear grouped when i load the fitting again
and ammo in cargo
2 months and several controversies removed one would wonder if the minutes will even be relevent at this point
minutes should be out this week buy popcorn now before the inevitable price rise
the way the meetings are held and the conversations we have with the devs take place in a manner that is not appropriate for public consumption when we tell ccp they are insert expletive here for doing this or that it takes place within a certain context and an understanding of what is meantthen i suggest that you adopt a more professional approach to the meetings and curb your language i read the reports of the fireside chat recently held the thought of wading through hours of cursing swearing and indecent remarks determined me not to listen for crying out loud if the reports of the language in a fireside chat are to be believed i would hate to think what pillow talk must be likeit is generally said that resorting to foul and abusive language denotes either a limited vocabularyintelligence or contempt for those at which it is directed i hope that neither is true in the case of csm if you cannot express yourself without resorting to such language then i dont think that i want you as my representativeswhat you are really saying is that we must take on trust that you are doing the job that we elected you to do ok benefit of the doubt etc but please be aware that trust is earned not demanded and if you continue to act as if the whole exercise of the csm is for your edification and gratification alone then im sorry the trust will not be there i speak from experience of being the minutes secretary at large rowdy and heated public meetings as well as committee ones try and keep the redactions to an absolute minimum if any and always bear in mind that you are not solely there as individuals but the players representatives and conduct yourselves accordingly sorry the last bit is pompous and maybe obvious but i feel that it had to be said
given the events of recent days the csm is overdue for a fireside chat join us for a freeformat qa about the may  june summits  well try to answer your questions in a fearless mannerdate saturday july 16time 2000 evemumble server csm6org default port no configuration necessary server will not be live until 24 hours prior update due to dns issues use ip address 75101186255 instead of csm6org if you have problems connectingin addition uaxdeath will hold a russianlanguage fireside chat on his teamspeak3 server located at voicelegionofdeathinfo on sunday july 17th at 1900 eveyour humble servanttrebor daehdoowsecretary of the 6th council of stellar managementposted by order of his eminence the chairmanps may summit minutes are now available they will be required reading
a song of fire and wait whatill be there
recent daysis this just about the endless patching of patches on patches of screwing people in the oceanic region or just the soe takeover and mt futureand honestly you cant do anything against the will of soe so why bother
hey i found it
there is still a csmi thought there was just a mittani nowim a little bit coked up on lies and propaganda right now im afraid i wont be in attendance
does csm know how vanity items survive being podkilled cause ccp wont answer my thread 
csm knows more than ccp as ccp are clueless like fearless just not quite the same they dont answer questions csm does everything that csm says can be later denied as they are not ccp employees meanwhile ccp cant even post a decent informative devblog so i gues 10x csm
dont hold your breath waiting for soe to get back to youso is this chat just the latest directive from soe to get us to argue about something anything not about the last few weeks get some attention off soe and get a couple of wedge issues into the community so we resume the usual fighting each other and not them
they do this because if worn clothing was destructible nobody would ever undock wearing any nexstore goodsand because nullsec folks tend to be in danger of being podded this means they would not buy fancy monocles because they would always be putting them on and taking them off  too much of a painand if ccp decided to address this by making it easy to change clothes so you had party clothes and work clothes then apart from the occasional person who forgets to change clothes before undocking youd never have an opportunity to grief someone and blow up their monocle anywayafaik this will not apply to items like ship paintjobs only to clothes and other bodily adornments
ummmm hello csm personthis is eve from my recollection the same place my first retriever was ganked while mining missions ninjaed and been podded quite a bit in null secwhy does some rich  get special treatment for a novelty trinket over my implantsit is fair or just that soe ccp want to train people into the consequence free land of mt
that sounds like a very good way to solve all recent problems dont let people who buy this crap undock thus keeping them out of our spaceship gameits the perfect solution
i personally would argue that the difference is that your implants have ingame effectsthe whole point of the nex store is to generate income nondestructible clothes are almost certainly revenueoptimal and clearly nondestructible items cannot be allowed to have ingame effects without breaking the sandboxput all these things together and nondestructibility is the best route for sandbox purists because it draws a line in the sand so to speak
that makes no sense thats like saying no one would pvp in an expensive shipmods because they run the risk of getting blown up thats kinda the whole point of eveeven though ccp have stated that making money isnt the point of this as stated by a dev the reason that they are willing to implement an item which does not follow the laws of eve at all for the sake of money didnt this bother you guys at all surely the csm could see how this makes no sense given that anything else in the game can be destroyed and you actually are ok with people having items that can magically transport from one station to anotheredit props to you still trebor for your quick and detailed reply so far 2 and a half days and ccp havent explained how vanity items are magically transported from one station to another i would really like the same service everytime i shop in jita seeing as its somehow possible in the eve world to do it with vanity items
not at the current prices youre right however at the current prices id imagine that almost noones going to buy them anywayhonestly ive said it before i think the whole pricing structure is absolutely pathetic indestructible clothes have no place in my eveif the prices were cut right down so that the transactions were actually micro id have no problem at all risking nex goodies in pvp hell itd only add to the thrill
doesnt this just contradict what you said about ship paint jobsif someone wants to buy a barbie dress ups from the space shopping network then more power to them they can look at themselves in their mirror all day longhowever what if i want to target people wearing barbie air hostess costumes people either have it with them or not i cant agree that these things should be magical after all ill be able to target custom painted ships running with your logic might not destroy the sandbox but it certainly lets the local cats  in it
what a load of bull if you want to generate income you create destructible items so they can be blown up so people have to buy new onesyou really have no clue about this its obvious and youre not doing yourself a favor by pretending you dojesus they are even talking about built in obsolescence in the fearless newsletter as one of the best things to do thats the antithesis of indestructible itemsgo away
and this is how the csm workssoe ccp party line all the way
if cost is a factor maybe they should make implants and officer mods indestructible too oh wait thats a dumb idea just like arbitrarily setting these items indestructible
some people are always going to want to find something to complain about thank you for the announcement i am looking forward to those may notes
hybridsgallente ja
the last sentence sounds nice but doesnt make any sensei see how nondestructible clothes are better from a revenue perspective but nothing you said did explain how they are better than fully destructible clothes from the sandbox purists povunless you want to argue if ccp does not earn enough with vanity items they will start selling convenience and advantages
yeah like we just found out that the person who should be discussing the players stance on the economic impacts the latest expansion has on the sandbox does not understand the most basic economic premises and instead repeats ccps catastrophic and wrong stancethats the something we just found we found out that were ed nothing more nothing less
ill make it even easier for everyone to see that trebor is not competent to discuss this by asking the following questionwhat is revenueoptimalthere see what i just did i just called him out on using a completely meaningless term
csm towing the company line this is why youre irrelevant
only for some well off people wouldnt care at current stupid nex prices at reasonable prices more people would undock with clothes accepting it as a risk just as they do with anything they undock withvanity items do have in game effects as well as out of game effects creating a elite class and relegating those not participating in the dress up to status of poor pod pilots in a game where youre value could be any number of things incarna will start out with class divisions to obviously make many look like poor slobs certainly seems like a great way to make eve real and increase immersion some will care and some wont in some cases the elite will the butt of many jokes and harassment but in others it will be the reverse this obviously is excellent gameplay to add in eve and most assuredly extremely important to walking in stations as far as griefing people it would be more about the grief than the monocle out in space sort of like blacklisting cause that is just about the only value nex pricingitems adds to the game chase down the monocle wearers kill them where you find them deny them access to your corp make them pariahs with their precious nex items safe from being destroyed griefing them nets ccp no extra money from destroyed crap that needs to be replaced
with respect i must disagree1 nondestructible items can be sold at higher prices than destructible ones although we can all agree that the prices ccp settled upon were in most cases wrong2 there are broadly speaking two populations in eve  carebears who rarely get podded and thus rarely would have to rebuy their destructible clothes and pvpers who are always getting podded and thus given the annoyancefactor of having to undressredress would rarely buy them in the first place nobody who is getting podded every week is going to buy a monoclethus by making clothing nondestructible you increase your income from both groups i would prefer there to be a strong precedent in place to reduce future temptation it is the set of conditions and prices that generates the greatest income i have some small experience with pricing of goods with little or no marginal costofgoodssold you may be interested in a brief paper i wrote on the subject over a decade ago not entirely on point but there are analogies
the actual reason why these items will remain invincible is really rather simpleif they were destructible people would simply undress them before undocking the consequence would be a lot of stress on the item database and a lot of whining from people who frown at swapping their vanaity  around all the time to avoid lossesmaking them destructible wouldnt accomplish anything really nobody would gain devtime would be invested for no tangible effect on gameplay cpu would be wasted with just as little effect it would be nothing but a cash sink
everyone has opinions all you do is try to berate people in most posts you make no matter what the subject so yeah i do not listen to a word you say i believe most people can see through the poison you are trying to spread
were talking about revenue here revenue is the product of price times number of sales ignoring the second part of the equation does not really improve my view of your economic capabilitiesusing this approach anything can be justified broadly speaking this is even more bull no facts no statistics nothing id even argue that there are more than two populations broadly speaking that isscanned over it its about tipping and intellectual property barely any numbers included no graphs no formulae no link to raw data no references to other scientific papers and its three pages longyou wrote that in school and it does not apply to the topic at hand you have no clue about thisthe fact that youre even linking to that so called paper to prove your point tells me youre delusional about the amount of your scientific expertise thus i repeat my initial point were ed
see thats the problem you think these are opinions and you believe stuff
all your doing yarrrrrhh is showing the entire eve forum community that you my friend are an arse ccp will always generate extra revenue by making certain nex items indestructible because many people will refuse to pay real money for items that can be lost by a suicide gankereven if the item in question was only a few pounds it still does not matter as you as by the very nature of eve anybody can destroy anybody elseon top of that like another poster has already stated if they could be destroyed all that is going happen is people are going to complain that everytime they undock they are going to have remove the items and they will stop buying itemsas for the argument regarding implants they have a direct effect in game where as clothes do notcant see any issue here other then people complain for the sake of it
i will try to be there seriously hope that the csm can push for some change latest expansionmonth was hardly a comunicationpr issue or bad luck currently game has stalled is filled with unfihished or useless content ccp seems focused elsewhere and the forumscomunity just suck with all the complaints going onpeople arent shooting statues anymore this has evolved into a general feeling of dissatisfaction that is corrosive
some players actually have some sort of pride i understand that feeling must be alien to you but trust me those players would undock with destructible nex clothes showing the people around them how badass they are by wearing what theyre wearing while flying ships that make it hard to be ganked
the election is over you guys won why keep campaigning with this townhall type electioneeringwhy doesnt the csm ever communicate with the players on the forums ccp set up for this very purpose jita park has been almost empty since csm 5 left not everyone can make it for your fireside chat moreover these sorts of chats dont allow others to follow up and get more of an in depth idea of what you are doing we are stuck with your canned soundbite responses pretty lame stuff csm6 oh yeah and it doesnt help after mittanis first communication to the players after you emergency summit was nevermind those leaked memos i guess we have to assume you all agree with what he said since you never posted anything in response to him as individuals
so when is gold ammo coming outi need a lowe to farm up some isk
tune into the fireside chat to listen to csms soundbite for you concerns will that make you happy csm surely wont address that in any substantive way  like on the forums
lol man you are a hell of a comedianby the way where are the these people you speak of
i think these fireside chats are a great thing but as another poster said they shouldt be replacing other more long term forms of back and forth communication between csm and players ie forums i feel that a lot more csm representation should be happening on the forums jita park specifically its been mostly a ghost town for months now
did you forget to add that he only expects his voters only to attend
i wrote that based on the experience of running a website using the model a website that is still around and quite nicely profitable and sorry to disappoint you but not only was i not in school when i wrote it but i had the benefit of 20 years of experience doing marginally relevant things like writing computer games and helping to create the anime market in the usbottom line you are entitled to your opinion but until you lay down some facts to support them they are unlikely to convince anyoneps the may minutes are now available
no arguing on that thats absolutely valid so whats your next step now that youve agreed that your former statements are unconvincing
so plex are destructible but monocles are notneither has a direct impact on the game and arguably neither are cheap there is no real reason to haul plex around rather than convenience and yet people still do it despite the fact they are destructiblewhat makes virtual clothing different and therefor exempt from the same rules as every other item in the game
snake sets cost multiple times the amount of what a monocle costs people still use them people fly faction fit golems which have a paper tank as well which are worth a lot more than monoclesthe whole argument of if nex would be destructible nobody would buy it is just utter bull disproven by items in game right now that are worth more than themits such a shame that were represented by people who deny that
by following that logic we should all have to buy new clothes starter ones too everytime we get podded and dont try to say oh but they are stater clothes so they should be free cause it makes no sense when some of the starter ones look better then the nex ones if you grant me this then i agree to your argumentalso you are quite selective with what you quote and most of times only reply to part of an argument id recommend you dont do that since it makes it look like you are dodging the question which you are not are youedit crap posted with alt
are we allowed to ask for low sec or fw related stuff 
youre just proving how bad this whole concept is it doesnt make sense as it is right now at all shoes for the price of multiple battleships just dont make sense no matter how you twist it nex failed ccp failed the whole concept is flawed im just pointing out that the people who defend nex cant even justify it with economic means
spaceships are expensive if ccp continues to allow ships to be destroyed no one who buys an expensive ship will ever undock this injustice must be addressed
yes of course they will have a soundbite prepared for that as well if it will make you happy to hear the soundbite make sure you show up
trebor is it more revenueoptimal to sell 10 100 monocles or 1000 15 monocles
er  just make them cheaper and destructible its very un eve to have an implant that as if by magic is the only thing to survive a podding in game effects or not if the items were much cheaper and destructible the loss of income from price would be made up for by a ppl replacing lost items and b players with less money actually buying nex store goods but theres the added benefit of keeping the eve purists happy and making a lot of players who feel disenfranchised by the nex current store prices i know dramatic lol happier that they now get to participate where only the self proclaimed elite could and consider this eve is about riskreward right  i see you point out that vanity items have no in game effects true ofc but that doesnt mean they have no in game reward if they did not exactly why would anyone bother to buy them  the massive monocle trollfest was enough to clearly prove the fact that folks get an enormous amount of fun from the monocle that is a rewardwheres the risk 
this so much this
snake sets improve your combat ability they have a usepeople fly faction fit golems because faction modules are more efficient or powerfulthe second part of your post is completely irrelevant useless monocles are not estamel invulnerability fieldsps stop doubleposting youre giving the forums literally twice the amount of whining
this i need some more isk fast
do we all need a fireplace screensaver for the eventi will be there to listen
monocles give an instant 500 bonus on ing people off theyre not useless you peasant
currently risk is obviously showing people you are a tool whod rather have a monocle than put that plex money towards something good like plex for good rewarding a new pilot or something really useful like a ship you fit and fly for fun so someone else can ruin your funthen there is the small chance people will harass the monocled fool in game griefing etcfinally in forums 20 people can ignore everything monocle wearing trolls ever say simply because they wear a monocle so long buddy
the only question i have is this when is the next election coming up for new csms 
really because ccp keep denying precisely that is this a personal view or something that ccp told you if it is a personal view then have you challenged ccp on the fact that you think they are lying to us if it is something you heard from ccp then have you challenged them on the fact that they either lied to you when telling you this or they are currently lying to the players when they deny this eg zinfandels devblog answers p 1
hmmm there are so many good reasons to be ticked off at this csm i just dont see either the destructibility of worn vanity items or the price of vanity items on that listbut yeah if you want to be ed off at the right people for the wrong reasons glhf im sure they are thrilled that you want to blow your wad on this crap and not talk about what matters
sounds like a personal problemyou want to destroy them because you dont like monocles they  you off boohoostop trolling these forums youre awful at it the only bad part of keeping these items indestructible is that people like you cant enjoy smashing them to bits but what if it wasnt a monocle how would you even be able to tell that hes got vanity shoes or pants are you going to look at every avatar pic in the hopes to get a glimpse of what shirt hes wearing come on be serious youre just a whining arse who cries when he doesnt get what he wants now to be on topic im very eager to attend this csm qa
i could not care less what a csm has to say or not say
i am very interested in hearing your clear concise knowledge please teach meand yaahhhr i see what youre saying you think people will have no problem spending money on ridiculously overpriced vanity items the problem is youre quite wrong even going back to you riskreward nonsense there is no reward to having a 2b isk shirtpantseyepiece combo on your character when u pvp shuttle around stationspinerr stationdoor in jita even bringing up multibillion isk snake implants or multibilloin isk ships in some attempt to compare how expensive things can get in pvp completely shows u miss the point ccp is trying to convey sure my pvp char has billions upon billions of shipsimplantsmods and the entire purpose of having those things is to hold a greater chance of achieving my objective killing while not dying clothes in no way will decrease my chance at dying and if anything make the chance go up with the grieferfun to be had even ifif not the clothes were destructible would i with 2b isk in my head at least 15b isk on my hull waste yet another 15b in spacedressup if i know i can lose it no no i would not no reward all riskindestructible clothes sure why not i got the iskccp wins
you apparently dont know how a precedent is set they sell indestructible items in a game where everything is destructible regardless of what that item is the precedent is that it can and will be done to more and more items to get as many people as possible to buyprecedents on slippery slopes are worthless when the bottom line is the determining factorperiodshame on the people who voted for this buffoon
honestly im getting sick of asking this is like the 4th 5th  time ive asked but can we please get a transcript of the fireside chats i cannot listen to the fireside chats because i am deaf
nakedinyourpod
what about monocles
have you considered that maybe they are removableoh and why isnt there any up in spaceman ill say it again youre really bad at trolling
last and only other fireside chat was nothing but the mittani show will be skipping it this time really dont feel like wasting couple hours of my life listening to that total complete dumb ass
with respect amazon disagreesthey have been quite successful going for volume over markup sure nobody wants to pay 60 bucks for a destructible item but would people pay 5 bucks for a destructible item probablyand market saturation means nothing if the cheap item is destructible or suffers from decay only people who refrain from playing eve will keep their swag while the others will lose and purchase moregoing for the jugular is just stupid vanity items will be in demand always so why not be smart about it and go for volume sales over gutting the players wallet on a one shot deal
oh no you didnt you did not just call ccp and trebor stupid for not understanding microtransactions the long tail effect and how to adequately price vanity items in that contextyou did not call them stupid or did you
ill call them weapons grade stupid on vanity pricing they had it close with destructable just also needed plex to break into 35000 aur at current pricingi completely understand the hobby analogy but bait and switching new subs or gosh people who invested years into the game are actually correct no matter how vehemently the csm is apathetic on the topic or ccp protecting the markets they are wrong and subscriber numbers will prove it
pointless much like that emergency summit you had and the csm as a wholecongrats
just read through the well detailed minutes thank you for so much clarityi would love to get more feedback from the csm on where they feel ccp betrayed trust and we sit at the current toxic environmenti would love to speak to the much valued npe as i just started in late march of this year and am on the fence about keeping my 2 accounts i see nothing in the gooey center of development just a lot of totally new trial account conversions and bitter vet retentionexample3 month old player who plays on daily basis attempts joining corp and doing incursion mining in hisec only to be wardecced and killed against our willnegotiated ransom with their ceo only to have them cancel wardec then repeatedly get killed for 24 hours thanks to ccp bug cancel means cancel right ccp cant fix dishonorable douch e bag s but they can cancel something as advertised right this alone has cost ccp 4 accounts of the highly valued new playersor are we just quickhit cashcows and churn is predictable why not make wardec avail only in low sec and null didnt i just read in the minutes lowsec is pointless unless you call gatecamping amamake for minmatar carebears the desired result because you wont retain people trying to get into the game if they are permanently injured psychologically the first 10 times or so they try think mma world champ fightingyou over and over hurts dont it come to washington and ill demonstrate
lowsec is far from pointless for the people that live there gfs happen all the time in my area
we really need more then 1 remap per year so i totally endorse this either it be by plex or just waiting for a timer to run out
i actually agree with this and dont believe its as game breaking as those against make out
how do they gather intel whilst afkwhat other items to they gather whilst afkhow do they disrupt your activities whilst afkid like honest factual answers please
so what your saying is that you should be able to go afk record logs of local chat see what ships come in and out of the system via fraps see when the system is active and not active and be able to plan an attack all without needing to be at your computer to grab that intellby changing it to where you can not afk cloak anymore and actually have to be there it allows you to gain better more accurate intell on the system and our response times it allows you to actually lock down the system for the entire time your on vs a half an hour to an hour what is better attack a system when there response time is a half an hour or attack that system when the response time is 2 minutes if your set in the right position you also get to see what kind of ships we field for that defensei am not asking that the cloak mechanic change or that we be able to find you we are asking that it be changed to where you cant just cloak up and walk away from your computer all day and stay safe and gather the intell or cause a drop in production without actually being at your computerintell if you set it right you can read threw the logs when you come back if you sit near a gate and use fraps you can see what ships come in and out by using fraps you can see how many folks are in local and what the active times areitems you of course wont gain anydisruption is easy i dont know if they are afk or not so rather then risk it and have 10 hulks out with 1 person doing protection i now have 3 to 4 folks providing protection this lowers productivity and if you consider how much ore you have to mine to keep an industry level of 5 or 4 each day that loss can and most times does mean the loss of that industry levelif i am going to online a pos in that system it would be relativly stupid of me to do so without having protection while it is going up and getting onlinedratting is also affected as we will most times not go out and rat due to the rats warp scraming us the risk is to great of you having scanned us down and then dropping a cyno and us being unable to get away
please answer each question directly
right and we are just asking that you not be able to sit in your system all day making isk while having perfect intel to be able to run to station every time someone comes within 2 systems of you
i have yet to see answers to why these arent suitable ways to handle afk cloakersdscan for probeshave a gang of friends with you to protect youalso  as far as free intel goes if they can do it so can you so your only argument is honor playing  that is that players shouldnt be able to get things easy if they can why not send your own cloakers to their systems only you are halting operations not them you are being reactionaryheres another thought  do you operate in only one system guess what afk cloakers cant follow you what a concept move next door and mine there if youre worried about hauling  you should have an escort anyways so a cloaker wont matter if you are in just one system afk cloakers are the least of your concernsnullsec and lowsec is not safe  no you didnt say it was  but you fail to realize how unsafe it is yes it really is that easy to get intel on you so you better be ready when that afk cloaker ends up being a hot drop when you least expect it stressful only if you make it so but generally yes unfair not at all can you do something about it yeah  go find his corp and kick their ass cant sounds like youre either not ready for lownull are a bot or you dont have any friends to help youwhich goes back to youre not ready for lownull
if your cloaked and afk it is perfectly safemags i did answer each item i was in the process of editing it when you posted most liklythats my point though right there nullsec and lowsec is not supposed to be safe no offense but after a half hour or so the cloaker doesnt bother me all he does is make me change my operations a little if you are in a system and cloaked up it should halt operations it should provoke a response it should cause an element of danger to the people in that systemright now it after a half hour to an hour guess what while i had to change my operations and have things disrupted a little i still continue i want that danger in my system you show up and cloak it should stop my operations in there tracks i shouldnt feel safer in null sec then i do in frigging jita
totally safe yes of course it is guess what you still cant do anything but sit there and watch too im seeing a costbenefit here and thus no problemeven if the guy was probeable  he could just move around and still accomplish the exact same problem of yours he could do it hours on end too if he so chose so again youre only problem is honor playing in that you cant stand that a player can accomplish a task with minimal effortyou know we also have mining industrials jetcan mining data cores fw and lp talk about a faucet changing ships while fighting with an orca jump bridges supercarriers that can only be beat by more supercarriersim seeing a trend of minimal effort with benefits so i really dont see a problem with someone being able to show up cloak up be unprobeable and sit there while they go play tennis with the neighbors there are methods available that you still havent addressed to ward against the threat of these people  gangs and dscan the most obvious system security is more applicable to alliances large enough to support such an endeavor but those first two a gang of three can do
you try and say cloaking and hanging out in your system is not playing the game its becoming clear that anything you dont like isnt playing the game as you see it well guess what  welcome to the sandbox anything goes so either adapt or die the latter is a good option for you
you know i just realized that even if you could probe out cloaksi have a covops thus it moves at a normal speed i take said covops and fit it to go as fast as possible passively since we cant use mwd or ab righti now warp in cloak up double click past the starand walk offcruising along at however many hundred maybe thousand ms given that im moving though slow relative to the size of probe scans even if you pinpointed my cloaked ship and warped in by the time you arrive ill be more than 25km away from your warp inand continuing to fly further away in a straight line so unless by sheer luck you manually fly right at me youll not bust my cloak tada i just became an afk cloaker thats probeable unless ccp develops a ship that can bust cloaks that far out which i can see 20km maybe but 25 your problem remainsfood for thought
ha i dunno why i didnt think to mention that cause i do the same with noncloaky small fast ship by powering along with my mwd thus anyone trying to probe me out lands way the hell back that way gestures over my shoulder giving me more than enough time to respond or if they jump in cloaked theyre too far off to catch me without a mwd while cloaked either way i can see them coming a mile offthe upshot is the whole idea of making cloaked ships probable fails anywayi also say that making cloaked ships would screw over many bigger slower more expensive ships who make not have a chance to survive unless they can stay cloaked in a safe spot while they figure a way out of a hostile system
you cant rely upon chat logs for intel its an extremely unreliable intel sourcefraps you honestly want me to believe that someone would create hours of fraps to watch lateryou already said they do why did you lie about thatbut they are afk how do they do all of this whilst not at the keyboard
you havent lived in a worm with an organized crew i take it all holes are tagged almost at time of spawn and collapsing the potentially dangerous ones them takes very little effortkeep in mind that the real worm dwellers dont solo crap like you are probably used to so a t3 gang poses no significant threat  read the long story about the first entity to ever be kicked out of a worm  took almost six months if i recall rk doing the deed i thinkdo try to keep up already answered that question difference between us seems to be that you want changes that benefit your chosen modus operandi at the expense of all others whereas i aim for actual balanceremoving local alone breaks more than fixesps please stop thinking i have anything to do with the daisychain stroking that is null  i saw the impending fiasco of dom before it was deployed and got out while the getting was good thank you very muchoh no my solo ratting supercapital backbone1111you must be referring to supers nothing else fits and nothing else would be impacted to any significant degreeguess what supers shouldnt be out and about without support if they want to live supers are alliance assets speaks not only about the cost but how they were intended to be used the fact that any moron with half a brain can buy one with a couple of months of grinding does not really change thatwould probeable cloaks make supers obsolete hardly a few would die in a fire after the change but then tactical changes are made  like jumping with triage nrgtrans archons or forward bases pos along travel pathswould probeable cloaks make solo supers obsolete most definitely as they should be that homogeneous superblobs is even viable is ridiculous beyond belief and one of the reasons why they will be hit hard when the pendulum comes back
not true all efected by thatos freeks as botter in the same way just ratter this days not so much good space to rat only 35 systems in all regions where is good anomalys and from my expiriance mostly clouckers have cov cynos on them so par rating and fleet ratign dont change a  and its still for that cloucker to easy get targets

allready exist sych programms with are using frapses and that can be counted outomatikly no need even count them manyaly with all ship names insted
my eyes
no im mainly referring to battlecruisers and battleships as i dont fly caps myself nor do i have much interest in doing so most bcs and bses cannot fly fast enough cloaked to make probing cloaked ships fail for them if theyre set to burn in a straight line nano fits might change that but they have been impractical for larger ships since the nano nerfbut good job not knowing the speed capabilities of subcaps while cloaked or how far away one would have to be to escape tackling
no serious pewer cloaks their ships any more except maybe during logistics operations even macrosbots dont use cloaks any more for goddess sakethe only combat cloaks i have seen the past 4 years are fail bbs and dictors plus an assortment of noobs who dont know any better remember that any one change will have to be made together with a whole slew of companion changes probeable cloaks would fit nicely with an elimination of local for instance and would naturally exclude legitimate uses ie all ships with cloak bonuses
right no one ever gets ambushed in wh space while doing sites i have been on both sides of that equation and if a group is mobilized it takes about a minutes or two to ambush a group with a hic and gang also ask ccres how long it took aharm to boot them from wspace guarantee it was not 6 monthsbut aside from that you are missing the whole point of my argument these isks dont live in wspace because they have to work to find the limited supply of combat sites and mining sites they want upgraded null sec to be soft and warm and have the ability to put a cloaked ship several jumps out and watch local for incoming gangs they want to make isk hand by chaining belts grav sites and combat sites that respawn in a minute you are right the whole balance of null is broken there is no way to effectively hunt industrial and ratters and they have no effective way to stop running from afk cloakers it is a poor balance but a balance none the less to eliminate the afk cloak without giving some way to hunt these types of players would throw off the balance
1auto log out for afkUFFFDs after an ammount of time 1hr not even low or 00
jesus i dont even live is 00 and i can think of several ways to cope with this tactic1 stay aligned really not hard to do warp as soon as you see the ebil person uncloak2 rat with a couple of friends 3 v 1 should be fairly easy to manage if you dont all fill your pants at the sight of a red3 have a falcon alt  friend  whatever handy im sure you null bears can manage this one already4 move to the next system5 actually think tactically and bait  kill the dude in the cloaky best option surelydamn if i can manage to rat my sec status up in 00 where everyone is hostile to me surely you can manage in a 00 area you own thats full of blues and only has 1 enemy in it
youve obviously not spent much time in other peoples space if you think cloaking isnt used by pvpers
this
afk  away from keyboard1 i have yet to hear of one incident that involved a afk player killing another player who was sitting at his key board2 the issue is not cloaking it is afk so lets do away with all afkers a player in stations are ejected every 30 minutes so they have to redock i hate flying 30 jumps into 00 to a station system with 30 people in it all docked up and afkb i want a weapon called the fumigator that after going into siege mode on a dread attachs itself to a station and injects poisen gas so all players who dont undock with in 5 min will begin to lose skill points after undocking the gas blocks their ability to redock for 5 minc pos ship draggingtractor beam that attachs to a dread and can drag players out of a pos who are afk if they are active all they have to do is fly back to the tower and the beam is brokeor how about you come to grips with the fact until ccp hooks you up to your computer with a wireless implant that tells the server when you are not sitting and playing eve you should get over your fears of being killed by people who are not touching there key board
nice d
that is where the difference is you probably think that killing pveers is pvp whereas i consider it ratting  use a cloak on a ship not designed for it against a willing and armed opponent  doesnt do very well at alltheres a reason why cloaks on combat fits are laughed at when they appear on the various killboards
who is laughing exactly i can not think of one serious 00 presence past or present that has not used or continues to use this tactic it is a widely used tactic in 00 across the board and it is not all about popping fat jewbears flying pinatas they just happen to get in the way sometimes
thisthe argument for years boils down to you want ccp to develop a game mechanic to compensate for your own fearparanoiaits a multiplayer game dont do anything alone and there wont be an issue
indeedeasily bypassed as has been said numerous times before
i yelled at your corp 4 years ago for being stupid and not docking up or moving to a different system with afk cloakers in system and known active reds in the system next dooryou still havent learned whelp
no
please check who is their new partner is nexonwho good in promoting free game and yet they will provide an in game purchase to power up or to enjoy certain services example you want to do rafting or incursion you will need to buy licence to run incursion with real money that is nexon for i lived in asia and i see a lot of free games and subs will paid huge amounti of money without knowing it because is blinded by the services to power up please if ccp wanna to follow the nexon way of dealing  do it with care cause we have council please council monitor ccp closelysincerelyshu jia

are you saying well have ships interiors soon not bloody likely and even if we did there is still no reason to disembark at every dock as all instation activities can be performed remotelyanyway being against this is like being against the option not to run missions or the option not to go to 00 or the option not to mine why would you
why the 1 not going to say you are wrong for it but give reasoning for it at leastalso 1
ancient issue that remains fail today just another way ccp shows theyre unable to sort even the simplest of obvious problems
1this is the ballance
dear ccp i want all of the benefits and none of the risks please implement k thxthis is clearly a haveeat cake suggestion if you care about your training speed so much odds are youre optimizing to two spiked stats which means you dont need a full rack of attribute implants  you only need two at which point even 5s become a reasonable expense and 4s become downright trivial
i like the negativity of the people that dont see the point or maybe they do unsterstand it but refuse to see why its needed because it might be that they lose their faulty advantagescrew the haters i want this
great idea hisecers arent screwed around pvpers get a more sustainable method for skill boosting and a new high volume market opportunity is created out of the deal there is probably a downside but im not seeing it
if you actually think about it it makes sensepromotes more interaction etc
would you mind telling us about the original mines i still find contracts for them around but know nothing about how they worked or their strengths and weakness
would be interesting to see mines as an antisuper weapon
i didnt think about that i was mostly thinking about how to secure nullsec border systems and poss though if the super cap warped in badly it could enter multiple fields and that would wreck its day a bit also after some further thought i think the damage should be increased to a base of 2000 or 2500 so its higher than bombs
instead of a command structure make it a new ship that also means that players cant leave it unattendedlike the hic it deploys a minefield and cannot move from the spot if the pilot ejects the mine field is destroyed
i to wish mines back
bring back dd
yes let me solo gatestation campi want it nao
while i was hoping for an around the clock defense system the second option could be worthwhile a new ship styled for gatecamping or both types anchor type for nullsec defense with heavy damage or hic style for lowsecnullsec gatecamping limited damage but much greater mobility only thing to make the ship balanced would be one high slot to fit the mine launcher so it isnt overpowered
i think it should be similar to the mobile warp bubbles if an alliance sets them up around a gate it will hit anything that goes either way through the gate hitting their own ships as well if they seal off every gate in a system they will be stuckif they are under attack its not a bad option but it will limit their own mobility otherwise a decent balance
dear lord please fix gal ships i want to get into serious pvp and i keep getting told oh train into projectile guns oh train into minmatar ships train into amarr train into caldari and get better shield tanking skills its bs that one race just gets the sharp end of the stick while all the other races keep getting their toys upgraded

i was there  few centurys ago hehunless theyre intending to give special ability to blaster ships like being able to warp on grid from 50km this trailer didnt reflected gallente and blaster ships issues like not being able to apply any decent dps unless youre on top of the targeta simple fleet of hurricanes would just spank that blaster fleet with lols in local
definately needs a slight adjustment
aye
supported make cq optional
one problemstackingthink about it i put five ewar frigates on your mothership ewar most notably webs stacks  meaning your fighters and fbs are moving at the speed of a bs no mwd makes this even worst tps  dampeners and you just really made these uselessthe idea is a great one and certainly ingenious dont get me wrong scs really do need a nerf of some sort or dreads need to be buffed to counter them somehow and stop the i have 1 sc i win scenarios however this suggestion goes above and beyond nailing scsand drone boats in general if applied that way it severely overpowers ewar ships fact is that a solution either to make scs more vulnerable fbs less powerful or an effective means to combat the drones needs to exist without upsetting other balancesim all for ewar ships seeing more love even jammers though not necessarily in the form of a buff but other ships are in dire need of attention black ops are virtually useless scs need a counter other than more scs dreadnaughts and arguably carriers are obsolete because of scpersonally i think dd needs to be aoe again and be able to wipe supers drones out more ships destroyed  better economy as well as more strategic battles
he did say that numbers would need to be adjusted so a 60 web would slow the fighters down by 30 maybe 10 there is also stacking penalty to consider if the super carrier is really being bothered by the electronic attack ships then maybe he should have brought in a proper support fleet instead of nothing but supersi guess super carriers without a support fleet will view them as being over powered certainly other ships wont think that way because these effects only apply to super carrierssupportfleeti agree but this proposal has nothing to do with blops or somehow arguing where development attention needs to 100 focused onso your saying to field another super capital to be able to fight a super capital aoe doomsday was incredibly stupid you would get hundreds of people ready for a big fight and then one side would just drop in a couple titans dd and that was it so where is the rock paper scissors in that rock paper scissors bigger scissorsbring a support fleet
you could have stopped there  the rest is just wasting space and trolling an opposition comment as i said the idea is a great one but i have my doubts about its viability also last i checked nobody is bringing just supers  support fleets are always therethe next concern id have is lag  yes that sounds lame but think about warfare links great concept causes crazy amounts of lag now take into consideration what ewar ship effects being spread across so many different entities are personally as i said id rather see other ships brought up to fight against supers  dreadnaughts have a chance to fulfill this role or destroyers could possibly be revisited  they are meant to be antifighter support and given their inherently higher dps could be buffed more to suffice as fighterfighterbomber killers while still remaining fragilethe short of my point is that this idea sounds neat but id rather see other solutions implemented to handle supercarriers and their imbalances im straddling the fence on whether carriers should only use fightersfbs  it would certainly change gameplay with them possibly for the better but then again its kind of lame that the ultimate drone ship is incapable of launching light drones to handle a swarm of frigates like those ewar shipskudos for thinking outside the box  we certainly need that ccp seems intent on thinking inside the coffererrbox
p 3 csm meeting notesthe long awaited scarrier nerf a reasonable one at that
well have to wait and see if it makes it into the game like that a little bit too tame in my opinion as it apparently leaves the ridiculous ehp values intact as well as implant interactionson a side note the changing local bit has me pretty excited addressing the instant intel problem is long overdue heres hoping for the best
i am going to support this idea although i think it is a little bit too harsh of a nerf on scbut as a generality i really like the idea of ew ships having a special ability to harm super caps
bump
dunno if the same problem occours on research stuff but i would like to see produktion and research mepe contracts possible either due to the lag of some nonplayer facility space that could be an interesting way to make additional money andor fill empty time in pos modulesalso prevents ceoUFFFDs from giving rights to some newunknown corpmember
supported every day i have to use bookmarks sharing them between people copying back and forth id love to know more about them and possibly how to optimize my own and the servers use regarding them
oh god yesthe original fix of having a delay in copying was made on purpose due to server performance issues oh how so long ago that was but that does not excuse the fact that managing them via folders and such is a complete pain if you reinstall have fun setting up your folders again the whole system sucks keep the copy delay that was a game design issueand promotes people to get their own damn strategic marksfix the manageability of them
just to clarify by what i mean when i say innocent pirate i mean that he has not commited a crime at the current time therefore he has no 15mins gcc timer
how does the official canon story go is it like npc pirates are assumed to all have gcc on them but concord doesnt actively pursue them if so then gcc should extend to those who rep them if not then ccp needs to fix it

im no programmerbut i would think this is easy to introduce since there is already an existing strip function in the gamebump for more support  im trying to find the little things thread and put it there too since it is you know little
a few months back i would have said this was unnecessary because you could simply apply a fitting to accomplish the swap now that were limited to only 50 personal fittings stored serverside and cannot apply a saved fitting this feature makes a bit more sensepersonally id like to see a return of the unlimited local store for ship fittings and no im not going to pay extra aurum for more fitting storage
yes
yes yes youre right everyone else is wrong the other player should have stayed in his weaker ship and let you shoot him instead of closing the astoundingly obvious trap on your stupid arse d
i dont recall npc stations gaining aggro when people dock there you can see the orca just as easily you know what the possibilities are if you dont like them gtfo
yawn you need some new material at least someone previous was willing to try the go back to wow line you just keep repeating the same stupid crap i suppose thats easier than facing up to the imbalance that exists
and that is why npc stations dont draw aggro when people dock there  but you cannot escape therein to avoid the consequences of your aggression either at least not immediately so under aggro rule one shouldnt be able to find refuge in an orca for the duration eitheri agree the op had plenty of time to get away but ultimately i realized that his decision to stay had nothing to do with the issue he brought up if you cant dock inside a station you shouldnt be allowed to dock inside an orca either that logic is hard to subvertbesides an orca is like a locally spawn superstation in that you you can just hug it and play docking games with it even when youre webbed and scrambled to death or not to death is the point rather 
uhh what philosophy againwhoever told you that is an idiot this game revolves around not committing to the fight while making your idiot victim commit to it
an npc station or a gate is a passive entity they are not player controlled they make no choices an orca pilot does make choices as does the player who chooses to use this tactic the tactic creates an imbalance that allows someone to escape the consequences of their actions
yeah ya think so huh tell it to the devs then
do you even understand what he is saying since you obviously dont id like to encourage you to review what the nanonerf was actually about it would probably help to read all the assorted dev blogs on that topic toohint it was not about removing kite tactics from the game it was about removing the ability to deal damage while at the same time completely avoiding incoming damage the ability to just warp off if you cant take something did remain completely untouched fyiyes thats a foot its so deep in your mouth its almost in your stomach edit and no as someone who uses mainly nanoships id very much like to keep that buff erm i mean nerf
well i wouldnt want to be the orca pilot who gets screwed over by his corpmate in that situation
continue to gloss over that you screwed up and its your fault you died whatever you do never deal with reality
way to ignore that he was pointing out eve is about fighting as unfairly as possible you think anyone with a brain goes willingly into a fair fight in eve or rl of course not you look for advantage and take it
see the bottom of post 80 dimwit
yawn
yep apparently you dont nice attempt at trying to back off from calling devs idiots though
so your ignorance of your own failings is willful then ok no one can help you here if youre not prepared to learn from your mistakes
just make it impossible in high sec like neutral rep should also be either youre in the same fleetcorp and so get the aggression timer or youre not and shouldnt be able to without concord responsenasty abuses of game mechanics should get nasty consequences but they dont its eve so you better find some friends wardec his corpalliance and spank them until they ask for mercy
they should not be able to dock full stop its feckng annoying you go blinky you should have a docking timer  simple
are you always an idiot or do you just act like one for special occasions
do you always insult people who point out youre the one who screwed up or do you still not understand you got yourself blown up d which is it stupidity or delusion
aww did i hurt your feelings youre the one that tossed the first insult and now you want to whine boo hoo cry more ya hypocrite maybe you can dock your personality in your orca and get a new one rather than being exposed as a simpletonps thanks for the bump
this at the very least im still a fan of transferring aggression though as the orca pilot is clearly lending aid in a fight
care to point out where i said anything like that again oh wait you cantmy exact wording was whoever told you that there is a design philosophy of committing to a fight in eve is an idiotfactual evidence that there isnt such a philosophy nonexhaustive list nonuniform speed properties on ships limited range warp disruption and speed control modules long range weapon systems anchorable warp disruption bubbles wormhole jumpaggression mechanics logoff after jump mechanics logoff mechanics regarding supercapitalsnow it was you who wrongly deduced that there must be such a philosophy from the dev blog you quoted which contained exactly zero evidence in that respect conclusion i called you an idiotbump so you may humiliate yourself some more it is very entertaining so far what are you going to do now dodge the point again
actually its simply a moronic game mechanic to give highsec griefers a 100 chance to walk free without loss 100 of the timethe issue isnt that the people using orcas swap to a better ship and kill someone the problem is that they get pwned regularly enough but instantly switch to a shuttle and warp outsolution is simple if ship maintenance array is used the orca pilot is forwarded all flags of the parties using the arrayeffect miners etc can still switch ships when aggressed but griefers lose their invincible walk free card want to use an orca to win at highsec griefing fine risk vs reward says you stupid er should better bring a fleet to keep it alive
you think you hurt my feelings snorts amused when did you manage that dude  youre now a laughing stock on these forums you a fell for the oldest bait in the game b were too dumb to run when it because painfully obvious twice that you were about to get ganked and b  worst of all  made the tragicomic error of whinging about it here dyou havent hurt my feelings you poor fool youve provided nonstop amusement from your first post chucklesbut hey if  like realising you were the reason you got blown away  you need to believe youve hurt my feelings i cant even type that with a straight face d  thats cool with me in fact i encourage you to spread this thread around as much as possible link it everywhere make it your sigafter all youre not a dumb  who keeps digging his hole deeper no youre the poor put upon hero who was the tragic victim of an unfair tactic by a nasty wasty pirate who no doubt needs to be taught a lesson
how do you differentiate between miners and nonminers and dont say because he has a mining mod fit cause then youve clearly not seen or heard of the many wonderful when miners fight back incidents in eve
pretty simple a miner doesnt pull aggression then swap ships usually goes the other way around thus the orca wont have an aggression timer in that situation
that would create an invisible aggression exploitfeature using ship maintenance bay and fitting service thoughnow i agree the orca switcheroo is kinda lame as is the neutral logistics and pretty much everything that concerns hisec pvp but its not worth opening that can of worms for it
puts a hell of a damper on using ecm or combat drones with your barge or ecm mods if a mining bs is being used for defence or to break target lock to jump awayive killed attacking frigates dessies and even really dumb cruiser pilots with my miners combat drones and often carry ecm drones to break lock i dont just sit there and get gankedalso i still say its bloody unfortunate for the unwitting orca pilot who has some dumb or malicious corpmate aggro another player and then dockreally i dont think yours is a winning idea but i agree it would be nice to make it a tad tougher for orcas to be used as get out of jail for free cards im just not sure how youd go about it without breaking the game for others as i point out above
just add a straight aggro timer to shipchange like we already have for docking and jumping 30s45s would be more than enough to make the trick much harder to use still viable against utter morons though refitting need not be impacted at allno need to change anything else really
yeah and the issue is being discussed dont let obvious smack you in the face you apparently cant recognize it
cause i dont need to 
this is why the docking transfers agro is problematic denying use of the array while the player is red boxed is the most clean solution
heh i kinda suspected you were a troll when i couldnt find any killmail of the incidentgood amount of bites though well played sir
why would you have to worry about using ecmdronesetc if the purpose is to break the lock so you can warp if you can warp and have to use an orca to switch ships out youd be doing that in a safe location where the orca will remain safe like in a pos shield if youve just beaten off an attacker with drones why would you be switching out ships besides orcas usually arent just left sitting somewhere afk that isnt safe also the orca has to actually be in fleet with the hangar access set for someone to interface with it in a way that could pass aggro
which is exactly the problem invisible aggro transfer since the orca hangars are just regular hangar arrays that would apply to all ships with these facilitiesbad idea way too much griefing potential for hisec and way too exploitable for lownull as well
1as long as a signature is within its lifetime it should have the same signature name without beeing bookmarked or needing any other kind of additional work to verify it at any later momenti would go further if a signature is probed out closer lets sa
i do think the current agressiongcc mechanics are a bit messed up nothing seems consistantone is ninja looters im all fine with people doing that but if they get aggressiongcc then like on other occasions they should not be able to dock or jump into an orcaif they loot you stuff outside a station they dock or they go change to a pvp ship in a orca next to them and instadock annoying as hell and you cant even kill themthis is loot we are talking about not wreckswhy implement a aggressongcc when they can easily avoid itat least give them aggression and docking timer so we can shoot them being allowed to insta dock is stupid
please read up on the various aggression timers and then repost your thread gcc is not what you seem to think it is
thats the whole point of the post
gcc means concord will shoot in high sec and shows as a red counter aggression means another player can shoot in high sec and shows as a yellow counter any aggressive act prevents docking or jumping for 30 seconds how is this complicated
looting does not give a gcc flag
looting aggro  gcc if they loot your stuff  only you and your corp can shoot them gcc means they are red to everyonelooting is really not that big a dea that you should be prevented from docking
ok updated i meant anyone with gcc or aggression should get docking timer
did ccp forget to finish these offfor a npc region this severely lacks stations and what is there are pretty much next to each thus giving controlling station huggers more controladd more stations all over venal and great wildlands please just like all other npc regions then more people can go and live there and have more pew pew to surrounding sov alliances
this is a key feature of these regions it allows for the region to be split into multiple factionsholdings instead of station games like in syndicate and should not be change imo
except that gw has some bottle necks that force you certain areas and the fact its all npc means you cant claim sov to put up a jb to avoid the bottle necks or get to the stationless pockets easily
could work as wellscanning in itself is ok as long as its something you try to find off grid stations gates etcbut as soon as scanning moves to the mentioned areas it just gets to easyhit scan wait 5 sec warp to 0km
seems hardly any of the s besides the be guys understand the way they fightyou nubheads need to remember that be always fight outnumbered stop thinking they are a blob just like most of you moronsand like be said  their snipers are tackable even before they come out of warp took me no longer than 8 seconds to get on oneso yeahplus one to support the awesome pvp be has brought for multiple yearsgood tactics skilled pilots and nice change to the blobs you nubcakes all loveccp fix the thing your quest for rl isk has put you on track with what the whiners want so that you forgot about a corp that made eve
bump
i think one major thing is missing in the npe timers dockinggcc aggressioni recently ran through the npe with a new player and within a day the confusion of the different timers and more importantly the noobgank cans inevitably cropped up the npe should have a section explaining these different timers and the player interactions surrounding them if for no other reason than the noob rage a lack of understanding about these mechanics can cause
not supporting until ccp fixes the damn timers in the first placeim fed up with the denial and refusal to acknowledge they have a invisible aggression counter
honestly i think that if more new players knew what was going on theyd be able to identify the hidden timer instances been there been impacted by those but it is rare for me being the brighteyed bushy tailed noobs that they are there would likely be a flood of bug report info that could eventually bring about a fix where as bittervetjadedplayers like myself dont even bother to send in a bug report unless we see it multiple times in a row and can assemble overwhelming evidence to convince the person who opens the report to not cannot reproduce it into oblivion
you cant reproduce what you cant seeill support it on principle but my reservations remain the sameps its happened to me twice
its because not even ccp knows what all those timers arebasically expect that you have some surprise timer for everythingin dark dark mmorpg like eve it makes sense that noobs die because someone touched the can they just threw out of airlock wait

theres a thought that occurred to me for the detractors who claim its not worth ccps effort its no more wasteful than a store that sells useless avatar items for the equivalent of 3060 dollars a piece and you might even get people who pay for this sort of thing regularly to cut down on their 5 accountsanyway thanks for the defense i wish these suggestions would attract more attention though
makes it easier to train up 3 cyno alts on one account as you can just toss a few extra plex at the account and train them simultaneously rather than one at a time
i think this would be a nice feature honestly i have two accounts will not be paying for a 3rd and dont really care to manage another account onagainoffagain using plex but i would buy plex ingame semiregularly to train a second char on both of these accounts it would allow us to buy and apply them when we want to train the second and let them sit otherwiseive always thought those two character slots were a waste unless you were a trader having them camp an exchange somewhere remotely just to check prices or gathering intel in hisec when you are wardeced it would be nice to make them more usefuli do however think there are higher priority issues ingame that should be addressed if this is a major rework
this as well as making lowsec pvp a more viable choice for beginners andor solo players as they can train up a character for logistics purpose without hurting their pvp trainingthese chars typically stop training rather quick in their career and are a waste to have on a separate account
i would love to have corp logos on shipseven more so than an alliance logoif alliance logos are requested make them cost aurum when alliances apply for a logo let that ofset development costs on adding a logo to ships
makes sense to have corp logos as priority since a lot of alliances dont even have logosalliances paying aur not so sure but then again why not make it something like 35k aur thats still only 34bill isk and peanuts but would remove a few plex from market
i want my corp logos alliance be damned where do i pick them upsigned
super carriers onlinetheres a message in there somewherejust saying
original content in the op just sayingalso more originality with inb4lock
ws hoping you would get the subliminal message and you would offer some constructive information on how we can resolve this issue i guess it only works on intelligent people
you must be under the misapprehension that super carriers online was original in some way and that by using this highly original sarcasm it would illicit great debate on the sc proliferation we have at presentcheck you out
i believe this should rank higher than new shipswith the exception of the noob shipstrails will also make the noob ships seam more exciting

i know people who blow money playing with the market for fun
ccp talked about removing abc arkonor bistot and crokite mining sites from wormhole space at some point in the future this may be from all wormholes or possibly from lower class wormholes only it was claimed by some members of the csm that a large fraction of the high end ore supply is produced through these sites however the csms who were active in the wormholes would not accept this claim without hard data to back it upand then again on page 29 paragraphs 3 and 4based on comments by ccp greyscale in a previous session the subject of removing abc minerals from wormholes was raised by nullsecresident csms who were surprised to learn that wh space was nullsec and that abc minerals were available in them they favored entirely removing abc from wh space  or limiting them to c5 and c6 holes  but the two wormholeresident csms objected strongly pointing out that exporting minerals from deep wormhole space was difficult and much of it was likely consumed locallyan argument was made by some csms that the prices of abc ores and refined products were being crashed by daytrippers mining in easilyaccessible wormhole space other csms stated that no nerfing of abc minerals should take place without first obtaining detailed statistics about the balance of trade for each mineral and class of wormholeand once more on page 31 the last paragraphthe csm with the exception of two members is irked at the idea of high value ores being mined in lowend wormholes distorting the market ccp zulu mentioned that he considers this ed and that this will be looked into in class 5 or 6 wormholes the position is more nuanced and the csm acknowledged that these minerals could be used for local production and that they are too far from the market to distort iti think my only real response to this is wtf seriously although its comforting to see the nullsec csm members who are apparently completely ignorant of whs are actively trying to ensure no lowly nonnull sec residents cut in on their profit margins
it takes time to carefully censor the secret nda covered stuff and then spin the rest so it sounds ok even calming aint that what csm are trying to tell us mmhm
i agree with this cccpsoe are going this way if we like it or not its their game so be itbut ppls are blind if they think aurum wont be game changing think about dust514 i read somewhere that aurum will be used in this part of eve how can that be nongame changing to level this out at the least cccpsoe should make sure that pidust514 items in store should be affordable by all lower the aurum prices and make them microtransactions btw cccpsoe how much more money you need to repay the loan
csm minutesi clearly missed something anyone have a link to more info on this
i believe they are referring to this winters expansion no blogs have been given for it yet
it seems so it just seemed like a weird way to announce what was coming in the winter expansion as sort of a side note in the minutes of a meeting especially considering how much players have been clamored for it
ccp even manages to break the fibonacci sequence
i think they talked about it in the last alliance tourney day four on youtube
they are also killing local chat p 6 holy these meeting minutes look like they are just filled with everything the players have been demanding and more well except pos changes
everything here usually flows in the hereswhatithinkcsmshoulddoforme direction after reading all the minutes i think that eve is generally moving in a direction i like so how can i help you csmim a carebear mission runner though i dabble in fw once a year or so and occasionally join lowsec or null corps for a change i play 1020 hours a week that i admit to i run a single character on a single clientwhat can i do to help you out csm
thanks
i personally get more and more the feeling the csm doesnt do what it is meant to dothey are representatives of and by the playerbase but i dont really see that happening anymorearnar made a slipup in the video where he clearly said that ccp has no intentions of bringing in anything else than vanity goods into eve todaybut what about tomorrow or next weeki still havent seen a ferm no to gold ammo or other stuffalso i dont see clearly stipulated what is considered gamebreaking playerbase vieuw will differ on that with ccps vieuwour csm got steamrolled by ccp and the big bad goon lawyer is exactly the same type of guy as those who dont  cant communicate with the playerbaseits all easy said they had heated discussions but were they discussions about players concerns or about what to order at the nordicathis whole vague crap which to contribute to the nda is nothing more than that crapnow they have to brush and polish the minutes till it completely fits into the same line of all the other nonsaying bullcrap they used over the course of timenot one of those people dares to speak open and clearly and it only shows one thing we are being misrepresented and we are being held on the short end of a long sticki am disappointed by the csm which has subcome to just another marketing tool for ccp and i am disappointed by ccp by more and more turning the ea routecsm delegates which said they would show how to rattle a cage only rattle the player cages for ccp now
the fact that the notes are not available yet is not the fault of the csm they are waiting on ccp to reacti think we should praise the csm for the work they did already dont blame them for stuff that is not their falut
who knows what happens 34 years hence it could be that ccp makes a deal with some online company where we can transfer isk back into the real world in the form of store credit or something market is still very young when it comes to the whole virtual currency thingcommon sense apply it something that is on par or beyond something attainable only through oodles of effort would be gamebreaking for instanceas the ncgoon voting bloc was ever so happy to point out democracy in action you get what you deserve no point in moaning about it after the fact  at least we got a few decent people in there and they seem to be rubbing off on the bloc or maybe its because they lost ingame influence and can devote more time to csm matters you have both a wrong idea of what the csm is and what the weekoftheemo was all about figure those out and youll see that at least half you paranoia is unfoundedps may minutes appear to have been posted available in left side
and if you shift  through enough siffs at the end you get clear water
after reading through everything i would like to suggest to csm the following1 publish the edited minutes as normal2 publish an unedited audiovideotranscripts3 publish additional relevant notesi believe that all of the above should be done for all future csm meetings to assist the general populous and dedicated eve players into better understanding the outcome of the meeting to the last dirty gritty raw and unedited truthi know it sounds unorthodox but its the only way to satisfy both the general eve community and those dedicated to the csmccppublic cluster
yes exactlywhat happened to the post of the long list of items the player base already voted on to be fixed from the last csm
ability to strip racks on shipsplease add this to your list  i imagine its along the lines of that little things thread and team i cant imagine this taking hardly any time since the functionality already exists in the game
i would call hg clones vanity quite a few people undock with them regularly you speak of terms of convenience with having to remove things but i have to wait 24 hours between switching out of my various clones into something more suitable for varied situations what exactly is the point of such an isk sink when you violate mechanics and allow for the purchase to be permanent
if they make them destructible and lower the prices they lose moneyat the current prices everybody can buy them as theres no risk if they cut the prices to lets say 10  and make them destructible all people who live in empire will spend a lot less money on this stuff and wont have to replace it anyway because they dont lose podsid like to have it cheaper and destructible and id probably buy it in this case myself but its not going to happen if it lowers ccps incomeand from an rp standpoint its more resonable to pay like a half a billion for a lifelong licence for a shirt as capsuleers will live forever than paying 50 million for a single shirt
2 wordsdecay
and if they were destructible would all you whiners be complaining that it is a conspiracy to get more money because people have to buy more of themgod it is like you people complain just to complain i hope you all quit over the monocles and things you dont have to be involved in but get upset when others have it it is as dumb as fighting in kindergarten over a crayon seriously start clarifying your opinions and stop blindly hating on everyone and everything that disagrees with youalso be grateful that we even have csms and people with a voice outside of the development team not to mention they come here and talk with us on their time unless i am mistaken they get no pay or special service to do what they do show a little gratitude respect or at least enough dignity to address them like you would a stranger in publicunless of course you act this way at the supermarket work or perhaps you are some immature kid either way grow up or people will start ignoring you
must find pencilas far as ship paint jobs is concerned it probably does apply in some fashion who would undock for pvp in a ship with even a 5 paint job knowing that they might lose it in the first few seconds either paint jobs on ships are dirt cheap a few cents a ship 25 is probably too much in the long run or theyll wind up being indestructible for the same reason
i have perfect clarity in the question im asking every other item in the game is transportabledestructable and must be transported via a ship many items in eve cost alot more than a monocle you can purchase any item from the nex store with in game isk by first purchasing a plex and converting to aurum nex items can be equipped to your avatar then magically disappear as you are naked in your pod as has been said by many and when you redock you are reclothed again your items are on you you do not have a license to wear the clothes and get them provided to you at each and every station or at least ccp have never said that or there is no evidence to support your items are not destroyed if your ship is destroyed and you are wearing them so they must be in your pod ok so if you get podded the items never drop and you get a brand new set every single time i am not a role player but i like a consistent game and how does that make any sense in the current context of the game at all i dont care about mt or the price but when it starts ing with the core parts of the game like making things magically transport across the galaxy and making them indestructible well isnt the risk of things dying in eve kind of the point
apparently the monocles and all other items are destructible when in your ships hold but not when they are on your faceso ccpcsms assertion that people will feel fully robbed is looking like hollow nonsense to cover up that they technically dont want to rerender a persons face when they get pod killedid wait for an answer but why get excited over more truthlessness from ccpcsm
apart from the other drivel i gotta agree on thisthe pricing for nex items is pretty insane it creates this disconnect where youre scratching your head thinking okay now why would i pay multiple battleships worth of isk for a pair of pixel shoestheyd have to cut the price tenfold for this to make sense and i think nex would work better that way as i believe people would be a hell of a lot more eager to buy some of the stuff if an item would cost like a dollar max
the high price was a great move by ccpmost mt in game store have a couple of very high price vanity items that only a few will every buyright now ccp will be watching the sales of the space pirate eye patch and as long they are selling the price will remain the same at some point the sales will drop off because everybody who is prepared to pay that amount would of brought oneat this point you most likely see the price for the pirate eye patch drop and a new expensive item appear and so on and so forthas for the whole they should be destructible unless the items only cost pence they will not sell most people will not buy vanity items that they can lose because somebody decides they does not like the colour of their pants and ganks them the biggest mistake ccp made was when they introduced the store they only had a few items they should of had at least 20  30 low priced items with the launch
i disagree why  because you are forgetting to factor in all the people who may now buy said items because they wont cost silly money
came in expecting mittens to be telling peopel to f off left disapointed
someone needs to ask the csm how they can be stupid enough to think the trace amounts of minerals wormholes produce compared to the botfleets of null warrant removing abc ores from wormholes daytrippers bull they come into an occupied hole they leave in a pod if theyre lucky they come into an unoccupied hole and odds are the sleeper rats will run most of them off with only an 18 to 24 hour window into a hole theyre not going to put a dent in anything hole residents please with the occasional site we get we mine what we need and tend to use most of it were not competing with your nullbotswhat they need to do is push to add moongoo to wormholes let that shake things up a bit
nondestructible items break the rp immersion aspect of the game periodhowever try this on for size the nex store vanity items are not indestructiblethis issue might be resolvable by some new descriptive text about just what it is youre buying in the nex store youre not really buying a single physical item but rather a lifetime service or subscription for an item of that type and when youre podded they supply you with a new one wherever needed every time needed with no questions asked they could even spin that as an explanation for why the items cost so much since a capsuleers lifetime is unbounded and the prepaid item replacement and delivery charges could be quite extensive over time
id be glad if you stopped taking position for all of us players you are just one player and although entitled to your own opinion you should not assume you speak for all of uswhether i agree with your opinion or not it is just not your place to speak for me or anyone else the only ones who might try to do so are the csm simply because they are a democratically voted bunch  you however are not
using ccp logic i would think that destructible clothes would force players to buy same clothes quickly again netting ccp more money maybe up the price to 1000 while were at itoh wait people buy these thingstechnically it doesnt since you can manufacture clothes anywhere
ill help the csm out herethe answer to all of your questions ismoney
my question was what total assets would kirkland langue freely give to me
if you are naked in your pod then your clothes and monocles stay in the station you buy them in do you have buy more clothes in each station then
csms are a complete waste of time i support the complete vote of no confidence of these people
i support 24 remaps per year either given for free as a shortened counter or as a plex or aur amount of plex for counter reset optionit would consume plexes would not be overly advantageous while still being usefuledit to activate ze thumbs up assuming above limitations are used
yes even a limit of 2 neural remaps per year would probably do it for most folks i will add the ceiling to the original proposal
a plex is one month a plex should therefore cut a single month off of your timer thats it i would support the proposal with this little changeif you complain that it would cost too much htfu and find ways to get rich
math not your strong suit is it  a neural remap doesnt make you train from 0 training speed to 100 as you seem to suggest rather absolute worst case scenario youd be training at 2700 sph from 1800 sph or something extremely similarly lowim sure ccp can come up with some sort of price thats reasonable thats details though
you speak of math and then go on to say a 50 increase is extremely similarly low well done and this is for all intents and purposes buying sp not receiving it on the spot doesnt make a difference its now given to you during the x extra months that you gained from the remapedit incase of severe  not supported
i gave training at 1800 sph as an example of training extremly slowlyand his math is still way off by 50 to be precise  because what you win is only a 50 increase instead of training time for a whole month and that is in the absolute worst case scenario of needing to remap to your now lowest attributes and you dont always need that of course for example im currenty training percwill at 2700 sph i have a 225 days willperc plan that i would be training at 2520 sph not horrible per se id still pay to get that done more efficientlyalso increase in training speed is an awkward term because remap for plex does not speed up training beyond what the current game mechanics allow youd still be training at 2700 sph  the games max the only difference being that you can remap once or twice more a year
sorry will not happen there was already a huge community outrage over this and was brought to a hault
until ccp zulu recently brought it up again 
supported with reservations remaps should be more frequent than once a year but id prefer that this be done by reducing the cooldown under no circumstances should the cooldown be less than 3 months i think it should be 4 months or 6 months
jesus in christ no matter how much youre given you always want moretheyve already given you remaps and removed learning skills and now you want more remaps reallywhy not just ask to have all stats pegged at 30 hell why even stop there
no thankyou was a big no thankyou then still a big no thankyou now will always be you guessed it a big no thankyou
hello so after reading the minutes from the csm meeting it seems ccp is actually going to commit some resources to ship iteration this is great i have decided to take up ship iteration and pvp mechanics in eve as a short writing project all thoughts will be posted on my blog and i will update this post as more ideas are releasedpart 1 overall mecahnics changes hopefully this is more productive then writing walls of text in this thread mj
1 no one understands those hieriglyphs there 2 i think most of ppl agree with heavy neut to some degree3 drones bad ideas except that most of combat drones are useless and only few are viable to use outside level 4 missions 4 ecm like most of ppl you end up crying ecm just cos you dont know their weaknesses or how to counter them and which ships to use dont expect to fight everything with minmatar which has bad ecm resistance i surely agree that if you get something at the belt with falcon support youre pretty op but how did he end up at the belt at first place is his fault
i think that ive had many a cat and mouse game with gate camps and locals in my stealth bomber etc i dont recall ever being laughed at and while i was sometimes able to catch the unprepared pveers i also engaged pvp targets of opportunity who were trying to find me and my mates camp the gatestationwhatever in question etcso again i suggest youre unfamiliar with the fun and damage can someone say bomb d  a group of cloaked pvpers can havenot to mention the many times a black ops crew have snuck a fleet behind the lines what was that well reported engagement in providence i think where an alliance snuck a fleet of mostly stealth bombers to a mining op that was betrayed by some of the miners and took out a rorqual that was very funny who was that gah  memory failing
right back at you have you ever been in a organized wh crew sure as hell does not sound like it a t3 gang poses no significant threat that is just so wrong on so many levelsyou try to keep your home system reasonably safe but you can never ever be 100 sure 2 seconds after scanning a new wh may pop into your system and suddenly you have that insignificant t3 gang threat decloaking right next to you so that they can proceed to give you a nice suprice buttsex sessioni told one of the new guys is that if he manages to survive the initial period of wh life which is kind of a huge change to someone used to 00 he will most likely never go back to kspace and he will start to frown on all the sniveling 00 people that scatter like vermin to a light as soon as you enter their system 00 people must be the safest people in the game yet they are probably the ones that are the most scared as wellyou 00 people have your infailable local intel channel and since you do you know stuff you really should not know and that makes you scared the simple fact is local turns boys into crybabybears this thread is the perfect example of that fact
oh you are suddenly speaking of ships designed with cloaking in mind well guess wherewhen my laughed at comment was made  let me quote you for ease of referencehad tons of fun with lots of cloaking bcbs lately then did the people who slaughtered you commend you on your inspired fitting choices or did they laugh at you as if you just wet yourself in public

would it suprise you greatly if i said that i would like black ops cynos to work in whsto me that would be very cool indeed00 is supposed to be unsafe yet it is the most safe place in eve and from reading what you really write the big problem is not the cloaky ship but the ability of said ships to put up a cyno so the thing you really should be talking about is to nerf cynospersonally i would like to change the way cloaks work entirely from the prototype cloak that should just remove you from overview but leave you fully visible in space and directional to the improved cloak that removes overview and directional and adds a blurring effect making you hard to see if you are stationary in space and finally the covert ops cloak that should remove you from the above and local as well as making you totally invisible while stationary and only very slightly visible while moving
easily bypassed as has been said numerous times beforeiUFFFDm not realy sure if i understood this right but if i am then the question of that action ist how much efford neds that mechanic near zero will everyone who uses the afkcloacktactic bypass it guess notso will it minimize some problems a bit guess yesjust a first step but if there were bypass arguments that often the request for that mechanic seems a minimum that oftenmaybe the first topic in that direction should just be the topic support autologout and if the problem is still that present some additional ways can be looked forand there are always some other reasons wich can be solved by an autologout i guess again
would be cool but it would skew the power ratio so much in favour of an attacker that no one will ever put down roots in wormswould be similar to removing cyno jammers from game it will quickly degenerate into hotdropoclock 237 with no thought or reason other than just because any sort of permanent residence would be made impossible to maintain for any period of time
yeah that sounds horrible one of the great advantages of wh space is that force projection is much harder another is that scouting is a difficult profession requiring effort and skill with blackops cynos in wh space any engagement could end up with an unscoutable gank squad being hotdropped on top of you
youre really not very bright or experienced in eve are youok lets talk bcs and bses i like the drake myself with its handy free eighth high slow to fit a cloak in its very handy for slipping past gate camps using the old trick of pulsing ones mwd cloak then uncloak and straight to warp once the mwd finishes its cycle or youre out of the warp disruption fieldagain i dont remember being laughed at for slipping a gang of larger subcaps through a camp and on to an attack in fact id say it was more tears like yours on the other side when we were successfulor maybe you want an example of cloaks used directly in combat or as direct as you can given you cant exactly fire cloaked heh not just to get the ships thereok  more than once ive lain in wait using a regular cloak either solo or as a small group for a victim to pass by if theyre sloppy or simply not aware your character is a threat it helps to make sure youre not a red this works well they get close you decloak and spring the trapunless youre going to cry thats more unfair play d then theres your use of regular cloaking in combatits also been handy to use a ship with a regular cloak as a spy already in place when they dont have to warp somewhere else cloaked andor you expect them to die a t1 ship with a regular cloak costs a lot less than a t2 covert ops shipoh and though it only works the once there was also the time we warped in a small missile sniping fleet and a group of heavy tackle drakes a couple hundred km off a gate camp the drakes immediately cloaked the sniping bses started attacking not being the best and brightest eve has to offer the campers turned on their mwds and powered towards us either unaware there had briefly been a lot more ships on their overview or that local showed more of us or perhaps just not caring  as i said  not the best and brightestthe snipers pulsed mwds cloaked and scattered making them hard to bump into then our second group of heavy assault drakes decloaked and tackled the incoming campers as they reached our snipe spot panic ensured and the snipers decloaked again and rejoined the attack unleashing their drones as well at that point our drakes with their huge tank were targeted and not our paper tank dps fit bses the campers were slow to switch targets back and we annihilated them before they could take out any of our bses one of our drakes did bite the dust iirc and that dear fool is just some of the fun that can be had with noncovert ops cloaked subcaps

come on guys dont tell me that the thread in the general discussion was just talk i know a lot of you want snowballs
heres an actual micro transaction thats not going to screw up plexes if thats what you are honestly worried about
choice is always good moar fonts please
you still blow up their ship possibly catch the pod unless they convo you and cry about lost implants you dont know that you got anything else that is unless you always imagine that youre podding people with a full rack of 5s everytimeyou seem to like pvp why dont you want moar
only if you made it a module for the supercarrier and for the minefield to stay the supercarrier has to be on grid with it outside of pos shields
no 00 needs to get away from supercaps just make it a new sub cap ship the mine layer its the only one that can deploy or use mine launchers only way to make sure they arent abused or broken
for the love of all that is holy yes
tldr supercapitals require a power core to function power cores are indestructable and strictly limited to provide exclusivity supercapitals are still built like normal but come with no pg and no drone bandwidth they get their pg and drone bandwidth back when they find and install a power core when a supercapital is destroyed the core survives and remain on the battlefield to be picked up and used by a new supercapital shippreamblewhen ccp created titans they imagined a select few being built and operated during the entire life of eve online their stats were designed with this in mind this is not true today as a result titans constantly need rebalancingthe same can be said about mothershipssuper carriers while probably not intended to be as rare as titans they were still supposed to be a lot rarer than they are todaysuggested fix  power coresimagine that all supercapitals would need a special power core to functionwhen the ship is destroyed the power core is preserved and stays on the battlefield the core can then be incorporated in another capital ship as follows1 supercapital ship gets destroyed2 power core survives and ends up on the battlefield3 the core is too large to be moved in any way and will stay where the original ship exploded the powerful core will immediately show up on the star map for everyone to see and warp to4 a nymph supercapital jumps in5 during a lengthy operation 3060 minutes the power core is loaded into the new ship6 a new supercapital is activated and ready to fight what is a nymph supercap see next headlinenymph supercapitalsfor this suggestion to work there must be a way to load the core into a new supercap but the core can not be allowed to be picked up and moved as it might be forgotten or hidden away in some inventory for a long time therefore the supercap that intend to use the new core must first exist be buildable and must be able to jump to the core by its ownhowever this capital can not be allowed to be of any use what so ever or the core wouldnt be needed enter nymph supercaps this is a supercap that is built just like today using the same materials with normal stats except for powergrid and drone bandwidth that is zero this makes the supercap entirely defenseless with no tank and no offensive capabilites its the precursor to a fully grown supercap and once the power core is loaded it will be given its intended powergrid and drone bandwidthloregiven the very limited number of titan power cores say we want to perhaps limit them to 10 in the game significan lore can be built around them let each core have a name and certain bonuses that way the titan loading the core will inherent the bonuses and all titans will be personalities with stats depending on which of the 10 cores they happen to pick upexample of different cores and possible bonusesthe divine spear  halved reload time for super weaponsthe reaper  100 bonus damage to normal weaponsthe life giver  25 bonus to all shield and armor resiststhe commander  50 bonus to fleet support modulesthe wings of eden  doubled jump rangeand so on five morelet the core description then update each time its host ship is destroyed to include it in a list of previous ownersto be continued in next post
continued from prevous posthow to migrate from old titans to new titansthere are essentially two ways to migrate eve from the old supercapital system to this new supercapital system the nice and slow way or the hard and fast way nice and slow  immediately make all newly constructed supercaps into the new nymph type supercaps this will make them essentially useless and the old ships have to be used as they get killed off one by one eventually there will be only a few left when there are only ten titans left and one gets killed it will for the first time drop one of the cores and the cycle can begin hard and fast  immediately make all supercaps into nymph type supercaps then randomly seed one power core per week in random spots in nullsec and let the festivities commenceadvantages with this idea supercaps in general and titans in particular will once again be something special highly limited something only a select few has possession of something worth more than their cost in minerals an awsome force on the battlefield making any battle they show up in noteworthy supercaps get easier to balance towards the rest of the game essentially they dont need to be balanced anymore due to their extreme rareness fantastic incentive for impromptu battles whenever a supercap is lost both teams will do their very best to manouver in a new supercap of their own to steal the dropped core but at the same time must defend the defenseless ship while it loads the core not to mention that the core can be located by other interested parties at the same time self destruction of supercaps to save face is not as attractive anymore losing a core like that essentially means you give the opposition a new supercapital more often than not a supercap lost in battle will essentially feed the enemy a new supercap therefore needlessly dangerous manouvers with the ships will be limited whenever they are used it will be with full realization of what is risked they will come with proper support and not just hotdrop people for the lulz and an alliance that happen to end up with a lot of supercapitals can either use them and eventually hand them over to the enemies when they are destroyed or not use them making the board balanced either way no active titan will be the same as any other active titan even if they use the same hull because their power core will give them personalities those interested can keep track on which titan currently has which bonus stats but for those that dont keep track of it every titan encounter will give unexpected results alliances will be known by what titan they own and which bonuses and capabilities it has ccp can easily adjust the number of supercaps in the game with this mechanic turns out there are too many make some cores be permanently destroyed when their host ship explodes too few spawn a few at random spots in nullsec
nooo i want my titan i am running out of useful skills to train
so essentially you say that the whole nullsec gameplay should stay messed up just because you want a titan
c p
one alliance wins battles over and over  gradually takes over all cores because if they won the battle they probably hold superiority on the field to take the core1 or 2 things happensyou hope  people will use their caps to fight despite chance of losing the corewhat will actually happen  just like moms the caps will hole up and on very rare occasions actually come out at least with supercarriers we see tons of huge ships out and about and unbalanced yesthe idea is neat but i dont think its going to fly
i would love to see a spell check for the chat windows for those of us who are less than stellar at it there is nothing worse that looking stupid because you cant spell i prefer to do that my through my topics of conversation
i would prefer no cloaking device for capital ships at allif you want a damn roleplay excuse its easy the cloak just isnt powerful enough to hide whole signature caused by its combat systems and size
is it brave to hide until you can run if youre a super pilot you should be up to the task if youre jumping in with it man up1 supported

wrong thread my dear this one specifically targeted at making supers vulnerable when used without proper planning just like all other ships are
yeah and in what universe is nerfing all regular cloaks not affecting everyone else using a cloak
in the universe where all other ships regenerate almost all cap while in basic warp in between cloaksthe only case where it might have a negative effect is when activated immediately after a prolonged mwd burn  even the gay mwdcloak trick is unaffected by this
allowing nullsec to become more industrially selfsufficient will kill t1 manufacture in hisec depriving new players of the avenue of deriving income from industry this will increase the dependence on missionrunning or ratting as an income stream  especially if ccp ends up entirely removing ice from hisecto solve the problem of hauling materials from jita to nullsec either provide the security required to mine veldspar in nullsec superveldspar is the wrong way to handle the problem or provide the security required to carry bulk materials from hisec to nullsec the fact of the matter is that there is no economic incentive to mine veldspar in nullsec due to the sheer volume of tritanium that needs to be moved aroundone option is to increase the availability of highgrade refineries in nullsec  perhaps a nullsec or sovonly refinery module for poses that will have higher refining efficiency perhaps an ihub upgrade that will provide higher refining efficiency perhaps consider allowing character skills and implants to have an effect on pos refineriesin the real world we offshore a lot of production to eastern europe or china because that is where the cheap labour is found in eve we do the same thing  the cheap labour is hisec where people can mine veldspar with no fear of losing their 150m isk hulk or 500m isk orca they just sip wine and talk nonsense with their friends while enjoying the relaxing passtime of mininglabour in nullsec is more expensive because the players need to provide their own security sipping wine and talking nonsense while not paying attention to intel channels costs ships thus it makes absolutely no sense to expect that there be some means of making nullsec selfsufficient in terms of miningas for markets  to spread markets out you dont kill them what needs to be done is to look at what makes jita so big and powerful the network effect everyone goes to jita 44 because everyone goes to jita 44now look at the real world what happens when everyone goes to london thats right london gets congested the roads can only carry so many cars there are physical limits on storage capacity there are physical limits on the tonnage that can enter and leave the city during any period of timelook at any cargo or bulk harbour ships are marshalled in and out berths are allocated berthing fees are paid transfers take time you cant load more ore into ships than you can hold in your holding yardsso rather than magically teleporting products to nullsec simply enforce the logical limits of trade this isnt commerce  we arent dealing with orders for materials we are dealing with bulk transportstations should have limits to the number and tonnage of ships enteringexiting stations should have limits to goods storedthen there are the star gates look at any bridge there is a limit to how much traffic can cross it the same should apply to stargates the relevant authority should be able to upgrade the gate eg anchoring something like an sbu to increase or decrease the capacity of the gatewith more logistics pressure the market will become more dynamic with more to think about than simply lowest sell price in jitathe current nullsec mindset of many csm candidates is dangerously skewing the views of of the csm as a whole there is more to eve than nullsec
the danger of the superveldspar mindset is that they feel the economics of supply can be answered by overabundance what will happen if superveldspar is introduced is that veldspar and tritanium will become even less valuable and thus even less attractive to everyone at worst superveldspar will become the only economically viable source of tritanium killing hisec mining at best superveldspar will not be worth mining and the status quo remainsthere are copious quantities of veldspar in nullec the problem with mining it being not just the yield but the sheer volume of tritanium required to build anything the issue is not hauling veldspar the issue is hauling tritanium even hauler spawns end up being ignored because noone wants to haul 40k m3 of tritanium from a belt when there are reds three systems overother than increasing system security or enhancing logistics security one game design approach would be to reduce the quantities of tritanium required for everything reduce the volume of tritanium itself provide better mineral compression or severely reduce the volumes of veldspar available everywheresuperveldspar is not a solution to any problem the nullsec csm seems entirely too focussed on what they want for building their war machines and unaware of the ramifications of their desired game changes on the future of the rest of the game
discussion of limiting ingressegresstonnage in stations has been discussed before apparently the ability of an airforce to simultaneously launch 30 fighter jets from a controlled runway is supposed to reflect on the ability to dock supertankers at petroleum facilities fighters in formation are a different beast entirely to supertankers bulk haulers and container shipsplacing limitations on the number of ships entering a station per minute ie enforcing minimum delays between ships entering will go a long way to breaking jita 44 into multiple smaller marketsfurther expanding the simple secondspership delay to stargates will encourage pilots to become more careful about planning and scouting allowing local authorities nullsec sov holders faction militia to modify stargates will provide for better logistics routes along with providing more targets for military action eg hacking gate boosters to temporarily disable them thus allowing your invasion fleet or blocking the other guys freighter convoy
t1 production is already dead because of missions and overproductiont1 modules overall are very expensive in null sec generally people in null sec tend to manufacture high end products like titans and super caps the minerals are not shipped out in bulk from jita but compressed
there is still profit to be made profits go up considerably when large battles in nullsec end up consuming scores of supercapswhat is the cause of the expense lack of security for mining lack of interest in mining low ends logistics poor quality of pos refineries lack of build slots poor yield of nullsec veldsparwhy arent pilots taking advantage of the opportunity to buy stuff in hisec sell it in nullsecthe issue is still the volume of tritanium required why would you have spreadsheets detailing the best modules to manufacture to provide the mineral compression in the proportions required for the ships you are building if the volume of the minerals themselves wasnt a concernof course the csm dont understand the issues they are nullsec warlords well then there is the chairman who doesnt even play the game or understand wspace the csm didnt understand the impact of ship created from nothing before their logistics guys clued them in the few nullsec industrialists that do exist are burning out because no combat pilot wants to escort freighters jump bridge networks were a pain to maintain and alliance leadership treats them as second rate citizensadding super veldspar is not going to make life easier for nullsec industry removing abc from wspace is not going to help nullsec industry what will help nullsec industry is some of what csm is giving words but no thought to the farms and fields where the focus is on lots of little infrastructure giving industrialists better facilities than are available in hisec each of which is vulnerable to small fleets such a system needs to be thought out and planned carefully which i fear is above the capacity of the current csm
your concern is based on the assumption that changes will be as is just bigger which i sincerely hope will not be the case highsec t1 production has 15 margins at best not a lot of isk made that way that it exists at all is due to surplus slots and minerals t1 modules take up a lot of space and are thus not convenient to haul anywhere least of all null after bridge changes mining is null suffers the same problem that is the cause of the rampant botting  it is boring no amount of super asteroids or security will change thatas for spreading out markets do what is done in the real world when ever loads of money condenses into one area  tax the snot out of itincrease transaction fees based on isk changing hands in any given stationsystem with a discount to corps who managed to snag an office in the relevant station  smaller hubs will grow out from the bigger ones and eventually couple of years probably contract into larger ones so instead of rensjitaamarr we will have 1020 roughly equal hubs
theres a good point about product magically appearing in nullsec logistics and jump routes are just too short which makes hauling require very little effort  no profitand again everyone forgets low sec though its just place you pass while going to null in cloaky hauler or jump freighterself sufficient should mean that its worth of trouble to haul modules and materials there
maraUFFFDs arguments sound like they make sense and for me 1 so farthe question for me here is what exactly is csm planning
simple due to risks of null sec solo or small group industrial work does not exist because it takes so many peopleaccounts to do industry in null there is little reason to produce things with slim margins why would my corp build rifters at a 2 margin when we can build caps at a 20 margin numbers are not exact just for illustration1 the risk of mining low ends are not worth it for small mining groups and thus not seeding into the market as the bigger groups are in industrial corps that use all the minerals miners provide and more2 the low demand for small t1 items in null other than the occasional rifter fleet very few players fly subbc t1 stuff in null most t1 hulls are used for t2faction hull production leading to the next point3 the high demand for things that require hauling from multiple regions to begin with such as t2 and faction production  since you are already spending a lot of time hauling it makes sense to haul the t1 hulls as well4 carrier proliferation the supply of carrierpilots is high so the cost of hauling ships is low5 production efficiency is substantially lower in null sec than high sec due to the base efficiency of outposts and poss
i completely support thisas ceo of an industrial corp i can set access rights for my members so they could use specific pos installations and hangers in specific offices however whatever i do i have to allow them the ability to be able to cancel any job in the si tabmadnessi support the concept of factory manager being exactly that a manager the rent research or rent factory roles allow corp members to install their own corp jobs which they can see or cancel however only managers can see all jobs and deliver andor cancel all jobsat the moment i consider the system broken and unworkable were not the drf building dozens of supercaps but the level of trust required vs the risk exposure means i am very reluctant to allow members the factory manager role due to the potential risk of isk losscsm  please move this up the todo list i would hope its not a major rewrite rather a patch

first off im sure some things of those im about to mention are already planned andor in the making but better give too much feedback than too littleim not a gigantic fan of cq due to the serious limitations it has right now starting with looks environment looks somewhat decent but the characters lighting is a joke ranging to functionality and usability but to keep this topic somewhat focused on one thing ima just concentrate on the viewscreenits a fantastic addition and at this time the only thing making me want to stay in there its the only thing thats not constant in that room and therefore the only thing i watched after having explored the room turned it off for a few weeks and now turned it back onhowever at this point whats on that screen is highly repetitive and not customizable at all in addition most of whats shown neither concerns nor interests me my suggestions areset up a menu where players can choose what they want to seei dont want to see what price badgers sell for i dont wanna see career agents epic arc missions new pilot certifications and i dont wanna see bounty offerswhat i want to see is stuff thats actually happening in game and that either affects me directly or just interests me sov changes news items incursion warnings not because i actually do incursions but because it relates to something thats happening at this moment out there somewhere which makes it infinitely more exciting than other stuffid even go as far as adding options for devblogs patchnotes maybe far reaching admittedly even an interface that lets you fetch rss feeds from the web  im melting just thinking about reading en24 on my cq screenalso market announcements arent bad per se but they should be customizable as well probably only show me things on my market quickbar eglastly players may also be interested in things like nex sales if there is such a thing planned  but always provide the option to not show thesemore detailed reports on the items i choose to seewhen i wanna read news reports and go to cq for it i dont want just a random headline with a link to the webpage i wanna have the article scroll down so i can read it directly on screenfor sov changes some information from the sov screen could be displayed instead of the huge alliance logos which tend to be the standard stars anywaysrestore functionality of the old hangar viewcustomizing the viewscreen to show your current ship possibly including shieldarmorstructure values with buttons for various cargo and drone bays on the ship might help alleviate the sorrow of loosing the old hangar view if i dont want the screen to show me anything but that i should be able to customize it in a way to make it so dont get me wrong the interactible ship model on the table is a nice gesture but giving us back the old hangar view even if just on that screen would be a nicer one maybe even go as far as make the ship spinnable on screen  but thats just me dreaming a bit as for the implementation of those changes an onscreen menu as opposed to a new regular interface window would be truly badass i think the basic infrastructure for this may already largely be in place as the scrolling clickable headline links would work similarly but obviously i dont have deeper insights on how difficult this would be
gladly supported 1ps as for restore functionality of the old hangar view would be nice if it were done the other way around start you with ship spinning hangar and an extra zoom out button which when pressed zooms out the hangar view to your cq with the old hangar view now on your main screen in other words you were basically always looking at the big sreen as it were only zoomed inthat idea is not mine actually but was posted once in general and i cant find it any more i thought it was brilliant though
what do you mean you cant apply a saved fitting
seems simple enough
by saved i meant the fittings carved out to an xml file when they pared the list down to 50if you had your 4 alternative fittings for your myrm and due to this new restriction only kept 1 in your server side fittings you cant select one of those other three alternative fittings and click apply if youre maxed like me youd have to delete or export then delete one of your existing serverside fittings then import the fitting you want to apply by clearing the checkbox of those 75 other fittings socked away in the xml then click applythis is a pita they could have retained the ui for offloaded fittings or at least give us an invert selection option but they didnt for some reason and while i am one of the people who has played my character from more than one physical machine laptop new machine i was never much bothered by having to transfer the xml and get all the settings backwhen i swap guns i usually change out the other slots as well to take advantage of or compensate for the difference in pg and cpu

op updated with similar thread on toggling what racks are stripped  please see op for link
why would i worry about ecm if i want to break a lock huh what are you on about you do know what ecm mods and drones are for right
be sure to return with more posts of how nasty unfair pirates killed your dumb arse over and over d
exactly which is precisely why aggro should not transfer to the orcakeep in mind that an orca used for legitimate purposes pvp is also legitimate but you know what i mean cannot be held responsible for a jerk or noob doing something dumband keep even further in mind that access to the orcas ship maintenance bay is fleetbased thats pretty broad so the orca pilot may just be rendering docking services to people who arent even in his corp it takes only 1 jerk from a different corp for instance to really screw the totally innocent orca pilot over
be sure to let me know when your opinion not only become relevant but are also facts
qq more
this is certainly a problem with transfering the agro to the orca pilot the pilot being attacked also being denied the ability to dockswap is a good comprimise
i dunno i wouldnt mind a few more stations in great wildlandschanged mind support withdrawn holy  reasoned argument actually worked in eve forums 
amount of stations makes regions unique like amount of valued moonsa lot of people hold great value on regions with only few stations because it fits their play style adding more stations would just destroy itwhole 00 is soon going to be full of stations anyway why not have these rare natural parks like gw where pirates can still roam free and you can go hiking there to spot few
charmed by the idea of just stripping 1 rack as proposed elsewhere i realized id also very much like the opposite to not strip a rack when unfitting like my grouped and loaded launchers for instance i may want different mods but still have the same grouped launcher setup i therefore propose the followingadd a  toggle akin to the mini overheaticons next to each rack plus a single one for all when fitting the state of these toggles set to  means you want the rack included in the fit when set to  you want it excluded and vice versa for stripping set to  means you want the rack stripped set to  means you want the rack to stay fitted the way it was
i will link your thread into the op of the original thread on this as i have posted it on sticky as well makes for easier transition for readersability to strip racks on shipsthis is the original thread for your easy navigation 
cool  yeah i just didnt wanna hijack your thread is all
no probs  excellent idea if youre gonna add a feature make sure you get the most out of it
can these be made per ship rather than per account that is alledit  changed granularity of the setting makes sense to me too
plenty of people have spent years in the game before truly understanding session mechanics from stations actions to pvp and fleets yeah its nice to have nubs flying around without a clue but people honestly should know some of the underlying mechanics of their game
i will never forget this transport full of shiny lost due to a mistunderstanding of the timers and i was far from being a noob at this timemore infos is really needed
support
the jukebox on the mac client constantly cuts songs short this issue has been present for years now we have only been told that the issue is being addressed for years now i hate to be accusatory but it seems to me that ccp has deemed it unimportant enough to put fixing it off
its frustrating yes however there are other more important things to fix first i feel
for example
yes ccp needs to learn to fit betterno ccp does not need to let highsec carebears get factionofficer mods off a dead mothership they can go to lowsecnullsec to get them like the rest of us
i can only imagine the craziness if one of those scarriers actually started dropping modules that people normally fit on a scarrierremote ecm burst i  volume 4000 m3 capital shield transporter i  volume 4000 m3let alone fightersbombersetcpeople would be lining up in haulers for incursions instead of actually participating the animosity between the people actually doing the fighting and the ninja looters would abound the tears stemming from properly fitting those ships would be immensely worse than the complaints about how they are currently fitted i and many others would enjoy warping a single disco bs into the fight right at the end to blow everything up for the carebear tears but i know it would be bad for the game
ccp needs to have people who actually play eve on a competitive level if only to advise on fittings to the actorsjust make an exception to loot algorithm for them so everything worth more than a little is destroyed to prevent them becoming cashpinatas
supportin mah space truckin brothers
all good ideas1
quality of life improvements that dont break gameplayincarna almost fell in this category  until it melted a few cards and subscriptions
wait  i dont necessarily want actual turret launchers as op pointed out that many ship skins would be incompatible with those so are you saying ccp isnt developing new missile graphics at all or just not like the turretsi like the new turrets by and large my cyclone feels even sexier with the additional turret embankments but i really want new missiles too  then ill rate incarna a little bettermaybe
the entire crystal ammo system needs a major usability overhaul automatic reloading of a replacement crystal when one breaks would be a welcome change also something in the ui that gives the approximate number of shots left rather than having to manually work out that figure by multiplying the volatility with volatility damage would be very nice any means of seeing the crystals current health from show info would be welcome
im against skills for plex in those ways that often mentioned bevor but the possibility to train the second or the third character on the same account is worth to be supported so farsince it is possible to have multiple accounts it is realy a hard question why i should train an alt on the same account so there has to be a be a benefit and the only benefit would be to gain more trainee time for that second andor third alt for one plex than gametime for an second account why easy becaus i canUFFFDt be online with 2 of that 3 alts at oncewhile a plex gives 30 days gametime for me it would have to give 4560 days trainee time for my other alts on that accountthe priority is more traineetime  not faster trainingso far the benefit for the player is that really money for skillsi guess not i have a benefit but also an massive restriction there came up a question why should ccp do thisfirst an account has three slots why let two of them be unusedwell this is a small point  i see  but secondi belive that some player would use another char on the same account on that conditions even when character transfer of the two other toonslots would be on heavy restrictions or not possiblei would my second account would stay untouched ccp would sell one more plex in 4560 days direct or indirect to me than bevori like this idea so 1

high end ore in wormholes is an issue that is complicated not just by wh class but also by location location is the bigger of the two issues though the spawn rate of grav sites also comes into play the potential issue holes are higher class static highsec with high rates of grav sites spawning it is certainly true that wormholes can produce massive amounts of ore but in most cases the transportation difficulties make it extremely suboptimal to mine all of it as after the 17th time you jump through a connecting wh in a industrial to move ore out to high sec it starts to get old the holes with static highsecs avoid the issue as they can move the ore at any time that they control the wh usuallythe classes of wormholes are already fairly balanced in term of what you can get out of them any real issue that might be there is going to be connected to having a hidden nullsec system in highsec space
i blame drone regions large amount of ore in wh lol they mine it in anomalies like lowsec and even highsec pilots does omg large amounts
are they actually stupid enough to think that the occasional sporadic grav site with limited amounts of nonregenerating abc ores in wormhole space where transport is greatly limited not only by the mass of the ores but the mass of the wormholes themselves is having even the slightest dent in mineral prices you have these nullsec mining bots going nearly 247 out there and they actually think what we get in holes matters in relationfor the most part when we have a grav appear we mine process and use the vast majority of the minerals in the hole itself its not cost effective to be shipping the ores to empire and processing in the hole already has a 25 penalty at the least plus a very limited supply holes can go for weeks without a grav site appearing to mine we also dont have the bonus style asteroids with the bonus mineral amounts in them its plain arkonor bistot etcnow if they gave wormholes moon goo in exchange for reducing the number of gravs that would be interesting considering wormhole is the true null sec youd think those null carebears with their infinite roid belts jump bridges and all that would be happy to straighten their skirts and enjoy the grotesque mining advantages they already have
the more heated the opposition is to removing abcs from the low end whs the more i am for the removal if it was only a rare thing that wasnt aggressively sought out few people shouldn have a problem with them being removed now granted the c5 c6 whs are a whole different animal and they have a right to be angry about the removal of minerals which are a giant pain to obtain otherwise plus those systems are more on par with the risks of null sec mining than other whs
its nonsensegrav sites dont spawn that often nor do most corps haul the ore back to highsec because its a big pain in the arse logisticswisethe exception is offcourse systems with direct highsec or lowsec statics
even more of a laugh was this out the notes the csm brought up superveld and the need for highyield lowend asteroids in nullsec to remove the need to compress and import everything from hisec ccp greyscale was cautiously in favor of this depending upon what the statistics might showis the csm turning into a selfserving bunch of null sec alliance carebears
so you are saying that if people are against its removal you are for it and if people are not against the removal you are still for it um that is kind of the point of living in a c5 or c6 and c4 toono they are not you are more likely to be killed mining in the lower class whs 123 as they routinely have connections to kspace generating a higher amount of visitorsnull sec already has moon goo all to itself which is much more profitable than mining will ever be having abc in whs does nothing to hurt the game and only adds to it by adding variety
considering the response to things like the anom and jb nerfs the response here is extremely tame but even if it werent ignoring the actual facts associated with the issue and judging it based on player rage seems a bit off as people still live in even c34 whs there are obvious implications about removing them for those groups these would most likely be smaller groups less equipped for complicated logistics the idea is further complicated by the fact that the csms suggested that they be made more self sufficient this really doesnt add up to anything other than a punishment of wh dwellers when we look at the factsno local which means no instant intel or warningno ice could be wrong here please tell me if i ambelts are only found in sigsmass limitations prevent large scale ops in low class whsease of access for daytrippers provides greater danger due to equal ease of access for piratespirates themselves would also loose targets due to decreased activity in low end holesfor those that do live in whs supply can be less than consumption at times as isthe only one area in the game that could benefit from changing whs is null which has significant advantages over wh space in terms of mineral production as is the hypocrisy of the null representatives in suggesting that they deserve to be more self sufficient in their chosen area of the game while decreasing the ability of others to do the same is somewhat deserving of rage imhoid be very interested to hear more of the csmccp reasoning for their desire to make this changeedited for misspelling
they do talk about pos changes with a possible 2012 for the dead horse becoming real
i too approve of what i read in the minutes
please look up the word technically technically the items are immersion breaking because they are able to transport between stations with no consequence everything else people are making up about paying for a license clothing is easy to make wtf says who is not fact therefore it cannot be technical
the second these nex items went on the player market they have become a item just like any in the game and should be treated as such

i guess since you asked so nicely that if you were to provide me with 2 plexes for the purposes of reactivating my main accounts i would be able to contract over all of my stuff  as this account has nothing plus a bunch of pi materials that are sitting on planets the unfortunate aspect of this is that i have no plans on logging in to this account before it expires just to see if i received the plexes via contracts
by the logic of good trebor all non game enhancing items should be indestructible so id expect to see exotic dancers or anything non enhancement related to become indestructible as well rightcome to think of it despite the fact that i disagree in principle with the entire subscription  mt model for this game and the amount of resources that have been put into the development of the ingame store rather than into the game where historically one would expect them to be applied the only thing id ever even think of buying if i could get cq to load would be topless exotic dancers that danced in your cq realistically high res full body mechanic 247 bouncy booby exotic dancers that your entire corp could view too bad theyre changing age demographics ala oe and itll never happen right now theres nothing desirable being added to the game it reeks of suits making game design decisions when that happens its always game over
you are naked in your pod and your cloths are stored in the over head compartment therefore move from place to place with you when pod killed your pod insurance apart of your clone cost covers small personal items like cloths and watches etc there are we happy now story explanation can we get over it yet ps ccp is a business the job is to make money and grow get used to it
ok ill be the one to repeat ccps mantra preincarnaif its on the market and player tradeable its destroyableso wtf happened to clothing
hey now leave the csm alonethey are under alot of stress by just finding out that wormhole space is actually null sec and that abc ores actually exist there to be minedthis has disturbed mittens and his muppets and must be delt with first the null sec nap monkies feel that this will cut into the the profits of thier mining bots
im all for cheaper destructible nex merchandise for a lot of reasons mostly becuase this is eve and the universe doesnt give a flying frack about how much grief losing something expensive will causehere are some arguments c is the critisism a is the answerc servers will have unnesscesary load due to people removing their vanity clothes every time they undock a if ccp had actually done anything but copypaste the character creator to make the character recustomiser swapping clothes wouldnt be such a frackin hassle for instance if putting on clothes was as simple as standing by the mirror opening a container and dragging the clothes onto your avatar similar to the dead functionality of dragging a module from your hangar onto your ship not the fitting window to fit said module is an easier and less hassleful experience for those who must have vanity items and do not wish to risk them c what about the portaits then people could buy a monocle take the photo and resell it a make the portrait photos auto update when you add time to your account as well as whenever you choose to do so the recustomiser becomes a photo booth essentially it even makes sense from an rp perspective you sumbit a new passport photo when you update your liscence c no one will buy the cheaper destructible items because they dont do anything a the problem is that they do do something they are a status item  just like the 700 sparkle poney tigers from wow ccp is underestimating just how attractive that kind of thing is to a lot of players so here is another question will i be refunded my 100 ishukone watch scorpion if it gets blown up c argh my plex market a statistically the vast majority of plex sell orders are in the quantity range of 12 which hints at that most people buy 2 plex and either spend 1 on themselves adding time to their account and sell the other  or sell both sure plex prices might go up a bit but ccp will not let it get out of hand and it will eventually stabilise again i for one think that 360 million isk for a months gametime is a bargain and im not exactly the biggest isk maker in the world for all arguments there is a counter  until a certain pyramid invalidates said argument back on topicabout time that another republic fleet firesidetail chat landed on gridim excited to hear about the unified service layer usl and especially if its going to be eve gate exclusive would give people a propper reason to use the damn thing especially if it would let the user change skills out of game changeing skills from your smartphone would be the most useful thing evermeeting minutes were as always the highlight of the month for me  lots of cool stuff 00 really does need a revampfootnote id love to see trebor play devils advocate on this
what has happened now been on vacation so havent been able to keep up anyone
ill be tuning in just to hear mittani opening his mouth to speak about stuff he doesnt understand watching the idiotic ideas of this csm in horror as display their total lack of understanding of the gameone sentence on how lowsec needs more attention then the rest of the summit spent on displaying total lack of economic sensibility rabbiting on about super veldspar and removing abc from wh to boost nullsec industrydo any of the people on the csm engage in any form of industry
it isnt just about nullsec industry but making it so nullsec is its own special independent game in eve and eventually well all be punished for not running out there through nerfs not working to make it more attractive or leave it as it is for those that want that kind of gameplay but nerf other parts of the game so null is the only place to do xyz
this is the only serious attempt to providing an argument against it everyone else is just whining against itthis is not buying skill points buying skillpoints is i give ccp my credit card and tomorrow i fly an avatar neural remaps already exist people do use them to train faster you probably do too no one wants them removed only a few vocal people oppose a way to obtain more i would support as few as 1 with a cooldown of 6 months i see the failure in buying skillpoints outright people could become a titan pilot in a day thats just stupid with remaps you cannot become a titan pilot in a day it will still take a very long time
i like most of the sheep here oppose this idea entirely along with any change that might happen good or badtaking years for training is good and we should not try to give new players ways to help fast track their enjoyment with more options for remaps playing other games while avoiding eve entirely while your character trains itself in real time is excellent and preferabletotally do not support anything that helps speed up skill training and increases player enjoymentfreedom and would preferably limit remaps to once every 5 years if the players are impatient they need to learn to be more patient
fellow capsuleersits easy to make all these grandstanding naysaying posts  i know ive been in plenty myself but can you honestly say to yourself youre sure eve still has another 8 years well i cant thats the problem the eve training system works great but it doesnt scale well schematically the issue is as followsfor every x year in the past the chance of eve existing yet another x years becomes smaller when x gets largerto give you a few exampleeve existed 2 years eve will exist another 2 years  very likelyeve existed 4 years eve will exist another 4 years  probablyeve existed 8 years eve will exist another 8 years  not so likelyeve existed 16 years eve will exist another 16 years  almost certainly notso the issue is that aheadtime condenses as it were with each year passing that means in simple terms that whatever others have done before you will become a less attainable goal so for 8 year old vets to say new people should just wait as long as they did is a linear logic which simply doesnt apply here heck even say a full 3year carrier plan is on shaky grounds at the momentalso please understand that this condensation of aheadtime as already outlined in the startpost becomes more pronounced with each new year passinghence this proposal its not even adding a new game mechanic its merely applying an existing one a bit more frequently to compensate slightly for the increasinglylesstimeahead matter
whilst the total impact of plexforremaps would be small it crosses the line however slightly of paying for something that cant be obtained ingameccp have a lot of trust rebuilding to do before id consider accepting the risk of letting them do just one small power mt starting down that road would do more to shorten eves remaining lifespan than almost anything i can think of
not the same as buying sp huhsituation 1hey think ill train perwill for the next 6 months to get into those nice t2 ships and getting some proper gunnery skillsremap to perwill training them at 2790 sph6 months inok time for my fitting skills too bad im only training them only at 2070 sph oh well got my gunnery fast continues training intmem for 6 months until next remapresult 20995200 sp from that yearsituation 2hey think ill train perwill for the next 6 months to get into those nice t2 ships and getting some proper gunnery skillsremap to perwill training them at 2790 sph6 months inok time for my fitting skills too bad im only training them only at 2070 sph screw this i have isk to spare buys a remap now training intmem at 2790 sph and continues training intmem for 6 months until next remapresult 24105600 sp that yearnow please tell me how the person in situation 2 didnt buy a bit over 3m sp given to him over 6 months yea the rate is bad but thats not the point is itthink its worth noting i couldve made the postremap time 119 months for lulz but trying to be fair here and it could also be that the time required for perwill is only 6 months and the player is switching over on purpose so its not about himher making a mistakemaybe this is not game breaking in itself but it does cross a linethis proposal does not help new players what so ever unless they are rlrich because they cant afford to buy plex ingame anyway and the rlrich can already just buy a character with their  so basically this is all in an effort to train new alts and old mains faster which is not needededit changed situations a bit because people are ed
wtb training at 2790 sphlack of game mechanics knowledge aside both people in both situations have the same choices open to them either buy a remap or dont
this example may be the purest incarnation of malcanis law yet
exactly we dont want more enjoyment or progressing for players its better to punish them and get them stuck with bad training times for 6 months when they decide to change game play styles which is totally their own fault and they have to live with it or quit eve
knew someone would herp so hard they derp well edit on my example situationsand eve is all about living with your choices only trained amarr while minmatar are fotm live with it and so on

i agree but with neural remaps which exist today it still takes yearsuh neural remaps already exist they can be obtained in game they are obtained in game at a fixed rate this isnt plex for gold ammo or gold ships if you think ccp still has trust to rebuild over an internal newsletter containing speculation that never became a reality and that they said is never going to become a reality you need to brush up on comprehension skills
the only one derping is you youth
supportedid used the tutorial agents to fix my mains balance before and it was pretty straight forward and effectivetonight i thought id use them to bump my alt to get a headstart on courier missions working towards rd rep get a cheap frig fit going set my waypoints rock up to the first agent no showdisappointed id just be happy to get option 1 back
there is no problem with afk cloakingimprovise adapt overcome
i have a red who constantly probably 20 hours a day afk cloaks in my systemand i dont give a rats ass about it know why i check my dscan when i ratmission i have friends on commschats who while they are doing their own  are also ready to help a friend in need as soon as  gets realits not hard either adapt and work with others or die in a fire because youre too lazy to manage the perceived threat of an afk cloaker ill be honest when i first came to 00 i thought it was ed as hell too but now that ive got many months under my belt of living in null ive not only grown used to it but i counter it oftenas for the fear of him having a cyno be aligned have intel on his corppast engagementsetc there are many things players can do to minimize the risks they are presented with the question is just how much effort are you willing to put in for that bounty tick or mission reward if you cant be bothered to put the effort into countering an afk cloaker then why the flying  are you in 00 space
give cloaks a timer 10 minutes for example train it up and have an implant and you will get a few more minutes once your timer is up you will have 30 seconds or whatever before you can reactivate your cloak that way if your afk you will decloak and can be scanned and found or make the cloak run on some kind of fuel that takes cargo space cant stay cloaked forever if you need to go refuel it personally i like it the way it is right now if its not a risk its not worth doing mining and rating while someone is in your space just means you have to be a little attentive while you do it have fun and fly safe
aww tears get over it
it wasnt in the release of incarna raaaaaaaaaaage come on csm this has 29 pages of support get off ur ass and geter done
agreed
signed my name is terrible my imagination was dead back then and the gallentes only option for long hair is dirty looking dreadlock things
or maybe enhance destroyer hulls a little by giving them and only them the ability to use mine launchers might give the class a bit of a shot in the armanyway the basic idea is sound would just be a matter of tweaking for balance i think
i was thinking that but i thought the destroyer wouldnt be strong enough to handle gate guns i could be wrong i was actually thinking that one of the tier 2 battlecruiser hulls would be a better fit or another cruiser hull as if there arent a ton of those already
i like the idea of mines lets give them a detection range 30km for example before they explode and a deployment range 35km apart a cleaver pilot could set a maze around a gate and give his corp way points to navigate past it after all mines in real life dont know if your on the same team
i was hoping to just have them be like the bombs hits everything in the area friend and foe that way you can setup a passage of same space but if you stray a bit or try it with too big of a ship and pop very hard thing for scouting skills required very high danger extreme rewards great
i think letting people place hundreds of aoe weapons on a grid is a recipe for massive lag followed by node crashes especially if any reasonably large fleet warps thereanother question to consider if someone is undocked in highsec when one of their 00 mines kills someone do they get concordedi would get around these problems by turning mines into singleuse highdamage drones doing selfdamage each time they fire at a target and blowing themselves up after 4 or 5 shots optionally make the drones fire missiles rather than doing turret damage so that smartbombs can be used as a counteralso create a new minelayer ship class with a massive bonus to  of active drones but not drone bandwidth give mines a very low bandwidth requirement but a moderate to high volume to stop other ships using them excessively except maybe the odd carrier or guardianvexor
i like the idea of mines and this thread has kind of inspired me to tweak the concept instead of mines being a singular oneshot aoe weapon with a given radius players would deploy entire minefields via a minelayer module the size of the field can be manipulated by players but at the cost of the damage generated smalltight fields 30km radius will generate a lot of damage but cover a very limited area largedispersed fields 1000s km radius will generate limited damage but might do so over a wide area multiple fields can overlap with one another allowing players to customize their minefields since each field is made up of some enormous number of mines each unit of mines has substantial material costsdamage taken will be probability based every second a ship spends inside a field it has some probability of being hit by a mine based on the size of the ship the larger the ship the more likely they are to get hit and the density of the field probabilities higher in smaller more focused fields the total damage taken could be expressed as a percentage rather than as a total amount of dps given lower chances of being hit this would mean that small fast ships would be able to sail through fields without much hassle while larger ships im looking at you capital ships would be largely unable to safely access mined areas so this would allow for more strategic play and act as a defacto nerf for capital and supercapital shipsthoughtsi may have to add this to my nullsec omniproposal
this is very close to my original thought but i toned it down so it wasnt so overpowered i wanted some type of limit to the number of mines and max damage it could do so large alliances wouldnt just set up an unassailable wall and jump bridge over it while also not adding to lag that muchindividual mines would like drones stress the servers
yes that would be for the best

worth repeating
bumping for justicethis thread will not die
maybe just for the sake of argument you should consider that learning projectile guns is a valid solution maybe if i were to put on my devils advocate hat the federation prefers tactics of drones and long range rails or close range blasters i mean if we disregard for a second that this is a game and think in the story terms it may be completely okay that projectiles pwn gallente weapons because well gallenteans are not exactly an aggressive race besides the minmatar are their allies so they would be having those same hurricanes fighting at their side in any faction conflicts with the state you all are capsuleers afterall not tied to any faction really not subject to the laws and restrictions of mere mortals if you want to be the best pirate ever then maybe its time you trained to fly good alpha ships like minmatar ones the ones designed that way so that they could over throw centuries of slavery to their masters the pompus amarriansi mean if i were put on my rp hatbalancing the game so that everything is equal makes eve about as boring as chess
dear lord please fix drones too
im not the biggest eve fanboy but something that important should to be built not randomly spawned its also a punch in the junk for those that managed to play the game long enough to get into those ships the better and simpler idea would be to make building times longer however good luck getting sc pilots support either way
the power cores are not randomly spawned they turn up when a supercap is destroyed also the supercaps themselves still needs to be builtas for some people being butthurt well yes its unavoidable the long term health of nullsec can not possibly be maintained if supercaps continue to be built like this you have to limit their numbers in some way it has to come down from todays numbers a lot how you limit them is less important although i think my solution is pretty neat in many waysif you dont limit the numbers there will be an unavoidable power creep eventually nullsec will be nothing but titans and super carriers how fun does that make it for a new alliance to try to stake out a claim today you can be lulzdropped by 20 goon titans do you think itll get any better later onno one likes their ship to be nerfed but sometimes it just has to be done to keep the game fun for the rest of the players when the speed nerf hit the hacs there was a lot of complaining from those with a hac but of course in the end it turned out to be better for the game to nerf them its true what ccp said we should note what the players do not what they saytitans started out as koenigseggs now theyre ferraris in another five years theyll be folkswagens with my suggestion we would make them koenigseggs again
this is a really neat idea
while i agree that supercapitalstitans should be very rare ships i dont think your way of dealing with them would be fairany alliancecorp loosing a few of those cores to their opponents allowing them to field even more scs than they had before would result rather soon into very onesided battlesin the end very few ppl would control those cores and that is really worse than what we have nowrather make them consume fuel like a pos no matter if their pilots are online or notthat way the maintenance cost alone would force the numbers of active scstitans down to a more exclusive level
so what you are saying is prevent new players from advancing in the game excellent may i take this opportunity to nener neneralso this is a terribly unbalanced idea far worse than the current situation
fair no but nothing is fair in eve they took a calculated risk by fielding those supercaps and lostalso there will be a sort of equilibrium the more supercaps one side gets the more likely they are to lose one by providing more opportunities to get them destroyed sure they get a certain edge due to their supercaps but given how limited they would be the edge would still not be an iwin buttonletting supercaps consume fuel has its own problems either its so extremely expensive that only the very largest alliances could afford it or its cheap enough that any alliance could afford it which means it doesnt limit anything anyway either it isnt balanced or its toothlessyes because as we all know the first ship new players zoom around in is a titan right
smart people will simply deploy these en masse even more than today and have empty supercaps ready to pick up destroyed core if mishap did happeneventually there will be only one group holding supercaps and nobody will ever be able to contest them no matter how successful they are otherwisesimplest solution would be to remove these ships from the game and reimburse skill points isk and minerals to characters not that ccp would dare to do that
in a large enough battle a limited amount of supercaps will have very little effect on the battle as a whole maybe you have an alliance with almost all supercaps in the game then all of a sudden they end up in a battle they cant handle and two hours later they dont own any supercaps at allsay 50 super carriers exist in game and 25 of them are owned by a single alliance the alliance is powerful sure but say it comes to a battle of 400 battleships  25 super carriers vs 500 battleships on the other side 500 battleships will easily kill a super carrier and i think the result of such a fight could go either way and the fleet sizes are reasonablewhat i mean is that with a limited enough number of supercapitals it doesnt matter if a single alliance owns all of them they can still be defeated if met with a superior force of nonsupercap ships today though i think it could be perfectly possible for an alliance to buy a close to invinsible supercap fleet if they have enough resourceswith my suggestion money wouldnt automatically mean superior supercap numbers a small but skilled alliance could easily steal a couple of supercap kills and all of a sudden they would be a force to be reckoned with
actually no of the caps supercaps are the ones able to run from a fight and an fc will sacrifice every other ship on the field to save those supers in a fight with 400 bs  25 scarriers v 500 bs the scarrier side would absolutely destroy the other fleet in spectacular fashion the way supers die are either solo supers that fall into enormous cunning traps or from giant lagged out battles in the case of those battles ships wrecks and pods are known to reappear after the fight even after they are dead or cruise around continuing to fight even though they are actually dead i have a fraps of me flying an apoc around for about 10 minutes shooting stuff with 0 hull it ended up dying twice according to the killmails which is highly lulzworthy but thats a side story point is how can you be sure those things dont multiply like everything else does in those situations how can you be sure they spawn correctly in high lag situations the answer is that when supers die ccp has no logs and no control over what is going on so to put some mechanic in place that needs to work correctly is just dumbcurrently pl has such a force they also are smart about the mechanics enough to very very very rarely lose a super and when they do it is often returned by petition instead of your dream version of small alliances yoinking these supers what will happen is they will become the hottest commodity and the blocs will go out of their way to take any supers not supported by a bloc thus consolidating bloc power dramatically due to the risks suddenly involved with large fleet fights the blocs with supers will likely all end up naped together against the rest of eve and work out who owns what valuable space through diplomacyto sum it up you dont seem to have a good grasp of what goes on with supers or null sec and your idea is flawed
no not going to work if introduced now just going to make a lot of people angry you cant have that ship cause we changed the rules and you get to role play titans now not going to work and will probably lead to them being unused as a trophy 1 they need to be nerfed especially ew resistance and damage vs anything they come up against2 a new ship is needed specifically to kill supercaps heavy bomber3 dreads need to be resist and vs supercap damage buffed when in siege mode drop 50 dreads seige  kill 20 supercaps lose 40 dreads dreads having always been vulnerable to cap warfare and swarms of subcaps game balancedthe usual chain is broken by supercaps at the moment restricting them wont fix it rock scissors paper supercap requires supercap killer vulnerable to subcaps to close this loop

sothis proposal wants to hurt supercaps somehow and does so by asking for a totally unnecessary nerf for every regular cloaker ideas like that are always inherently badif people want to nerf supercaps propose something that only affects supercaps pure and simple like i dunno cut their ehp in half maybe
and have them land at a gate
ive never used cynos so i may be way off the mark with this but why not just make it that you can scan out cynos that way it doesnt matter if the ship gets destroyed you can still scan out and warp to the intended entry pointargus

the problem has a lot to do with so many parts of manufacturing already requires jumps to high sec that the price to produce would have to be lower in null sec than high sec if you do that you will reverse the problem and suddenly high sec would be flooded with stuff produced in null sec that problem stems from all the jump freighters and carriers having to move back and forth to supply everything and the empty room being filled with whatever random stuff they want to bring to seed the market if it were reversed the problem would likely be amplified as the ships are rarely able to be filled currently when going from null to high sec as the only stuff being hauled is loot not worth reprocessingi honestly think that the way to improve industry in null is throw low ends at the problem in a way that they cant simply be passed over such as some kind of hauler spawn plexanom type of thing mining isnt done solo but ratting is forcing ratting income to also be in the form of minerals would reduce the isk inflation a bit as well as seed markets in null with low end minerals this would have to be followed up with equalizing the industrial efficiency in null as in empire or the low ends would likely just start piling up then become the ugh i got another hauler skip
sounds like homeworki knowessentially id like to see a csm member or two or three take an active role in faction warfare development for those of you who like fw no ccp is not developing it  i want csm to try and push that1 find out how many players actually partake in fw  this could be as simple as looking up all the registered militants and miltias something ccp could aid you with quickly2 perform several polls on fw  why do people like it why not as im sure many veterans know new players always ask about faction warfare and are drawn to it  likely because its pvp focused but presumed to be more controlled than lowsecnullsec many think its in hisec3 leading off 2  npe if so many new players are drawn to fw why isnt it developed more its well known ccp is pursuing a npe campaign incarna the centerpiece at this time and devs have long touted that getting players into corporations is a priority for retention pve provides a straightforward though limited path of progression hulks battleships freighters however no such progression exists in pvp  except for faction warfare and its complexes id like to see the csm deliberate in conjunction with ccp on why faction warfare inherently draws new players until they are informed of its current state and how it could be improved to benefit both veterans and new players as a defined tool for pvp progression from a business perspective fw could increase player retention by providing a different pvp environment than lowsec piracy and lawless nullsec sov and alliance warfare and wormholes survival this results in more places to go when players get bored with one facet of eveex i started as a minerwas cool in my hulk then an orca with my buddies in a gang got old of course so we decided to push past level 2s and cruisers we got battleships were making isk like crazy  and getting bored of missions so we moved into lowsec to try piracy didnt fit the bill  too much waiting for us and we lacked logistics at the time eve is a learning experience ya now were involved in nullsec and so far like it there as a result of having so many different places to go  were still playing eve thats the beauty of the game two of us are talking about taking up the miner operation again to build a carrier this is player retention in action  the more quality features available the longer the retention4 the final step is to present the ideas the csm representatives think about faction warfare what theyve discussed with ccp and future plans obviously nda renders them unable to give us explicit details on features  but fw has a lot of potential for factoring into npe and in general fixing a feature that has been suboptimal since launchare there any csm members that would be interested in taking on this task theres no deadline considering how ccp operates the csm or devs would need to create a centralized discussion thread of course at the end  players have this habit of duplicating threads or some suchedit i realized that i posted with a different alt than i usually do  oops lakuma is traditionally my mouthpiece and i will be answering posts as him sorry about the confusion
i would be very interested to see if any ccp employees particularly develops like soundwave who deal directly with ship balance would be in support of this measure to save them some legwork afterall ship balance occurs only as a result of ship competition  ie pvp in some form be it freighting or fightingfaction warfare has the most controlled version of pvp in the game by virtue of being complexoriented though not successfully of course but thats besides the pointsoare there any devs out there who also would like to see the csm compile some data from the playerbase to present to them in regards to faction warfare
not even a drop of interest
i thinking getting someone on the csm to champion faction warfare is a must
would support this with wholeheartedly if i thought it would have any effect but you are fooling yourself i am afraidnewbies are not necessarily drawn by interest they are or were presented with a big fat join the army button at the end of a tutorial  the number of people who pop up in militia channel and ask why they were just killed or some other rudimentary question is staggeringfw already has champions on the council or at least that is what they said when campaigning problem is they are all nullbears and ccp has dangled a tasty trout in front of them filled with joy for their neck of the woods  good luck getting anything meaningful from them until after null has been placatedthey even consider it abandoned 
then you should vote for someone in the next csm null sec has been tired of the sov mechanics and pos grind for years we as a giant block voted for csm delegates who made sov mechanics and structures their priority most of the current csm delegates champion the demands of the null sec community the which came first the chicken or the egg can be played but the point is suddenly we have a null sec sov focused winter 2011 expansion comingit had been hoped that fw would get the grand new sov mechanics that ccp had rolled out a few years back for null but as they are not exactly good be thankful your sov mechanics have not changed yet hopefully ccp get it right this time and fw will likely benefit from a modified version of whatever null gets
well i did vote for someone but i agree if you mean all fw members should get together and support a single fw candidate
other way around actually fw was used as a trial run for some of content scheduled for the dominion sov revamp remember how the pitched dom way back when  multiple objectives smallfleet action all over the place limited but crucial blob viabilitymost if that plan was scrapped shortly after they saw fw fall flat on its face and the current sov system was launched instead at least that is what i can piece together from timeslinescommentswould be grand of there was some link between the systems as they have marketed fw as a steppingstone for null  so dependant on what they cook up read fail at this time around a simplified version couldshould be implemented in fw
i think it went something likenull grinding poses sucks really badccp no worries were about to test some cool new sov mechanics on empirefw this is terribleccp hmmm that didnt worknull so about that whole pos grinding thingccp we have new sov mechanics coming for null it is awesomenull yayfw but what about usccp once we work the bugs out in null well port it to fw it is awesomefw yayccp tadanull even more lag and unheard of structure grinding awesomefw still broken over here tooccp winter 2011 itll be awesomenull it sounds goodfw still brokeni got a bit carried away there didnt i
not sure you were actually  hahahahaha sounds very ccpesque
i was intentionally avoiding the fact that this had a low chance yes csm is very nulloriented last i checked it always is because primarily null players actually voterun for csm and on an account basis severely outnumber hisec players active on the forumsmy point is that ccp is already engaged in seeking ways to improve player recruitment and retention because fixing old features apparently doesnt help either of those and thus faction warfare as an almost obscure feature has a lot of potential to fit into this overall plan you are correct in that new players are directed to fw via a join now thats more akin to a scam than an advertnonetheless  i think csm could gain a lot of traction with the playerbase as a whole as well as ccp if it was to be proactive as opposed to reactive  hence this proposal sounds like homework indeed  but if you do the basics for ccp they have more reason to review faction warfare and pursue itso again  are any of the csm members who supposedly partake in fw or care about it interested in doing a bit of legwork to see if this feature really is important i personally think that ccp has ignored it as a feature for the simple fact not nearly enough players are vocal about it  as opposed to pos misery and nullsec
not letting this die
if they can only cancel jobs they start themself it wouldnt be much of a issue if you got someone in your corp building big things on behalf on the corp they probably got roles to do more damage than just cancel a job they do regardless
up
this requires more oomphpirate faction ships are more like faction tech 2 ships and thus should be treated as tech 2this is a real problem please fix
seems good to me d
i want to strip racks
youre so not stripping my rack
so now anyone who points out you failed is a liar d best edit your op then
your reading comprehension skills are bested by a slug
ultimately you missed the real problemthere is no design philosophy that says a player must commit to a fight  otherwise ecm wcs and other methods of disengaging would not existnor is there an assumption that what you think youre fighting is what you see  he could just as easily have brought some friends to play and would have if you had been able to hold tank for too longif you were better informed you would have known that this is a standard ninja tactic  he wasnt stealing your loot  he wanted to kill you you took the baitthe only problem here is that there is no way for you to spring his trap on him and kill the orcawhen that is fixed life will be more interesting for ninjas and victims both
why worry about transferring aggro at that point youve hopefully broken the lock youve warped out safe up and wait it out if that was what you were planning to do if you were planning to switch ships then do it from the orca that is in the safe you just warped to where the transfer of an aggro counter wont do anything negatively to it did you even read the rest of the paragraph i wrote or just the first sentence youre started to look like a troll
solution orca is protecting a pilot who aggrod you knowing the situation thus orca should become red box to you too
you cant board a ship thats targeted i think its a good idea that you cant dock a ship thats targetted either with the exceptions of stations and outposts ow station games would take on a whole new aspect docking your faction bs into a carrier to save it from destruction is such a pansy use of the game mechanics that it really ought to be changed
missions should not be the only way to increase standings i beleive that a small standings increase from placing orders via brokerage s well as paying tax would help not just the economy but also allow traders bypass missions to trade and haul while still getting counted as a part of the npc corperation and factions good side going pew pew for agents should not be the only way to get a standings gain as a trader i would rather stick to trading and hauling player made goods not doing missions that keep me away from helping the economy by putting my isk to the value of the items on the market so my standings suffer and i end up paying rather high fees and have no way to grow my competitive edge and when i have less fees due to higher standings i make more isk to keep buying more goods from players however i am also wanting to propose a anti exploitation factor to include into this any market manipulations that result in false pricing via buying your own goods in an attempt to create a false price on an item should result in a small standings decrease as falseifying the market is a bad thing
i would agree that some sort of standings for traders would be in order however i dont think adjusting the standings just from normal trade activity is the way to goperhaps with changes in smuggling coming there can be some sort of thing that brokers want that is less than legal something that can moved from region to region insider trading data if there needs to be an rp reason for ityou can incarna your way to some broker agent but some data sheets and then move them to another region and give them to another some other broker and gain some standings with that npc corpthis way there is some time effort and risk involved above and beyond just doing what youd do anyway
you can pay someone to grind standings for you enough said i think
just a thought if not original then please forgive mebut why not make fw pay the participantsi mean many complain that fw is a empty shell of what it can be it seems to me that the easiest way to get anyone to do something in an ultracapitalist society is to reward them for actions with isk if you are part of the armed forces you should expect to get paid for your servicescurrently the only way this can happen is through militia agents and frankly anything less than lvl4 missions are not worth it as the amount you stand to lose in loss of ships for lvl1 and lvl2 players arent worth the rewardswhy not pay for kills you are fighting for your faction anyhow seems to me like the faction should reward you for it should apply for corps and playersof course we have to make sure that people dont create alts just to join the other side to be killed so maybe set the rewards for kills to be depending on the pretige or rank of the pilot that you shot down also make lower level mission rewards worth more so that it can be a full time profession it makes no sense that people have to mine or do something else just so that they can make a living while in the militia the missions should not make anyone rich but it should at least make them self sufficient make the rewards a function of how large the enemy force is or how much territory they have vs yours etcany comments or suggestions
we already have lpforkills they just need to fix it so that all involved get a slice top damagemail recipient only now i think there is your direct payif you know of anyone mining to make ends meet in fw pod them for me please they must be so dumb that their deaths will bring the average iq of the server as a whole up several points i can if i could be arsed to make isk enough for a supercarrier in little over one month with only a few hours per day invested in fw  show me a place that is not deep null where that is possiblewhy do you think that 95 of all militia members do nothing but mission whoringps fw is a proxy war it is not the armed forces but ragtag militias
maybe im missing the point of all the threads that fw is broken theninteresting though didnt knaw about the lp how does that translate into isk thoughgetting things from the store and selling them
it is not broken because of the lack of isk but because the mechanics and general system is fubar ccp did not spend months prior to release riling people up with promises of the biggest cash cow in eves history but rather meaningful smallgang action rp and entertainment  the pew is there but not really all that different from everywhere else any morelpforkills is pretty low but yes you get lp with your militia to use fw store for killing others any higher and you will start to see people killing alts repeatedly so not really a steady income but nice to see a flash once in a while
sorry if im being obtuse but i really just never been in militia so dont know but is the lp earned any more than the lp with regular lvl1 and lvl2 missions if so then how can this really pay for itself are there any special items that you get from militia stations or missions that are worth more than the occasional lost frigate or destroyer for beginner playersin your opinion as you seem to have more experience than i can a beginner player support themselves doing fw what does that mean exactly alone i know 1 case where someone was just doing the lvl1 missions and they complained that at that rate it would take them forever to earn enough to buy a cruiser let alone carry the cost of losing one if i were to take his story at face value i would say that their is a game mechanic problem here but as he already quit eve i thought i would throw this topic out for discussion and comments from those who may know better
fw missions can easily support a fw players pvp habits
the lp in fw is fantastic check the lp reward costsfaction warfaremission runningdedicated reasonably skilled fw pilots make a couple billion a month one problem with fw is the gap between skilled both experience and sp players and new players one big problem has been that because gallente ships are generally gimped compared to other ships their faction versions have much less market demand so people in fw for isk dont join the gallente militia creating a dramatic imbalance with the caldari which are possibly the highest demand shipsmilitia another issue is that incursions from an income standpoint draw experienced players away from the militias but the major problem from what i understand has to do with the fw sov mechanics i would assume that if ccp can come up with sov fixes that work in null in this winter 2011 expansion then fw will reap some of the benefits of a functional sov mechanic
beginner is a strange term to use does it mean new to militia or new to game you can acquire standings enough for lvl4 missions in a few days of doing almost nothing thanks to the broken plexing mechanicsonce lvl4s are unlocked you can make enough for a supercarrier in a couple of months by investing 23 hours per day  the income potential has no equal except maybe for a locked down 10 system in deep null
i dont think its broken that experienced player gets to level 4 missions fast because it would be pretty much waste for any experienced player to do level 1 missions so there is no problem thereif you spend time exclusively doing missions you can get pretty nice income granted that there is no one hunting you in plexes however there is plenty of other ways to make isk faster its no i win button for eve by any meansalso lp stores have differences theres much more demand for caldari items and missions are more difficult to do with higher amount of ppl in fw area  higher gainwhat has bugged me most with fw is almost nonexistant rewards for actually participating in war you get rewards for carebearing originally idea was probably that people would go shoot people doing missions but thats not really working right now fw sov seems more like ping pong
read it again it is not that it is possible that is broken but the mechanic that allows it hell you could buy the bloody standings for all i care  but when plexes that i want for rptags purposes are blitzed by stabbed frigs i get sad name it because i sure as hell have never come across a better revenue source bulk invention comes close but is very vulnerable to market fluctuationsmarketeering can get similar income but you need a massive wallet to begin with to really make it workthe payouts are identical to any other agent payout is based on system security  lowsec pays better than highsecdifference is that normal missions cant be completed in 5 minutes and normal lp stores do not have the same item spread or ship discountspreaching to the choir dear preaching to the choir nothing worse than playing a game and getting the feeling you are wasting your time which is why it would awesome to get some read any response from devs
hmmm yeah actually youre right  it does kind of add to the wildlands character support withdrawn
this is one of those every region of space should be the same and equal and balanced threads again isnt itsheeeeesh you people need to go buy yourself a pair of nice ripped jeans and learn to appreciate that the imperfections in life is what gives things character and personality stop wanting the world to be so digital its boringedit oh and im minmatar and love my heritage and having very few stations fits right into the character of the thukkur tribe btw they are nomads like mongolians no permanant homes its quite fine the way it is
ok i think this is going too far if you could strip a rack of your fitting you can also strip 2 or 3 if you want to keep 1 dont strip that onealternatively you might want to make a proposal for locking modules in the fit locked modules could have lock mode toggled on  off locked modules wouldnt get strippped if you did it for the whole ship or a rack
read op fully  second paragraph states this as their idea
as i was finishing reading empyrean ages great read btw i started reflecting on the may notes fanfest and day four of the alliance tourney dev chats it came to me i think it was greyscale saying he would like to have a modular rebuild of poses an example i believe from the dead horse thread how cool would it be to have a place to refuel caps from a market at poses this would be helpful when there is no station in system for people that do not have access to the corp hangars i imagine people in wh space would love this too i then took it a step further into this idea i see this as a win win because of course it can be destroyed we could even have it outside of shields where you would pull up and access a personal hangar there to get your purchases this would also create another place for pvp i bet i would like to see this just like a market in a station any thoughts
the problem i see is that within seconds of reading this i thought ooo i could set one of those up then sit off it in a cloaked super and gank the fools that come and realized that few cap pilots in their right mind would actually warp to one of these because this will be the reason for 90 of themi tried to think of a way to solve that sentries that protect anyone refueling just means i could bring more ships knowing exactly how many to bring allowing only one player to be on grid at a time with a cap would mean i could go to these empty it then wait for the previously happy owner to arrive to restock it only to gank him for the fuel he is carrying thus doubling the fuel i get out of it alternately that would also become a way to create impregnable safes for supers which would not be a good thing making it capable of being docked at would erode the purpose of outposts and stationsin the end i just cant come up with a mechanic that wouldnt being exploited into disuse or become an op exploit it is an interesting idea if you can come up with a way for it to work
i still think the pos should have defences i also like that it gives another choke point for pvp too this also gives wh people and small alliances a easier way to have a footprint than a corp hangar or building a station
even better why not per shiptoo many times i lazily click orbit and find my bc trying to close in to 5km or my tackle frigate trying to orbit at 60km
indeed  i see no reason why they cant be stored on a per ship basis till said ship is repackaged its a pita to have to set this every time i swap ships
yeah change it to per ship who wouldnt want thisop can you please change your original post or create a new proposal
we all know it takes about 45 months to sit in a carrieror about 23 months to sit in a jump freighter now thats a lot oftime for someone who is not really interested in training in thosetwo directions and wants to spend his time training to be subcapitalpilotthis would be a ship for lowmid sp players who live out in lowsec and00 so they can become less dependent on their corp mates that are capitalcapable this would allow them to have a ship of their own that can makejumps between the systems and allow them to move their things when theyneed to instead of relying on worm holes or their corp matesfor instance before being a cap pilot i had problems say i bought a ashimuand wanted to bring it out to null sec i had to wait for about a weekso i could catch a corpmate that was going to empire and back to bring it upthis ship would fill this missing holeso what i had in mind was a midlarge sized ship maybe just a tiny bit bigger thana bs probably in ore ship category so all races have 1 same typehere is what i had in mid jump range  base 8ly  cargo hold 50000  75000 expandable up to 1520 by two cargo expanders no ship maintenance bay or corp hangar array maybe a 400m3 drone bay capable to field 5 drones 4 hi slots 4 mid slots 2 low slots 2 rig slots
so a jump orca minus the extra bays do i understand that correctly
yes but say less skills required and costs around 100300 mil range
so what you want is capital ship capabilities without the price or skill requirements
sure great we definetly need more ships capable of jumping i think it should have also cov ops cloak
and it should be able to jump gates as well and field fighter bombers maybe a doomsday device definitely should be able to use bridges as well maybe make it immune to bubbles the 100300m price point sounds about right

yes to fixing the icons no to bringing back the old ones i like the art batch that was done for the pi icons so something along that style would be nice realistic but not too starcon3 ish and not 1990s throwbacks like the old ones but thats just my opinion

small issue is that no one including ccp now actually understand how all the timers work in eveanyway even if someone would manage the impressive task of figuring out eve timers i got a much better plan b simplify timers so it doesnt require a tutorial start by removing idiotic stuff like npcs in belts giving an agro timer then remove stuff like extending agro timers by shooting someones cans which dont actually show on the victims screen that his agro timer is extended etc
even simplified timers and aggro will still need to be explained to new players in no other game that im aware of can players bait other players into pvp in such a dizzying array of different ways quite like eve a new player shouldnt be forced to learn every possible way that can happen but the tutorial should give them the basic knowledge that taking from someone else allows them to shoot you the difference between yellow boxing and red boxing and gcc also the basics of the aggro counter that doesnt allow dockingjumping for 30 seconds should be explained to new players if ccp wants to retain new players they need to do a better job of giving those players the information they need in a game when losses really hurt to not lose ships left and right to other players until the quit in confusion when they lose their first ship it should be to a crap i forgot about that rather than a why can he do that why cant i do this how did i just die
collisions on things sutch as asteroids and stations and flyign space junk are a bit ridicoulus i have lost too many stealth bombers to rats because i cant allign even though that asteroid is the good part of a thanatos length away from mei beleive that ccp should attempt to get the  collision wall right up with the opbjects skinany other sugestions
objects are typically defined as an arbitrary set of spheres which i think makes the collision detection simple since the game only needs to know the distance between your sphere and other spheres near you trying to make objects an irregular polyhedral shape would probably make the collision calculations far more complicated
yes it does the sphere even elliptical ones are the easiest shape to test collisions with if everything is a sphere then the equation becomes measuring the distance between 2 points and comparing that to the radii of the spheres  ellipses if you use cubes or lists of triangles you have to test against each face that will hurt the servers ability to perform
but thats the attitude that i feel ccp has and i am bothered by in the first place whatever happened to excellence
dropbear stated theres no reason to fit them the same as conventional ships for the situation as much as im critical of ccp atm im sure they know that the fit you posted isnt an accurate portrayal of how to fit your motherturd i would liken it to going on the test server and fitting your ships up for a bit of fun
this and more of this
that was the part that i really didnt understand ccp brought it up and the uninformed csm raged as if hs carebears were in wh mining abc ores unmolested but in all of the tidbits in the minutes i saw no reasons for this nerf i would gladly accept this nerf if wh can also become a bit more self sustaining but that means adding ice grav sites or comets wice previous posters have stated the pain of logistics in moving ore wow thats an understatement i need to bring in everything from fuel ammo and spare mods and ships and take out everything if i plan on refueling ore is not cost effective in this sleeper tags sleeper salvage are also for wh residents in c5c6 wh space they are not there for the ore sleepers and gas for t3s but ore yeah ive never run across a hulk in anything higher than a c4one caveat i have run across a couple large operations in c2 holes that use a rorqual which significantly eases the logistics pain of moving ore these are the only operations that will be crushed by this since they made the investment in that ship and it is stuck there for the rest of us itd be just another nerfheadache of living without a market or a reliable exit
i once or twice ventured into a wh connected directly to high sec i now live in nullsec as a minerindustrialist tbh the nerf is totally unnecessary there is more risk of someone blowing up your hulk in a wh than in nullsec because pirates go into whs often specifically looking for the easy ganks associated with them what i dont like about this nerf is they make out that whs in high sec are like high sec but as everyone knows theyre not theyre equivalent to nullsecnext theyll be suggesting that all the abc ore in a nullsec region vanish when a high sec area gets directly connected to it via a whof all the changes that could be made this seems like such a pointless unnecessary change which just makes the game more linear i like the variety of options and associated risks saying abc ore only in nullsec sleepers only in wh etc just boils the game down too much itd be no more fun or challenging than boiling the game down to three ships combat ship industrial ship mining ship
and yet again proof howfar the current csm has grown away from the average player who doesnt see null sec as the endgamethe whole removal of abc ores from wh space is utterly ed and only gets an approval by mitanni and cronies cause every penny they cant make on a certain thing needs to be nerfed so they can get moreevery abc you cant mine in wh means less competition for the nullsec residents they already managed to bring faction drops in hi sec to a virtual halt and also to bring droprate of mods in missions down a few notchesfor high end minerals they want you to be as dependable as possible of null sec not to mention the moon goo storythe whole issue at hand is that the major part of the community which lives in high sec isnt as vocal as the null sec dwellers which makes misrepresentation for them a lot easieri personally feel we have to find a few very good strong candidates for high sec and get some real blockvoting going for the next electionsthen you will see a whole other sort of blockvoting from null sec
just to play devils advocate why not take them out most of the people i see worrying about them going away also say in the same paragraph that its hard to get out of there and not worth it if its so hard to get out and so logistical intensive then why worry about it going awayagain im not trying to start an argument just confused
its as challenging to bring materials into the hole as it is to bring them out the minerals obtained are mostly used within the hole theres something just wrong with requiring hole residents to be reliant on nullbunnies for the materials we need to survive in more challenging space
well that makes a lot more sense thanks for the clarification
so run get elected and make it mean somethingor would that distract you from making idiotic troll threads on the forums you stupid attention seeking dumbass
yes i can  its called habitual drinking
thanks for representing the player base in iceland at such short notice i know that real life must have got in the way to do this for us and im thankful that you took time to go out therethanks for taking notes and communicating the notes back to us
i so totally agreecan we meet ingame once this is out i like your moustache  bet it tickles when doing a 69 
sad but true
you sir are a raging soe tooli wish you much misfortunekoba
nex clothes are fully destructable nex manufacturers however understand the dangers that pod pilots face and when you buy them you get two sets one for your current clone and one for your medical bay one when you get podded you get to claim an new replacement from the manufacturer and that has to be shipped out at considerable cost and thats why the damn things are so expensive you are actually buying a lifetimes supplyimplant manufacturers do not do it because the cost of a single implant would make it prohibativethey dont show on the killmail because nothing on the podkill shows but rest assured pvpers when you pop that pod you definately scortched that guys skirt
can i get a link to back this up as something beside an idea you came up with please
really trebor at what point exactly did you think that was even a little relevant lots of us have done meaningfull things in their lives perhaps even more meaningfull then writing computer games and helping to create the anime market in the uswho knows some people here work for nato or the eu fund cancerresearch or even work at hospitals its time to get of your high horse thats actually a small pony from up here and get to grips with the fact that you need to do more then just rehash pr info this goes for the rest of the csm alsoeverything in eve can be destroyed even nex items when they are in the hangar of your ship thus they should also be destroyed when you lose your podship and are wearing them00 isnt the most important thing in eve it has become the most important thing because all the rest is broken with skewed rewardrisk ratios we need to balance the whole of eve not just 00for instancefaction warfaremining get a decent mechanic like reynirs deep sea trawlingfishing ideamission running there has been some input on that front
why was this stickied
you werent aware that you get more than one set whenever you die your clone wakes up with the clothes not just once you also arent aware that some implants actually are cheaper than nex clothing items then if you ran the total cost for a full outfit shirt jacket boots accessory etc it could easily be more than the implant costccp it is nanobotswhat about implantsccp nanobots cant do implantswhat about monoclesccp those are different being that they go in your eye and cost so much cause you wouldnt want some cheap pos in your head like an implant that costs only a few dozen isk like inside your brain manright
how about you try to make an argument in your next post 
try posting a factual one first then well talk
i would love more remaps even if i had to buy a plex to get them
you think lets seepeople onlinesource 
this is the last time i will try and explain it to you allthe issue is not that they are cloaked cloak mechanics do not need to changethe issue is the tactic is not having the desired effect people have become so used to it that while some folks post threads like this over all going into a system and cloaking and walking away from your keyboard is not causing the effects it shouldyes all the countering tactics running with friends ect get used when a cloaky comes into system thats not the issue the issue is that while it disrupts a system and causes a little grief and lowered production it in no way causes the effects that it shoulda cloak in system should stop that system in its tracks while folks try and find him bait him kill him work at protecting assets ect thats what i want to see change the cloak doesnt need to change just the afk portion of it untill the afk portion of the tactic changes it will continue to be just an annoyance and thats the part i want to see change i want to see this be more capable then what it is of disrupting a system for those that asked i would create hours of fraps for intel for systems that i wanted to take down any good tactician gains as much information as he can before launching an attack you also dont need fraps there are programs out there that can read the info displayed on your screen and put it in a text format sit 130 off a gate cloaked up walk away and you get to see what kind of ships come into system how long they where there by having local logged properly to see who was in system
seems to me the simple solution to the afk cloaker is requireing cloaks to actual use cap to generate a system that reflects the universe around you should require a great deal of energy to accomplish  this way it requires the cloaker to to recharge cap while decloaked and gives the carebears time to hunt him down  bahahaha who am i kidding they will still hide and whine  but still this is a sound solution to the issue 
and how is this different from say neutrals in local who are afk when you are miningmissioning in lowsecthe answer is that it isnt different at alltherefore the annoyance is just something you have to deal with when you are not in highsecso nothing needs to change here except maybe that everyone who cannot deal with this annoyance should move back to highsec using the standard counter tactics that have already been mentioned many times in the thread
why are you avoiding my questions

i skipped over most of this thread as it is a well known topic but i had to add my 002 iskafk cloaking is just another form of espionage or covert ops it is no different than the police leaving an old squad car parked under a bridge or along the side of the road it will deter speeders even if there is no cop in the car it is one of the jobs cov ops ships such as recon ships are made forthe ones that do this are generally the same characters in the same areas after a while you will get to recognize most of them and know when you see them in local they are usually afk the truth is many do not do this to disrupt the system but do it for gathering intel for their alliance i have done this not actually afk but to everyone else it would seem i was afk i have several accounts and when i am busy in fleet with one account i often will place characters from the accounts i am not using in cloakies and stick them in nearby hostile systems not to disrupt the system i have no intention of ganking miners or rattersunless i get bored but i do it for intel so i can alt tab over occasionally to see what is happening in the system if a counter fleet is gathering there or not a good fleet commander always has scouts in the surrounding systems that they expect a possible counter attack from the best way to avoid a surprise attack is to see them coming watch the systems you know they will be coming from if you see a spike of reds in local there is a good chance they are headed your way maybe your fleet can even go after them before they get organized and ready to fight there is nothing like catching a fleet while they are forming up before the logi guys are ready it always means a few easy kills before they get there  togetherjust my 002 isk but try to understand why players do things before you go and rage about it
mags i already answered your questions along with a lot of other folks i dont want to see the cloak mechanics change at all i want to see the tactic cause more chaos and problems for the folks in the systems in return for that i want the cloaker to actually have to be at the keyboard being sorta afk is fine your still on another account and changing back to it your still at the keyboard with changing it to where you cant afk cloak it provides us with a lot more disruption gives us the chance to try and bait you disrupts the system 10 times better then what it does now generally provides more fun for all of us i would rather spend an hour trying to bait said cloak to kill them then to know that they are afk and be stuck in my normal activities all the timeso in shortmake it to where you have to be at the keyboard in return you all get better disruption of systems and more accurate intel on a systembenefit for the pvper better disruptions of the systems allowing you to prevent industry level gains and better disruption of rattingbenefit for the carebear knowing that the cloaker is active and therefore allowing you to do the normal hide or to actually start getting into the pvp aspects of the game
ohh and mags me thinks your looking at it from me complaining about the tactic being used on me its actually the other way around i am looking at using the tactic and what i would like to see happen
they should remove cloaks and probes from the game so its just like it used to be way back
no
cosmetic onlyand to op if you can get rid of the obvious biased words from the original post you might earn a better attention to ccp you might not like mt but you dont need to be immature about it
it is not what is already in game that is the problem yes you can buy plex and sell them for isk and use that isk to buy what ever you want but this does not hurt the game economy you are basically buying game time and trading it to someone for in game stuffcurrency this actually supports the game economy as the isk generated from the plex was worked for buy who ever bought the plex and the items bought with that isk were made by someone else in game so plex effectively remove isk from the game helping to curb market inflation the items bought with that isk were made or looted by someone in game who put them up for sale it comes full circle and supports to in game economy the thing many players are affraid of is mt directly for items means players willing to spend real life money can obtain them with no benifit to the other players in game this is not a problem with vanity items but what if you could buy the whole ship with the new skin for aurum this puts a ship into the game that nobody built and with no benefit to the in game economy the current plan as i understand it is for those new ship skins to cost aurum plus the normal skinned ship purchased or made in game which is not a problem but every other mmo that has introduced mt has eventually started to sell items that did effect the game it start with xp potions or in eves case probably some implant that speeds up training time then moves on to unique weapons and eventually the best in game items are only available through mt and can not be earned or made in game this is what most of us are worried about not what they are saying now but what will happen down the road

well done ed  very well thought out  kudos 
the lag issue really bugged me which is why i thought the minefield would be better than reintroducing individual mines and with three sizes and three damage modes with in each size it would allow for greater customization of the defenses without making it too overpowered and while still keeping it dangerous for both the owners and the victims
would love a little gallente love
strict gallente supported ccp balance up please ladies and gentlemen
it would be nice if cpp did something gallente suck arse atm
i read in another thread where someone suggested having a cargo rig type structure that could be anchored anywhere frieghters could dock here to loadunload cargo he also suggested having it so you could add modules and such although i like the idea it seems a little far fetched i have also read some players suggesting making poses so they could be anchored in dead space so i think that this might be a cool idea for t2 poses let them anchor anywhere no moon required give them more ehp less power gridcpu and maybe a built in hanger this way by sacrificing a little power gridcpu you can anchor them anywhere filling this niech sugested by the cargo rigplatform idea a t2 pos would be perfect for this there would of course have to be restrictions like can not anchor within say 1 au of a cosmic signature or asteroid belt or whatever you could anchor a t2 pos at a safe spot or in deep space where the only way it will be found is through scanning maybe even add a defensive module that makes it harder for probes to detect these poses could be used as deep space depots or to make jump gates harder for the enemies to find i would think the power gridcpu penalties would be high enough so you can not run capital ship manufacturing there but then again why not freighters can load cargo at a pos so these could be used as safe spot docking stations for freighters just a thought but what do you think about the idea

on may 9th ccp made an every question answered thread they poorly estimated that they could answer all questions within a week or so two months later small groups of answers are still trickling here and there i check it every few days on the second page of the answers that are posted so far is thisi was curious to see what that new effort link was all about it was a lengthy thread which then lead me to this thread in my mission to find the most current discussion on fw and these unanswered questions i personally asked a questions about fw on the initial questions thread and am waiting their response they are not exaggerating about the many fw questions asked there are a surprising number of themanyway long story short i have been given the impression that ccp has something to say about fw in addition to the response above i think it was referenced in a recent video or during the tournament and i give my support to efforts made to make progress or at least get the answers on fw
anything that might result in ccp fixing the broken mess that is fw is worth a thumbs up
agreed with op and rodj
i too was drawn in interest in this however being told to find other pursuits as you cannot fulfill some of the objectives due to mechanical fractures means the game content has been broken in an update and never repaired our corp leadership discussed this as a fun thing to do in the future but we will not ask players to embark upon a content that is broken
sorry i fully support fw  ccp bought me off with the missions good things1 free war dec2 missions for income bad things3 occupancy mechanicsnot sure theres anything you could do with the occupancy mechanics although heres an idea i had the locals in low sec are tired of giving their allegiance to an empire that spends more resources on fw pilots than they do on protecting their space this is going to change1 expand occupancy mechanic to all of low sec and all of npc null sec2 occupation gives you minor bonus for stations in system ratting anomolies something like 5 boost in payouts3 change occupancy to include all corporations and all alliances that do not hold sovereignty in 00  including the current fw factionsso heres the mechanic 1 plexes operate and respawn the same way they do now however2 plexes arent run by proxy navies they are not filled by empire navy factions they are filled by the pirate factions in the area 3 plexes are capped by killing all rats in it no spinning buttons plex closes when last rat is killed 4 the corporationalliancefw faction that kills the last rat earns points towards occupancy the local civilians recognize whoever takes down the most plexes in the last 30 days as the top dogs because these factions have helped clear the systems of evil pirates and they give bonuses out to them these could be pirate corps rp alliances whoever doesnt hold 00 sovthis way many small corps small alliances rp groups whoever can have some fun fighting for something without having to join an empire faction alliance fw alliances are still around and still in the mix but others participate too
supporteddepending on the market conditions you can make up to 180m iskhr from cyto gases my most profitable hours in eve have been cyto sucking and c1sor ninja salvaging i support this because firstly we will get a new chance for an invent a starship competition throw it open to the eve community to design a cool gas ship secondly if you have a dedcated salvager ship you may as well have a dedicated gas ship thirdly it gives the devs an ability to look at the booster market and lowsec aka mylhanis idea for the mobile redneck drug lab of lowsec in a new lightfinally it will make wspace more vibrant and deeper because the gas mining specialists would have something new to devote a month of training towards even if the ship buff is something as banal as extra cargo per level of skill
thumbs up if you want pod squishes back
this would certainly give navy ships some love  which im all formore importantly it would keep pirate ships out which in turn makes the plexes more fun for t1s which have a much better chance against navy ships as well as force veteran players to fight on more level ground1
problem no problem already supported this most noble endeavourdestroyers are awesome when done right but i eat them in t1 frigs if they are fit or lowskilled and walk all over them in navy frigs so can only imagine that pirate frigs will barely notice they are thereif on the other hand it is t2 fit and flown by a skilled pilot you are no longer in noob territory as price is quite high and they take more than xx sp to fly properly  gives my slicers a run for the money thoughsame issue with all ship hulls really they are accessible quite fast but youll end up dead in a hurry if you jump the gun and board itps wont support with this secondary main because it is dishonest so hah
i support making pirate faction counted as t2 i do not support making navy faction count as t2 no excuse for not using navy anyways tbh that  is basically free to everyone in fw
yup this does make the most sense as long as we still get a god damn fix on the spawning
these are the parts of the argument that make me not want to see this sort of thing in game in a general sensebut at the same time i stand that like ive said before this isnt really the promonetary componentforsp conversion proposala reminder that i am an 06 character and ive done it the hard way all along and enjoyed it ive had plenty of great n00b experiences and this isnt about thati dont want anyone over some arbitrary value say 10m sp to be allowed to apply purchased sp you bought 10m apply it to one char bought 20m apply to two and so on but not on any one 10msp is just an argument sake additionally i would certainly not want to see sp spent in any category over a 3x skill set meaning if its a 4x category no purchased sp allowed herethey already have lock outs for skilling up for trial accounts so there is code for it etcbut the point severe limits and high dollar price tags allow such a thing as an avenue for some folk this isnt about the rich brat hell have to spend his rl monies on isk and whatever few sp or go to the bazzar and spend the same on that 10msp char someone else squatted and skilled up difference being limits in place the bazzar still had trade value for over whatever amount of sp no high sp n00bs running around except the bazaar ones of course  and no instatitan pilotsthat isnt the plea here the plea is my friend who shows up in a t1 frigate and the other 10 or so of us in 2 year sp afrigssbsfits he cant play with us and all this ends up doing is promoting a squatter in the fleet earning standings while he plays l1s or mines tiddly winks this creates a frustration for the new guy as older players we are more than happy to train them in the way of playing fitting learning the system etc but they get frustrated and just leave ive already lost 3 buds to the whole eh dont want to listen to you guys having fun when its going to take me 35 months to get into something that lets me run in those same missions with youmy only other alternative to this is an idea of buddy pilots no sp for sale ok but perhaps the half way point is pilots get a new skill leadership protectorate which allows us oldtimers to add if interestedwilling to train it up and grants us some simply there passive like siege warfare standard et al and grants stupid high resists to t1only fitted frigs while within 20k and some age over normal damage if aggression timer kicks in  kill the bonus aka neuter the temptation to exploit for gank festsshrugs
you have a point here there is a problem with noobs fleeing the game because they cant figure out how to have fun quickly enough but i do think that this may not be the solution to that problem as buying sp can be abused so maybe what we need is for some 1 time only noob training missions which give out sp boosters which are 1 time use for boosting specific skillstrees specific because we want to limit them to be used on say only 1x and 2x skills and they cannot be used by players over a certain sp also the skill branches they can be used on would be reflective of the career path training agent they got it from the sp limit on use will prevent them from being resold as they will be of no use to experienced playersanother idea is to make the sp usable only on skills that are in the beginner profession certificate skill trees so the military traning agent mission paths upon graduation gives a bonus of soldier sp that can only be used on skills in the soldier  basic certificate treethough as someone pointed out the number that do stay keep the growth of the player base positive
thanks for thinking with me not looking for skill point giveaways just looking for ways to get folks that are willingable to have an out for a boost that helps get them into the game in some way plugging into the larger old timers crowd is a hard step when you know they spent 47 years getting there and no matter what you do you will have to spend that time to play with widget x its a bit daunting to newcomers and try as i might to point out lower level ships and toys are often plenty useful its easier to say that from their perspective when you have the choiceagree outright large scale sp sales is not a solution its too pragmatic without concern for longer term consequence if its done without some pretty serious limitationsthis is some thinking on our part the players to help ccp with creative juices rather than leaving it to them to solve something on their own not that they cant  but we would like more players and would like to see the longer term success of the game and perhaps help maintain some momentum in their success so us old timers have game to play later if its slow growth its still growth no one has made the argument that i read in this thread anyway that we should open the flood gates of sp sales uncheckedbut to be clear i dont make any argument that all new players see all new players leave thats silly but i have experienced personally several who just arent interested unless there is something that allows them to at least participate with their buddies that already have much higher sp its fun enough they want to and ive even convinced a couple to stay by going tot he bazaar and getting a character that way but they arent always sure of that as an out as not many are willing to fly around with the name fluffy mcsimpleton or whatever perhaps a start might be aur purchasable renames but thats another disaster waiting to happen as well i fear perhaps rename on character xfer for an extra 50 or some such shrugs again just trying to think a way through all of this to allow new comers to have some way to plug in with a more meaningful way that makes them feel like they are plugged in

lol wow you are one sad little man d nonetheless your original tears over your very own up remain for all to see
the suggestion was made that i neednt gain aggro before docking i said i often do need ecm modsdrones or combat drones though if i need to bring them out my chances are usually very slim but  it ill try anything to escape   to escape you then said why would you have to worry about using ecmdronesetc if the purpose is to break the lock so you can warp i basically said the upshot is if you cant see why id sometimes need to gain aggro to get away from an attempted gank youve obviously never had someone try to gank youso really  what are you on about and why are you trying to call me a troll youre the one suggesting i never fight back which makes no sense in many situations where im scrammed
the amusing part is that you think im upset the sad part is that you and a few others feel that anyone who makes a suggestion does so for selfish reasons sorry to harm your world view but not everyone is a self centered prick like your selfas for the issue of the thread thanks for participating 
it obviously bothered you enough to post this thread then spend 5 pages defending itsounds like youre kind of upset to me this is a well known tactic and you made multiple errors that resulted in your death let me reiterate you lost this fight through your own stupidity not because of the orcas ship maintenance bayyou are also quite hypocritical the guy flipped you in a vigil i note that when you ran back and grabbed another ship you didnt pick up a t1 frig to give him a fair fight you brought back a t2 shiplets break that down you are mad because the pirate switched into a superior ship after you switched into a superior shipnow lets go down your mistakes first you engaged a a can thief this is a mistake because the only reason people will steal from your can in a mission is to get you to aggress which means he expects to be able to win now do you really think a vigil stands much chance of killing a mission bs before he ran off or you blew his ship upno the vigil was used to get dumbasses like yourself to engage thinking youll get an easy kill any reasonably intelligent individual would know that he would be using a different ship for actual combat you didnt which is my justification for the first sentence in this paragraphyoure idiocy in this case is slightly mitigated by the fact that you grabbed a different cheaper ship to actually engage him inyoure next mistake was not recognizing what the orca landing in the mission pocket meant this is a very commonly used tactic which you should have known about even so it was an unknown variable in the situation and that change should have been enough for you to reevaluate the situation and decide to gtfo youre final mistake and the one that cost you your ship is that as soon as you lost lock and he switched ships that should have been your signal to gtfo it was going to take a couple seconds to lock and you could probably get outside of point range and warp away in that time you were in an interceptor so its not like it would have taken you long to align to warp outas far as using the orcas maintenance bay being a cheesy tactic sure but its just one more in a long list of cheesy tactics he could just as easily warped back to a station to have his bigger ship ready when you got back from grabbing your intyface it youre just mad because he out thought you you thought you would be the one to get an easy kill but instead he turned the tables on you but please do cry moar your tears are quite tasty
opposedthis comes down to housekeeping  both of your wormhole and within your corporation1 dont let them build up ie be active and utilise them spawn the crappy ladars so they disappear spawn your gravs if you dont need them and you wont have this problem2 organise your incorp intel somehow via motds in intel channels web applets googledocs spreadsheets whatever it takes
seems you talking about owning systems or equivalent but there are some vagabond or freelancer in every sec lvlUFFFDs tooplay a game to use as many outofgameutilities as possible while a relativ simple database change could prevent this well yes your suggestions are possible and used already but i think they schouldUFFFDt be needed and something like a customizeble boardcomputer would proof the game experience too not even for roleplayers the more i think about the more usefull capabilities i can find make them useble with scripts that can be bought on the marked some business scripts for trader or a roidfield database for miners and so oni dont like starting my browser to get informations as fast as possible i like to explore some roidfields und mark those who have valuable oreUFFFDs in it but not on a google sheet or else those technics are more for real life actionsbut yes fleetcorpalliance sync could be possible toohave to edit going away from topic a bit but i think it starts with static signature names
as ive bought a new graphic card ive seen ctrlf my fps are much higher than 60 as 60 is the maximum my monitor can show the rest is power wasterid like ccp to introduce to the client a new option where you can limit fps to a certain custom maximumwhat do you think about it
60 fps is about the average limit the human eye can detect tooim curious though what do you hope to gain in limiting the fps to 60 you dont lose anything by going above 60 your hardware consumes the same amount of power if its rendering 5 fps or 5000 fps
i can monitor temperature and fan revs of my graphic card on fixed window mode if i click on eve client it goes to a 150fps average monitor still showing 60fps on the other hand if i click out of eve client the average fps goes down to 60 and so my temp and revs of the graphic card do this is a prove that not limiting client to the maximum of your monitor can show its power wasted graphic waste and energy waste as heat
graphics options  present interval  interval one seems to set vsync for me
heythank you that was what i was looking forsolvedtopic can be closed
new to the game new players to the game with no isk cannot make any money from fw essentially forcing wannabe pvpers to be mission standings grinders for the first 3 months in evethere may be other problems as someone else mentioned but the problem i see is that it has an impossible barrier to entry for new players where as other professions can support themselves for new players
exactly my point and though lvl4 missions make money in fw or normal missioning that isnt the problem the problem is lack of a beginner  err new player  profession path for pvpers fw was supposed to be it but it fails in that regard horribly 23 jumps to do a lvl1 mission that can get you killed and not enough reward to even cover the loss of your shipsother professions have easy noob pathspve  missioningindustry  miningexploration  salvagingtrading  npc commodities all of which can grow your isk and skillspvp  solution may be just to make the lvl12 fw missions pay more i mean they earn so little lp and the number of things you can get at the lp store that are cheap enough for a noob to buy are not really profitable to sell also if it isnt this way already lp should be rewarded for kills so the 2 pronged approach is1 make sure low income players who dont have the standing yet to do lvl34 missions get paid enough to replace their frigatedestroyer class ships2 encourage more shooting of other pcs by rewarding more cashlp for kills though this may affect the veterans so must be careful to balance
interesting that you mention this because i heard it was the opposite the caldari have more numbers in the militia but the gallente top the kill boards followed by amarr i have heard many selfdeprecating jokes from those in the state protectorate about their own inferiority and how many of their numbers are actually spies from the much better organized gallenteans though maybe things have changed
you already said you had no clue or words to that effect when it comes to fw so why go onthanks to the broken fw plexes you can take a t1 frig and get all the standings you want in a matter of days  literally days after that it is bomber training for the lvl4s and you are good to go  you should come see the farcical situation in the fw areas 80 of all ships are alts in bombers going back and forth grinding lp
tldr for each supercap in operation your alliance need to own an industrialized system super carriers require lvl 3 industry and titans require lvl 5 existing active supercapitals can be operated even if they dont have enough systems supporting them but trying to board a supercap without enough systems supporting them will not workpreambleoriginally i had this proposal
it will never work if you try to limit super capitals by some kind of limited access natural resource you will never get support and it isnt realistic or fair to players in generallimiting stuff by sov would work if you could actually win the game at some point but this is persistent mmo so you cannot having limit by sov would mean that bigger alliances would just get bigger and bigger until there was only one left also there has always been supercarriers without allianceseasier way to limit amount of them would be just limiting their abilities and usefulness in general so people just wouldnt use them just check out dreadstheres few things which would reduce number of supercaps on field very quickly and they would also seem pretty logical to me reduce supercarrier offensive capabilities adding fighter bombers for them was a mistake at first place they were suitably strong already and thus their amount in game was sane  reduce titan effectiveness against sub capitals theyre still too effective and most importantly in my opinion normal cynosural fields need to change to have some kind of timer before cyno can be used i could agree with even cynoship moving while doing it as long as there is a timer in my opinion timer should be equal to aggression timer before you can jump or dock to make cynotrapping useless at gates or station undocks that would effectively reduce supercap usage in low sec alsoall these things make sense though so i dont see that csm or ccp is going to support them
you put a lot of thought in but i dont think youll get any support for this i dont fly supers have no interest in doing so and i still dont support it your proposal would restrict supers to those in established alliances in sov space there are a lot of us who prefer the pseudo sov of low npc null and wspace to those mechanics and i see no reason as to why we should be forbidden to have those ships we already cant build them being unable to board one takes it way too farthe solution as said is to reduce their appeal scs are an all in one wonder ship when that changes well see their numbers go down
so the alternatives are either make them unlimited and useless or limited and useful in my opinion the second alternative is betteralso remember that this idea has general advantages when it comes to nullsec industry and small scale warfareand the relative power between the blocks will be kept typically as it looks now the larger your alliance the more systems you have and the more supercaps you have the same will still be true with my suggestion only now supercaps will be something special instead of just meh another titan
you say lvl 5 indy for a titan pls check the eve map and tell me how many lvl 5 indy systems there are atm plslast time i counted i had 5 or so you need 20 hulks mining 247 to get it to lvl 5 and keep it therei think thats kind of hard to doand how are small non 00 alliances ever going to be able to get suppercaps 
why would you want supers in low sec anyway they are more or less expressly built for nullsec warfare i mean if you are going to nerf super carriers anyway why would you as a low sec pilot want to use one if you instead could use a much cheaper carrier with superior rr supportas i see it there is no harm in making the supers nullsec only it defines nullsec and nullsec warfare
as i said it would not be easy to have a large fleet of titans but remember that there is a lot more room in nullsec for industrialists than today part of this suggestion was to get more industrialists out there by giving this as incentivewell as a small nonnullsec entity you wouldnt be able to field supercaps you would just have to take some smaller out of the way system first hold it with regular caps get an industry going and start producing supers
linkagemy take on the issue the bare minimum quickdirty but sufficiently efficient supercapital changes neededall remove ewar immunity or alternatively have ewar modules work at 50 effectiveness against them preferable  add jump drive spool up time not very long under a minute optional  logoff vanishing timers doubled or even tripledsupercarriers also bomberonly bay separate from drone bay which is made too small to fit a fighter change 2 bonus to controlled now only bombers from always on to a 2 boost for one dcu per level
your proposal is interesting but not well thought troughproblem nUFFFD1big alliances will effectively have more suppers than small ones that may even be true for today but what happens if that one alliance keeps winning because of their amount of suppers  as for today one can narrow it down to this statement field more suppers than your opponent and you win the result would be one alliance that rules all of 00 as there is no chance of anyone beating them due to their lack of suppersproblem nUFFFD 2you state that an alliance can only have as much suppers as they have industry 3 zones but every supper that exists will still be operational even without sov so lets beat your system first you build a supper and board is as you got enough sov and kick that char out of the alliance now you got another free space for an suppercap and can go on with that method until the end of time although the second one maces the first obsolete both are still flaws in your system and therefore the hole idea has to be rethought
yes this is a pretty large hole isnt it i didnt think of that at allbut i think it can be fixed with some creative thinking say for example that if you sit in a supercap and move between corps all modules in it get deactivated then the game runs the check every time a module is activated on a supercap this would also prevent refitting of the supercaps as long as you cant support them which may be both good and badbut it sounds like the general consensus is that most players want the supercaps nerfed and unlimited instead of powerful and limited anyway question is if most players know what is best for the gamepersonally i would like to see the supercaps as something special the way ccp imagined them when they were created but maybe its just time to give up on that notion
it wouldnt actually fix that supers are op supers need a nerf which as akita pointed out should start with making sure they cant fit an unlimitted ammount of regular drones and lose some more of their flexibility either by forcing them to use their high slots for dcus but i have also seen other proposals that simply nerfs their ability to fit neuts for examplefurthermore apparently there are 5 industrial 5 systems that are 5 more systems than i expected it is stupidly hard to keep industrial levels on a reasonable level especially since it is trivial to put an afk cloaker in them and simply bridge in a fleet once in a while to obliterate the mining ships you cant defend agaisnt that thats why it is now way more useful to have multiple lower level industrial systemsand then finally you give the dominant 00 powers as only ones the ability o field supers i cant see how that could possibly go wrong
you missed the point i was raising though i have no interest in leaving low sec many new alliances use low sec as a stepping stone to null sec sov in order to take and hold null sec sov you absolutely have to have 50 scs thats just the way it is these days your requirement basically forbids any new alliances from entering null sec except as petssecondly your whole proposal evades the entire problem scs are overpowered make them not overpowered and they will be less desirable due to them requiring a dedicated character slot and being relatively expensive i dont see very many titans running around do you the reason they are less popular is they arent game breakingly overpowered like scs are in fact once you ignore titan bridging the 15b isk scs are superior combat ships compared to 50b isk titans and youre telling me there is nothing wrong with thatscs need a good whack with the nerf bat im not totally opposed to some production restrictions but yours seem heavy handed and skirt around the real issue anyways for production limitations ive always like the unobtanium idea make it so only a fixed number can exist
this is bad  it gives even more power to those who already had it and takes it form those who dont it makes it even harder to lose what you already have and harder to gain space if youre small s whats good about this
i couldnt give a flying fig about burnedens need to safely deploy viz sniping nightmares sniping blops sniper machs or whatever other ship they wish to deploy in kspace at a gate their problem is they are deploying expensive ships to pvp and hate the fact an easy countermeasure exists to increase their risk to the point that it is untenable boo hoo find a new tactic heres the facts if you are sitting within 14 au of someone youre on scan shocking statistic huh if you are in a bs someone needs to get 4 probes within 1 to 2 au of you to get you at 100 if someone can put those probes within 2 au of you regardless of your safespot location they get a warpable on you and voila you are boned their problem in doing so is reduced to zero if you are idling within 200km of a gate if your safespot is not within 250km of a celestial this makes it harder this is especially true if you are not within 1 au and especially so if you are not within 2 au but it does not make scanning you impossible  just harder skilled combat probers can give you as little as 5 seconds of probe time in the water on scan from you assuming they have launched probes off scan this is viz them putting in more effort than deploy on gate hit scan which only works on burneden and other whingers because they have crappy tactics your problem is solved by firstly maintaining dscan coverage of all areas of the solar system and reacting to a combat probe launch accordingly second not idling within 250km of a gate and crying when someone dumps probes on you thirdly running dscan and not relying solely on local to allow you to safe up like my little ponies when someone jumps inif you make probe scan times longer than the current minimum of about 5s with perfect skills then as previously mentioned combat probing is dead real combat probing not the hamfisted idiocy which nullsec and lowsec and hisec fools think is what you do with combat probes as it stands to be safe in wspace you have to mash dscan constantly 10s plus probe warp time would make wspace too safe in short adapt or diaf
exactly my concern with the proposal probing while available to anyone rewards not only investmentsp but experiencemaking changes to how probes work by extending time for instance will exclude all but the leet from partaking and that is not something i want to support willinglyyou have 24 full sets in space at all times one at 05au around target celestial one with 12au range and sets in neighbouring systems reconnect to probes is awesomegangs such as the ones be run must necessarily have safes relatively close to their target area or base travel time makes it so ineffectual that you might as well not botheralternate solution or in conjunction with increase in warpto range  make core probes capable of scanning down probes in general make all probes destructible targetshootlet the cloakndagger crews wage their own little war behind the scenes has to be cores to open door for using probes as bait so no point in having ships show when probe hunting 
not only is your post full of factually wrong information you can get a 100 hit on a bs with probes at 8au just fyi but you are ignoring mainly due to the fact that you were somehow manhandled by be at some point in time the fact that the probing changes completely negated an entire fleet type fleet sniper bs and what these new probing times have done to on grid combat probing 2 forces on the same grid usually each will have a prober in fleet with probes deployed on grid giving a 100 hit in 5 seconds to the other fleetthis has pretty much changed the face of battleship combat to be either arty abbadons or arty maels there is no reason to bring anything else to a fleet fight as there is no reason to be able to hit farther than either of those ships is currently ablealso you should stop being so mad that people think of thingsspend money on things that you are unable to it shows all over your post
i dont know how you achieved such poor results but my forays into dronespace via a k346 static c3 was incredibly profitable just stop holding onto the lowend drone poo
i donUFFFDt see any need to buff drone space drone space is owned by drf drf are the worst botusers in eve bots run 247 problem solved
awesome idea then the russians wil have even more isk to sell fully supported
my bad youre right i misunderstood still i think stripping racks  ability to lock  unlock modules would be better similar to how you can offline a module in the circular fitting window you get a padlock symbol that you can toggle for modules so your ewar boat can have everything but jammers locked click strip rack refit jammers you want your mission ship can have everything but hardeners locked click strip fit refit hardeners you wants the op does say racks not modules ill support this these are simple ideas that are a convenience and dont change gameplay
mittani has already stated this is to manipulate the market and allow 00 control over the prices of high end minerals ofc since him and his crappy coalition are burning i cant see how this will benefit him
this would be nice but have a limited number of usage like the attribute remap actually not number of skills you can uninject but rather the times you can do thatwhat do i mean once you enter uninjection mode you select what skills you want to eliminate and then exit this mode you can remove as many skills as you like but only once every year or so should be good for new players who realise that mining isnt that much fun after all also unless youre a noob say less than 2m sp 1m you have to pay for this isk or aurum but this would really cause a lot of disturbance in the force
none of the csms who made it to iceland for the peace conference have lives if we had lives we wouldnt have been able to make it
using a 2 month old char one could get the idea that csm feels the need to stroke their own egos or that this is meant in an ironic way
keep the option to have it disabled
first of all i would like to give ccp some time they still havent finished the other cqs for gods sake yet we complain bla bla bla okay complaint hat is on or rather what id like to see happening in the near future1 customisation youve mentioned this previously but i want to stress out that this is the most important thing of having your own quarters an extra couch the ability to buy a new room for your cq to stash your drugs dog tags damsels slaves or for those with the relating fetish frozen corpses p okay obviously that would be a bit hard but the ability to have an extra room with an extra couch or bed or whatever you choose to add would be really nice2 the tv screen first of all you should all know that you can import your own videos to watch on the screen out of game theres a video on youtube with someone watching my little pony in his cq p aside from that we should be getting more important information such as agent missions corpalliance messages calendar events the calendar atm is useless imo they need to make it more obvious
hey you did it again tyvm for making all players wanting to quit asapkeep it up pirates
care to elaborate did i miss something
i dont really give a  about vanity items being destructible or not sorry
my questions aresince mittens is a goon and touborg is a goon and both spies to boot why doesnt that clear conflict of interest raise all kinds of warning flags with ccpwhy is this council so deferential to alex he gets drunk throws up insults people makes silly recommendations such as the wh nerf makes it clear he has no interest in the game or the playerbase as a whole only the interests of his alliance and acts like hes the smartest guy in the room please tell me hes not the smartest guy in the room am i missing somethingwhats being done about bots if ccp has no plans to get rid of bots could i please have a bot buttonmodule so that i can passively earn say 50m iskhr without doing anything i dont think that would be very difficult to program correct me if im wrongthose are enough questions i guess obviously youre incapable of getting ccp to devote any more than the pitiful trickle of resources they devote to internet spaceships now so i take it that finished content is out optional incarna is out a firm commitment on microtransactions is out an apology from hilmar is out  trying to think of something constructive you guys have accomplished or might conceivably accomplish in the next 6 months  nope i guess theres nothing
excuse me i dont throw up x
cool story bro
werent you voted in to represent the players or was that a lie so you could just get the game just the way you wanted itare you really this big a douchebag in real life or just on the internet wow what an as shole
i love you too mittens
you better watch it or mittens will get all ragey and accuse you of being part of the tea party or some vast rightwing conspiracy that threatens to take down his serious interwebs spaceship empirebut then again comments like his are what happens when you vote in a manchild
mumble server still down 
i voted for trebor and he has at least acted professional on the net and in his official paid capacity as csm and yes csm are paid by the free year account which obligates them to rep all the players including us whining forum residents our money spends just like the next playerwhen i saw mittani tell someome to kill themself on twitter while acting as a player rep he lost all credibility as a rep and is an embarrassment to whats being salvaged as a community mmorpgcom i believe it was even censored some of his unprofessional commentary coming out of the crisis meeting perhaps some dale carnegie reading is in orderif you dont want the scrutiny dont take the lead and claim to speak for the whole community pass it on to someone who acts as professional as the situation demandsthe kind of attitude he presents is perfectly fine for somethingawefulcom and it seems he is incapable of seperating the environments
csm are unpaid volunteers unless you want to count free subscription as pay
thanks for sharing your wellreasoned factsupported opinion with us
this
there have been problems getting the mumble server working it is up now but dns may not have propagated sufficientlyif you are having trouble connecting try using the ip address 75101186255 instead of csm6org
that works i am in
hmm just get a 210556 server connection failed the remote host closed the connection default port appears to be 64738 is that right
falseif i want to go to a party in jita and im in amarr i have to fly with my fancy clothes to get there so i do have a reason to buy the clothes and take them in spaceunless i want to keep my clothes in one place and buy a suit at every station then i have to take my party clothes with meif im going out pvping im not going to take out the 80 monocle just like i dont take out a panther everytime i want to go out for a stroll in a rifterso yes they should be destructible and yes they should make it easier to switch clothes out
default windows install also installs a backwards compat version which is only 11x doh in now
can someone please walk me through how to connecti have tried using the ip address you provided i have tried using csm6org mumble forces me to put a port  what port  should i puti am currently using the default one that came with mumble version 123 windowsi keep getting connection timed out
yep it forces you to have a port the same way a bicycle forces you to have wheelsthe op says default port so lets assume its the default port the server doesnt seem to be answering though so its probably down for some reason
maybe ccp will let you pay a premium price20 per item for a license to have your clothes made at your location and available to you wherever you go as well as clothing outfit slots so you can save 20 or so then pay more money to save more fits neither are gamebreaking or required to play barbie in space dressup

thats the issue old players not wanting new players in the game while i cannot support this issue due to the fact that in the end it is buying skill points just getting them over a longer period of timethe idea that new players should not come into the game is wrong new players are what allow the game to continue to grow and stay alive should we cater to the new players no i say this as being a new player however we should make eve interesting enough to encourage them to play and continue to play the older players while they should not be necessarily nice should be the ones to come up with the ways to get new players in the game and keep them in the game the whole attitude of the older players is what is honestly driving players away from the gameits not enough to point out why an idea is bad and come up with an counter argument or even a way to make the idea viable you all trash or wardec the player that came up with the idea seriously there have been some decent ideas that have been posted that while not viable and i cannot support have a merit of truth to them and could become viable if everybody worked together to make them viable instead of just trolling
i was actually thinking reversedturn in a remap for a plex say play 12 months you get 1 month free or a remap
like when there were dual mwd cruise missile spewing kessies
personly i think they should remove local and put in new probs that can do nothing other then prob out active cloaks both other wise bos and other stealth ships become to powerfullbut at the same time i think it should take like 510 mins to prob out a cloaked ship too and you cant prob out any other ships becouse the probs should only be able to find active cloaks and nothing alse have to pull thoughs probs back and relauch the normal combat probs for ships and thoughs probs should not be aloud to find cloaksbut thats just how i feel about it i dont feel you should be 100 safe and unprobable no matter what and you diffently should not be in open space and be 100 safe and afk and still know your ship is going to be ok ether
youre only 100 safe while cloaked once you have to move your ship out of the system or undock if you docked earlier youre subject to the dangers of gate and station campsbut really  the fud that cloakies seem to inspire is largely undeserved with a little awareness and organisation its easy to protect ones self while ratting or mining its having to actually lift a finger that bothers the 00 carebears  theyre worse than highsec carebears who at least know the realities of highsec
no you haventbut this is all pointless argument now as local is being nerfed
i dont see the problem with afk cloaking furthermore i dont see how someone who is possibly not even at their computer has a tactical advantage the only people who this ever really seems to upset is 00 ratters in faction fit battleships who log off when a cta gets called htfu
and cavalry ravens yes please
this is the direct counter to your botting so sorry if ccp cannot stop it then afk will save us all from robotsedit oh no these guys not at their computers are preventing me from making isk while i am not at my computer tragedies
not supported caldari hybrid ships are even worse then their gallente counterparts and not a word about them in the op
i thought gallents were kicking ars i mean super caps wtf right whats better then a fleet of nyx hiting the battle field to rip it apartno for real you got my support becouse other then super caps and carriers gallents sux ars
or alternatively if the cyno ship is destroyed after the check is made but before the jump takes place have the jumping capital ship appear at the point where the cyno ship was last located ie at the time the check was made instead of at a random location
10 minutes to kill the cyno ship is not enough time time to play a different game due to your terribleness me thinks
i support thisas far as i know you can not start self destruct after you lite the cyno but you can activate the self destruct and then lite the cynothis makes it so you can control how long the cyno is up by how long is left on your self destruct timer when you lite itit defeats the whole purpose of having cyno show on over viewthe 10 minute time lapse and having the one liting the cyno locked there for 10 minutesthis is an exploit that needs fixed

give me boobies or give me death
noteworthy ideas but i imagine ccp intends to bring back the original ship spinning with an ability to enter cq as its alpha version originally allowed see the original videos for incarna several years ago an option of which is default loaded will be available in the menuas for an animation though everyone is clamoring for one it will likely never come  or certainly not soon as any veteran can tell you and really a 6mo char there is one video in eve  and its not actually in the game its prior to it there isnt a single ingame video anywhere  no cinematics nothing the cq is the first real introduction of this on the screens  which are just simple displaysas neat at an exitenter pod animation would be  players would turn it off after the third undock eve is an impatient society may have something to do with waiting on skills we got so impatient that scotty was fired and apparently had most of his clone brothers bioprocessed the original is probably still out there somewhere  maybe sansha abducted him and thats why incursions take so long to spawn and despawn
doing my best to avoid the infamous we because i cant speak for the playerbase and if under the right conditions sometimes for myselfits safe to say that the majority of the players who have been involved in fw or still are would like to see faction warfare updated in some form or fashion to an actual feature  not a war status as united way would say not for profit is a tax status not a business strategy faction warfare needs a boost both in content not necessarily in rewards like ships or modules but mechanics as well as differentiation  that is to say fw pilots should feel like they are engaging in a different kind of pvphow this should be accomplished is not the topic of this thread and i will not address your idea  it needs to go to features and discussion forum for that matter all faction warfare threads should be in fi since it is a feature i have created this thread specifically to ask the csm to involve themselves in this process actively and get the ball rolling a feat ccp is notorious for not doingi ask that you support this thread as a show that you too wish to see the csm take an active stance in the promotion of further developing faction warfare into a defined feature of eve online if not a career choice like missions piracy mining manufacturing etc there is after all a career agent dedicated to explaining the basics of pvp thanks
needs to be moved to features and ideas forumas for the typical response  another more efficient ship will only cause gas harvesting to further drop in profitability as if it could reach new lows the idea that struck me as best is approaching this issue not through ships but modules or additional boostersone such proposal called for the total removal of attribute enhancing implants and replacing them with legal boosters that last a set amount of time coming in various strengths and duration which fleshes out the market and manufacture of them the booster effects would then be interrupted by poddeath or change of clone much like implants behave now the point was that gas would get a boost in usefulness throughout the game hisec particularly players wouldnt be so frightful of death because boosters could be cheaper being duration based not permanent and pilots who regularly engage in combat could utilize shorter duration but also cheaper boosters when out of combatpvp pilots arent know for flying around with a 5 set  but they might use 5 boosters when they arent actively in combat again all of this should be in the features and ideas forum so devs will be more likely to read and comment on it they are much more passive in the ah since topics are for the csm
got my support and for the guy talking about how heavy it is to hull did you forget thats with all mining
many players dont know what the pod squish is find a youtube clip or something so they actually hear it and edit into optons of players didnt know old cyno and didnt really care until someone finally linked it  thus followed the omg epic want nowz threads that of course have yet to be sated but thats another story
when you kill a pod it would go squish quite why you need a youtube vid for something your imagination can do in a split second i dont know
eve has soundi will actually turn sound back on for thisdo this nowtia
navy faction frigs fill the role of combat interceptors so comparing them to afs is kinda moot even though they can give some afs a good run for the moneyfiretail vs claw is up for debate id say firetail is superior in general due to slot layout or rather more flexibletaranis vs comet mostly on par but comet does come out slightly ahead that is before we consider it has a full flight of replacement drones easily makes comet the better choicecrow vs hookbill honestly the hookbill outclasses the crow to such a ridiculous extend its not even funny how youd chose a crow over the hookbill unless its simply a price consideration is beyond meanyway back to the top
yeah lets do it
i have money that i can splash on stupid things why not pixels and junk you cant afford it well get a job and quit whining and preventing me from spending minelet me spend my way to eve greatness  i can buy officer fit faction bs why not the skills to fly it effectively
the day ccp makes sp appear out of thin air and sells it i quityou want to buy skillpoints go buy plexs and buy a character off the character bazaar
yes
supported
thats some buttons i could use for sure
definately
your error along with the rest of your ilk is the assumption i am mad about loosing the fight i encountered an imbalance an imbalance i knew existed but had yet to experience first hand now that i have i can speak to itthe annoying thing is this all too common eve tough guy attitude you give me  i throw it right back in your face im not afraid of being called a carebear or shrink in fear from stupid comments like go back to wow etcan imbalance exists in my view it should be addressed you need to defend the cheesy tactic by calling someone names and going after the messenger youre full of  deal with it youre just another fake tough guy sitting behind your screen
no youre not upset are you d youve not spent five pages crying about your stupidity getting yourself killed nor have you abused anyone and everyone who pointed out the realities of the situationpats you gently on your back there there there there life is just so unfair isnt itah dear its just too funny i wonder how long you can be goaded into continuing to embarrass yourself oh and dont hesitate to share your future ups  someone like yourself ought to be a near endless source of amusing pratfalls in eve grins
effect orca pilots cannot allow anyone access to their hangar apart from their own alts since that would be just an open invitation to have your orca flagged and gankedaggro transfer like that does not show in the ui the poor bastard has no way of knowing someone can legally shoot him in hisec or that he will not disappear after logging off in lowsecnullsecwspacenow i am all for griefing and ganking but invisible aggro timers the victim has no chance to notice is just plain stupid
you sure assist flags add the pvp timer for logoff doesnt for rr as neutral logis seem to disappear just fine not hidden timers either as you get the flawed ticker in left handtopthe problem with aggro solution is that the orca is technically innocent as he just happened to be there in his mining support craft with fleet members who just happened to shoot stuff adding the run of the mill docking timer for all maintenance arrays is by far the least intrusive solution will require minimal adjustment to account for in the field except when a whole fleet absolutely positively has to change to frigs mid combat
lol ive nothing to be embrassed by im not the one showing my ass you are you jack offs just cant help your selves too funny keep going 
this is likely the least expensive in terms of code to implement
yes it would just leave the question why a friendly carrier would refuse a friendly ship docking rights for attacking an enemymakes sense for stations and gates as they are neutral entities for ships of your own corpalliancefleet not so mucharbitrary answers like it works better that way dont really cut it here given how wormhole jumpspawn mechanics workedit given that the whole issue is pretty much irrelevant in the grand scheme of things and ontop of that is easily being avoided by just a little common sense i still see no valid reason to touch it
thank you csm for all you do cheersi suggest that a nerf is appropriate only a percentage of the timethough it is the easiest to implement it is also not necessarily conducive to the prosperity of eve or any environmentit es off all the people it affects directly an indirect approach wouldnt catch so much criticism like giving people the power to overcome what you consider needing to be nerfedyou see it in nascar and governments and other environments when considered on a single case basis it makes the best sensewhen reglations are added up over time and considered by the end user or affected parties they are not necessarily positivein balancing a game countering a nerf with increased capabilities to the other parties involved can have the same desired effect without caging the victims with a negative effect its much harder to implement sure the easiest rout is not always the right oneexample i flew in a game called fighter ace it was a combat flight simulator game in the beginning it was very fun over the course of 10 years the most whined about uber killer planes were nerfed at the end of ten years everyone was flying around in bathtubs that wouldnt turn couldnt shoot go fast or take a punch it was boring and the game diedthinking out of the boxroar exodus
i too agree that nerfing 90 webs was bad thing bring back 90 websreally dude
the system needs to be looked at for sure but just paying you a wage to be part of the militia  free isk so that wont work also if your getting major lp or isk for killing pod pilots then what stops them sticking an alt in another militia and farming kills for stuffi love the idea that you get rewarded in fw for getting involved in pvp but you need some pve material too i think it comes back to the issue that plexes need to be totally revamped or axed for a new system i think at the very least pve content in fw should not be doable solo in a stealth bomber it should be more like incursions where you need to work as a small gang team or the whole militia we need a system which encourages people to join fw for what it should be awesome small gang warfare with group pvepvp content
alright let me first say that im not really sure where to post this so ill do it here as the most likely place kindly put this thread in another place if need behere goes i was thinking about a cool gameplay idea that is kinda like the incursion mechanic for prosperity i have named it instabilitynow the basic idea is that just like incursions randomly pop up so too can these system instabilities you then have a choice whether to aid the sovereignty holderconcord or the pirate faction3rd party depending on where the instability occurs the winning side again depending on what initial npcplayer faction started the instability can then convert the security sector into a higher or lower value depending on how overwhelming the victory is for a few weeks or monthsi think that this could make the game a bit more dynamic and make you really feel as if you are changing how the universe is like living in imagine turning jita into a 00 space for a few weeks or a contested 00 area into high sec with concord flying around popping you if you do all the regular things you do out there in lawlessnessbecause of server strainpatcheswhatnot instabilities might not happen all the timeim thinking that every security sector except 10 and systems adjacent to newbie areas should be a viable place for an instability to occurof course this might not even be possible to begin with and i understand that completely however id still like to hear the communitys thoughts about the idea
i can see it now nullsec players getting lolz first absorbing lowsec and then majority of highsec into their empires would make newbie integration into the game impossible considering they would all be packed into only a handful of systems and the game basically becomes about paying everything your character owns in tribute to your nullsec overlords or you can never missionratmine or anything unless your in thier roster
not necessarily if you limit the areas that can be affected for an example a certain amount of systems within a 10 newbie area cannot be destabilized then it should be possible another things is that unlike incursions nobody says that instabilities have to occur all the time once in a while 23 areas could suffer from instability afterwards after a fixed set of time the destabilized system becomes stabilized gain and returns to normal how does that sound
so basically the discussion is weve going from one nearimpossible situation catching an unprobable sniper bs to the show being on the other foot if the snipers are facing competent enemies i can see the call for a happy medium but the fact that fighting in or against sniper bses leaves so little room for error on either side finding that balance is difficult for the term of the unprobable ship the ball has been firmly in the snipers court while i personally enjoy the change i do see the inequality
got my support as is probing a ship down in 5 secs is bs second battle ships this day and age are not much good in pvp other then sniping ya you can use one but you can spend less isk on a smaller faster ship that hits just as hard and is harder to hit and hits more targerts easyeri personly dont care about wormholes though wormholes and the new scaning changes have screwed alot of people over from day one i mean realy scan a hole solar system in seconds in some cases 0km lock in 2mins or less thats just dumb i could drop ccp in 24 squar miles of wheat fields with any gear they wish and they could not find me in 2 days let alone a hole solar systembut i have felt is was edly fast from day one any ways
supported jesus christ if you dont want to support this then maybe you should pull your thumbs out of your arses and actually conisider balancing ships across the board woohoo sniper bonuses in a game where sniping is literally death never mind the rest of the useless ships love your game but ffs fix the blatant gaps
since its obviously you dont seem to grasp the real issue here ill do my best to give you a reply we have no problem that probing exists or that there is a risk involved  that we might be probable in a ss is of no concern to us we have been probable before and it didnt give us much issues unprobable setups as a combatfit came to life basically because of the probing mechanic we have today to be honest i can come up with a bunch of other useful stuff to put on my ship then a bunch of eccm mods the main problem is that probing as it is now makes sniping bs a non viable tactic fear of getting sniped simply deploy probes on gate station whatever and you will have the snipers spot before his warp animation is donethat is not risk that is bad game mechanic you are welcome to come and test this and i can assure you that we will have your ship tackled before you have aligned back out again even in a cruiser
i constantly run into this annoying thing called 150km it practically means engagement range is limited within somewhere approx 75km range from target and that will pretty much count out everything long range but it isnt limited to that it even means that if i have a relatively fast ship and i keep kiting enemy gang they might just warp to just one guy who is fast enough to keep up the pace with my fast ship and warp to their range againi am not feeling intelligent enough to say if its totally bad or not but it surely gets annoying if you try to actually fly in space and then suddenly gangwarpsupporting the general idea for sake of keeping the discussion up
how damn long does it take a company to fix a game sound problem lol really make this game still feel likes its in a beta stage come on fix itsupport please im sure alot of you want this back
i my sound was unbroken with tyrannis was unware people still had major sound issues i do now occassionally get an issue when i start a second game client where it glitches to no sound at all though
i have not had game sound period so it get boring unless i have music on while i play its pretty pathetic really
its weird  you start off with sound then it slowly fades away to nothing over a couple of days so you do a reinstall and lo sound is returned in all its glory then it slowly starts to fade away to nothing over a couple of daysi dont think ccp want us to have sound in this game anymore i know of plenty who have no sound either but we are getting used to it much like you get used to a canker sore or an ingrown toenail
eve has sound
hmm does ccp actually look at these posts at all its not like this post is important or anything sound make the game more enjoyable happy customers mean long time paying customers fact
eve doesnt have soundsi also fully support keeping it that way everything should be possible to notice visually without a sound effect a it helps people who cannot hearb you can listen to radio whatever meanwhile
first we have to consider all who are affected were getting close is there even any truth we dont know ccp could pull mega reserves and compare them to sell orders mega was the only one i recalled that dropped after wormholes i bet there is a reserve not responding to new market pressures cause people overmine it cause of greed even if the reserves are in balance it was good to loosen the null stranglehold besides price the out of region logistics complicated t1 in similar ways to t2 its nice to have highends dropped in empire from small wh operations because i like the effect of null not having a stranglehold on highends i do not support this initiativebeyond t1 convenience t3 would have to rise to compensate its too expensive as it is a cruiser over a carrier price lots of times yeahthere is a process going on the situation is not static so it does not require a nudge if things arent stalled the market can do the work mineral price was balanced by lower demand from the introduction of lag and the balance they did in the drone regions they have stimulated demand with sov changes and work on lag the prices are just starting to rebalance in the opposite manner than they balanced it looks smooth to me so there must be reserves people are itching to sellsome people have lost moongoo income others have taken space and not utilizing it yet no outside rebalancing should be applied at this time
according to the qen for q4 2010 the population disctribution in eve ishisec 7961lowsec 668 nulsec 1126wormhole 245therefore approximately 80 of ccp customer accounts and 80 of the players the csm represents are based in hisecdespite this i have heard little if anything of csmccp thoughts on future hisec developments please could the csmccp enlighten usminutes from the may csm meeting indicate the next expansion is 00 focused to follow the dominion expansion perhaps the csm also expresed a desire in the minutes for nulsec residents to get sole access to abc ores better t2 invention opportunities and to be able to operate with further independence from hisec i saw nothing to suggest ccpcsm have any thoughts on how to enhance the eve experience for the 89 of people not in 00
i will buy sec status from 72 to 19 for 100ccp just give us the option you will make so much money
if being selfserving is a great job then i have to agree they are wonderfull
theyre sure as hell not representing us democratic representation requires accountability and the csm is accountable to no one and they know this which is why you have csms telling players theyre stupid always wrong or calling them whiny and irrelevant and if that doesnt get the point across they just tell players with criticisms to die in a firecsm doesnt really achieve anything meaningful the csm members are however attempting to do something meaningful in the form of suggesting changes and nerfs that will directly benefit themselvesthe first rule of bureaucracy is to perpetuate its own existence the second rule is to secure perks for the bureaucracy members
i read alot of negative responses in the forum to a point where one wonder why some are actually playing eve for my part i think its a really good game richly detailed and fun to play and i want to send a big cheers to the csm and ccp
you said it yourself if people didnt really love this game why would it make them so mad
actually its because people love this game so much they get so mad you donthear anything from the people who doesnt caremany or at least a lot of the people who write in the forums feels ccp have lost touch with the playerbase that they dont play the game themselves anymore one thing that makes this very evident is the new turret icons that are fubar then theres the lack of communications from ccp the mt the forced cq the mail from hilmar the fearless intern ccp magazine plus a number morei am which you have probaby figured out now one of those that love eve and it breaks my heart when ccp is seemingly down prioritizing work on eve to focus on dust 514 and wodbut you are right apart from the above eve is a good game it is fun thank you ccp but csm atm i dont know who they are working for
forever  a future vision world debut trailer 2011  fullhdccps eve  a future vision 1080pfor me if ccp is pushing for their game console and these players can interact with the players from eve this will be exciting so it worth the patience to wait for next coming of dust514 and incarna is a step ahead in this direction
man you got it all wrong and sideways it was said in the devs blogs that at the beginning we would walk around the quarters and not much else so there it is we walk around the quarters personnaly i think incarna is stunning especially the view in the station second of all i play second life and it is a role playing game and a social network as of eve is a mmo so we can see you cant make the difference between a mmo and a rpg
now instead of complaining take a free account on second life download qavimator free shareware and make yourself a nice set of gorean positionsfree animation shareware
you can send an receive evemails already via evegate and reading evemails but not sending them is accessible via the api so you just need someone to make an app that supports that
because it isnt that simple just because you do want a service from someone does not justify bending over and taking anything and everything that is asked for that serviceno one who isnt an idiot has a problem with the concept of vanity item micro transactions the problems however are in that first sentance firstly ccp said they were not going to extend the rmt model outside of vanity items the leaked email said they planned to evolve the nex store paraphrasing secondly the price is not justifiable nothing they are providing in the nex is worth what they are asking nothing fits the bill micro transaction the man power and materials needed to supply these things could easily be paid at 110th of what they are asking no one has a problem with the concept it is the degreeput it this way if you went to buy a litre of milk from me and i asked 30 dollars what would you say you might laugh it off and walk away not letting it bother you you can get your milk elsewhere or you might take offence that i have devalued your money and in turn you by asking out of all proportion what i am offering either is a valid response now imagine that you cant get your milk anywhere else you want milk but you cant get it from anyone else so by your reasoning thats cool to pay me 30 bucks right im not holding a gun to your head so im not forcing you that justifies it rightit may not be up there in the realms of starving orphans and world peace but that doesnt mean it isnt worth objecting tonor is it out of place to ask for an equitable exchange that however is not what i am asking for for this milk and it isnt what ccp are asking for nexactually on an unrelated note i might have a bridge if your buyingthere was also some opinions expressed towards or about the community which has fanned the flames of those torchesnow i am willing to believe the community may have acted prematurely in the non vanity issue the price issue however the facts are right there in front of you just by clicking on one buttonit needs to be emphasized that they only people who are either a arguing against the concept of vanity micro transactions or b making it out to be vital world issue are the strawmanners
hey guys ill be changing up some stuff after i talk to the csm this next week see what shoudl be removed and what will be added
i expect this fireside chat to go as smoothly as getting us the may summit minutes cd
i got to about page 3 of the responses and saw nothing but trolls with bad logic so id just like to say i agree with this position and give you a 1inb4ccpalt
yes indeed and we all know which folks are this csms sole raison detre dont weoh wise supremely cluedin people who didnt even know wormholes are 10rateddont wetell me whats it like being a joke does it rankle awhile and then stop or does that little tingle of knowledge never quite go awaythank you treb your answers along with the minutes are proving mostinstructive
nein
is there a recording out yet or is it still going i just pray it is not another the mittani show like the last one what a colossal waste of time that was
it is another hour or so of mittani performing autofellatio
1111111question is is there such a procedure and would its results be honoured if invoked
really wow some people never learncsm do the rest of the universe a favor and dont bother with another so called fireside chat with the mittani there is enough bull being spread around than to subject us to him doing audio  spreading lies
this is what you get when you vote in the entire goddamned zerosec rmtbot empire chaired by a complete pantsonhead imbecile who revels in being a douchebaggood job community youve made me so prouddont blame me i voted for arden elundul sp whatev you know the suddenly ninjas guy
sorta a troll comment sorryi hope there is a fire side chat on april 1  and wonder what things the csm could come up with and how many people would believe them till laughter breaks out
its okay we knew you were a completely clueless douche already back to something awful for you mate you and your fluffers are quite perfectly irrelevant herepantson head ret4rded cnt
thisoutstanding community welldone on letting that slip by youdont blame me i voted for the suddenly ninjas guy
thanks to csm for doing this it was a very depressing and pessimistic performance but thats not your fault and you are fighting an uphill battle i got some interesting insights thanks for that
i heard more of white tree than mittens but i guess youd rather have your preconceptions confirmed that actually listen to the facts
wow i get that you think you are edgy and hip in some sarcastic profane fashion but as a player elected representative you fail its not about you deciding what the game should be for everyone its about you being professional and trying to represent everyone as you were elected to doyou dosay things like this then expect any respect
was white tree still crying over its free trip to iceland
anywhere we can get the recordings of this chat

just listening to the recordingwhat is ccp gonna sell us as convenience itemsships fitted ships ammo delivered any where more ship saved fittingsare they gonna  anything in the player driven contentyou wouldnt answer that question and id like to know what they are gonna charge for
convenience is a pandoras box though if you offer say ammo delivery for a small fee then that gets around the player economy effort thats a no noany service that could be offered ingame being conjured out of thin air that a player would have had to have provided himself beforehand breaks immersionthat only leaves things that are outside the scope of player interaction like extra ship fittings but the problem with things like that is avoiding the perception that you are simply out to grab as much cash out of the individual as possible for seemingly tiny improvements that should already be a part of your subscriptionperceiving people as greedy is almost as poisonous as mechanics that break immersion
could be but more likely they will start with things that arent obvious market workarounds want extra wallet divisions for your character not corp pay them how about for the corp pay them how about not having to fly out to get a skill book pay them over and above the npc sell price and it will spawn want extra jump clones pay them how about reducing the time to use a jumpclone by 46hrs pay them how about increasing the standingsecurity you gain by a factor of 2 for 2448hrs pay them the point is they will try stuff they think will gain traction with some people and be meh to others always looking towards pushing the envelope to full pay for advantage aka p2w they might not introduce p2w for a while but when dust514 enters it will have pay for advantage and that is the beginning of the conversion to bring it into eve if it isnt already here by then just as plex turned out to be the seed that brought mt into eve for all the good it was supposed to do it will always be the progenitor of mt in eve dust514 will be the point we mark when eve had some claim of not being p2w and when it no longer did for all those that understand what and how plex works of course not the plex is pay to win the people who think like that are okay or say meh to more mt and pay for advantage because they are not cognisant of the difference just as ccp hopes with their ideas that skirt the fine edge to appear to not be gamebreaking or have loose ties to the market to mask the p2w aspects
ea did that with battlefield heroes theres a video blog with statistic and everything before and after changesit work almost to good to be true for them even the most rabbit haters where later spending way more cash then the avarage user cba to find link thou sry it was posted in eve general some weeks ago but im 95 sure we will see thisread quote as its logical from the numbers point of view to the company myself ill play aslong as i feel the space game weights up for the doll game and im actually up 1 account since incarna pbut i dont have any illusion about where ccp is heading its the same way everyone else in the market is heading everyone
so much for the cold hard eve i feel in love with looks like the road to hello kitty is on its wayoh well all good things must come to an end i guess
your respect is meaningless and i only represent my constituents  not crybabies with entitlement complexes soz m8
with all the advocacy of social engineering and creating personal relations and all that angling do you still think you have personal relevance in any of all this in the aftermath of repeatedly ending up in pants down moments thanks to your ccp brosefs
i read this laughed looked at my cat and immediately realized this had the potential for a lolcat picture too bad my camera is broken tti thought this thread has effectively been shot down  but i guess some dead horses need beating still soundwave confirmed local is getting changed if not outright removed in nullsec  but it likely wont happen until the winter expansion
without nullsec local wont they still stay instation terrified of what might be out there after all  if an afk cloakie scares them silly imagine what the unknown will do dseriously  i doubt any changes made will satisfy these nullsec crybabies
does anyone think this is a bad idea any negative thoughts or am i so awesome that i balanced everything out before hand and came up with a great idea with few downsides
supported
supported means more support fleets to cap up the capitals and super capitals before they warp off teamwork is always goodand i dont see any real negative to this
thanks for the tip didnt know i could do this trick 
signed
yep we definetly need poss with more hp than old ones which can be anchored in missions or stargates i think it would be cool to do mission inside forcefield
you know how guys slow down theres your laggood think incarna introduced a singlespeed character
to be honest its not that difficult to add its all in the skeleton of the 3d model and the weight of the boob area if any of you have played oblivion the elder scrolls then you may know of the mods called bbb name of clothing you can add it to the mod within an hour easily via blender and nifscope vid to prove it linkage
please
far too long has wormhole dwellers lived in peace and exploited the resources in unknown space they risk extremely little and the reward is multiple times better than null sec pilotsthey dont have to worry about being invadedthey get to farm the hell out of our abc ore that spawns all over their c1 c2 and c3 spacenow they want to moon mine and their own iceso it is time for the sleeper rats to start appearing in null sec so we can have access to the material they drop so there should be sanctum like sites us null players can runwe hack it out in null with constant danger and they just sit in their space practically printing isk none stop time to even it up a bit
wormhole space is better in every way this is obviously why far more people live in wormholes then in nulloh waityou dont know what youre talking about was mildly amusing though 410
1 for asking csm to do their job1 for assuming they will when you voted1 for trying to help fwyoure good in my book
dear ccp  csm and coplayerswhen a player do missions in empire space there is a explicit warning when enemies in the misions use warp scramblers from a agent before accepting the mission i trusted in this warning until today when there was no warning nevertheless there was actually a frigate scrambling me i was not ready to handle the situation and lost my ship please fix this either adding warning messages to all missions with npcs armed with warp scramblers or a general warning under helpmissions ingame that you can meet enemies with warp scramblers as the situation is now new players like me trust in the warning and then have to write a petition reimbursement when there is no warning and you get warpscrambled
welcome to eveyou are always warp scrambled unless you are not
no also lol
great ideaalso add a warning that nasty ships may shoot at you ccpi considered it quite rude and unfriendly to us new players
this may be an interesting read for you
especially after ccp soundwaves recent grandstanding about it being too easy in eve to make money i say its time to remove t2 bpos from the game the people who own them have been able to outrageously exploit these isk printing machines for years now and it needs to stop i therefore propose the following remove all t2 bpos from game which is to say convert them to t2 bpcs with 100 licensed runs on them no refund or any other kind of compensation shall be given to their owners ccp already made them trillionaires overnight when they gave them these isk printing presses its time for them to get off their lazy asses and work for a living like everyone else
nogo read one of the billion threads on the topic that have a majority consensus that they are in line with invention in terms of profitability
agreed i say ranka mei should buy a bunch of plexs in order to reimburse the current owners so we can finally get rid of this atrocity
in before akita t unloads on the op as to why hes wrong
this post is bad and you should feel bad
if the profit from these is comparable to invention then what is the problem with removing themor what is the problem with releasing more
its unnecessary
also add the option to play your own videos nothing says immersion more than watching your fav tv show and playing eve at the same time o
i would like to make a proposal that the preincarna sound effects for strip miners  mining drones be reintroduced as soon as possible i cannot see a viable reason why they were removed in the first place the current sound is quite pathetic and not in any way industrial sounding i would also like to see the return of the cracking rock sounds when looking at asteroids being mined although this is secondary in importance to returning the old laser sound effectsnb this proposal is for return of the old sound effects only as the new laser visual effects are indeed cool if you support this proposal please reply to this post thank you
i am in favour and give my full support to celgars proposal for the previous set of sound effects to be returned for strip miners and mining drones
supported because it was yet another pointless improvement that just made things homogeneous and bland a few weedy beams of light are pathetic compared to the nice big pulses you had before and if the sounds have changed thats even worse
common sense you wont see any of that from the op he thinks hes being persecuted and rationalises away any and all counter argument as trolling attacksps how long do you think i can keep him embarrassing himself here for  five pages so far
lol keep it up show the world how much of an ass you truely are
how many supports have you got again d nah youre not wrong are you snickersps if you cant spell at least use a spellchecker
id say he spent as much time defending as you guys spent attacking himyes he handled the situation very poorly like a noob really and got shot to smithereens however try and not fall into the trap i did at first too mocking him for his gameplay at the expensive of the legit issue he brings upwhen you got a player aggro timer on you youre not supposed to dock up for a while or jump gate the orca offers a way around that in the form of what clearly appears to be a loophole the only logical way to deal with this therefore is to close the loophole and suspend the offenders docking privileges to the orcas ship maintenance bay for the duration of the aggro timer as wellagain try and separate the logic of this reasoning from thinking about the circumstances of the fight because theyre irrelevant really it would in fact have been much wiser had the op not mentioned the fight at all and just outlined the issue alas he didnt doesnt mean you cant strain yourself a little to distill the abstract of the matter at hand here and base your vote on that
the pfrp side of things was sacrificed on the altar of balance a long time agowhy does a friendly player controlled station disallow docking the issue exists solely because of a subcap the orca having a maintenance array with no restrictions even the bigger rorqual has severe limitations if people cant agree on having the same aggression mechanics apply across the board then apply the rorqual indyonly restrictions to the orcaproblem solved carriers are unaffected and rppf is satisfied the only losers are highsec pvpersedit to compensate the 23 people who use the orca to actually haul assembled ships around which was the reason for not restricting its bay give jf andor freighters the ability to carry assembled ships
supportedthe cowardly riskfree pvp that orca and carrier hotswapping allows is completely at odds with the riskreward model of eve
far better i think to simply apply a cooldown to ships with aggro docking inside an orcait still shafts innocent people who try to escape inside an orca from an agressor and use ecm or combat modsdrones to get away to the safety of the orca and thus gain aggro but at least it wouldnt gimp the orca as you suggest doing so but really i think the best solution is the one we have now where its not perfect but isnt as bad as the fixes being suggested carebears can suck it up when they fall into an obvious trap and pvpers can live with their targets sometimes escaping inside an orca adapt or die dont try to fix eve till its stuffed
that would be a reasonable solution indeedthey already have that ability you can make a courier contract and stick the plastic package in the cargo
no downtime would make the signatures always have the same ids during its lifetime as for bookmarking each and every signature thats just more load on the server besides filling up the places tab most dedicated explorers are scanning constellations not just a few systemsi support this proposal and the options mentioned by vislor amatin
the alternative to nerfing is power creep which would be even worse for the game personally i dont want to be playing something where only 5 ships are worth usingpretty stupid example as buffs can and do happen in this game remember when nearly all faction ships were just as useless as you described there remember when stealth bombers were just zeronichUFFFD toys i do but that changed and added more variety to the gamethe inevitable cost of this is that simple poor judgement or unforseen metagaming results in some of these ships becoming overpowered  ie the dramiel thats when the nerf bat is quite rightly swungoh and lets look at major nerfs that have already happened nano nerf nanoships are still viable and frequently flown theyre just not godmode any moreecm nerf worked out fine and brought the falcon down to ranges its realistically possible to kill atand in the process they buffed the rook adding another viable shipso yeah i really dont see why youre so worried here
actually the nerf to webs was a classic example of over nerfing something ccp excels at
ya id rather them give us things than take away why slow down dramiels just give us counters to the dramiels the nerf to 90 webs was over nerfing less over nerfing needed more counters
the dramiel will still be perfectly usable postnerf and to answer your question because if youve got a choice of bringing one ship back into line or buffing another 20 buffing the 20 would be a catastrophically stupid thing to do and would affect a lot more than one ridiculously op frigateand exactly what do you propose implementing that people wouldnt use for a lot more than dramiel bashing
yes stop with the constant nerfing stuff everyone whos ever trained a good ship inevitably gets nerfed by ccp stop doing that
nerfing webs to 60 was pretty much a perfect decision that is one of the things ccp got exactly right
and this has happened to you how many times i fly 3 races out of 4 grand total of ships ive had nerfed 1 the falconand numerous others buffedyes ccp certainly are constantly nerfing everything
yes scs are op so we can eithernerf scs for example half their ehpor we can double the ehp of all other ships double the damage done by weapons double the ammount repaired by repair modules half the repair cost in stations etc then we are going to use a new unit for hp where one new hp  2 old hpin other words scs have their hp nerfed by 50 only you made it look like all other ships got boosted
would be nice to get some medals for a few of those things definitely would make them feel like something is being accomplished right at the start as well as giving some short term goals
i like the idea gives carebears a little something extra to go after
hahhah i support this product
this is not achievements online try to set your own goals and show some imagination
considering fw already has thisand that the existing tier system perpetuates this ideai dont really see a problem with it carebears will be carebears make it where my killmails show these ranks and such so i can change the start of my story from so i killed this carebear to i killed this carebear that looked like a mexican generalin all seriousness i dont see anything wrong with this at all but i think development time is better spent elsewhere hisec has all the features it really needs for the time being  low and null could use more love as well as features like fw that got left in the dust after launch players who spend time getting achievements isnt an issue if anything achievements that require players to work together strengthen the communitythat being said  id rather see achievements for null low and wh long before i see them in hisec living in hisec isnt an achievement its where you started its the safest place in eve there is very little adversity or difficulty spaceship wise marketing is cutthroat at least
i want this if only so that ppl will rage against bears for it
almost anything that will incur the wrath of trolls and emo nullsec fanatics is good imo
bump
its 60 seconds so apparently its complicated enough giggleregardless this op is very confused and has little idea what theyre saying andor is simply terrible at communicating it
can you please have some sort of skill like ship assembly technician which would l 1 allows the fitting and rigging of any t1 frigate without boarding it or being able to use the modulesl 2 allows the fitting and rigging of t1 cruisers and industrialsl 3 allows the fitting and rigging of t1 battlecruisers and t1 mining bargesl 4 allows the fitting and rigging of t1 and t2 battleships and all t2 ships belowl 5 allows the fitting and rigging of t3 cruisers and capital shipsmaybe split the skills into combat ship assembly and ship assembly for combat and non combat ships i would have this skill cost 10 million isk this skill would be conditional of1 industry v  some other high end indy skills like frigate cruiser battleship constructioni dont see why a factory should be able to use the guns well in order to mount them on a ship or rig the thing specialized industrial characters should be able to do this without actually being able to fly the ship or use the mods and contract ready to use ships with all the bells and whistles
not terribly many people even care to buy ships prefitted making this somewhat irrelevant
the case i know about is a friend who quit eve because coming out of the training missions with 2m mil to your name he did lvl1 missions for the state got a destroyer lost it lost interest in the mindless monotony of flying 25 jumps to shoot 1 npc only to gain 150k and 100lp in mission rewards and quit eveso i dont know what this couple days and you should have enough to do lvl 4s comes from maybe you had a friend who tossed you 50mil to start else where did the money to buy the stealh bomber come fromguess what im saying is how to bridge the beginner 2million to 50million isk hump and get self sufficient enough to farmt1 frig used was a merlin if that matters
plexes not missions run defensive plexes semi afk or offensive in a speed tanking ab frig for militia standingsit is boring as hell but about as as riskfree and activity as you get in evebombers are not very expensive and the time it takes to get skills trained is more than enough to acquire the funds for several
you still have the problem that highsec corps have offices and poss in highsec and most of those corpsalliances barely break even on bills if their site foes under they effectively have to close up disband and find somewhere else to live because once it goes unstable all the pirates and nullsecers will kill anything and everything left in that systemthis means that youll have alot of players either stuck in the station for several weeks poss taht cost hundreds of millions of isk guaranteed destroyed and alot of alliances wiped out by pure chance of game mechanics its not really fair for the newer players who would suffer from that the only people who would benefit would be griefers and pirates
unfortunately i still have to disagree with you on these points however isnt this what might happen in the real world given the right circumstances if so then i dont see any reason as to why this couldnt be possible also if this idea went on and became reality then prehaps people shouldnt put all their eggs in one basket if you cannot run your corp without your office or poss keeping you on track then prehaps you ought to think of expanding to include more divesity just in case and new players arent really that likely to even have a pos in the first place it does after all take some work in order to place poss in high sec if however you have an alliance that is capable of doing so then they should be aware of the risks involved even if the system is not distabilized a war dec can and will do the same to a new corp or alliance is this fair no does it happen anyway yes
the idea has merit  but again you have a slippery slope once an alliance reaches a critical mass of systems theyll forever have far more supercaps and by virtue of their not being limitless systems opposition will continue to be unable to retaliateresulting in zerg tactics if they can succeedid suggest that a given alliance can only have x number of supercapitals active  literally link this to the alliance as an alliance asset not a player asset that number is entirely up for speculation  i can imagine 20 is about as high as i would want to see for a given alliance this includes all capitals  rorqs carriers dreads scs and titans freighters and jumpfs would be excluded given their absolutely necessary role as logistics and the fact there is no super freighter to balancethats my two isk balancing the cost of the ships could be easier  as well as their actual stats since this problem really didnt exist until supers then youre just getting into whether the nerfbat needs to come out or if dreads and carriers need buffing
nerf artillery
thats even more doomed to failure as the original proposal what ships do you think an alliance would choose to have active if all capitals would count into this limmited number  they would have x titans and or suppercarriers why should one use a standard carrier if those two are just so much better same with dreads
sounds like a plan if the aim to solidify the chasm between the haves and the havenotstwo things need to be done to make superscapitals less of iwin1 destroying them needs to be easy without having to resort to supercapital spam oneself2 production of them needs to be made more vulnerablepoint two is already being debated as an option by having pos modules incl csaa outside of shield bubblespoint one can be done by removing immunity adding vanilladrone bays and reducing ehp slightlythere fixed them for you now lets move on to the sov revamp ls boost hybrid boost fw revamp etc
the great wildlands is owned by the thukker tribe who are nomadic and so do not need or use that many stations consider them tribe meeting grounds rather than stations

you cant bring a hulk into lowend wormholesyou cant refine very efficiently at a posyou dont have a local so botters cant exploit the system to just warp away when someone enters systemhell actual players cant just warp away when someone enters systemits more difficult to ship ore in and out of wormholes you need to worry about industrials not going over the weight limit as they jump in and out repeatedly unlike 00 alliances which just pile everything onto a carrier and jump it to wherever they need itlowclass wormholes have insignificant amounts of the abc ores claiming that its destabilizing the industry is ignorantwormholes dont have mercoxit afaikwormholes dont have moon miningwormholes dont have ice miningso tell me why the bloody hell people want to nerf that
my corp will be directly affected by any such change as a tiny mining corp  15 players 58 fulltime residents living in a c2 wormhole we see a grav site approximately once per fortnight we have 3 people who can mine at all the rest being combat site runnerssecurity our wormhole has statics to both c4 wh and hisec sounds like a perfect moneymaker rightheres the realityevery day the first one to log in scans down everything and updates the bookmarks in the can at the pos this takes about 15 minutes or so on average if there are any wormhole sigs besides our statics we go look them over and compare with dotlan which is usually checked before we even log in lets say we have a lucky day and find a grav belt along with 2 combat sites maybe a lowend ladar site our 2 statics and a 3rd wormhole k162 to anywherejob 1 is to go visit that k162 and gather intel about whowhat is in it with 4 players we wont be touching that grav until we feel weve minimised the risk to the hulks just like any other 00 system except we have no intel channel no alliance to call on and no instant local to warn us to continue we find where the k162 leads to and run a box recon of the system in order to establish who lives there active ships etc this includes going on grid to all poss many of which have bubbles nearby to trap and decloak the unwary using cans drones etc even if all this is done well and safely theres no guarantee the intel will be current 5 minutes after we jump back to our system the person who did all this might still be alone others not logged in yet for the day and therefor has to sit by that hole and watch it pretty much until another corpy logs in lets say we get lucky and this happens within the next 10 minutes or so no guarantee out of the usual suspects 1 is from ny one from australia 1 from malaysia etc anyways someone logs in and a decision is made based on the previous intel to crush the hole in order to provide one less potential threat to the hulks this if done quickly and successfully with an orca can take nearly half an hour itll require the covops to sit on the other side to scan for ships during that time and leaves the orca wide open to attack in our system but again lets pretend luck is on our side and we do this successfully everyone is home safely and the hole no longer exists now we have to worry that whoever scanned in probably mapped our system and warped to both statics so we have 2 more holes to plug both guys get into covops and each goes to one of the static holes to run intel checks we see our static hisec takes us to within 5 jumps of a major trade hub and there are 44 people in local no probes on scan at this time the c4 is occupied by something nasty say a corp with 34 poss tonnes of ships out etc the corpy in there has to visit and confirm that all ships are accounted for in pos shields empty since we cant reasonably jump an orca into it without knowing this now we have to decide based on intel which hole to crush first lets say we pick the hisec since the orca will be safe on the hisec side at least the guy in the c4 has to stay there near the hole to our system to prevent the orca from being bushwhacked from there the orca is on its own to crush the hisec static one more time lets assume we get lucky and this goes without a hitch 12 an hour later the hole is crushed the orca driver swaps to a covops and scans down the new hisec static but does not warp to the sig sealing it offnow we have to deal with the c4 static even if we are extremely lucky and at this point we should be buying lotto tickets amirite crushing that will again take another half an hour the first corpy in covops scans out the new c4 static and seals updates the pos can and we finally feel safe enough to think about mining our osoprecious belt continued
continued we go to it first in a drake to wait for the sleeper spawn pop them and lootsalvage the wrecks waste not want not of course we had to wait 1015 minutes for them to spawn 5 to kill 510 to lootsalvage but were feeling lucky becuse 25 hours after the first guy logged in we can actually get ready to minewith 2 players ok lets get lucky again and 2 more log in in the nick of time gotta give them a few minutes to update their bookmarks and give them the scoop on whats been done one driver in the orca 2 in hulks and our first guy in a hauler lets minewe get to the belt to find its an average deposit our most common heres what it looks like
i think the real point is nullsec residents just feel dirty using ore they know hasnt been botted must be some kind of itis they get out thereremove local and see how much ore gets mined in nullalso id like to see the prices on your precious needed t3s once you  your suppliers
just a quick little something i forgot to add in my last wall of text ever consider what well do if these changes get pushed through ill tell you well just stop mining and go farm our c4 for tags and salvage thats right well go next door and pull isk out of nowhere so we can help add to the inflationary pressure in new eden you take out a player driven thing and you replace it with a faucet just watch it happen all so a few prima donnas and their bots myriad can force hisec players to pay more for everything it wont affect us monetarily well make billions more than we are now if only we were in it for the moneyright
as elaine solarheart stated if you dont want to get ganked or fail repeatedly you need to be ubercautious about all the sigs and you need to take the time to findscout them and reliably know their status anyone can mine or rat without doing this and occasionally get a way just fine but the squad of t3s in the wh you failed to scan down is just waiting for you to go to the next anom because theyre waiting for the hictor pilot or their covops scout to reship not having situational awareness leads to losses back to topic the majority of wh will not be adversely affected if abc ores are removed but it will raise the inconvenience level and as stated above expect t3 prices to rise since we would need to import more orepartsships when we could have just mined locally and built locally on that note i would suggest an interesting trade the 1st wh only pos mod otherwise itll end up all over null a structure that compresses ore like a rorq and does nothing else for that mod i would actually get back to mining more since the compression takes the pain out of the logistics i think losing abc ores would be worth that carebearshs mission runnersnull rabbits00 botsyarrls ghetto dwellerscave dwellerswh addicts
mp3 of csm fireside chat2nd one 22 minutes in for what the csm had to say about this issue
so true
wow and i will quote who i think is mittanicomplete ignorance and the only arguement he throws is low risk and whats more low risk than mining in nullsec
how is mining in a foreign everchanging system with no local any less risky than mining from the heart of a big blue blob of happy nap space in nullsec if anything class 12 are more risky since theyre all connected with highsec and are frequently roamed while 56 are deeper and youll have less gankers going in there for easy kills learn 2 wormholes hulks cant fit into a c1 unless you build them and again how is a big blue happy nap blob extremely dangerous spacewhy are you blaming wormholes for the collapse of mineral prices when every miner can be blamed for that especially when a whopping 245 of eves population actually lives in whs maybe if nullbears stopped naping everything that moved it would be a riskier environment for miners resulting in mining being more lucrative thats not to mention all the other ways that minerals are injected into the economy im looking at you drone regions
my god his ignorance is amazing how can you be a csm and on top of that then advocate for something you have no fing clue aboutguess what that hulk daytripping in a system two jumps from jita just got ganked because of being two jumps from jita and how did this hulk get his ore out you cannot take a whole grav site worth of ore out through c13 exits so how much money is this guy getting like maybe 20 mil only ignorant people mine in wormholes they dont live in the logistics are terrible and the risk is not cost effectivethis continues to amaze meediti didnt even see this onequotei think its dumb that you can have some guy in a hulk from jita pop in with relatively low risk into a c1 whatever and get abc when abc is typically something uh reserved for extremely dangerous space far from empireso this csm doesnt know about mass limits at all you cant even get a covetor into a c1 without building it in there thats what i like to call wormfail
ah but you should know by now that the only real players in eve are in nullsec now that the likes of goonswarm have decided to take the csm seriously you should not be surprised that csm are trying to enhance the benefits of operating out of 00 its what all power blocks do they try to get the best deal for their special interests the solution is to put up some credible candidates from whs hisec etc to try and achieve a balance because if we dont then the only game worth playing will be from 00 and that is not somewhere i want to go im not presumptous enough to think that i would be a candidate at any time this nda business is enough to put me off but i would be willing to help out and try to counter the block votes of the 00 alliances who will of course only be voting for their own candidates and in their own interests
if you read the may minutes and
fact is that high sec players arent as vocal as null sec playerswhereas the null sec residents vote in large chunks the residents of high sec only dribble in here and there and are too spread out to have a real candidate to be pushed forwardif high sec wants a better representation they have to look for a few credible candidates first and then vote en masse on thembut since a lot of high sec people dont bother to vote they resort to complaining
id also like to hear if the csm has any ideas on improving hisec gameplay i believe this forum is the official means for comminicating with the csm if the csm views hisec as boring or repetitive then what are their thoughts on how hisec gameplay can be improved
well if we had their full apis we could get them and their alts and just go assasinate them you know form another mob and track them down instead of statues sounds like a cool activity actually
yep i reckon clavian voi has hit the nail on the head at the moment all we have to look forward to is the aggrandisement of the csm delegates spiced with a little self serving for the 00 inhabitantsbah as to the op i surely do admire you patience waiting for the minutes of the may meeting
why do people like me play eve when we have things that we are not happy about simple ive invested over five years playing eve and when people have a stake in anything then i think thay have a right to be critical when things appear to be changing in ways that adversely affect the game just because you love someone or something does not make you blind to faults eve is not what it was when i started playing some things are better ie pi invention rather than the lottery others are not lag general performance and at the moment cq
i saw that and ccp wants mt period when players in a majority said no to mt it didnt matter ccp wanted to put them in and they did
who the hell vote for this failures anywaycsm is god damn joke
no one gives one  about your opinion so u read up on worm holes yet so you dont look like a total idiot next time u talk about them
predictable i raise a concern about your behavior as socalled lead of the csm and you lash out like a child skip any further political office not for you i am afraid especially since you consider your constituents only those people belonging to the mittens club the obvious 00 slant of the last two and only fireside chats make that obvious despite what other csm members have tried to say your legacy i am afraid is ruining any progress the csm has made over many years in legitimizing itself
your only now realizing his agendaever since csm 5 went for the jump bridge nerf the mittani has been hell bent to dismantle any credibility the csm has with the public any possible idea or change that would hurt his goonies and how they operate he is against even if its what is best for the game as a wholehe runs around telling people to commited suicide and die in real life do you honestly think he gives a  about eve much less the csm
really typical politiciangreasing the hands that feed i understood that the csms job was to represent the entire player base to ccp hmmmlet me seei found this in the evelopediathe purpose of the csm is to represent society interests to ccp this requires active engagement with the player community to master eve issue awareness understanding and evaluation in the context of the greatest good for the greater player base the scope of issues is restricted only to eve its ongoing development and limited meta outofgame issues which have direct relevance to the eve universe it is important to keep in mind that the csm will not have formal powers within ccp they will have a voice inside ccpnotice that it doesnt say greatest good for the chairmans constituency
then you are in the wrong place mate
thats rich coming from you
this pretty much sums up why most players cant be arsed to care about the csm and why many hope the csm loose what little power they have in the end it would be better if the devs and designers made the decisions and not a group of players who are willing break the parts of the game they dont play to improve on the parts they do playeven with the recent bad decisions made by ccp i feel they are doing a better job then the csm trying to improve the game for all players
id say that his sentiment is what will fuel such feelings for csm6 and beyond the work done by csm5 tossed aside in part due to his antics and the csm as a whole going along with the join statement bsalso you are aware that the csm doesnt make the decisions they have a voice that ccp will listen to but ultimately the decisions are ccps not the csms the csm will try to push the issues they unite behind and that is it ccp listens and ignores them or puts some effort into working on their ideas in whatever capacity they feel is correct i disagree they are doing a good job in this instance both ccp and csm are failing hard ccps just been doing it much longer cause csm gets recycled every term and this one is pretty much a load with few less than stellar exceptions
yes even if it wasnt what i said i meant the decision making process anyways if they csm had zero influence on the direction ccp is developing eve it would be pointless to have the csm
i have this question lingering around for quite sometime and this seems to be the right place to ask it given the contextfrom eve wikipedia the scope of the csmthe purpose of the csm is to represent society interests to ccp this requires active engagement with the player community to master eve issue awareness understanding and evaluation in the context of the greatest good for the greater player base the scope of issues is restricted only to eve its ongoing development and limited meta outofgame issues which have direct relevance to the eve universe it is important to keep in mind that the csm will not have formal powers within ccp they will have a voice inside ccpnow from what i understand in this statement the csm is a group of people which express the player base interests to ccp elaborating a little bit more on the perception i get the csm in a very frontal and crude form are the link between ccp and the player base interesets in order to achieve a common ground of agreement but unfortunately what ive been reading through all this forumtweetsmumble recording is nothing more than a group of people with their own personal interests csm mostly disregarding the player base interests or the majority of them since i see very little feedback request from the general player base in order to understand the player base opinionsinterests and imposing their personal viewsinterests andor agendanow i dont have any issues with voting people for their interests and opinions as long as it is stated and explicity declared like a real political party with an agenda very well defined on prior to voting for the player base to choose what agenda or game political side theyre voting for but i was sold or have been that the csm is the player base spokesman and not a party with its own political agendai have no issue whatsoever with the csm having their own interests and views of the game i do have issues though if they are our interests spokesman and they impose their own interests disregarding the player base im also fully aware that there will always be people against something granted but i havent seen many statements from the csm with the tone of i might not agree with it but the majority of the player base whishes this that i have to express this as the player base interest instead only the i dont care about this so ccp can decide whatever or the imposition of csm interests on to ccp with little or very limited player base reasearch about the issueanyway the real question is what is csm supposed to be after all best regards
listened to the fireside chat recording and enjoyed it it was nice to hear a variety of voices from the csm this time rather than just the one pretentious douchebag hogging the stage i was at first content with our new csm chairman but more and more i just cringe at the fact that hes the public face of this important group sir i pray that you find yourself with a hellish job that requires you to work 80 hours a week and leaves no time for eve forcing you to resign and hand the reigns over to trebor who is far better suited for the role i must say though mittens has improved considerably from the last fireside chathe mostly dropped the insulting and childish word rtarded from his vocabulary for this call kudos
what is quite funny if someone in a real political movement made a stupid comment like this his resignation would be expected it seems to me that your ego has far far exceeded your actual position
so are you saying that you dont represent yourself then  lol
darius iii the fair for csm
and 70 of eve players support reducing refine rates by 10
there is no limit to the mittanis ego thats just how he is he really thinks quite highly of himself sadly that makes for a very poor representativeall that aside i would think this is the last csm there is no credibility left without that theres no sense of representation and any work performed is seen as just an extension of ccp even though the csm may have the best intentions they are constantly undermined by ccp so they really arent doing anything other than pr stunts too bad because it was yet another great idea sunk by ccps mismanagement of course the csm at some point may want to stop playing along it may be a bit too late for them though a lot of damage has been done
hey vile ratin regards to ship ballances specifically capitals i believe there is a very large gap that can be filled from carriers and dreads to scs and titanspersonally i am of the opinion that scs are fine as they are people have invested alot of time and money into chars that can sit in these things as well as the actual construction of them is a very big undertaking they are also prime offensive weapons very versatileanyway to my point i believe combat capitals should be looked at in terms of a scale of 110 in terms of isk spent and a combination of dpsehpto that ends in my mind i have the following10 titans98 scs76543 dreads21 carrierscarriers make great auxiluries sp to cap fleets and are pretty damn useful in terms of docking ability corp hangar etcdreads also have their use as limited as it may be these days lots of dps little ehp they are essentially a glass cannonthere is a huge gap between dreads and scs scs cost upwards of 10 times the priceeffort they have about 120 the ehp yet require very similar skill training timei believe the big gap between these can be filled by not reducing the abilitystats of the scs in some ways i think capitals should be a slight mirror of sub caps frigs destroyers cruisers bcs bssi think a tier 2 dread has a very good opportunity to appear a type of ship that has less ehp than a sc and alot less versatility no siege module but a straight weapon damage bonus similar dps as a sieged dread something to make a sc fc think twice aboutin similar gameplay with subcaps it would be bad to send a scythe into battle vs a tempest get a bc instead to make things interesting the same premice should be for scs as wella new hull 56 turrets 100 odd bonus damage multiplyer decent drone bay x bonus to shieldarmour rep amount per level keep tracking very low so sub caps can fight them efficiently essentially giving a dread alot more ehp and without a siege module but with all the benifitsdrawbacks that go with it minus the speed decreasei think that would be a good rebalance of scs
not sure if this is the place butright now freighters are huge and there is no mid sized option other than the orcadifferent skill pathplayers do not always need to carry the huge amounts freighters carry but we do not also want a new ship to take away from the freighterso why of all the ships are there no fittings on these ships add 3 rig slots reduce the amount they haul so if cargo rigged they are equivalent to current freightersthis would let people set up there freighters how they like more tank more speed more agility or more cargo rigs rather than modules because these ships are huge and not easily reconfigured like military vessels may also promote people having more than one to use when they need a particular load hauledalso helps use up more rigs and introduces a sink when the rigs are destroyed or changedwill also make freighters more appealingthanks for reading
nice blog definitely worth the read fixed the link so it works to few bother to cut and paste links especially when you can insert it as a proper link
dreads definitely need some loventhey used to be the end all for pos warfare and still hold there own in cap fleets but as many have said scs can out perform them in every wayi would like to see the seige mode buffed so they are almost immune to subcap attacks while in seige but at the same time should get a tracking penalty in siege mode to the point where they can not hit even a bs unless it is not moving they should be able to hold there own against a small bs gang 45 bses in non sieged modeat best a 5050 survival chance but be near impossible for that same bs gange to kill while seiged to balance this make there tracking while in sieged mode so bad a bs can easily avoid 90 of the damage if they keep moving basically causing a stalemate until one side or the other gets some reinforcementsi would say keep the buffer where it is or even lower it a bit but give a big increase to passive recharge this will keep them very vulnerable to super caps as the high dps of subcaps with burn though the buffer faster than it can be repaired yet the repairregen will be enough to make it hard to kill them with subcaps think heavy armor in wwii the german panther tank was heavy and slow but the american sheman could not take them toe to toe the armor on the panther was so thick the shells from the smaller guns on the american tanks mostly just bounced off while the huge guns on the panther could take out a sherman with one shot the panthers weakness was that the huge gun had trouble hitting smaller faster targets it was almost immune to most attacks but could only effectively kill larger slow moving targets along with a nerf to tracking while in sieged mode the damage boost should be much larger dreads should be the best choice for pos bashing shooting at a stationary object nothing but a titan should out dps a sieged dread a significant dps boost would not make them overpowered if they could not hit a subcap ship while sieged but they should be much harder for those subcap fleets to kill this would restore them to the role they were meant to fill at the same time give them enough dps to be worth having in a combat cap fleet with a couple carriers supporting it with rr to keep it alive the dread could deal massive damage to apposing fleets capitals i believe this is the role it was meant to have however the super carriers can far out dps a dread making it pointless to have a dread over a carrier in fleet a good boost to the passive tanking by either increased armor resists or shield regen or both while in sieged mode combined with a reduction in effectiveness against sub caps and a huge dps boost should put them right back to where they should be at least in my mind
speaking from what i have seen in eve i put forward the followingeach region or group of regions has its own plusses and minuses drone lands has alot of mins but no conquerable npc station to be seen anywheregurristasanshaangelserpentisblood space all drop nice modules and bouinties but not alot of mineralshigh sec produces alot of the requirements for t2 constructionforexample in drone lands you can build a super cap and equip it with t1 or t2 rigs and t1 modules in serpentis space you can raise the liquid isk to buy such a ship and have the modules on hand to put on it check jita out for t2 modulesone way i can see that type of ballance being overcome is to have each constellation in every region have different types of rats otherwise one region alliance is going to be dependant on the other regions produce
add destructible mining stations which can mine unattendedadd destructible research stations which will take research away from the posbe able to add missile and turret batteries to these stations to defend them somewhatall these structures are separate and independent from a pos and have to placed somewhere else in system
i really liked the eve books empyrean age especiallyi would pay money for a plkex or two to see that side of eve fleshed out more or even made into a tv seriesalso i would be happy to buy a tornado ship from the nex
what do you mean biast it planely states that there are more logical arguments for than against and each of the three examples specifically promotes itself
they should be special items for christmas only but idiots ruined thatccp have already removed them because they were getting too many complaints from clueless carebears who didnt understand aggression mechanics and got themselves concordokken for firing back at people shooting themnot supportednot going to happen
hi henrys alt here henry is in suspenselimbo at the momentcarebears are complaining to ccp anyways when people gank them in highsec when they mine or mission also why are you against my proposal just curious if you sounded like you are against the carebears who were too dumb to learn the mechanics
if they reintroduce them it should be for christmas only as i stated therefore not supportedcarebears whining about them got them removed in the first place so its unlikely that ccp will reintroduce them only to end up with more inane petitionsin short they were originally a bit of fun for christmas that ended up being more trouble than it was worthdespite what you may think i am not automatically supportive of things used to grief trick or whatever you want to call it ccp have indeed made this a game for babies and nerf all kinds of mechanics that should remain market scamming is practically impossible now remote rep agression the lofty scam despite a warning given on joining gangs etc this is a bad trend and closes the sandbox but regardless this is a waste of time for ccp when they have far more important things to fix
one feature i think would be great would be more introduction movies you have the racial videos when selecting a char then you make your char and then you just get on with it strait away could there be another intro movie played after creating your char for example leaving a space port on a planet blasting into the sky into outer space then zooming to the station along the way you get introduced to rats what damage they do different sizes swing by a stargate and overlay the network of gatessystems pass my planets and show pi zoom through a fleet battle dodging fire from both sides before entering the station parking your ship disengaging the capsule watching it fly to the cq then see yourself get out climb up th stairs and then have the camera zoom into your head and away you goanother idea may be a readily available list of gold star quality pc corps in the local area you could join each of these corps can be monitored by ccp and ensured they are genuinely helpful a condition of entry into these gold corps could be that once you get to a certain sp level you have to leave themjust some ideas
should post this over in the new player qa forumpersonally waiting until avatars can interacts with each other before introducing eve to to many people
my thoughts so far1 ui overhaul2 finished career agents what now maybe an expand for specific careers eventually triggered by skilllvl3 explanation of some basics like standings kill rights and more4 less need for external information and tools
the npe needs more information on playerplayer interaction things like aggro counters gcc yellow boxing red boxing some basic bits of information the noobs will almost instantly encounter check the undock point in noob stations for all the players trying to bait them if these things would be covered before players undock for the first time there would probably be better retention people should be able to bait other players but noobs should be given a chance to know what is going on before it is too late

you can currently get a new name by biomassing using a different slot on your account or opening a new account circumventing these mechanics gives you a clear in game advantage and will never be allowedsuggesting an alias list makes this acceptable is ludicrous standings flags for people in local was introduced because it was a default behaviour to show info on every new person that entered your system this would just force more show info activations furthermore known fcs falcon alts etc could use the mechanic to appear less threatening in local or in fleetthere are consequences to your actions and reputation is a highly valuable resource to be used or abused circumventing this without starting from scratch will not be allowednot supportednever going to happen
while there would need to be restrictions on it having a deep space outpost would be a great idea it would remove the need for so many safe spots and create the safe havenhome for more corps to move into lowsec it would of course still be able to anchor around a moon perhaps giving it more cpu and powergrid to work with being in a locked orbit or some such while in deep space it will need to sacrifice a portion of cpu and powergrid to monitor and defend against cosmic rays or micro meteorsi support this idea
i see nothing wrong with this idea1
there is a deep space pos already its called an orca with a cloak
good luck doing bpo research in an orca
you really want a lab you can anchor off of a celestial cloaked or nearly impossible to probe down aka unscannable t3s what just got nerfed yay which is as tough as a pos defendable blah blah blah whats the point it will take someone all of 10 minutes at worst to find your cloaky deep space carebear creche and ruin it in which case heres an idea form a corp with your research alt pay someone to be a faction fluffer get faction standings to 8 for your corp anchor pos in hisec bingo youre just like everyone else
the reason i suggested the limit of being anchored at least 1 au from any cosmic signature was so that it could not be anchored in an asteroid belt or inside a plexeffectively keeping it from despawning that can not be allowed i know scanning down a pos in deep space is not a hard thing to do but it would provide a little more security from hostiles just passing through and if someone does stop to scan the system there probes will show up on directional scan and the defending force can possibly scan them down and kill them before they find the pos with additional stats slightly better than the faction towers only a reduction in cpupower grid as a sacrifice for the ability to anchor in deep space it would give an option to have a more secure pos but would support less modules for that extra security to maintain a balance whether or not these could be anchored in high sec is another issue trying to find an available moon in a decent high sec system is no easy task but allowing these to be anchored in high sec could result in far to many poses in a system perhaps just adding a restriction to the number of poses per 10 au system width then systems 100 au wide could have far more than systems only 20 au wide but there would still be a maximum number t2 poses would also be much more expensive creating a good isk sink for larger alliances with far to much extra resources
if orcas had enough cargo space to hold a full freighter load 25 million ehp for protection and could protect the freighter within its shields while loading an orca would work well but an orca provides none of the defensive benefits a pos does
that would work just code it so if anchored in deep space it has cpupower grid penalty to maintain the anchoring and if anchored at a moon there would be no penalty in keeping with t2 stuff being generally better than faction t1 give the pos even more cpupower grid than faction towers but make the deep space penalty high enough that you have less cpupower grid that a normal t1 pos if anchored in deep space
eve has qa
i approve of physics which properly simulate booby movement while were at it put gannets and skuas on the list
you guys are disgusting lets not turn eve into a tomb raider franchise i think the folks complaining are just those men who made a women toon with maxxed sized inhuman breasts the kind that are made of silicon so it looks weird when they dont move
even small boobs move but really this is a bit silly to worry about given how many more pressing issues are in eve
this is already in game however the structure of braziers in eve is far more advanced than we have on earth giving far more support and keeping the girls in place that is why they do not move any woman with average or larger size breasts that participates in active sports or runsjogs on a regular basis knows the value of having really good support most athletes do not giggle much due to the firm support of a good sports bra if they changed the game so you could actually walk around topless like in age of conan then i could see a need for life like breast movement but in eve this is a fail idea
aye support me err supported
i just thought it was low station gravity and the benefits of genetic engineering but i cant believe the jovians provided inertial dampening fields in ladies undergarments

thanks for the bump i needed a good laugh and your proposal delivers
you know this almost made it to the second page then you had to go and post can you imagine how much effort all the other forum watchers had to put in to not post and bump this you should be ashamed for bumping this  i only post because its already at the topand naturally was waiting for someone else to bump thisplease leave this thread alone so one more thread with actual content can make it to the front pagethread
no riskwwwsuddenbuggerycomkillboardand others like narwhals ccres lost etc etcas for the farm the hell out of abc i doubt its really as bad as you nullturds make out 10k abc is 160km3 you refine inhole you lose 25 you export it takes 8 round trips in a meta4 industrial through hostile 00 space at risk of bombs hictors sniper hacs mwdbumping t3s knocking you off the hole etc etc etc which takes almost as much time as mining the damn stuffas for mining the stuff well you have to sit there mashing dscan like a rat on methadone or you get probed out and podded whereas in nullsec you immediately see your enemy enter system and hit warp to pos and you go cower in your fairy bubbles like schoolgirls until your 50 man blob comes and chases the bad dramiel awayyeah wormhole miners are creaming itoh and heres an idea dumbfirkin hows about you lern2probe and find those wormholes which spawn into nullsec you too can be farming of the sites
bumpcan we get a csm response on this idea
gentlepodsin a few days i will begin another round of prioritization crowdsourcing in preparation for that i would appreciate your help in getting the list of items as accurate as possiblei have done a pass of csms list of inprocess items and migrated completed and denied items as appropriate i have also moved some items that ccp has sent back to csm for review to a new tobereviewed category in the wiki i intend to prioritize both the inprocess and tobereviewed itemsi particularly need help verifying that all the items listed in these categories are correctly categorized no doubt there are a few that have actually been implemented in some form by ccp and id like to move them off the listi have put up a skeleton page listing all the items on the wikibased on feedback from the last prioritization this time around i intend to let people vote both for and against items and ill generate results in multiple ways so well be able to see the most loved most hated and most divisive itemsyou should expect formal crowdsourcing to begin towards the end of the week or early next week
sweet enjoy doing these and seeing the resultsi do not see some items and am not sure how the list was populatedprioritizing the art departments work would also fall under this would it not so raising the desire to se engine trailes and new effects should eb there should it not as well as the addition of corp logos to ships via the csm minuteseven thugh the csm said it was low priority
couldnt see my proposal listed on the skeleton page to bring back the oldprevious sound effects for the strip miners and mining drones i have read numerous people asking for this to be done
ccp you want to sell convenience then allow me to buy premium research lab time like available slots x056 multipliers etcid certainly pay aurum for that
no waythat gives you an advantage with real money in the game
does it im just purchasing a commodity like available research slots and time mind you this is no more giving me an advantage than buying pos time somewhere  the only difference being that i can do it directly via the nex store which is where ccps convenience part comes inand think about it why shouldnt npc stations rent out research slots for immediately availability to folks willing to pay extra for it the fact that they dont is actually whats strange its like selling server bandwidth if you pay more you get more makes perfect sense to mealso please dont get hung up on the word aurum as it would likely just be plexes converted to aurum anyway
because your proposal gives an in game advantage for aurumif you want private research slots there is nothing stopping you from putting up a pos somewhere
i dont see how if i form a 1man corp people will just dec me and fly in as many battleships as it takes to destroy my pos in highsec and in lownull sec i probably wouldnt even get the chance to put one up
yes making a corp does indeed open you up to war decs but thats the price you pay for gaining all the extra benefits of makingbeing in a player corpheres my advice keep your head low dont smack aggravate or gain the attention of the locals attention is bad set yourself up in a place where there is little traffic or more make a judgement call on where you feel youll draw the least amount of attention to yourself make friends preferably ones with teeth even more preferable ones that are local if you get decced have your friends dec the aggressor make deals can be done with friends preferable or mercs just offer up your services if they defend you ex cheaper bpcs cheaper ships cheaper ammo etc always put in the maximum amount of strontium you can into your pos this will give you time to formulate a proper responsebut i digressnot supporting this its a blatant example of people paying rl money for an ingame advantage
its an mmo not single player but srsly  you can setup a pos in low with 2 man corp  been there done that just make sure that1 its rarely used system2 its within one jf jump from hi or more preferably its connected directly to hi 3 moon have no worthy moon goo4 full stront bay5 get some friends srsly ill say it again its an mmo
in to advertise my alliance why pay aur when you could pay good old isk
another good reason not to support your proposal entrepreneurship such as this fine corporations
in missions if any npc is warp scrambling its almost always a frigate theres only one case i can think of where a mission cruiser warp scrambles and that mission has a total of six ships to fight so i generally eliminate the frigates first and then deal with everything else i havent lost a missionrunning ship to npcs yetthat said i dont see the harm in this so supported
you having to buy a new ship incentivizes the whole economy and your personal interest  health of the economy so no
when ever i am being warp scrambled or webbed there is a little icon on the overview beside the ship doing it just pop those ships first and you are free to warp out
i reported it in a bugreport and it was classified as bug by bughuntersteam its only logical if you first get warnings in missions about scramblers trust in them and then suddenly without warning before accepting the mssion there is sctually a ship with warp scrambler
your comment would be great had it been sarcastic so im confused as to why you support this proposal
it would end these threadsthere is nothing you can do to change the common perception that t2 bpos are unfair when people find out that a privileged few have something they cannot they have some anger and frustration eliminating t2 bpos will make thousands of players who are less unhappy
im not even into industry myself but its the idea of it its like p2w items  except you didnt have to pay for it with aurum but ccp just gave them to you its just weird such items simply shouldnt exist in gameand to those who claim theres not much difference in profit to be had between t1 and t2 bpos a t2 hulk bpo currently goes for ca 60100 bil i guess it costs that much because its not much better than just inventing a hulk with regular t1 bpos right sarcasm im often amazed how people can say these things with a straight face
signed
i am always for removing anything that is a static isk printing machine currently those are t2 bpos and bottleneck moon gooon a side note you do realize that there is a mailing list that all t2 bpo owners are a part of right any time a thread appears with the idea of removing them from the game or reducing their efficiency in making isk they spam it hard core telling everyone to derail the thread as fast as possible with their army of altsyou have been warned
but if you remove all t2 bpos from the game then how will you make new ones with t1 bpos and it will make the isk you pay for t2 ships and equipment go up but yeah who needs that stuff stupid me you are so right op down with any way for us to have items easy to make so we can get them easily
dude youd invent t2 bpcs  you know like every other nonprivileged industrialist does
you are seriously overestimating the profits involvedonly a handful of bpos are in the hands of the original winners and the exorbitant costs involved with buying what is essentially convenience takes years to get back unless it is sold again  and that is before market fluctuations take their tollwith a modest payment upfront you can start inventing and make more isk than any bpo holder all it takes is a bit of business savvyif you want to rage then find an actual problem like moongoo which is 100 the richmans isk printing press supers needed to acquirehold and a prerequisite for bpo and invention boththe only area where the bpos are skewing the markets are for the resource intensive items ships but for all their epeen enhancing properties they are but a small part of the overall pictureps sounds like you tried your hand at invention chose an egobooster item like a hac only to find it is impossible without taking a loss now who is the lazy one  you didnt even bother reading up on it
so petty these ad hominems and alas so common for threads like this still penalty for personal fouloh and do try and read a few of the replies a bit before you post would ya since i already said im not an industrialist and have no intention of becoming one its apparently very difficult for people to understand that one can advocate balance without actually having a vested interest in the matter
so not only do you speak on a subject you have zero knowledge of but you do so without having any intention of ever acquiring said knowledge  you should be taken seriously why exactly not having a vested interest is one thing but being ignorant of the subject matter is something else entirely  read up on it loads of material available the ignore feature on the new forums will do wonders for my calm  cant wait
again with the sad stream of personal attacks would it kill you to i dunno stick an actual argument in there somewhere you know just for good measurenb oh and i dont fly supercaps either nor do i intend to become a supercap pilot and yet i still want supercaps nerfed weird eh
it takes your about 68 years depending on bpo to earn enough isk to pay off the purchaseisk printing machines indeed
this is a blatant lie
wanting to do away with things you know nothing about
this should have been done ages ago when t20 was giving out prints for his buddies
this is something that has happened to 2 of my toons in 4 different corporations already since i came back a couple of days ago people will war dec highsec mining lowbie corporations hoping to either get isk or get some easy kills there should be some kind of change to the war dec system here is what i propose1 make it so that in order for combat to occur both sides have to declare2 double the amount it costs to declare3 both sides pay above amount half the isk goes in to a fund with the winner getting that isk4 you win by causing the other side to surrender or after 1 week have less loses then the other sideplease this is a serious discussion treat it as such if you are a forum troll please find a different thread to troll however if you have something that you feel should be added or changed please reply
you will find all these things and more in hko
maybe you should find another game
gets out troll bashing hammer and smashes troll get out your not wanted here
no u
this topic has literally been beaten to death please read those threads to find out what youve missed instead of making new ones
not using that word it isnt
this game is a pvp mmo nonconsensual combat is not only to be expected it is more common this doesnt make griefers any less lame but its trueive realized that eve war is not war in any sense of the word griefers win if they derive pleasure in your misery thats really it its not war in an economic or political sense at all
to the top
no i am a lower skillpoint character and i am saying   no this is the worst idea that anyone could ever come up with i think the only thing that would even be acceptabl to give newer playerscharacters a skill boost would be to give them a boost to skillpoint learning that goes away as they get more skill points such as for the first 1 million skillpoints they get double gains for each subsequent million they lose 20 after 5 million they go to normal actual numbers could changed to be more acceptable also other actions could be used to trigger the end of this bonus such as certain skill book injects with the effect added to the description anyone with these skillbooks would be allowed to have the bonus as long as they do not train any points into the skill also entering lowsec space could cancel this effect as welledit also if you want to buy skill points buy lots of plex and by a flippen character that can do what you want to do or stfuedit
christ is this still dragging onlook i sympathise with noobs joining eve only to find out theyre not immediately able to handle lowsec 00 or wh space which ill just call lower sec from now on but how is that any different from any other mmo i cant do max level raids in eq or wow with a new toon eitheryes i understand its possible for characters in those other mmos to get to max level much faster not that eve has a max level as such but then they just transition from level progression to gear progression as if its any differenthowever  getting back on track  perhaps instead of complaining that they cant join their established mates in lower sec space eve noobs ought to take advantage of the multitude of other corps that will happily take on new players willing to learn with a good attitude as well as the many soloable activities for off peak hoursim also aware of many large corps and alliances that have noob friendly activities or sister corps in highsec maybe if you want a rl friend to stick at eve you should take a week away from your high level lower sec activities and spend it with them in highsec teaching and helping them along or even get your corp organised to provide a highsec venture to get noobs interested and ready for your 00 activitiesthere are also programs run by established corps that teach players of any level how to pvp function in a fleet etc not to mention eve uni which is free and excellentso in summary  once again i say if youve a problem with eves slow skill point progression perhaps the issue youre having is one of your own making given how much fun and company there is out there for the new player with the right attitude breaking eve for the rest of us just because you dont like it is not a reasonable position im really sorry but it is not or if your friend is the kind of player who cant ever wait for anything then eve is really the wrong game for him no matter the effort you expend trying to help themnow since ive asked you to be proactive its only fair i do the same thus if you have any questions about how an eve newbie can have fun feel free to ask or make a new thread  i guarantee you youll get plenty of help probably a lot more if in a new thread actually threads like this make most of us shudder and move on me  i have no life so i respond now and again to them  
good idea
sounds like a great idea i dont know how many times i have just stripped manually one module at a time just to keep for having to reload everything when i only what to change a third of itit would be nice also to have to option to strip rigs even if it meant losing the ship im sure a lot more players would use t2 rigs in t1 ships if you could strip the rigs by sacrificing the ship id put full t2 rigs in a mammoth if i could later sacrifice the mammoth to get the rigs back when i no longer needed to ship considering a mammoth is less than 1 mil even t1 rigs are worth more than the ship
also give us back some decent looking mining laser beams these new ones are just pathetic but still not as pathetic as the new weak sound that only plays once
the new sound is so pathetic i thought it was an unintended glitch that would soon be fixed difficult to believe that it was an intended feature working as intendedironically the new visual is nice
id like a pet fish in a force field bubble of water that floats above your shoulder using antigravbut still doubt ill ever buy anything from the nex store after ccps stupid launch and the absurd prices of todays goods its put me off the entire idea
yeah some themed clothing would be nice shoulder pets is going a little to far but whatever i actually like the look of the military style shirt currently available in the nex however the prices are absurd for a vanity item in what world should an optical implant that provides no stats or bonuses of any kind and is only for looks be in the same price bracket as a capital ships 12 billion isk for a monocle may be worth it for a select few elite traders making billions of isk a day but that is a very small number of players i also realize this is probably the whole point they want the monocle to be rare only owned by the elite rather than every other toon having one but at least have different versions of it maybe a really fancy gold plated monicle that has a borge style lazer shooting out of it for 12 billion but the standard low end one should not be more than 15 plex worth of aurumthere is no way i would ever even consider spending over 100 in real money on plex to get enough aurum to buy a vanity item im sure at least 80 of the eve community would agree with me i find these prices so overboard that i refuse to even support the nex by buying the cheaper items i would have no problem paying a few mil isk for some nicer clothing even a few hundred mil for the higher end items but over 1 billion isk is just ridiculous they did this totally backwards they should have released the nex with a few basic items at much lower prices and then added the more exotic elite items at ridiculous prices later having vanity items that on release cost over 100 in real money just makes ccp look like a bunch of greedy money hungry idiots directly resulting in the revolt against mt if they are so money hungry to ask for 100 worth of plex to get a monocle than it is not so far fetched to think that they will add non vanity items in the future  oh wow i can buy a carrier for 250 my dad is rich he wont mind me putting that on his credit card this was a major blow to ccps credibility with much of the player base another decision this stupid could ruin the game sending players running like they did when nge was released in swg
i was wondering on what everyone thoughts were on dead pos in space basically not fueled and has been for monthsthis is only a suggestion so please refrain from the flaming as i am fragile to the flame what if a pos has been offline for so long or empty of fuel that it actually unanchors or just disintegrates like containers in space have to have someone access them every so often why not have a pos require fuel every so often or it disappears or unanchors anyone
it certainly would not be orca can haul all sorts of ships thats one of its assets and charmsapplying a simple nondocking period to people with aggro is both in line with the already existing rules and its clean and simple
rofl  youve stooped to the lowest level of internet debate youre now a grammar  classic
thats an interesting take on the issue as well
you know had i done that the very same chest thumping clowns would have said did you loose a ship noob or some other such comments i choose to lay it all out and throw their crap back in their faces i did this from the very first post there are no edits there my reactions and format of this thread have been quite deliberate
im not the one who created the post im just making fun of himyou are missing my actual point its not that he fell into a trap its that hes being a hypocrite for complaining about someone shipping up to a more powerful ship after he went and shipped up to a more powerful shipsuch a mechanic wouldnt have changed the outcome in this case if the op was cleared of aggression timers blocking docking to switch to his interceptor from his mission ship the pirate would have been free of any aggression timers to swap a ship from the orcas maintenance bay eve is rife with imbalances and lopsided mechanics knowing those is a part of successfailure in the game there are so many things in this game that need attention more than this issue things that actually rate developer time and affect more than the occasional mission runner who is stupid enough to try and fight a ninja i mean come on there are only two circumstances people engage in combat in this game when they have an edge they are pretty sure will give them victory or they dont have a choice this is a situation where the op thought he had that edge when he went and got his inty only to learn that he did not as his opponent swapped into a strategic cruiser
the only change i could see wanting in this situation is the orca pilot should have got agro for interactingsupporting him would have been really funny if he warped in his orca got into his loki only to lose the orcai agree that the op only died from his own stupidity but being able to swap ships at an orca ship maintenance bay while under agro without the orca pilot getting agro is not right this should either not be allowed or the orca should gain agro from interacting with the player who has agro what if the op had got the loki down into structure and then the aggressor switched to another ship to avoid losing his loki that would definitely be an exploit and probably would have happened if the op was strong enough you can not be allowed to support an agroed character without becoming agroed yourself it is the same principal of getting remote repped by a neutral they fixed that now fix this
so how many supports was that d
so your point is you roam around constellations scanning and never staying in the same place long and then dt happens and all the sigs get reset and this is a problemhow if you are camping a wormhole for a few days farming sites from the back of an orca it pays to bm the sigs when you move on you delete if you are in there less than 24hrs you move onthe connections collapseyou might not find your way back to that hole for weeks andyou want the sig bookmarks to be accurateim honestly not seeing the point move on trash the bms deal with itthere are roid field databases already pulled from the eve api dotlan for example this is quite functional with the ingame browser as it stands you just leave your browser open and minimise it when not necessary believe me living in a wormhole as a resident i cop this sig id change at downtime every day i would love to have them stay the same ccp must have had a reason to implement this change and my corp has adapted others have their own solutions as simple as corp bulletins for instance so it is what it is but changing things to make itinerant freelancers lives easier when they are roaming randomly around kspace isnt much of a target audience
opposedthis is just good housekeeping corps in wh space should know what sigs are in thier system and should scan regularypart of being in wh is the fact that sigs do change and i see no need to make it easier for lazy corps or those that do not have the scanning skills or the logistics in place to know what exists in thier whas has been said before wh space isnt easy mode just leave it as it isand that includes leaving the abc ores
agree to the op it is a bit of whining
so your point is you roam around constellations scanning and never staying in the same place long and then dt happens and all the sigs get reset and this is a problemhowyou want the sig bookmarks to be accurateme personaly didnUFFFDt even want most of them to be bookmarks but i want to have a clue what i already have scanned in those systems but mentioned that beforethere are roid field databases already pulled from the eve apiyep and maybe there are harvestable moon material databases as wellbut they are uninteresting to me  because its not me who scanned those moons or find that kind of ore in that system for me  in a game is more than just looking at some databases mentioned that too2 organise your incorp intel somehow via motds in intel channels web applets googledocs spreadsheets whatever it takesyeah or iUFFFDll just board a shuttle land on on planet make some colour out of some botanicals and starting to do some cavepaintings and every time i want this information iUFFFDll fly back and have a lookmentioned that as wellccp must have had a reason to implement this changetheir names were static before any kind of ccp change if yes those reasons would be very interesting maybe there could have been choosen some other way else was it discussed somewehere a link would be nicebut changing things to make itinerant freelancers lives easier when they are roaming randomly around kspace isnt much of a target audiencethis isnUFFFDt about making things easier for some fraction and harder for others itUFFFDs about a sciencefictionmmoonboardtoolsvsoffboardtoolsandgameexpieriencequestionif there would be a problem with ballance there would still be the possibility to improve gameplay and make sure it is ballancedat this point i canUFFFDt see any real reasons against such a request
the store has nto been well implemented and has nothing i wnat to buythat does nto mean that i am against the store but having a new coat does nto intrest me i also do not want to see non vanity items therewell fine i dont need to use the nex storebut what can ccp do to get me to use aurumsimplethe store needs some high value items for corps to purchasethese items would cost aurumand maybe more that could be earned through isk or buying them these items would be big and considered corp goalsmore expensive the a monoclethe idea is to buy something that affect the entire corpsome examplessewen badge of corp logo 10 aurumeach memebr of the corp can chose to wear the patchship logos 40 aurumeach memebr may add a corp logo to his ship for 5000 nobel metalcorp background 5 aurumeach memebr can use a new back groundall your corp could look similaryou get the ideai think these need to be put in i have a lot more intresest in working towars these than to individual vanity items
i like the idea however i think it would be to much work for the art dept they would need to make an entire new ship skin for each corp that wanted there own logo i dont believe the current model can be modified to have a logo added to current skins it would be cool though if they added military style uniforms in a bunch of different colors the the corpalliance could buy and they would automatically be available to anyone in that corpalliance this way a corp or alliance could have a standard uniform even if not unique that all members can wear it would be really cool if they could add a feature to certain cloths that did allow for custom colors and logos it may be possible considering that the station captains quarters skin has a logo above the walkway that changes depending on what station you are in but again from what i have read in dev blogs the current model for cloths and ships does not allow for variations each variation needs to be introduced as a new skin that would be a huge server load to introduce a new skin for every ship for each corporationalliance that bought it but if they charged enough arum it might be worth it for ccp to look into it 1 plex  3500 aurum a custom shirt with corpalliance logo for everyone in corp 100000 aurum thats about 500 usd real money for a coustom alliance shirt in game not worth it for ccp as a 1 off item but if they made a few custom skins that just need a color and logo inserted for each corp that bough t it they could cut it down to 1520 minutes dev time per sale but they would need a lot of corps jumping in to pay the cost of developing that customizable skin in the first place if they did it i would expect to see 80100000 aurum before they would justify the time invested to develop a custom skin for an individual corp some big alliances would have no problem paying for that though only 2030 of the cost of a titan
the corp logo would be easier than a reskin as it uses the current skin and the lgo could be placed as a sort of modual using the color matching tech already displayed for turrets the corp logo is made up of in game images rather than custom art so it may be possible tohave a badge shirtif this can be built into the current ship remodel that woudl be really nice so it would not require a re skin to implement
sounds good to me
even the nerf they propose for the dramiel isnt really much of a nerf its going to make it actually killable by something somewhere maybe if the dram pilot stuffs up
im on the fence on this onethat said if it were implemented then the easiest way to do it would be a decoration awarded by npc corporations andor factions so ore awarding decorations for asteroids mined an npc corporation awarding decorations for missions run and so on that way were using the existing mechanisms rather than creating new mechanisms
but hisec has the community that sees the most attrition in the game and everyone has known one or more friends who started the game only to quit a week later lowsec and nullsec players are very unlikely to pickup and leave the game having invested so much into it already so sadly ccp can ignore them more while still keeping the greater population happy
yes this is a good idea it will also add to the rp dimension i think that if eve can get more of the single player rpers they once they get hooked and get enough money to afford a couple of lost ships they will come around to enjoy the other parts of the game low and null
supported with the reservation that i should be able to salvage those medals off your frozen corpse 
i like that idea
it would be very useful if there would be ability to group members and their alts together in the corporation memberlisting not only it would provide good view which members are actually active but also would provide nice compressed information to who is who in the corpa few cents and fistful of dollars
noi have not provided you with an api and thus my account is secret i have 2 charcters in your corp ever notice how  and  are nto on at the same timethat is because we are going to rob youtuesday 1407 eve timereally no because it would provide information not available normally also not all alts are on the same acount
zangoruss suggestion is considered an exploit and bannable offense login traps considered an exploit of game mechanics and get you kicked from game if reported to ccmat least that was my understanding
like mission running mining and turtling in npc corps
perk did i hear something about felonious goats totally 100 wrong logon traps are not at all an exploit
yes log on traps are not an exploitbut seriously we can stop posting in this my thread its quite deadand for the record activities involving goats and felonies are among the best ideas mankind has yet to offer
agreed hybrids should retain their wide variety of range bonuses really imo all they need is a wee bit of a dps boost compared to the other weapons
i like the idea of all the same ammo and changing charge levels to affect range and tracking make changing charge levels instant like lasers but they have a 20 sec reload when they run out of ammo per clip make the damage get higher at longer range charge levels for rails and opposite for blasters to enhance their flavor even more
this looks like a workable and sensible way of buffing hybrids particularly rails right now you have basically 2 choices for pvp with t2 railguns navy thorium or navy antimatter because the tracking penalties of anything else utterly bork your real dps there is also merit in differentiating gallente and caldari hybrid weapon bonuses from ship type eg the rokh gets great optimal bonuses which get completely borked the moment you load any ammo in the guns be they blasters or rails a mechanic where you get better tracking for shorter range ammo with lower dps should create a fairly flat dps curve this would be a major improvement for hybrids allowing a reasonable dps output at all ranges however it would potentially make blaster bs too dangerous to approach in a smaller ship with good closerange tracking especially because people will quickly drop the mandatory mwdscramweb trinity for blasterthrons with more of a mwdscramtp it would also require thought about sniper boats loading highdps longrange ammo and dropping massive sniper fleets at extreme 220km range and getting max dps though it must be said that this would just turn the alpha fleet fotm from maelstroms with arty to hyperions with 425s nevertheless a worthy mechanic worthy of worthiness
i really like this idea it needs some work to balance the details but i like the idea of hybrids being more power at range limits like for example a rail gun would out perform a artty at max range but rapidly lose the advantage as range is lost while arttys perform well at lower rangesexcept for tracking and gradually lose dps as range goes up arttys better at medium to long range rails better at long range sniping and on the flip side blasters would be unmatched dps and tracking at close range but would rapidly lose effectiveness as range increases while autocanons are good at medium to close range losing tracking become less effective at really close range again blasters are better if you are always up really close but auto cannons better if you fight at varying from close to medium auto cannons are better i really think it would work i think this is basically what the op was thinking but to implement this through changes to the ammo i think is a great idea it would give hybrids a unique niche to fill making them most effective at extreme rangesclose or far but much less effective in between when projectiles will shine i believe this would make them more of a experienced pilots dream weapon if you are good enough to dictate range in combat they will be the best weapons but far less versatile than projectiles so arttys would reduce in dps as range increases rail guns would increase in dps as range increases but also need more cap as range increased and autocannonsblasters would be the opposite with blasters increasing in damage and cap consumption as range got closer as more power would be needed to keep the gun accuratestablebetter tracking at closer ranges making them both unique with there own strengths and weaknesses lazers still would have the big advantage of not needing to reload no ammo just crystals and capacitor energy most likely still preferred by many mission runners to keep costs down hybrids need a unique feel and to fit as the best weapon in certain situations to really see them used regularly most players will always go for the higher dps so hybrids need a situation that makes them the best dps without over shadowing the advantage other weapons have with the current system as others have said most players will run either lazers or projectiles even on hybrid platforms as the hybrid turrets currently leave much to be desired however there is always the chance that these weapons where meant to be inferior caldari do have the best missile boats and gallentine have the best drone boats to give them both really good hybrid weapons as well might be to much but if done right it could really help to balance the use of all the various ships available
at higher fps values the human eye does not capture discreet frames it can however distinguish between different fps values through movement fluidity for instance on a high frequency crt the difference between 60 and 100 fps is very noticeable in fast paced games like shooters its a shame almost all lcd panels are 60hz onlythat is incorrect by limiting the fps the graphics card can go into idlepower save states much more often reducing power consumption and thus heat
op got himself killed by running head first into a trap and is now following the time honoured path of whinging on the forums
gotta admit mittens is brave for jumping on this one brave but stupidi wonder how he feels when ccp reports that the high end minerals are the price they are because of drone regions and botsplease let me see a dam hulk on dscan in a c1
i wonder if csm is getting confused about thousands versus millions when examining the figures that ccp providedthen again it could be an attempt to get a wh nerf in under the radar while trying to distract everyone with oh look supercaps nerf
jesus h fcking christ this has got to be the stupidest fcking statement  of supposed fact  i have ever seen as a player who has had a character live in both a c4 and a c6 system and im sure anyone with any amount of time spent in dubya space will agree this shyte dont happen sorry  opening your mouth and making that kind of general statement shows you know nothing about the subject matter youre professing knowledge to zero zilch de nadawhile i had time away from eve i dont ever remember a wh exit right into jita closest i remember is maybe 5 jumps  and people had to change their soiled underwear when that happened  it was a crap shoot where you had exits to and it wasnt always caldari space or even hisec making it sound like theres some wh exit superhighway system into jita is plain ignorance and pander to your null sec  abc bot mining no doubt  buddies not to mention spreading misinformation  dare i say  damn lies  to players of eve who dont know anything about wormhole space and might see you as csm president as having some understanding of how the game worksyou go take around 20 people into a wormhole and live for a couple month then come back here  or your csm fireside chat  and tell everyone how easy it is moving stuff around and how easy it is to mine  much less find  sites in a wormhole if one of your folks can fly it elaine try a plated up domi wan ab for crashing holes that was our proffered method along whaving one of our guys loose an ocra when he miscalculated the mass and ended up on the null sec side of a wh once a domi is a little cheaper on the wallet in those instances
being comparatively new to the forum i have not been able to find any references to a body to represent the interests of people living in hisec having read both the minutes of the csmccp meetings in may and also a number of posts to jita park i am concerned that 00 maybe making a move to shift the balance of eve to favour lowsec in mining invention and so on a couple of threads here and here seem to show a campaign aiming to convince ccp that the proposals coming from the csm have the full support of all sections of the game i feel that this is to promote the interests of the corps and alliances in 00 at the expense of the other areas of the game some other posters have suggested that a forum should be opened to allow hisec residents to coordinate their responses and ultimately to put forward candidates for the next csm so as to safeguard the interests of hisec i agree and would like to hear from others interested in setting up such a forum if there is not somewhere already for this purpose i should say that personally i have no interest in standing as a candidate in any future election the nda insisted on by ccp makes this impossible as i have an aversion to gagging clauses of any kind
i fail to see where any of the threads youre linking says anything you claim them to the first is some guy expressing his gratitude towards the csm for going to iceland on short notice discussing the latest pr fiasco concerning virtual goods and forcefeeding players cq it is entirely unrelated to any nullhighsec issues which werent even talked about at that particular emergency summitthe second one is proposing more work on highsec because the majority of characters is located in highsec which is the exact opposite of what you claim it to say
ok thanks for the feedback let me see if i can make things a litle clearerthe first post on first glance has nothing to do with the moves to enhance the opportunies for 00 its a peaen of praise for the csmthe reason i highlighted it was because the op has a very short employment history yet seems to have knowledge of the timescales involvedin the meetings something i was not aware of and i have been following the election and so on quite closelythe second poster also has a short employment history but again seems to know a lot about the benefits and disadvantages of 00 versus hisecim not the only one to notice the short history of the first poster by the way to me the fact there have been two posts both supporting in different ways the stance of csm seems to be curious ill not put it any stronger than thatwhat im trying to point out is that there seems to be some sort of effort to boost the standing of the proposals about giving 00 advantages not shared with other sectorsand that the posting of two supportive posts by characters with short histories who should be less informed than more longstanding players is an anomaly it smacks of astroturfing to me it could be that i have not been paying close enough attention to the csm and its schedule etc or it could be that old age and paranoia are taking their tollwhat i feel is more important is that hisec should try and organise a mechanism to ensure that the residents are sufficiently represented so as not to be unduly disadvantaged in any changes mooted for the future
i see  so regarding the second thread youre not referring to the op but some other guy in the thread i wouldnt pay any attention to character age on eveo forum postings as most people use disposable alts to do that i think this character only has a couple of months on her back without ever being in any corp  its an untrained scouting alt i have on one of my accounts and i biomass those frequently to avoid anyone associating her arrival with that of my other character i still fail to see how the first post relates to anything with highsecnullsec priorities as he thanks the csm for discussing the mt issue in an emergency meeting again highnullsec balance was not discussed there in case you think he refers to the recently released transcripts in which those matters indeed were discussed  those were from the regular may meeting not the emergency july meeting the op is talking aboutedit ah  i think ive found who you meant  the guy has a point imho ccp designed the game with a certain progression in mind  ie learning to walk in a safe playpen highsec and then once the characterplayer has grown up made some isk and can look after his own security without calling for mommy concord he moves on to nulllowsec where he occasionally flies bigger ships than he could in highsec makes more money and so onthe problem is not ccpthe csm not caring about the people in highsec  new player experience is constantly iterated on and has seen the latest iteration with the improved tutorials provided through cq and aura the problem is that the playpen is too comfortable compared to finding an own apartment like one should normally do eventually which is why we ended in the current state with grown up rich characters still sitting in highsec like 40 year olds still sleeping in cradles mission hubs and being breastfed l4 missionsso id agree with him that the best way to make the game more interesting and less repetitive for highsec players is to create more incentives for them to finally move out into the real world 00
i think you are the one who has to grow up and realise that 00 isnt and never will be the ultimate goal for all playersa lot of people dont have fun playing the big lag battles where it takes 10 minutes to lock a target and then you maybe can get a shot offa lot of people dont have fun flying in pure gank fits to shoot easy targets and then roflmao thema lot of people stay in high sec because why would they let the null sec carebears dictate their gameplayinstead half of null sec is napping eachother and in return the other half naps themselves too and then the tears come because all of a sudden there are only a few frontlinessocalled hardcore pvpers crying they dont get enough targets to shoot at and blaming the high sec players for not comming to null secif the socalled hardcore pvpers want to pvp so passionatly i am sure they can get all the pvp they want in 00ow wait they cant half is blue and the other half is too far away or god forbid they might be able to kick your l33t arse back to the cribwant 00 less stagnant make blue list a very short list so only like max 1 or 2 alliances can get set bluemax 5 corporationred setting not possible cause that would make it too easy to see whos really neutral and who is only neutral due to not being in the blue settingbut heck that wont happen cause then 00 would really become a dangerous place to live at and you would have to do more than blaming people who dont give a rats arse about your playstyle for not following it
nooooo move out into the real world 00 this is exactly my point im a carebear and not ashamed to admit it i dont want to move to 00 i play eve to relax my real life is stressful enough so i invent a little run missions have some pi etc etc i dont need any more adrenalin rushes from pvp or have to keep looking over my shoulder to see whats behind me nor do i want to be a master of the universetm i want to be allowed to play as i want to and not as some megacorpsalliance or ccp think i should my money is accepted by ccp as readily as the blackest pirate or ceo of a huge alliance if you want to build an empire complete with titans stations etc be my guest but please allow me to play eve in a way that suits me to do otherwise is to infringe on the equal rights i have to enjoy playing a game that so many people love and have invested so much time and money in
despite your rather emotional inflammatory post ill give a serious answeri dont even have a single character in a sovholding allianceguess what  i dont enjoy flying around like a drone once a year clicking a broadcast in my fleet window and hitting f1 either because i for one dont consider that to be pvp theres npc 00 wormhole 00 lowsec  all without blobwarfare structuregrind napfests and all thati also agree that sov 00 people are for the most part the biggest carebears of them all actually thats the fascinating thing the carebears still not moving to sov 00 despite it being just as safe for a carebear not interested in pvp as highsec  as the guy in the other thread said the biggest 00 entity until recently consisted of 50k carebears with no interest to pvp ever and they did fine for quite some time these guys wouldnt leave their sanctums eben whilst their spaceempire was crumbling hell  havent been there in a while but getting ganked in motsu in a tengu is more likely than getting killed in some pocket in sov 00 with a bubble camped entryso what exactly is your point are you complaining theres not enough pvp in sov 00 so you stay in highsec because you get more pvp with empire wardecsgood for you  dont go thereare you not interested in pvp at all but miss higher level content in highsec join an alliance and go to carebear sov 00 for high level carebearing or go to a wormhole for a little more adventureare you interested in pvp but are annoyed with wartargets hiding in stations all day long in highgo to npc 00lowsecactually this intrigues me  what do you people expect ccp to do with highsec more varied background stories for the red crosses you shoot at in your officer fit golems
well  thats an honest answer  and its in your best right to play as you wish but the same question as to the above poster applies what do you want added to highsec thenbesides sov 00 not being the murderous harsh place where you live in constant paranoia  its carebear heaven where you can grow your own complexes which you can then run in a supercarrier if you wish with a few entry points 20 jumps away from your location which are bubblecamped by a bunch of wannabepvpers in your alliance if yomething slips through theyll warn you in your intel channel giving you plenty of time to safe up even if you were afk at the timealso im really just wondering what do you people make all these isk for if you dont intend to do anything that could put something at risk one day or maybe you already do you have your fully officer fitted machariel in which you can run an ae in 10 minutes and an additional 100 bill isk on your account and then whatif you never put anything at risk you dont need isk to replace it obviously so why are you still generating them
most of the csm are 00 lobbyists so what do you expectalso abc ores already are restricted to nullsec whs also being 00 in general highsec serves two main purposes  let newbs learn to walk have a neutral meeting ground for tradeso basically i dont see much need for highsec expansions if its boring and repetitive go do something else  be it in highsec or somewhere else even highsec isnt restricted to mindnumbingly rescue damsels all day long go wardec someone do incursions leave for 00 whspace or lowsecthere is no need for midendgame highseccontent because the midendgame content of eve is already there  its called wardecs00lowsec as hopelessly broken the latter might bethe only problem is that highsec is far too lucrative and risk free hence a huge percentage of players never moves on to a higher level and gets stuck in the newbarea due to a lack of incentives to move on this needs fixing and this is whats being worked on for the winter expansion
this not a single highsecer i know bothers with the csm then again most of them dont even visit the forums on a regular basis if highsec wants representation they need to abaondon isolationism and get a serious set of candidates in mind for the next roundi am however confident that this will not happen
so even though 80 of the player base lives in highsec it shouldnt matter if that were true there would not be nearly as many highsec systems think about it what you said is short sighted and onesided i know plenty of people who choose to live in empire space because of their play style not everyone wants to deal with blobs and gate camps
well you know of one now me
it strikes me that we seem to be being astroturfed on the merits of 00 versus hisec this poster only has an employment record of 4 months and this seems to be a pattern with amar azaph posting here link he too has a 4 month employment history coincidence maybe
carmen well  until very recently the majority of players living in the biggest nullsec powerblock consisted of people who never engaged in pvp didnt camp gates never left their anomalies even if a homedefense blob was called for or never ran into g
i saw somewhere that the average age of an eve player is 31 i happen to have a young family i assume im not alone in having significant rl demands that prohibit me from being online for extended periods on voicecoms or able to monitor local and the scanner without distraction that makes trips to lowsec or 00 an infrequent luxury for me does the fact that i am based in hisec make my subscription less valuable to ccp than that of those in nulsec alliances i hope not indeed the fact that i am a casual player means i have had to spend real dollars on plexes to buy new ships when ive lost them i just dont have the rl time to make that much iskit already seems that a disproportionate protion of ccps development effort goes to supporting a minority of players in nulsec alliances i hope this doesnt continue
there are several csm members that care deeply about hisec issues most notably meissa and myself there are lots of things that are horrible that need to be fixed but the blunt fact of the matter is that hisec participation in csm voting is much lower than nullsec participation so most of the csms are going to come from nullsec until this changesadd to that the fact that fixing basic things in the game is boring but fixing nullsec is a more interesting challenge and there is a definite bias towards nullsec at least for nowit is for this reason that i put most of my effort into general game issues like the ui where improvements would benefit everyone because its easier to make the costbenefit case
caring about high sec issues is a whole other ballpark than actually doing somehthing about itit means that the high sec representation will have to realise they have to work harderthe number of votes alone in the csm isnt the only thing that decides if something comes up on the agenda its also the amount of players agreeing on the forums about a topicand yes to have more people in high sec to actually agree with a certain topic you need to work a lot harder than in null secthe high sec csm members can put in their own agenda to bring the csm more to the high sec crowd raise interrest etc you represent a slower to respond and most likely slower willing to vote mass but if you want to be representers of this group then that is what you do and not just ride your own favourite piggy and for the rest swim along with the null sec incrowdyou arent in the csm to avoid the boring stuff stuff like this just proves to me that the representation we currently have are mainly glamour bunnies heee look what we all did but heck i look at all the stuff you again didnt represent or brought forwardwhat you call boring is a part which improves the game experience of a lot of people if finally handledfixing null sec is just as boringinteresting as high secthe only difference is that the null sec is more vocal about it this means you will have to find more ways to get the high sec side more vocal yet again less personal directives and more representation your ui improvement isnt why people voted for youthere is no biase towards null sec stop flogging that dead horse there is only more vocal sound about null sec if you manage to bring high sec on a more vocal path you wont hear null sec because the roar of high sec has the option in it to be ten times as loudand that is the sad part you admit that you put most of your effort into your personal project and not into what people voted you for you arent in the csm for your personal little pet project nor for doing costbenefit calculations for ccp they have people for thatsince this csm is an obvious fail for the major part of the playerbase i will focus my time on finding a good group of high sec representing peopleto break the hegemony of null sec loudmouths and bring the csm and ccps attention to where the bigger part of the playerbase actually resideshigh secps yes this is an alt
trebor thank you for your input appreciate your honesty with respect however it seems to me that the csm approach is inadequate as you point out the csm represents the interests of only a small minority of players i am certain ccp is aware of this therefore ccp is quite rightly justified in disregarding the csms opinion if the csm provides advice or priority lists to ccp based solely on the desires of the minority they represent then ccp would be wise to take council elsewhereregarding your point about hisec not being developed because it is not interesting that is exactly the problem and what the csm should be addressing with ccp im not advocating cap ships major fleet fights or top tier anomalies those belong in 00 however there does need to be some more attention paid to the interests of the hisec or more casual player such as more interesting solo pve content like epic arcs or changes to the way markets work to eliminate market bots and give casual players more of a chance
csm  ccps attempt to fight corruption with corruption 
lol nice troll 1010would read again
make it optional i dont give two flips about incarnaambulationwalking in stations if that had been important to me i wouldnt be playing eve i would have been playing 2nd lifeliterally im glad i live in a wormhole ccp  dont you ever introduce stations for whs  and if you do they better be destructible
sure is drama queens itt
in a way yes but not the way you mean when people care they get a bit dramatic nature of the thing really dramatic doesnt  negate it
let me see if i understand this correctly1 csm offers a fireside chat with the playerbase to try and address questionsconcerns they may have2 playerbase asks one questions3 chairman of csm says he doesnt care about that issue and doesnt care what the playerbase thinksdid i miss anything here what kind of bad joke is this shrug account expires in 23 weeks then ill stop posting wait till some point in the future when ccp can be arsed to put some effort into eve instead of barbies
unfortunately your comment is meaningless as you dont understand what the word constituents meanshint it doesnt mean those who voted for me and does by its nature include the crybabies with entitlement complexes

good stuff i just had flashes of elton john in glitterpumps and a peacock feather hat jamming away on his piano
i wasnt reading much before on the eveo forums this sounds great 1
they are finaly getting looked at
watching what they do and not what they say crew checking in
supported
two words interdiction nullificationflame meedit and something that makes me having blops lvl 5 worthwhile starting to think i should have trained jump cal v or carrier v instead p
the only tweaks blops need are fuel bay size and jump range based on our corps experiences running blops these are the only concerns that come up consistently no matter what type of fleet we try to use
i would agree but i dont see how this is a new direction ccp have been rushing stuff out ever since i started playing the game nothing new really
this is important to the newer player who may inadvertently lost faction standing and is attempting to regain iti support
yes i really dont see what all the butthurt is aboutbotting and rmt are the real p2w but everyone seems to put up with that so meh
chucks a snowball at lady spanksomeones become a cynic stop yer bellyachin and support that which you love you know you want it back spank even if its a lost cause support it anyways and laugh about itas far as it being christmas only i say reintroduce it on the basis that somewhere on the planet it is winter and snowingchucks another snowball at lady spankedit forgot to support
id like them back for christmas
well i guess it would be nice to keep it to christmas only then after all snowballs are usually related to winter but having them not supported simply because some stupid noob didnt understand the mechanics like he should have is not a very good excuse to begin with besides i got ganked twice in my lifetime did i report the gankers to ccp for griefing no i just adapted like everyone else doesbut i understand what you meanteditevery time i see your name im reminded of sm for some reason
xmas only would be good but let them not deteriorate if you want to hang onto them and use them in july you should be able toas far as the problem with noobs and carebears not understanding wtf is happening when they get hit by one simply having it explained on the log in screen at xmas time when they are released should be all that is needed i they are to dumb to read and understand it then they need to get used to losing ships anyway in eve there are many situations where ignorance will cost you your ship im sure there are many more noobs that have died jumping into low sec before they understood what it meant than from shooting back at snow ball throwers

wow thats a lot of absolutes in one post kinda makes you appear closed minded or under the delusion that youre the final authority but thanks i really do enjoy it when people get all riled upanyway the only part worth reading in your post wasone of the ideas already proposed was to have standings transferso youre saying a notorious fc is going to trash his name and pay a fee for what will inevitably be fleeting anonymity since theres an alias list at best it would work for only a few fights not very efficient now is itas for alts same as the above but even less likely because of the fee and being alts additionally alts are expendable and change hands enough that your data is probably outdated anyway and the worst consequence is more show info activation thanks for supporting name changesagain no reputation evaded just twisted panties
really paulize i commend and respect your tenaciousness but i think you can call this one dead despite your brave efforts to bump this the overwhelming consensus is that although you may represent the tiny minority of people that need this feature for legitimate uses the potential exploits the fact it makes buying alts on the bazaar even easier and more attractive and all the extra troublework you put on everyone in the game through just so that you can have a rename is unreasonableits time to let it go
i will and do cave to one thing and that is only to sound logic as always its 20 percent making 80 percent of the noise which can be said for both sides worse if you factor me in i believe the silent majority is much more rational and much more ambivalent if not swayed by fear mongering and ignorance thus educating others about how reasonable name changing can be is the path ive taken after all no progress was ever made without a little troubleworkand since you brought it up i dont want to rename my character
bump and stop whining about monocles
great post malc  give us some hybrid love plox
if trial accounts only yesand even then only if member of a npc corp at the current time
where is the button for two thumbs up
if its only unactivated trail accounts then yes its a good idea
i really like this ideafree bump
this sounds like a good idea this way the t2 pos would be usefull around a moon as well for when you want to put up a really big deathstaras an added penalty for anchoring in deep space if the pos ever runs out of fuel it doesnt just deactivate it and its modules also unanchor and if left adrift like this for too long despawn  say 23 days now what would be reaaaallly cool is the ability to set up our own deadspace pockets complete with rooms accel gates etc
please tell me i did not kill this thread
im afraid so  your support of this thread seems to have killed support for lack of perfect support in eve undergarments bugger
i endorse this product andor service ahem
this is actually a very fun idea
i like this idea a lot not just for the implicatiopns for nullsec but as long as they do something about the absurd ehp level scs have it should also solve the im bored so i drop my sc on a random fleet in lowsec because i know theres jack  they can do to me problem as well3 or 4 eafs later and that lone super is a big fat lossmail waiting to happenedit  forgot the thumbs up
and thank you too i can always use a weak foil
the aka system wont workwe went over this at length already do you need more people saying so explicitly before you believe that all the silence on the thread is not us wondering if you are right but us shaking our heads and wondering why you still think it will work i really think that you should live in lowsec or nullsec a bit to realize that some aka will not work the proof is shown in how people name their ships something different just to avoid getting primary targeted in big fleet battles and it does work
i understand many of the concerns in this thread but allowing name changes is not such a big deal especially if it was combined with character name history on public character sheet and automatically updating the name for any other player that has them saved as a contact or blocked contact many players buying characters off the bazaar would love to change the name but it is just one of the things you have to live with buying a character rather than creating one from scratch personally i would like to change my name not because of any reputation or history but just because nobody in voice chat can seem to pronounce it my mistake for not thinking of that when i created the character but i have used this name in several different mmos over the years there are many players here with reasons why a character name change could be used as an exploit but not changing the name of a character bought off the bazaar can be equally exploited say for example a character well established and known in the game is sold they have to notify their current corp that they are being sold be in an npc corp when sold etc but what about past corps that the character was in or contacts they have that the previous owner has earned the trust of they may not know the character was sold the new owner can use past character reputation for espionage or to get into a big alliance possibly with access to alliance assets granted based on the characters reputation especially if the player buying the character knew that character in the past new there history and how to pass themselves off as the original owner they may have bought that character as much to exploit its reputation as for the skill points in such a situation the seller and their friends would benefit from a mandatory renaming at character transfer rather than giving the buyer a choice to rename a character or not i think character renaming when being transferred should be mandatory the buyer should not benifit or suffer for the reputation of the previous owner and the previous owners contacts should not suffer from the sale either this can even come down to a hauling altfreighter pilot sold cheap on the bazaar that had a reputation for being very dependable and many players trusted that character enough to give them contracts at reduced collateral then the new owner exploited that reputation and many stole billions of isk worth of assetspossibly more than they paid for the character to begin with before other players stopped trusting them although having mandatory character name changes on transfer could be exploited i truly believe that the exploits possible with not changing the name are far worseconsider another possible scenario you played with a character a few years ago got along well they were a great fc and a great asset to the alliance you were both in for what ever reason you parted ways and have not seen them in game for over a year you are now in a new alliance and have worked your way to the top you then meet this old friend you have not seen in a year and offer them a position in your new alliance knowing how great of an asset they were in the past you recommend them for immediate promotion over the next month or so corp and alliance assets start to go missing eventually some capital ships disappear from the poses they were left at by the time you realize that this character is no longer the old friend you trusted they have stolen billions in assets from the alliance and they blame you for bringing him in had this player been forced to change the name at character transfer you would have known it was a different owner and not gotten exploited yes having a mandatory name change at transfer could let players change their name simply by transferring that character to another account but i believe the potential for exploits is a lot higher by not having names changed it will do far more good than harm
i can second that this does work most of my haulers are named as a faction shuttle it has gotten me ignored more times than targeted
a good reputation can be exploited just as easy for every character that would change there name to avoid a bad reputation there is another bought on the bazaar that is exploited for their good reputation that the new owner did not earn make it so names can only be changed on character transfer and can not be to an account that uses the the same emailcredit cardpay palisp etc that should really limit the number of players transfer to an alt account just to change their name but some one buying a character from the bazaar should not benefit or get punished for the reputation of the previous owner really what is worse not knowing right away that a contact is someone you hate or not knowing that a trusted contact now belongs to a new owner i think the later is much worse
no it went like this you brought up a point flourished with pathos and i shot it down with logos repeat then you stopped because your silence was due to your lack of a point just like this post becausesomeone already posted the idea that a name changed should begin with the same letter as the original see that all your pathos shot down in one line of logos been there done that lets skip ethos shall we it wont be pleasant
my votes for prioritization supporting all1 colonies2 destructible outposts3 modular starbases4 individual pilot income generation in 005 unanchoring abandoned offline pos6 ships crews7 alliances and factional warfarei have a detailed proposal linked summary here which is vaguely similar to this save that it is targeted towards a wider array of complaints about nullsec and focused satisfying csmccps farms and fields approach to nullsec i dont suppose it could get some csm loveill just go back to my thread fortress of solitude
thoughtsforum revamp topics 61 and 62 can be removed becouse the new forums will be deployed soon a new topic about the state of the new forums shoud be voted up from the assembly hall will not get votes anyways exept in the negative will delute votesdo you want the prioritization to reflect current state of game or prioritorization after the winter expansionbbf stated items being worked onsoundwave has not responded to fw or gallente balancing can you ask him to post on those issues before voting starts so they do not become black hole issues for votes though they should be clear messaging about what prioritization means your vote will show what you want ccp to worked on etc not i likedislike this feature will be used in this manner for meta purposes anyway but for the average player the messaging could be clearerhow many items can be voted to the bottom of the pile none of the messaging has covered this topicgreat work on the wikiwhen will the messaging game wide start for this project only forum and wiki warriers know about it so farmore after we get more feed back in this threadare there going to be any of the current topics in the assembly hall voted on and added to the list
i went through most of the points and offer some constructive criticismduplicate issues 7 9 and 43 19 and 20 40 and 116 57 and 59 70 and 150 108 and 109 168 and 169issues already at least in a large part implemented 32 37 49 made irrelevant by agent changes 143 1805 and 42 could potentially be merged28 seems to be a very specific suggestion of a new game mechanic this contrasts with most of the other items and with the idea that the csm should help ccp in highlevel decisions not play backseat game designers36 i think covers many relatively unrelated items could be split into several points45 already covers all of 44 and most of 4647 is a bug report not a prioritization issue62 i think is no longer relevantthe implemention of 92 is according to the csm minutes very unlikely in the near future id suggest removing it from the list136 is no longer relevant with the agent changes a while back you can always access some l1 agents179 is an incredible omgwalloftextthanks for this initiative
the inprocess list shows all the active afaik formallypassed csm items so if you wanted to prioritize the art department you need to raise an issue here in ah and get it taken up by the csm it would then appear in a future prioritizationsee above if it wasnt voted on by the csm it wont appear in the prioritizationgood point i will flag them for removal from the final listcurrent afaik gallente rebalancing is something tallest will be addressing after he finishes destroying supercapitals fw is a much longerterm issue i would not expect any love in the winter expansionnotednot quite sure what you mean by thismanifest has promised massive pimpage shortly after the prioritization startsnope no time

fix the ing piece of  mac client
is avatar recustomization on the list whenever i jumpclone my avatar resets to my original settings the original look of the character i created when i first joined the game it is rather annoying  the look of my avatar should be fixed to my last change
char transfer are already available with plexes and potraits are currently free without total recrustomizationi saw it on the new account page so its donethis is too old and need to be reviewed  pi changed lots of things about this for example90 of it is already livetheres lots of issue about complexity of issues also a way to separate little things and big changes would be nice
are shortcut keys on the list the asdqwe keys should apply to any selected item in any window if applicable  not just the overview
is not clear how the against voting will work i am assuming that we can put only 20 topics in a valid voting post and that we can vote against vote to be worked on last by either puting a minus in front of one of the number or are we using a seperate line or grouping feature to indicate that choiceedit number fu
noted as superseded and will be removedmarked as resolved will be removedwill be moved to the needsreview sectioni have a way of combining items into categories that i can do after the main results are inmy current plan is that you can put a  in front of an item number to vote against itsosalpun1234567means votes for 1234 and votes against 567 as with the last prioritization you will have 20 points to allocate voting for less than 20 items increases their weight in this case to 207 voting for more decreases their weight with a max weight of 3 points per item you can spend your points voting for or against but each vote  for or against  costs you pointsill write up a clearer explanation of the process in a day or so but it will be very similar to last time my focus is on making it as simple as possible to vote
thanks for the confirmation on the format
theres a issue here voting against something at first cant workpeople need to know first what are the issues that people voted foryou cant vote against something where there is 180 possibilities cause you dont know what will appear and if some that will appear look really bad for yousay for example that i dont want ccp to work on mining 64 cause i consider theres way too much others things to doi have the choice of wote for something else or vote against miningbut given i dont know if people will vote for mining i dont have much interest to vote against itmoreover i dont know if what i want will be voted a lot so its more sure to vote for itvoting against something is only interesting if you already know what the results of the vote will beso i would suggest you to make 2 votes at different times  1st round  everyone vote for his things2nd round  people after looking at the current ranking vote against things or agaisnt  for thingstheres still issues here but seems better
since you have to make at least 7 votes then you can vote both for what you want and for what you specifically dont want if you want them to work on faction warfare then vote for it if you think mining reform as proposed is the dumbest idea youve ever seen then commit one of your votes to thatthe outcome of the poll will be the aggregate of the votes that players cast to continue the example above if faction warfare reform is highly popular it will have a large number of positive votes if mining reform is highly unpopular it will receive negative votes probably expressed by negative numbers if players dont care about a topic it will receive few votes ccpcsm can use each proposals scorevote tally to assign it a level of priority among the developers
the issue with off line poses is a big one for me i would really hate to see this bumped off until they do the complete pos revamp all i ask for is that when a pos goes off line or is anchored without being onlined it should have no shields i am not talking about the bubble but the shield hity points are still there when the bubble goes down how could it still have shields if it has no power a simple fix i know many high sec pirates and small corps will actively seek out off line towers to pop if they had no shields making them 500 easier to kill
what im trying to say is that on this configuration you have no reasons to lose vote by voting against something its always better to vote for something elseoh man do what you want but i would be surprised if there much people using the against option here
32 seems to already be in the game it would be nice if the contract notifications would automatically dismiss after you look at them though ive forgotten a few times and gotten excited only to find that i failed to dismiss an old notification37 couldve sworn ccp rewrote courier contracts along with the rest of the contracts but this has some interesting suggestions that i dont think are in the game143 pretty sure we already can do that180 if this has already been implemented they did a bad job of making it visible because i cant find it with the whole wis and the giant screens we now have i would hope this will be a future use of the useless main screenthe suggestion in the may meeting minutes that moon goo was being reworked led me to cross my fingers harder that poss would also be reworked im assuming this wall of text can be better summed up by simply linking to the farms  fields discussion here and im under the impression ccp already has this under the works for winter 2011 anyway
cosmos is obsolete and left behind content that was developed in a time when eve didnt have dynamic agents nor epic mission arcsthis content could be revamped and integrated into the new systems that are now in place to support pvemissions either making cosmos agents dynamic or rewriting the missions themselves as epic storyline missions or bothit feels like an elegant move since this would merge all mission pve content under a common system instead of having separate things that were developed with different mindsetsits not a major thing but this should be low hanging fruit an easy to do furthermore perhaps revamping cosmos content is easier to do than adding new stuff thus a quick win
supported cosmos is one of the original examples of a feature left to rot in favour of new shiny thingsccp seem to have a mindset that addressing old features is somehow a backward step but mmos a lot more successful than eve have revamped old content to great acclaim
yes but you are daftly avoiding the fact that it is an in game advantage for aur which is categorically wrong and disavowed by ccp no less after rioting in jita your attempts at switching your argument that this will provide a solution to the lack of rd slots in highsec are a nice diversionary red herring but a valid problem that deserves a different thread and a different solution
for the record theres nothing wrong with ingame advantage for aurum per se and thats not what the protests were all about the upheaval was over paytowin items in other words items that give you an imgame advantage you could not otherwise obtain the socalled golden ammo yet it seems now every time someone mentions aurum  advantage in the same senstence people immediately go ballistic with the antiaurum sentiment going on now i doubt people can really hear the difference thoughwhat elina proposes does give a player an ingame advantage but not more so than buying a plex does a simpler proposal along the lines of rd time for isk would probably have been better and not have triggered the aurum hysteria
its still buying convenience all this proposal is is a circumvention of the risks involved in putting up a pos
if it has been beaten to death then it is obviously an issue that needs to be rectified and has as of yet not been
the issue is that you havent read the other threads and havent realized that its not a problem at all
no the issue has been brought up repeatedly by one or two random alt rejects in which the community turned up in mass and had been beaten it like a baby sealthusit has been beaten to death
after reading the interviews regarding this idea suggested by ccp i felt that it was a bad idea to even think about removing abc ores from wh space read about the 00 and wh comparisons herethe same can be said about the ice beltsthe only way i will support these changes that appear to favor the 00 alliances is if ccp implements at least one of the following changes in addition to their own1 removal of local from 00 space2 restricting technetium moons to wh space3 restricting mercoxit to wh spaceor4 restricting the 00 jump bridges to one per constellation instead one per system or remove them completelyif ccp is not willing to implement the above changes in addition to the idea of removing abc ores from wh space and limiting ice belts to 00 then this is just a clear indication that ccp will be padding the 00 alliance coffers while giving freelance industrialists the ty end of the stick
this seems to be a well thought out suggestion and not at all the petulant footstomping of a butthurt child ccp should hire you and put you on their balancing team immediately
yes

yeah

i dunno selling sp in as microtransactions doesnt feel that right but at the same time the op have a point the skill waitfest completely annihilates new players i joined eve a few months ago and to be honest i feel so freaking useless this is the second time when i sit down and ask my self if waiting all this time for a little fun in the end is worth my timeif you ask me they should give the players more control on the character progress let us get x ammount of sp by doing this mission or achieving this goalinstead of money lp and bonus money give us some sp as a bonus for doing a mission or poping up an entire complex or killing someone in pvp
just think about what happened to the learning skillsin truth everyone knew they are totally evil and unnecessary and it will bring only good to the game if they are removed but the problem was never solved until someone found the solution of compensating free sp to the vetsthe truth here is that it is not really a compensation because vets didnt actually lose anythingit is just extra free stuff for everyone then the long term plan choice and patience arguments disappeared or ignored by the major without a conclusion in debatethe problem is never about right or wrong it is about human nature and balance of vested interesti also think it is a terrible gamedesign that players cannot do anything to enhance the character growth it annihilates the motivation and joy to play the game especially for noobs but i really think op should give a more feasible way to implement it rather than just arguing about right or wrong many are opposite to fix the problem not really because sth about correctness or necessity but because they think this will somehow do harm to their interestno matter whether the thought itself is true or right the fact that vets think so is the problemthe problems were never solved by the right solution they were solved by the solution that please majoritybtw i really think the solution i posted here is the most feasible one up to now no more rules broken than character bazaar and well replaced it nothing created from thin air legal access to buy sp newbies get rewardedstimed for hardwork and everyone more or less can benefit
no
when people start playing they wont put 500 to have more sp or to buy a character using the character bazar do you really think people dumb enough to spend so much money in a game they dont know new players will just start the game like you did they will run the tutorial mine run mission make some money train some skills buy a cruiser run mission buy a battlecruiser then a very cool battleship and then after few weeks they will ask themself what do they want to do in eve then they will choose a path pvp pve mining industry trade  putting 30 in it to do a good start wont affect the game in anyway as soon as 30 dont provide too much sp would you feel affected if they had started the game 2months earlier 
this is by far the worst idea ive readthe argument that this will bring more ppl to the game to fastly enjoy it is crap when you had pay for a large part of sp you will just sit down in your supercap waiting to something happens you will not get happy by having 2 hours waiting before get in t2 cruiseretc the most important thing is that new players with mass of sp will just do nothing worth they have to wait for someone experienced to make something and guess what  they will cry to have a xp market where they can purchase real knowledge when this will ofc not happen they will ragequit and tell other ppl this is a crap game with stealer in place of devs or wait  xdhumpink you take the fact that you are an old player as an argument it will be no more an argument if you sell sp so your best argument is crap my last 2cents is that new players have a tons of other things to get in mind before been in a t1 tackler frig use the ui the basic game mechanic market industry fleet etc in fact this kind of hierarchy between young and old players does give a role at moslty of them seriously when you have 20 players with 3 months game experience and they all fly a nyx which one will accept to be in a tackler to get any target  so you just broke the game this role will be just blown up and this will be a drama to find someone to full fit that role when a newbie will be very happy to follow old players in a supercap fight to see it if you give value to a role with real money you give it less value with gameplay and experienceccp will never allow that kind of sales cause this is a sandbox game this is the base of this game break that will simply result to break the gamethe nearest way i see to this in relation with background sandbox etc is to sale this with game money lets say for the example 10b isk to have cruiser at v but to have this amount of money you need to be a old player skill for plex ship to do plex wh etc or a good trader no need to have cruiser at v in this case imoto concludegiving opportunity to buy sp will favor rich irl ppl so a fact without any relationship with this game in that way the current system does favor ppl who play the game and more long you play it more favored you are by this system the consequence is in the same logic than the cause to compare do you imagine one second if you earn xp in wow when logged off when others have to farm like chinese to have the same as you dso 2 ways to have the spxp in a game is crap you want a way to get faster xpsp in eve with improving gameplay and asidesgive some appropriate sp when getting some kill in pvp the rest of the game need to be fixed to work properly so its a dream or a nightmare 
first how can you think that everybody will buy a nyx and such sp  how can you think that people will spend a thousand dollars secondly you should open your eyes and be aware that its allready possible how it is affecting your fun i dont know anyone who enjoy wasting their money if they use some  to have a quick training its not to do dumb things people who want a slight boost allready do it by buying plex and for the richer characterif there are bad sides its definitly not the one you are pointing look at all other f2p the average amount of  spent and apply it to eve all new players wont spent their month income in the gameirl or ingame rich people can allready buy everything they want
exactly why this is terrible idea the whiners here for instant gratification are chinese wow xp farmers and they are peeved that they cant make characters to sell quickly in eve that is because the brilliant sp system that works as intended which is everyone trains at the same speed mostly so gamers that play 24 hours do not get any advantage over people who dont have the time nor inclination to play all day and thank god for that as a trader i dont log in more than a couple times a week so this may be a problem if the skill tree was as shallow as other mmos but the skill tree is so deep in eve that even people who have been playing training for years have not hit the max skill cap nor can they be unbeatable in game termsthis is necessary in eve because you have so many people who do professions that do not require you to be online all then time but instead just make smarter use of their time online like trading or industry  a system that does not reward you xp for time grinding online but instead for choices in training path that you make and whether you choose to train deep and be a specialist or breath and be a generalist
see op you can never win an argument against guys like this no matter whether you are correct or not they can just keep pulling you down to their level by crapping like thiscuz they are players with such successful professions as to just login the game serval times a week but fighting on forum everyday to defend some advantages in the video game as while as fantasizing their superiority to chinese
yes plz
i regularly switch out my turrets based on an engagement so id like to see this1 for easy quality of life improvements
yes bring the good sound back also the new mining laser effect is pretty lame i like the crossing back and forth of the 2 beams but its so thin and pathetic lookingbring back the big fat rock melting goodness were used to

instant gratification allready exists with the character bazar and plex you can buy whatever you want in eve with real cash  ships faction stuff character  the main discutable argument against sp selling is that using the character bazar you dont create sp sp has been trained with this solution this argument vanishedto balance this storing sp in a pill should also have a cost in aurum or isk whatever i am totally convinced that sp selling or sp transfer is a good thing for eve
i dont think we are playing the same gamepeople should just stick with the rifter until they have clue or go play wow i wish i felt like joking heresp doesnt make you good in this game thus any sp trade threads are 99 trolling 1 of not having a clue so any people making up this crap should be deducted 1 mil sp
dont mean to argue i just feel that as a player who thinks that sp means nothing and doesnt make you good maybe you are trying too hard to defend your advantage on itnot only you of course interestingly
doesnt create sp out of thin air allows those of us who like our characters to develop them instead of the detachment the character bazaar promotes sounds good to meid prefer the simplicity of assuming a worst case conversion rate but then having sp convert into a generic pool that can be applied to any skill
this has come up many times there was even supposed to be something done about it some time ago the biggest problem as i understand it is that an off line pos is as hard to kill as an on line pos off line poses should have no shields they have no fuel no power how can they still have full shields the bubble disapears but they still have the full hitpoints from the shields
i think after three to six months of being inactive they should forget who owned them and allow anyone to unanchor them
a tower has say25000000 shield hp 1000000 armor and 1000000 structure an off line pos looses the force field bubble but still has full shield hit points this makes no sense to me as if it is off line with no fuel there is no power there should be no shield if an off line pos lost its shield they would be much easier to pop if you only needed to do 2 mil damage instead of 2627 mil you would no longer need to spend 46 hours with a decent bs fleet to clear a dead pos in high sec with the current system an off line pos is as hard to kill as a online pos so since you need to war dec it anyway to keep concord off you why not go after an online pos better chance for loot same effort mild chance someone will show up to defend it many high sec corps will pull down a pos if war deced so if all you want is the spot the easiest way is to go after a online pos i say again this makes no sense make off line towers easy to kill simply by making the shields go offline when the pos does
this gets my vote surely its the best way to deal with old pos
how about having it go up for auction of some type or let the person who wants it file a claim on the pos and pay a fee of some kind on the size of it and take it over free and clear
ok so you acknowledge the existence of dotlan and similar sites yet refuse to use them because you want to go and catalogue all this stuff yourself sure its how you want to play the game it will certainly soak up a lot of your time but probing every moon in eve yourself to create your own database when one already exists not a reason for anything except wrists imo but hey if you get enjoyment out of it thats fine but i dont see why ccp should pull code monkeys away from rebalancing supercaps or railguns or designing more items to flog to carebears and wow refugees to pander to one players playstyleyou are saying wormhole sig ids should be the same but wormholes are transient things so they move within 235hrs of any downtime guaranteed meaning all your effort in scanning them down is flushed down the toilet within 24hrs and wherever that wormhole now exits to it will have a new sig id anyway maybe you need to learn to deal with thisso seriously what would be the point the only time this is of any use is between downtime and when the wormhole naturally expires and the only person it would be useful for is you for signatures like gravs you will have bookmarks these sigs will last several daysweeks in a wormhole but expire within 24hrs in kspace so what if they change id keep the bookmark treasure it collect them all if you feel the need you make a point about onboard tools vs offboard tools which i take to mean web apps accessible via the igb ok a fair point but the game already allows you to bookmark a sig once youve got it to 100 after downtime you can drop probes over the bm pin in the solar system map and choose ignore signature for the sig which turns up at that location voila you have organised your sigs with an onboard tool called the ignore button again this has nothing to do with the sig ids and everything to do with player knowhow ingenuity and laziness
is it really just one players style i see potential to have a benefit to all eveplayers by improving the handling of the game and the ingame information is some board computer the right way maybe itUFFFDs one of thousend ideas swirling around in this forum the question is are there ways to give something like that the potential for having a benefit to all iUFFFDm not aware of how many coders are planed for high low sec and nullsec stuff i bet nor do you except you have some insider information but even if you would  this would not lay on us to discuss that there is no problem in dealing with it with already listed possibilities you gave the factor timeimagine you scan a system and in there are 8 signatures 3 wh 5 other for examplelets say iUFFFDm actually interessted in gravs chance of 12 of 8 scanned out my first sig at 70 or 80 or what ever itUFFFDs no grav now i have to scan it to 100 to add a bookmark just to know next time i scan this system  that is not what i want downtime ship change client crash just get some stuff from neighbour system  what elsedunno of these all resets scan results 8 sigs  12 scans  bookmark  eventually manage bokkmark  losing timelosing time  well i think you know that yourselfa question of lazyness or of effectivenessit started with a pro for static names of any signature as long as it lasts already wiesma pointed on that in his entry post i just throw in a ball for a system that imho would have the capability to improve multiple aspects of the game  for everyone has to be worked out sureright now iUFFFDm flooded with serval ideas how this could improve many aspects of evejust one of them scan out system moonsnot limited to download the results on a datachip copy that datachip in a playerpos with copy center sell those datachips via contract on the market buyer imports those results generating a datamap of a constallation sells thoseby this i wouldnUFFFDt have to scan out every moon in eve but that would be sound of the future iUFFFDm honest i wasnUFFFDt in a wormhole or nullsec already but i take all bets  gimme a bit time and more knowlege in there and there would be many ideas  based on such modification  for this part of the game as well
i realize adding a logo is not a big change to make to the skin but with the way it is currently set up every ship using a particular skin is exactly the same there is no allotment in the current code for a logo block that would allow a logo change dependent on the pilot or any allotment to use different skins for the same ship on any of the current ship skinsalthough this should be possible and would be the best solution for server load it is a huge amount of work after changing the skin to add the logo it would have to be saved as a new skinwith a new name other wise every ship in game that uses that skin would display that logo so every corp wanting a logo would have to basically have there own skin for every ship they want there logo on hundreds of skins for every ship in game that would be a huge server load the reason i believe it works like this is from the dev blog discussing the new ship color skins to be available soon through the nex for it to work they basically need to have it set up as a new ship with a new skin you pay aurum plus the basic ship and receive the new ship with a new skin on it these will not be custom skins but just several different paint job options i would love to see an option to allow for every player to customize the skin for there individual taste but i believe this would involve a complete revamp of the current ship rendering system and would probably greatly increase lag in fleet battles as the custom skin of every ship on grid would have to be sent to every client that has a ship on grid the more info passing between the server and the clients the more lag will be produced
would they have to reskin every ship could the logo not be pasted on like a turret is added to a ship the reskin would simply have to set a place for this logo to apear turrets already use color matching so a logo should fit on any color ship easy to oull the logo from the corp window and set it as a low draw priority
if it was that easy why have they not already done itoh yeah it is cpp
well that simplified but the time to do the work is now when they are reskinning the models reskin them with this sort of thing in mind this avoids being unable to do it lator or having to rereskin them
edit delete this post meant to reply to a post ccp your forums suck
there are too many issues to mention but things like having 1 minute left on gcc then it resetting to 15 mins again when a sentry shoots you docking timers should be set for all agression and gccgetting agression when you attack a flashy and theres morethese issues has a massive affect on gameplay please fix it
i agreeccp stop nerfing things you ssc are overpowered since when since the nc lost its spacemoongoo is overpowerd since when since nc lost its spacegive back websbring back nanogive us back cruise misslessnping for the win untill ccp nerfed itbut yeah go with the masses ccp listen tp the damm n00bs that dont know how to play the game and want eve as a second wow
stupid ideananoships are still present and viable just not godmode have you been living under a stone for the past two yearscruise missiles were never good buff themsniping is fine
you sir are the biggest dumbass in the game go back to your ice field blob ahum pvp ahum
fine by me as long as you can drop your fw and decorations as well ps im being sarcastic to those of you who are smart alecs
perhaps i did not explained the functionality correctly as this would be manual operation inside the listing where alts could be grouped to the member it has nothing to do with api or account amount or anything this is that you could compress the member listing by grouping persons alt characters to next column or nicely underneath the member in the list as marked x alt of xsorry if this caused some confusion in the first run to readers
the complete ignorance if someone who is supposed to represent the player base is astonishingreality checkwormholes are much more dangerous then most 0sec the massive blue blobs are probebly the safest places in the eve universe why dont we remove abc there oh wait because mittani lives there abc is mostly mined by bots as said a 100 times the amount of abc actually going out of a wormhole to empire space is minor 2 of the players live in wormholes and most dont do anything with the gravs as far as ive heard so the amount of minerals comming from there is barely worth mentioningit should be removed from class 14 maybe not 5 and 6 same mistake as saying 0sec is more dangerous then wormhole space the shallow wormhole classes see a lot more traffic then class 5 and 6 youre confusing with what should be dangerous with what actually is dangerous granted comparing class 5 to blue nullsec is like comparing sivala to amamake yes class 5 is dangerous but not nearly as bad as the shallow classesyou can mine abc 2 jumps from jita and yes mercoxit as well sometimes well you could in theory fact is all lower classes are occupied especially everything with a static highsec go mine in the last piece of 0sec that isnt blue to you and then tell me its so much saferalso the amount of jumps from a tradehub or main mission hub kind of dictates how much traffic you get bring a hulk in a c2 close to jita and youre 99 dead the chance of being shot by residents is about 50 the other 50 from empire people who come there the same way as you do its just 2 from jitaim sorry but this entire argument is invalid badly supported and brought by people who have no clue what they are talking about as far as i can see they are only trying to secure more income for themselves even though in this case it wouldnt make any difference
rofl i remember how the csm boasted about how knowledgeable they were about game mechanics etcand now they prove they know jack 
the traffic in the low end worm holes like c1s and c2s if far heavier than c5 and c6 due to the fact the vast amount of entrances from high sechigher traffic  higher riskreally getting tired of nerf everything i am not involved in now cryingtrolling removed zymurgist
all i hear is zero point zeroforce all the underskilled and poor out into the low and null sec space to be fodder for the players who have superior skills and a blob to back them upforce all the underskilled and poor to mine crap low value ores reducing their options further in obtaining a pvp competitive shipdont fly what you cant afford to lose well if you take away all the resources and play from highsec how are people sposed to build up a bank to buy the pvp ship to take to lowsec if you can only afford the buy one pvp ship a month because the rest of your time is spent marketmining to get the isk to buy the hull and mods to fly to null then by focusing on 00 constantly and nerfing highsec your chewing off the arm that feeds the pvp machineif anything highsec should become more lucrutive so noobs can generate more isk so they can actually afford to lose a few hulls to lownullsec roamslosing ships in eve should have impact you should feel bad about losing your ship but you shouldnt have to spend so much time earning isk in gamewhy should someone spend half their months play time mining or grinding missions for 20 seconds of pvp losebuff highsec ores or do something to make new players and even 1yo players earn more isk quicker so they can get out to where the real game is 00
my advice is dont run out to 00 without finding a blob to fly with firstsuperior skills do not make up for playing the game badly its deadly when you run into someone who both plays well and has the sp to back it up but often youll run into someone who has one or the other or neither even the most fun you can laugh about it laterif i have money problems i keep a missionready jump clone in high sec nothing wrong with a little grind for some isk occasionally i usually fly drake so thats a few hours worth of work yeah it could get blown up in 5 minutes and i could also log off and not play this game id rather play it i accept the possible outcomeseve is all about risk vs reward tbh unless youve got multiple people with you you wont be making decent money in 00 unless you have a great true sec system like 05 and lower wh is another risk vs reward scenario that can pay out big time and will require finding people to fly with too
people beat that drum because other than peer pressure no one has a terribly good reason to go to null sec i make more isk in empire with less risk the only thing empire cannot provide me is a steady stream of pvp pirating in low sec is 10 parts hunting and 1 part ganking a noob which is not very satisfying to me which can be obtained whether you live in null or not the much vaunted part of something bigger has a bitter taste in my mouth after repeated changes ccp has made over the years benefiting old alliances to the detriment of newer alliances
could someone explain why wets are so anoyed with highsec carebearsis it so gratifying to kill newbs so you cant wait for us to come to lowsec or 00for me it sounds like ufc champions who only wants to go against untrained foes ehh cause you know we atm dont stand a chance for a new player low sec is just gankland you will run in to gankgangs in their t2 or better fitts and whatever you bring as a new player you dont stand a chanceso that means that if you want some quality game time as a casual player highsec it is cause otherwise you will spend 34 hours looking at your pod and that to me is what wets is trying to sell to new players as the real eve p
i think ccp did a good job of encouraging us to vote last roundccp could create electorates so that  of players are representedno reason why ccp couldnt directly contact players to be representatives based on a few algorithms
to answer your first point nothing or at least nothing to the disadvantage of other sectors of the game what im really going on about is what i perceive to be a move by certain parties in the csm to give 00 an unfair advantage over the rest of us and trying to get some kind of mechanism together to ensure that the likes of goonswarm do not dominate csm and skew the game for their benefit hisec is notoriously hard to get a consensus in in part i think because of all the new players but also because it has people like me who want to go their own way in small corps run by themselves and not as a part of a mega alliance dancing to the tune of the senior members remember bobon your second point my alts have never made more that isk 300 million between them the two senior ones do have over 50 million sp between them though thats why i play to develop my characters to find out how to do different things and to explore how far i can go with the skills i have i lose ships and other stuff especially drones and let me tell you a t2 heavy drone costs a fair bit to replace so its not all risk free but that is my point i play to relax not be the next napoleon or bill gates eve for all its virtues is after all only a gamewhat seems to be getting lost in all this is my main reason for starting this thread to try and see if we can organise some sort of action to stop anyone biassing the game in their favour i would welcome anyone interested in setting up such a mechanism to contact me ingame and ill try and set something up
franz i personally am not annoyed with highsec carebears nor do i have an interest in ganking noobs or getting them into nullsec  its the old players living in highsecthere seems to be a problem from a game designperspective ccp had a natural pr
oooooh aaaaahits becoming obvious that i am not making myself clear i dont want to stop anyone doing whatever they like in eve what does concern me is the apparent attempts to skew things to favour those sections of the playerbase that are in 00iv
there were a number of candidates that ran for the last election that would have tried to create a more balanced focus in the csm sadly none of us that would have provided a high sec point of view were elected until the general eve population takes an active interest in the csm elections you can expect the csm to be just the large powerblocks that can get their minions to votei hope some day the majority of eve players casual pve types often derided as care bears will realize the csm is a real force in the future of eve and they will actually get someone that would share their views of how eve should evolve elected preferable someone that wouldnt get removed for nda breaches and that doesnt throw sporks when angered isslertwo time csm membervoice of reason candidate
ive played in hisec and in 00 why would i want to stay in 00 making it easier for people like mittani or vuk lau to cash in on rmts is not my idea of higher level contentjust sayin
for some people iskpoints why should you be caring what they do or do not spend them on maybe they just like the idea of racking them up
let me see if ive got this straight your arguing that hisec and nullsec are actually balanced against one another and as evidence you cite that most nullsec players have alts in hisec to do the stuff there that they cant in 00well damn son why dont more hisec players have alts in nullsec thenquit dancing around the bush and just come right out and say it here ill do it for you themittani is a big meanyhead who wants to ruin the game for everybody because thats all goons ever want to dohai guise theres a problem here and i demand that it be fixed good luck coming up with a solution for me ill be over there
well thanks for making me post again but as you seem to have nothing constructive to say id better try and explain againim not saying that 00 and hisec are in competition with each other just that there appears to be an attempt to skew the game in favour of 00 this affects whs as well i cant saynever having been through a wormhole yet but reading posts from whs residents it seems as if things are tough enough there already without taking away the resources that are available to them abc ore for examplethe reason i said that i would not post on this thread again is that i want time to go and do something about a situation that seem to me to be in danger of upsetting the balance of the game if you take the time to read my posts you will see that i have no intention of going to 00 a good reason not to have an alt there do you thinkyou dont know me so stop trying to put words in my mouth you might think thats what i mean i couldnt possibly comment now if there is nothing else ill get back to try setting up some kind of organisation to see if we can get some hisec representatives onto the next csmthank you
i have 11 characters1  in null sec3  in low sec7  in high secnull sec players are almost forced to have multiple accounts with piles of characters in high sec this throws off these statistics dramatically though im about 23 high sec i would have no problem with ccp nerfing high sec into dust
the csm like any elected body is there to represent all the players of eve online not just the people who voted for themif polititions acted in the same way only looking after a small minority of the people in their electorate they would not get in in the next round of votesthe player run alliances and member corps would naturally have an advantage in any voting system they are already organised and a policy of voting for alliance candidate x would be appliedfor highsec there is no organisation there are no highsec alliances or large corps based in highsec so there is no organisation there is no body of people to policy a candidate to the csmif 70 of the player base is in highsec then 70 of the effort and actions should be directed towards this area of the gameit is not sufficient for an elected body to claim that because the majority of their votes were from their alliance that they should be representing the interests of that alliance aloneit is the responsibilty of the csm to represent all players of eve else the csm is just a complete waste of time for all but 20 of the player baseeve needs more small and solo pvp where someone without 5 years of skills can actually be effective in some wayhmmmmm makes me annoyed and wondering why i subd for a year if the only improvments are going to null ccp and the csm should be sponsoring the love around for all the players
im currently in 00 but typically spend most of my time in hisec from what ive seen there are more game features available to those in nulsec than hisec moon miningcap shipssovofficer rats etc as a consequence it could be argued that those in nulsec have more fun  which is the reason for playing the game in the first placeeve is supposed to be a sandbox where players can do what they wish that suits their play style it isnt correct to say that everyone is supposed to progress from hisec to lowsec to 00 many people just dont like the lowsec playstyle which seems to be largely based around forming or surviving gatecampsi believe there shoud be more varied content in hisec to keep the game interesting for the vast majority of players who may have no wish to move lowsec or nulsec as is their choicei play eve to have fun not specifically to make isk im not sure that either hisecnulsec incomes need to be boostednerfed basing arguments for that on gross carriacatures of rich players is a falacy cap ship plexer in nulsec vs faction fitted golem pilot in hisec both are a tiny minority of players and not representative of either constituency
do players really want avatars and in the current form they are quite pointless the cq is a nice touchyfeely thing but it adds absolutely nothing to the game i was expecting a lot morei know this all hooks in with the booster changes and the dust 514 game but id really appreciate some more polish on the parts already in evethe players want shipmod balancing they are screaming for it why the hell does it take two years for shipsmods to be balanced if there were a real faction war thed also be a war of technologies existing ships would be refitted and updated to be competitiveedityes i agree ccp should not exclude people who have probably played for many years from using older computers just for the sake of being able to walk around a small room and sit in a sofa even when the full stations become available the settingslightingmeshmaterials can all be low quality and allow older computers to play seems like a very short sighted implementation is this a spaceship game or a station walking around avatars interacting game i play for the spaceships not a monicle

is there an audio clip of this that can be streameddownloaded
state of the goonion and csm fireside chat audio clip is in fact the same file cd
supportedhaving pos like stations is a good idea any corp that has a pos that is used by a large number will know of the problem of storage for each charthe hanger access system is limited and does leave the door open for rogue corp members to be able to steal shipshaving an actual station allows each char to securely store thier ships and items and make it easier for a corp to regulate access to the valuable corp items
absolutely support this and from what i have read a total pos overhaul is planned for the near future
to those who say they shouldnt use a covops cloak i add t3s you can get 104k ehp out of a proteus which can fit a cloak has lower sig than any black ops bs does 450dps and gets scram range bonus much greater scan res and agility all fitted for the same cost as a blops hull if you compare the black ops bss to this how could giving them a covert cloak create an outofcontrol solo pwnmobile people are running massed cloaky t3 gangs or t3 gangs with interdiction nullifiers as it is t3s have outclassed even a wet dream blops scenario of covops cloak cloakywarping battleships around i think the idea from 09 of splitting the class into two roles like command ships has merits one for porting the other for cloaky gangs
thanks for the comments i dont think we need a restriction on the numbers of ships it would be great to have 30 v 30 frigate fight in a minor if it does become an issue they can restrict it
why dont you put it to a vote then start a new thread stating clearly that it is just a vote thread and not a discussion one point back to this old one for debate then tally the votes for vs the number of against and reads i think we can assume that since only people who feel strongly for or against a proposal will comment on the thread we will count the read but not commented as ambivalent and therefore for the purposes of proving your silent support or lack thereof the ambivalents will be counted as not supported after a week lets tally the numbers and then we can see how much real support in these forums this proposal really has
i like the idea from the first post erf daredevils will become the new dramiel but a few points are forgottenrailguns definitively need a dps bonus at least for the pve side lvl3 in brutixesferoxes lvl4 in megarokhhyperion  just a pain in the ass the kronos and the vindicator are still usableone of the main problems in hybrid balancing is the mix blasterrailgun range blasters want a falloff bonus only a few of the gallente hulls have onerailguns have a big optimal which cant be really improved tracking computerenhancer its not that important because nobody really cares about having a 255km optimal anymore hi useless caldari gunboat bonusthe range bonusmalus for hybrid ammos is for the optimal only with the exception of void which makes this ammo good for caldari gunboat ahgood luck balancing this hell the javelin ammo not the rockets  is a disaster crappy dps no alpha huge cap cons and wtf is this range  caldari antim is far superior well its still railgunsmedium railguns have indeed a real problem with reloading and hybrid charges arent that small in the cargoand why the rokh has a lot more cap problems than amarr bs

tell all gallente pilots to come here and vote
yes a 2 support to read ratio isnt exactly helping the cause so either a gallente pilots dont read these forums b only 2 of new edens population are gallente pilots or c there isnt a problem big enough for them to support this only the stats on the demographics of the readers of this forum can reveal the truth178 supports for 7600 reads

pretty sure i have never posted this in ah if so i apologizesomething that has always bothered me with the mining system we have now is that it is too treehuggery mankinds methodology for extracting ore has always been nuke everything and sift through the rubble but eve has surgical lasers gentle enticing rocks to hand over their valuablesi propose we base it on one of the greatest games ever created asteroids not only does it make more sense but it will make militarized mining ops viable and mining in general more funbasic concept all rocks break apart when subjected to brute force once they are graveldust they can be collected any force dps will do strip miners are attributed 1k dps or there about graveldust clouds dissipate over time new module wide tractor field arrayexactly what it says on the tin not strong enough to move larger solid objects canswrecks covers a conical area in target direction wtfa are only usable on rorqualorca and t1t2 mining barges rorqualorca are given bonuses to the sizespeed of the field in place of or in addition to regular tractor bonusesextraoptional  new bomb gravitational shear bombdesigned to tear apart porous solid objects refined metal  ships  denser honours the ageold tradition of throwing explosives at a problemand there it is outline anyway protection details need never be bored to tears probably still bored though rorquals get a reason to join the belt parties and door is opened for hostiles to burn the fields
i think they should just allow the roqual to use a capital tractor beam to tractor entire roids directly into the hold then compressgind them into blocks small enough to refine
sure why not after all many dead space mission sights have abandoned or derelict stations in them if outposts and poses can only be anchored near planets and moons respectively how did those deep space stations get there even in the eve lore there is hidden deep space stations and stargates nobody knows about why not be able to anchor poses and even outposts in deep space for say a 20 power gridcpu penalty it would be awesome for large null sec alliances to be able to build an outpost in deep space that does not show up on overview because it is in deep space you could have to get a book mark from someone who knows where it is before you can warp to it it would fit well with the lore according to lore there are pirate jove and sansha deep space stations and stargates that are not on star chartsdont show on overview that you can only find by stumbling across them or getting coordinates from someone who knows where they are not even scanable currently these are only in game in mission dead space pockets why not allow players to build them as well at of course a significant penaltyincrease in cost over the standard planetmoon anchored ones calling the deep space ones t2 versions will make it easy to bring into game without breaking anything just start with t2 poses that can be anchored in deep spacebut not in belts or anomalies and see how it goes i really like the idea of player owned complexes with acceleration gates to access them t2 outposts could be added later if it works out well
great your toons will be more mature than you are bzzzt
i say if you realy want realism you shouldnt hold back but yeah let m fix other things firstsuch an effect dont need tobe server side considering its just an effect it can be perfectly client side and make use of the hardware most videocards have these daysi dont see how this has to produce lag other then stress your computer a bit more or why the whobble needs tobe sync on everyones screen or even enabledthe texture is mapped ontop of m i dont see much issues with bras there eitherbottomline i dont think its such a bad idea its more do we realy need itfor me cq is a waste of cpu power and i have it disabled boncing boobies however i have to see least once

i must confess that this is a good way of making eafs useful but wont affect scs in anyway because the support fleet will maul the eafs on sight increase the cost of scs to 40bil and your good
adds up to this
cost has already been proven to be a horrible way of balancing ships if a cost of 15 bill doesnt deter people from buying them as fast as csaas can  them out then what makes you think that doubling or tripling that cost will have any effectthe point of marlonas very interesting proposal is to ensure that supercaps need a support fleet a supercap fleet that attacks without support can quickly be crippled a supercap fleet that loses its support is in grave danger iow this stops superfleets being an iwin button that is unanswerable by anything other than more supercapsgiving the longneglected eas class an interesting and useful role is merely a bonus although a very welcome onealthough eas are horribly vulnerable its worth noting that all carriers and motherships have huge hangers and can easily bring along spares for the eas pilots to reshipadditionally eas are a fairly accessible class to new players so this proposal would give a genuinely meaningful role to newer players in fleet fightsedit btw you can easily tweak the relative utility of eas to stop the kitsune being too powerful by increasing the sensor strength of fighters and fbs
yeah its a good change for eafs but it doesnt really help with the supercap problem at all even ignoring a support fleet that will instantly nuke all eafs on the field the supercarriers can just whack them with warriors or if theyre really proving to be a problem and if theyre not being a problem then theyre pointless then the titans just dd them you might think that using a dd on a frigate is er excessive but if eafs are effective at neutralising supercaps then by definition it will be worth killing themthe fundamental problem with the eafassupercapcounter idea is that you dont solve supercapitals problem of a complete lack of vulnerability to subcaps by giving them a vulnerability to a single extremely fragile and relatively expensive subcapital and this applies to every single lets make this class of ships into supercap counters although at least its far more sensible than the insane blackops as supercap counters idea if you want supercaps to be vulnerable to subcapitals and make them require a support fleet then you need to make them vulnerable to all subcapitals that means removing their warp scramble immunity and limiting them to fbs only and making dds and remote ecm bursts work only on capitals but in that model there is still a place for making supercaps vulnerable to eafs ewar so the eaf changes would be a good idea in conjunction with other changes
as ive suggested before id be more than happy with eass simply directing affecting supercaps as their role bonus nevermind distributing the effect to drones  the ships themselves are the issue passing the effect on just creates more serverside processing and doesnt address the fact that titans are the main threat to subcapstired of a titan blowing up your subcaps tracking disrupt itdont want fifty plus supercarriers remote repping each other ecm themwant to hold down hostile supercaps until more support arrives points and webs from frigatesized ships are keyeas are fragile as hell and can be easily taken out by a competant supporting fleet just like dictors the key to balancing supercaps is to ensure that theyre at risk when theyre not accompanied by enough proper support and cant just be thrown around in a helicopter fashionhics were added as an exception to the ewarimmune rule back in the days of the aoe dd now its time for for a new exception
i dont like this idea much since it will hit a small capfleet very hard but large supercap fleets wont feel thesethink about it fights that have a handful of scs in them arent so much the problem instead they have the potential to be good fun and epic  its the growing number of f off supers that are in such a situation no destroyer or frigate could hold up to make a difference
um just because someone suggested a semi fix doesnt make it the defacto i win in the argument you really should stop assuming that silence is our collective acknowledgement of a point conceded in favour of your argument for instance having the new name start with the same letter is a pathetic plug in the leaky damn of logic in this proposal the point was that any change that would make it harder for someone to spot a name in a list wont be acceptable if you accept this premise then having a psuedoname starting with the same letter wont cut it i thought that pretty obvious so didnt feel the need to point out that the ball was still in your court to fix this hole

i dont think you understand the intended weapons focus of the racesas i understand it it is something like thisamarr primary laser  secondary missiledronesminmatar primary  projectiles  secondary missilesdronescaldari primary missiles  secondary hybridsdronesgallente primary drones  secondary hybridmissiles each race has most of there ships with bonuses to their primary weapon system and a couple with a bonus to a secondary weapon i think this is why hybrid weapons suck so bad they were not meant to be primary weapon for any race although there are some caldarigallente gun bouts meant to use them they are not that races specialty you can cross train weapons and use them on any ship with the right slots at the cost of losing the racial bonuses many players do this but if you have a preferred weapon type you will find it easiest to go with a race that specializes in that weapon and find that races best ship for that weapon for example if you like missiles caldari do have the best missile boats aside from faction ships like the dram only gallente frigates can use drones ect
nono no  its just a sb and a recon with a split weapon no hybrid weapons are the primary weapon of the gallente race drones are only the second but since hybrid guns have too many drawbacks gallente drone boats are more commonsaying that drones are the secondary weapon of caldari ships is just so wrong maybe youre talking about gurista ships  well why not saying lasers are the secondary weapon then because of the sanshas drone gallente fregs  ishkur ishkur ishkur ishkur ishkur imicus ishkur ishkur thats not a very good point and putting aside the dramielwormcomet lost methe arbitratorcurselegion are drone boats too its not only about gallenteim pretty sure you dont thanks for the input anyway but you missed my point  eve has two lineups that were forgotten years ago
ok scratch drones as i believe every ship above frigatedestroyer class can use drones but the only weapons a minmatar ship receives bonuses for are projectiles and a few ships have missile bonuses so the other two are right again fine scratch drones but show me a caldari ship with a weapon bonus other than missiles or hybrids yeah i guess you can scratch missiles i cant think of a gallente ship with a missile bonus other than the sb however gallente are absolutely meant to be the drone specialist race they are the only race that has t1 frigates that can use drones they have the best drone boats of any race the faction frigates that use drones such as the dramel require gallentine frigate skills to flywell pirate faction ships are cross race that is why they require skills from mutiple race backgrouds to fly i use the dramel as an example only because that is one of my favorite ships it is a t1 pirate faction frigate it requires minmatar and gallente skills to fly ability to use drones comes from the gallente technologythe dramel is not gallente but is a pirate faction frig that requires gallentine skills to fly all frigates with drone bays require gallentine skills because the gallentine race specializes in dronesi was talking about frigates not cruisers but i understand if that was over your head show me a frigate that can use drones that is not gallente or pirate faction requiring gallente skills that can use drones sorry dude hybrids are not a specialty weapon for any race they are shared between the caldari and gallente as a secondary weapon caldari primary focus is on missiles giving them the best missile boats gallentine primary focus is on drones giving them the best drone boats neither caldari or gallente has a hybrid platform that is meant to be a focused ship they just have average power gunboats no superior gun boat fits focused on hybrids you will see this is intended if you read up on the lore try doing some research rather than pulling facts out of your a
damnit youre totally missing my point the wrong part was in bold there is no problem saying that missiles are the minmatar secondary weaponboldyoure forgetting the 3 other rookie ships the heron the crucifier the magnate the tormentor the bantam the griffin the probe and the vigil yes i know it hurtsshow me a cruisersize drone boat which can get solo kills  vexorishtar  yes but they are certainly worst for this job than the arbitratorcursepilgrimstating the obvious did you read the part where i stated that in order to use pirate ships when you have khanidcaldapewpew skills you must crosstrain twice  nothing wrong with a crosstraining see the listgallente drone boats  ishkur vexor ishtar myrmi dominix sin thanatos nyxgallente hybrid boats  almost everything elsemy bottom is fine thanks you now about the subject 
lol
khanid apoc anyone 8 launchers with torpedo dmg armour resist  torpedo rof and cap recharge bonuses i know folks dont like the idea of that but i think it would be totaly ing awesome p
the dps of that thing would be a bit too much just add some range missile rigs and you got your minidread the raven has only 6 launchers and the rof bonus and its already one of the best bs to shoot at poses
i guess you missed my point as much as i missed yours im not saying there is no need for an update but if you read the lore gallente weapons development is drone focused drones are meant to be the gallente specialized weapon i always thought that they should split gallente and caldari focus one specialize in blasters and the other in rails but that doesnt follow the lore i agree that hybrid turrets do need some major love but i do not agree that gallente should be given a missile boat that can out perform the comparable caldari since caldari are according to lore supposed to be the missile specialiststhere is supposed to be a complete revamp of all ships for balance but only one or two at a time per update and with a focus on making less popular ships more appealingsorry for posting with the wrong toon last time alexia is meif you want to ask for a new gallente ship you need to keep it in line with the lore or it will never be considered
it always helps if you undock to go see yourself instead of sitting in station and watching holoreels its called getting field experience
very true but ccp developers will never do anything that goes against the lore so no point in even asking
click the ingame clockthe minutes state that the art team is tied up and no new art assets will be made anytime soon the suggestion clearly requires thosethanks for taking my input into considerationedit question what exactly does a negative vote mean is it i do not think this item should be a high priority or i do not think this item should be implemented at all as i think it would be bad for the game
my understanding is that each topic will be prioritized based on the number of positive or negative votes it receives high positive numbers mean we really want this numbers approaching zero mean we dont care about this one way or the other and high negative numbers mean we hate this dont even think about implementing itim not sure how else they could work it based on how theyve explained it so far
marked as resolved with a note that a new issue can be raised if it needs tweakingmarked as resolvedccp wants to redo poss but it is a big job and as always resources so not in 2011
pretty much this a  vote means i really want ccp to work on this no vote means meh who cares and a  vote means i really dont want ccp to work on thismy plan is to run the numbers in multiple ways both with and without negative votes
negative votes are best described as wait on working on that item till last votes while it can also mean i do not like this item the question is when do we work on this topic sooner or later not do we want ccp to work on this at all that was the purpose of the csm updown votewhile including a vote for a needs review item might be a like dislike vote for simplicity lets treat all votes as a work on this feature now later so everyone votes with the same state of mind based on the core question trebor can comment if i am right or not edit beat me
there is a huge mishmash of things here some of them are trivial bugs that should be routinely fixed through a bug report some are trivial things that should take 10 minutes to implement some of them are discussional mining with no definate objective some of them are posturing commit to excellence and encapsulate ethos not effort some of them are major reworks that would be a significant part of a 6 month expansion cycle tbh it would be better to break up biglonglist into categories based on the resource level needed to work them and have seperate votes in each group in particular break out the set of things that would take 50 or more of a release cycle to do into a separate list otherwise how the hell can you compare rework mining and drones are bugged sanely
fix or reroll the turret icons
you are on the right track but i would say that 1 is a little strange as you force people to do some quick math in their head everytime they change an order in order not to get rejected because it is under the limit which is badbetter would be to have a tick ladder of min isk changes in following rl they should represent a basis point which is 1100 of a percent floored by 001 isk ieprice range  tick size1999 001 isk10009999 01 isk1000099999 1 isk10000099999910 isk1mil99mil 100 isk100mil999mil 1000 isketci realize this isnt a complete solution the 001 botters will soon adjust so that they make the minimum increase required but at least that increase will be significant enough that the price will indeed move a bit more than 001 isk on large ordersnegative on the changing of order time to 30min though we do not want to penalize those who actually want to spend all day updating their orders
stupid idea for several billion reasonsthe entire concept is wrong if ccp cant eliminate all bots they should acceptcontrolmanage them yea that wouldnt work it could make it even harder to catch other still illegalbotstoo much potential for abuse allowing market bots would almost immediately crash the wholesaleretail spread profit margins would be a fraction of a percent but if you combined a hauler bot in there hmmmmmmthis bot is allowed but this other bot isnt i realize some ppl are going to use them anyway but once you legitimize a bot it will open a botting floodgate why would you even want this isnt the purpose of a game to be played sure you would have to configure the bot but can a few mins and let it run for daysweeks be called playing
im going to assume you didnt read the large part of this thread this bot you are referring to would be an in game order bumper perhaps only in certain hubs like jita this is not a 3rd party bot it will be in game lots of stuff happen in game already without player attention after setup rd manufacturing skill training and at the risk of repeating what i and others have already said in this thread an auto order bumping system isnt an iwin button in fact it will probably lose more than win as real humans will exploit bots like a bad chess aianyway this is not a we need this asap thread so please take your animosity and testosterone elsewhere if you have excess of either its a discussion thread we are looking for pros cons what potential changes it will make to the way the market works and if it would be a bad or good thing overall making markets in eve more like markets in real life that is
tried this in the ideas forum told to come here with it here it goesi would like to see cans of ships destroyed in empire to flag loot theives for aggression by the victim his corp and by the pilots involved in the death of the shipwhywell most of the time in empire pvp cans are not looted by the destroyers due to noob corp loot theives that have little to no chance of being caughtyes they do gain aggression from the victim and his corp but generally the cans are either looted during the fight by the noob corp looters or the possible defenders of the canthe victims are pods or corpses which have a hard time defending the cansi dont have a problem with loot theives everyone can choose how ever they want to make isk but currently the noob corp loot thieves have no danger in their professionsince this is a post coming from other threads please keep the thread on tract and keep the trolling off this one please

ok it goes like thisevils mcpirate is 10 sec status and camping a gate he has not shot anything yet so no gcc gate guns will not fire fluffer mcwhorrealt is not 10 and is sitting in a ship with rr they hear there is a tasty target about to jump through so fluffer starts rring evils mcpirate setting up a massive spider tank circlejerk rep chain before combat starts this makes evils mcpirate basically invincible to his intended target or to anyone who sees evil mcpirates is 10 and is therefore free to take a potshot at him with no gate gun response  in which case evils mcpirate is free to respond without gate gun aggro because hes not gcc he game mechanic as it stands is to prevent this type of behaviour of people lurking gates in lowsec in 10 characters supported by massive rr chainsimo sucks to be you if you are too lame to pirate without rr man up
as my father would sayyou made your bed now lie in it
how about you find a corp with a high sec pos and join them and use thatits simple
it isnt really the same isk is bought through plex which has a fundamental supply and demand basis which drives the price to equilibrium the last thing that ccp wants is for people to be buying aur to get game advantages no matter to what degree whybecause people who buy vanity items that have no game value are rich people who are buying plex with isk to get the aurum to buy these goods withpeople who would buy game enhancing items are more likely the hardcore gamers who are trying to maximize every single element of the game in order to give themselves an advantage these same people are the kind of people who would pay real usd to get the plex to change to isk or aur to improve their gameccp intends the nex to be used for the former not the latter the former drains isk from the system while the latter doesntin summary isk for plex was invented for the sole reason to allow people to be able to play the game for free therefore they needed to sell plex for isk but with that came the double edged sword that you can get isk for plex aint economics a bh i believe that ccp have been trying to mitigate this problem for a long time of course they cant just stop plex sales too many players depend on it to pay their subscription fees so how better to than to create an isk sink for those with too much isk in buying aur it has a side effect of allowing people to buy plex just to buy aur but as long as aur cannot be used for anything that poor people may want to use to improve their game its okay the instant this isnt true then aur sales will shoot up and you will have a flood of people buying plex with usd which is not what ccp wants nor is it what established players in the game want it would be terrible to have yet another way by which you can get better at the game by using rm
a bit of a long read but very well thought out 1
just thought of something about the above post why is there local chat in 00 or even low sec
the rplore reason is that its a service provided by concord who manage the gates themselves including the ones in null sec so it is freely available to all capsuleers who enter the system
ok i guess i should have done a little reading before i posted but thanks for the info i do think it would be nice though if it was removed

according to lore drones are supposed to be the weapons development focus of the gallante empire every other empire has implants to support their weapons focus it is only fair to have drone implants

i never thought learning skills were a bad idea but then i was never stupid enough to only train learning for my first couple months i maybe trained one learning skill to about four to six regular skills and later on i trained higher level learning skills during extended downtimes mine not eveslearning rewarded me with faster training of other skills long term thinking rewarded  good in a long term game like eve i was happy and people who didnt want to train learning skills much or even not at all got their short term benefit too  they got more nonlearning skills trained to begin with win win thinking long term or short term  it was all good and people who hadnt bothered with learning at first could always pick it up later it wasnt a big deal unless you had crippling ocd over potential lost spsbut then the whingers finally won eve was nerfed and now everyone gains sps at the same base rate joy at the lowest common denominator winning outbut that wasnt enough for them nor was being able to buy high level characters if they couldnt wait to get a cap ship blown up nope thus we get stupid threads like this one where the whingers moan that they cant compete with people who have been playing for years or even more stupidly they  about not being able to immediately do insert high level skill heresomehow they always manage to totally ignore the rich opportunities for players with low to midlevel skills nope  they just cant feel fulfilled unless theyre flying a capital in 00 weird i still dont fly a capital nor do i spend much time in 00 yet somehow i have heaps of fun in eve and find plenty of people to fly withutter rubbish if not blatant lie if im feeling uncharitable we had learning but you whinged and got that taken away and we still have implants and attribute remaps and skill plans but that requires long term thinking and planning so i guess thats out for the instant gratification crowdin short stop trying to get instant gratification and start playing eve you might actually enjoy it or if you cant then shock horror this might not be the right game for you wow what a concept instead of whinging and trying to turn eve into your version of short term fun and ruining it for others maybe you could realise eve is not for you and move on holy sht my mind is blown what an amazing idea instead of pUFFFDssing in everyone elses pool you act like an adult and go find something that does suit you in awe at this revolutionary conceptbut no thatll never happen youd have to actually exercise some personal responsibility

youre beginning to repeat yourself now toovhon which is not a testament to your sanity but the consistent juvenile irrational nature of the responses this thread is getting to say that your last paragraph sums it all up would be an exercise in repetition deal with it because what you are asking for changes what eve fundamentally is and ruins gameplay for most existing players for the benefit of a small fractioni think that you and most others as well have expended all logical statements and any further response is serving no other purpose than to bump this thread although the side effect of having said inane arguments being read over and over by newcomers to the thread does almost make it worth the bump i believe some of the last comments show that even the last semblance of logic has left the opposing side and the thread is in danger of being discounted as superfluous gibberish therefore with all arguments expended and all that needs saying been said there is nothing further to be done here but to take a voteop please post a vote thread and see how many supporters vs readers you can garner and let the numbers do the talkingedit or we can use just the numbers on this thread if you wish 16 supporter out of 6100 readers 02 support

i personally am adamantly opposed to buying skill points either with real life cash aurum or isk i would still consider myself a new player even my main is only a little over 20 mil skill points i dont get on a lot which fits very well with the design of eve i do not get punished for not playing 237 my character still keep training as long as i get on to add skills to the que when needed it is frustrating for some noobs to know that you can never really catch up to the veterans but really how can you expect to start playing a game play for 6 months and have everything that someone playing for 7 years has achieved it makes no sense yes this does happen in other games where once you reach max level you are on par with the vets except for maybe some elite raid gear you have not got your hands on yet but those games have a lot of trouble keeps subs up for more than a few years in eve character growth never stops there is no max level the more skill points you have the less advantage a veteran may have over you but even a 5 mil sp character can kill a 200 mil skill point vet with the right fit and circumstances eve is not about levels endgame content or any of that crap many other mmos focus on that being said it would be nice if players new and old alike that do have time to play should not be limited to the same character development as someone who only logs in once in a while to update skill ques it takes isk to truly develop a character and time playing to be able to put any of those trained skills to good use i would support having some sort of mission agent that you could run skill based missions for to get a skill point boost to that skills training for example extend the training missions for stuff like exploration but rather than an iskitem reward when the mission is complete you get a bonus of skill points added to that skill make agents for every basic support skill many level 5 skills take a month or more to train with this agent system logging in and running missions for the agent for that particular skill every day would say cut the training time in half for that skill this would fit with the lore as you are actually getting experience using that skill and benefiting from that experience by training that skill faster much like doing the missions for research agents doubles your daily accumulation of points but you would have to run missions for the skill agent that matches the skill you are actively training and receive a  bonus that would basically double the skill points earned for that skill for that day based on the rate of skill point accumulation you are getting at the time of mission completion everything currently in the game for skill point accumulation would be left unchanged but any character could double there skill point accumulation by running the skill agent missions this would even be great for veterans want to train to fly that titan your alliance is building run missions for a spaceship command agent every day and cut that several months training time in half if you have already trained for a titan well there has to be some really long training time skills you have not trained yet that would be worth training if you could do it in half the timeveterans would probably appreciate this more than new players as they are the ones training skills that take 23 months to complete just an idea but it would add the option to everyone of training skills faster by investing actually time playing the game into it  a skill grinding optionwithout changing any of the current mechanics no butt hurt for the vets as this requires investing time to reap the benefits time which could be spent and was spent by the vets doing other things it would still take 4 years for a noob to catch up to an 8 year vet and only if the vet did not do any skill training missions

can i become space pirate with parrot in wow
yarr we need pets peg legs and olts of other piratey stuffa space pirate wouldnt have a parrot theyd have some little alien blobby thing that farts and spits at people like the little shape shifter thing the space pirate in treasure planet had
most of you are forgetting that sp need not just be used to get piloting that new shiny t2 ship if that was the only problem it still would be a pretty bad idea but the more damaging one that i see is that sp is the fabric that holds all character progression in the game at a common playing field you have a lot of professions which are specialized like trading mining invention etc and the only thing that makes a character who does this as their livelihood feasible is the fact that they sacrificed a good amount of their training time to get good at pi or exploration or trading etc if you open up sp to anyone who wants to pay for it you basically ruin their livelihood and means of living by flooding the market with newbie wetnosed traders specialty miners manufacturers etc who didnt have to sacrifice anything to gain those specialized skills this is categorically badits essentially the same as saying you can earn a university degree in 4 years by paying tuition and doing the coursework or you can bribe the dean and get a degree in 1 day making that bad situation worse you will then flood the market with unqualified doctors and dentists who have no idea how to take a patients temperature or clean tartar
id point out the obvious flaws but simply by failing to see them in the first place youve demonstrated yourself to be beyond such things as basic common sense so i shant bother
sorry but  noi honor you made some serious thoughts there but still no
as ceo and cheif dunce of vogon demolitions a corporation made up of alts in afkgeddons and afkdomis we dont mind paying 2m to dec the corps behind offline poss in hisec sure it takes time but when you have nothing else to do you just turn up press f1 and walk away from your computer the rest is simply a matter of time my corporation has cleared a half dozen moons of pos trash so far and we accept contractsif there is a need someone in eve will find a way to make money off it or at least killmails
wouldnt it be so much easier if those off line poses did not still have full shield hit points you might as well just war dec and attack a online pos a least then you can scoop the modules once the pos is destroyed i dont think there is much better chance of someone showing up to defend the pos in high sec even if it is online if they could deffend it it probably would not be in high seci would love to be able to unanchor and scoop them or claim them as my own with some high tier hacking skill they could add but next best is just make them have only armorstructure for defense and loose the huge shield buffer when off line
increase the cost of sc to 40bil case solved dreads already deal titan dps so you cant ask for more and sc were made to wtfpwn dreads and co
having to organize refueling after a longdistance jump will effectively reduce their power projection capabilties considerablygiven the amount of fuel that would be needed for a moderately sized supercarrier fleet going by the op proposal that would leave that fleet in a very vulnerable position after deployment at maximum jump rangeand yes it will have a huge effect on their pockets look at the numbers on typical killmails with supercarriers involved youll see 20 regularlyto jump a fleet of 20 to their maximum range it would cost the respective alliance 6 billionnow imagine a larger engagement with 60 supers on each side and keep in mind the loser might not only find his supers pulling the emergency logoff but also stranded with the need to bring in massive quantities of fuel to hostile spacegood idea not sure if it needs to be that extreme but the fuel cost definitely should be increased a whole lot and the fuel logistics made more important
signed awesome idea
seeing so many supports to this idea is extremely depressing and demonstrates exactly how these imbalances arise in the first place ship balance cannot be achieved through costbased nerfs and this is especially true when the ships are so prevalent ingame already the reason titans were so imbalanced the first time around is because ccp assumed that their cost would keep numbers low with occasional ship deaths to keep balance in fact it just served to enable the rich to buy more and keep maintain the status quo by never losing titansthe logistical aspect of this change becomes more of an annoyance than a nerf established groups and alliances already have plenty of suitable logistics support and there is no real risk as the underlying balance issues of supercaps versus everything else is not addressedthe overall effect of a change like this would be1 established and wellfunded groups with many supercaps will be unaffected they will cover the fuel costs with an alliance wallet and use their numbers to dominate nearby territory  further increasing their strength by taking high value moons and similar assets2 smaller groups with less cash will find themselves struggling even more to use their prized flagships many will simply opt to sell them onto the richer groups mentioned above3 nullsec space in general will become more stagnant as alliances leave their supercap fleets at home due to cost of movement wars are then degraded to attacking subcaps and capitals versus defending supercaps  which is still as broken as everfix the underlying balance issues dont just slap a new price tag on and call it fixed
supported this as a part to make the use of scs more expensive is a good way to decrease ridicolous usage of them include a much increased cost of fighters and fighterbomber doomsday fuel cost and maybe even remote ecm cost
this its ed that one capital ship cant tackle another one also change the triage module to effect only the repairhit points of the ship itself not for remote repairrp hat carrier points sc maybe not titan pushes the triage button and survives at least long enough to do some good hp buff to the carrier itself would need to be significant i dont know what that would be 400 off of the top of my head add into that a massive boost to self rep and all of a sudden you have the chance of a fleet of 20 1bil ships at least holding there own against a handful of 20bil oneswith an eye on the longevity of eve its much easier for the little guy to aspire to a carrier im talking players less than a year and to feel like they have a chance against the big boys no aspiring alliance is going to risk to go and take a foothold in nullsec if they dont feel they compete at any level come up with a counter over a nerf any day guaranteed to  less people off and add more interest to the game you can add but you cant take away as they say

lol doesnt matter you prooved youre a complete ass mission accomplished
still no spellchecker huhand wow  no one noticed how you just pretended not to notice that for its length your thread is just about the worst supported in eve forum history bravo on your excellent misdirection there bravo sir well played d
agreed there should me a way but standings for orders isnt itstandings for distribution missions or trade missions should suffice no i mean they are trade missions afterallthough personally i would like to see the mission isk rewards for trade missions to be higher i mean you have to pay for the items so they should take into account that you are just earning a thin spread
i didnt make you do anything youre an autonomous agent capable of free will and decision making you chose to post gj btwthe two halves of that statement are mutually incompatable either nullsec is in competition with hisec or theres no danger of one being skewed which seems to be your favorite word over the othera very good reason indeed youve just made my case for megood luck with that i expect youll be posting again soon
short of a ccp implementing a method for players to join and form political parties and even probably limiting them to a certain number i honestly cant see rallying the hisec players behind select candidates hisec players are by nature disjointed and spread out in all walks of life no eve mail or chat can reach large segments of them like alliance mail can to direct them to vote or look at candidate xat best a dedicated group of players could feasibly form a party out of game and promote it on the forums in game and with limited scope through a corpalliance though that just presents a target such a dedicated team could nominate endorse and support select candidates that present a balanced view but are of course going to favor certain non gameplay breakingnerfing positions a model for some policies is the vote match site
i believe alot of you people who actually think 80 of the people who play this game play in highsec dont really fully understand the game that number is a lie most people who play in nullsec use alts whether they be mission alts trade alts data core alt freighter alts combat alts in training i was not the one who said this but it rings extremely truepeople in nullsec know what goes on in highsec people in highsec dont have a clue what goes on in nullsecalso who in there right mind would call moon mining fun
i would like to offer up for the csm a couple of thoughts on how to better spread out the population from hisec 1  hisec players do not generally go to the lowsec areas because of the massive amount of it that is claimed by the big block alliances possible solution big block alliances can only claim 3 or 4 lowsec00 solar systems per member corporation a nonalliance based corporation can claim only 1 or 2 lowsec00 solar systemsplease note that i am a hisec player not an alt and i do vote
1  it isnt claimed space since you cant claim lowsec like null sec you can only try to control itmy suggestion would be more along the lines that supercarriers cant jump to low sec since for low sec and high sec entities its much less viable to have a big chunk of supercaps than for big null sec alliances this would open more normal carrier and dreadfighting in which the table was less easy turned into the null sec residents advantage as it is nowmake supercarriers null sec only vessels and the whole low sec issue becomes a whole new ballpark to play in
the csm does not care about high sec it does not fall under one of the mittanis chest sucking wounds agendas the only changes the csm wants for high sec low sec and wormhole space will be nerfs
instead of using capslock or shouting at people you could try to wake up your brain and put something constructive in any threadsadly enough your just another wanna be populist who shouts a lot into the void without ever offering something usefull to improve stuff
well it seems that i really wasnt as clear in my wording and that has resulted in readers not being able to following my suggestion above my thinking on the claiming by the lowsec00 alliances was more along the idea that when i a hiseccorporation player would be trying to establish a presence in lowsec00 and then have to deal with both the rats that have bigger dps and the alliance roving bands who want to protect what they haveare claiming as theirs tends to be a bit more than the hisec playercorporation can deal with in order to just get setup and dealing with the rats in lowsec00 is more than enough to start with i am quite sure this last thought will not find a strong agreement among this forums readerscommentorsthe idea was that there would be a learning the ropes of this part of eve before being hammered by every passer by
i dont need you to watch me walking inside my quarter like a limping idiot me myself is just enough to feel depressedthere is a big mirror what is it for  of course to see myself in poses and have a sexy walk i personally do care about this and i really hope its coming fast i really like to spend half of my real life salary on aurums just to get this fixedand yes you are welcome to visit me inside my bedroom and check out if it tickles or nottwinkle eyewho really needs new content in eve when we can have a sexy walk 
actually making a mirror reflection of a virtual object is quite awsome if you stop and think about it for a second you should cheer up and not be depressed when you are looking at your character in the mirror now if you are depressed when you look at your character in the mirror well then that is another problem
they will never be able to make it run multiple clients with the cq as well as it was on the same spec machinesanyone who thinks it can be done should feel free to donate whatever they are smoking to me
ok i havent actually walked in stations for a bit of time as im now temporarily playing on my laptop that cant cope with it but i had a few days of experience on my pc b4 i put it in storage so sorry if i get something wronghowever i would like to have a choice of loading locations ie i can choose to load on my balcony or sitting on my couch locations where functionality is at your finger tips rather than standing aimlessly in a room or door i really enjoyed chilling on the sofa seeing the world go by and chatting to corpies while being able to see my ship and edit itmy cargo easilya lot of my other desires i know are on the way and i can only hope they are quicker about it such as customizability better on screen interfaces for pi and corp and the ability to choose what the screens show id like to see my current build and research jobs up on the screenanother rather cool thing to do would be to enable crome their in game browser to have flash playing on the main screen so we can watch vids maybe but certainly it would make me happier than having to alttab out to watch linked vids sent by friendsi am disappointed that establishments have to be corp owned i can see their reasons for it but often this encourages players to set up their own mini corps and staying in them to play dolls houses happens with poss too rather than getting in big corps and having side industries running along side them being in corps
ok ill bite lets say we give black ops the covert cloaknow we have a ship that has the ability to enter a system completely undetected save by the local count increasing because you jumped in to your covert cyno no intel on how you got in or where you landedthe cyno is invisible unless youre on grid no indication of where you went after you arrived because you covert cloak and no way to catch you unless youre the kind of idiot who makes cletus the slack jawed yokel look like stephen ing hawking oh and you can do all of this starting from a system light years away because youre jump capable in ships that can easily get 1000dps from a combat focused fitand to top it all off if things are too tough for you solo just bring some friends they dont even have to worry about getting into the target system thanks to the handy jump portal you can make for them
further imagine that its 100 guys and not one i like the idea of covert cloaks on them but larger groups of them i feel would be game breaking and as we all know small groups is not the current paradigm
guess what theres these things called wormholes wuuurm hoooles so your argument is that blops can enter a system undetected except for 1 local and this unbalances the game how you can do this with recons t3s already if you live in wspace its not an autowin button by a long shot for a start local is too much of a crutch for you crybaby nullsec carebears oh sorry i mean hardass pvp deathdozers when we lived in a c3 with k346 null static wed jump into system hit dscan 5 drakes wrecks 10s later either local has cleared logoffskis or dscan has cleared warp to safe cloak then if your carebears are desperate for cash and the mafioso they pay rent to are bored you have 1030 dudes turn up in local and it all turns to pup tents kumbayah and smoky barbeque they find your wormhole and light a cyno and youve got 3 aeons camping a wormhole exit yeah a cloakywarping bs is going to unbalance that right thereyou then go on to complain that blops are a force multiplier which allows you to leverage multiple frinds from a system far far away like some kind of darth vader special weapon except your average nullbear schoolgirl instasafe poshugging my little pony tribute ratter will more than likely have the ability to port cap ships and supercapsif you think im kidding you clearly dont know nullsec its a hive of weenies cowards and is safer than highsec these days because you cant be caught by neutral rr because theres no such thing imo the more they free up black ops the better it will make pvp in nullsec youd be better off complaining aboutthe upcoming degradation of local channel functionality in unupgraded space then youll be at risk for the first time ever
can you create a wormhole on demand in any system you chose for a few hundred units of ice products a wormhole that is impossible to detect unless the person making it is a total idiot and cant be camped because it only exists for a few minutes didnt think so trying to compare wormholes to covert cynos is missing the point on an epic scale you also make the mistake of assuming im only talking about nullsec although your comments about the timidity of a lot of the people who live there are fair my alliance has been running lowsec black ops gangs for months and were well aware of how powerful they can bethe simple fact is that the black ops does not need any extra capabilitites to be a powerful and viable ship what it needs is a boost to the things it can already do ie extra jump range and increased fuel bay size
do u even are fimiliar with the cyno mechanics how do u cyno in a undetecable u realize u need a cyna alt yes would he be blue thats retorical question
regards lax
1one player currency and dont force this upon me
i dont believe i have supported this yetstation environments really need to be seperated from the old hanger environment properly so that we have the old functionality and hanger environment then a new station environment where those that choose to deploy to station dont have to minimise chat hanger station windows in order to see anything
awsome idea
fluff fluffagain i wrote that im educating people that means there is an ignorant predisposition presentagain i wrote that sound logic is the only way i would quit not a skewed vote
unfortunately this discussion cannot be resolved with sound logic my dear the problem is that there are disagreements on the relative usefulness of the premise youre arguments are rooted solely on the basis that adding a bit of inconvenience to everyone in the game who needs to identify people at a glance is ok in exchange for giving the convenience of name changes for those who want it this is not resolvable by logic as it is simply an opinion of who agrees which added inconvenience is worth any added convenience for the greater good read populationso popular vote is the only way im afraid think about it if logic would work here why do you think we have politicians edit or democracies
i agree with this one hundred percent
lol seriously scientifically speaking if you yourself veiw it more than once youve skewed your own hypothesis ive viewed it a few times and scientifically speaking the laws of probability will back up my supposition that you and i are not alone in our multiple viewsseriously though why the hate on gallente pilots matar were rebalanced to their great fortune and as a side note to ccp ive crosstrained into amarr and matar so now youre free to rebalance gallente
there is no hate i am a student of scientific method so i just would prefer to hear the logic behind the rebalance instead of going on the votes of people who may be having problems with their fits and just assume that there is a problem honestly i dont know which are which popular vote may be skewed buy nonexpert votes i would love to see the opinions of hardened pvp vets on the matter thats all i also am a fan of varied game balance what that mean is that i do not believe balance on a ship by ship comparison should be a goal i like games like starcraft where each race dictated a different set of tactics and playing styles so i suppose i am biased in that from my tiny perspective the races seem pretty balanced as part of my nullsec corp the ship spread seems pretty equal amarrian guardians are the best logisamarrian battleships are more popular than the restcaldari have the bombers and drakesgallente thanatos and nyx is the carriers of choiceminmatar for cruisersi just want to point out that forums like these may be read by say only gallente frigate or cruiser pilots so they feel that their entire race needs a rebalance i would just like to see some actual evidence of where the imbalances lay taken as a whole race
though this forum page doesnt display it im sure its a simple task for ccp to do to filter out duplicate reads by same users so that a very clear readnotsupportnotcare vs supported ratio can be found
some of the reason why fewer people are joining eve is because they feel that they cant catch up on skillpoints to those of us who have been in eve for yearsi know this is the case i have had people who joined and then left because of thisit is a serious issue it is likely a real reason why we have less people joining eve nowso there should be mt to allow people to speed up skill acquisition on their characters maybe even give them the accelerator limit it to new accounts ones less than 1 year oldsome argue that people can already get high skill point characters if they buy them on the character market well i dont care about the character market that isnt part of the game it doesnt add anything to eve it detracts additionally a lot of people are attached to their main so not allowing increased skilling speed for new accounts directly harms new players joining eve while does nothing for veterans who already have a main and can just purchase on the character market a high sp altso please csm introduce to ccp that there should be increased training speed in the mt store
counterproposal drink bleach
no
i laughed out loud was that bad op you idea is based on the false assumption regarding catching upnot supported
i know youre just trolling but for good measureeve is a game based entirely on progression sp isk relationships etc all things you build up over timeit is right and proper that new players forever lag behind veteran players in several ways every measure taken against this concept is a denial of the very reason people play eve
biomass your characters and never come back
i agree in part with the op i know a lot also that never started up eve cause of the sp gap got a lot of other mmos that have double xp ideas in place to help out with just that vets still will be vets cant buy real experience in how to play the games items you have gathered thoughout the years etc but i think it should be geared more towards middle of the run players ones that know what they are doing and just waiting for skills to finish so they can get into that new shinny ship or just to be able to use the one they got better someone playing the game for a few months into a carrier or such is just crazy but as more and more vets leave the game is the ones that have been playing only a few years that will be the future of eve
once upon a time i joined the game and flew with players who had 10x my sp i thought ill never catch up then i focused on attaining specific goals for myself fly this ship use the t2 version of that max that skill and suddenly i wasnt worried about it now i hear people say ill never catch up to you and i chuckle a little then help them set goals for themselves like a good corpmatealliancematefriend
the old specialize your training arguement again sure at first it is very good to specialize your training to even be somewhat useful in any corp  alliance but one thing the bitter vets always will have is non specialize training for how many ships they can fly fit them all well and be very useful in any corp  alliance ive been ridiculed in prior corps  alliances for the lack of ships i can fly and how i can fit them a lot of others have to and to be frank a lot are tired of it and i know some that have quit the game over it cause of the sp gap or others that will never start playing eve cause of it so a few bitter vets will quit if ccp ever does something like this but would probably get more new players and retain others out of it i say good and wave to the bitter vets as they leave
wouldnt really improve mining as an occupation though
jeez just listen to yourselfi want a pos i can anchor at a deep safe which acts like a deadspace pocket and which i can put a stealth emitter array or similar on making it nigh on impossible to get a lock on with more ehp that wont unbalance the game and make the current crop of warptosafeandcloak bots even safer nor will it unbalance the riskreward structure of sov space because its now impossible to blow up peoples candy or even begin a siege because you can anchor this somewhere that they cant detect except perhaps midwarp with a lucky stab of the dscan this is seriously the most idiotic proposal i have seenyou say finding an available moon in hisec is not an easy thing well neither is finding an empty tech moon either tough cookies eve isnt set up such that everyone gets an equal opportunity at getting everything without resource allocation inequalities we would not have conflict and this includes highsec moon jousting if you want a moon in a system just dec the guys with the offline one and hire mercs the last thing we need is bigger tougher poss take wormhole space notably the lowend systems which cannot get cap ship transits fumigating systems of their human rats and poss is hard enough as it is this type of pos would result in people being able to camp unrestricted in basically invulnerable unscannable deathstar poss without even the clue of showing up in local to tip someone off that players may inhabit the system yeah fantastic idea
this is an internet spaceship game focus on internet spawait did you say boobie physics1
why doesnt this surprise me
um no your argument as quoted was defeated now youre retracting and arguing the proposal as a wholei thought it was pretty obvious that i didnt need to point out that you better get your message straightis that a ball in your hands why yes it is whatever im obviously arguing as the defense herefinally after cutting through all the flourishes and we arrive at the single actual line of your post then dedicate yourself to get rid of character transfers it is a fact that name changing is an alternative to the character transfers where it is impossible to spot a name in a list name changing isnt making more disreputable people out of air but channeling the existing ones to a system where their identity is accountable does that agrument sound familiar oh yeah because ive argued it before pass and you went
i went  because i didnt think that you could miss such an obvious fact and any further explanation would be superfluous also i dont like to repeat myself but ill make an exception hereyes we were here before and you simply refused to accept that as you have just agreed that character transfer is bad then why make it easier for people to farm and sell alts no name change keeps the number of people doing that downthe logic you cant seem to accept is thischaracter transfers  escaping reputation you seem to understand thisname changing  more character transfers you seem not to understand this logic whyi will spell it out to you againwhy would you or joe smith hesitate to buy a character today1 he doesnt want to be called mrs pms its just too silly2 he worries that even if he was okay with the name mrs pms may have a bad rep that he may inheritso you take those 2 things away with name changes and you get more character transfersget it
as long as theres name history on character sheet and api its okay if you can change name for plexaurum whatever jew gold it isit matters very little on battlefield who is who just pew pew
i support the idea of a khanid bs with missiles in the very least it does make sense since the khanid ships are missile boats as pointed out by the op suggesting it be a khanid navy apoc with 8 torps is disingenuous in the least besides thats called a golem the op as far as im aware is saying if ccp releases more ship variations in this class the amarr bs variation would preferably be a missile boat the difficulty is in providing a solution that is more than just a phallic raven and doesnt outmatch the cnr or golem eg khanid bs8 high slots 5 launchers 5 turret aka minimum 2 utility5 mids6 lows5 bonus to cruisetorp missile damage 5 capacitor recharge bonusthis would create essentially a bs with comparable dps to a raven given the ability to jam more bcus in the lows and the ability to either mwd around cap bonus or fit an effective armour tank just an idea
i never talk about gallente ships its about amarrcaldari a gallente missile boat is a silly ideaah thanksim looking for inputs from khanidpewpewcaldari pilots i know they are rare and hunted and mocked but maybe we could cry a bit together 
only gallente firgs can use dronesdont forget the heronalso missiles are a secondary for gallente if some of its ships use a different type of weapon besdes the primary it becomes secondary tristan celestis nemesis lachesis
me too i like to post in a thread without reading it
well i dont think ccp will introduce any new ships best shot for a khanid battleship could be to turn the redeemer into a khanid shipet voila khanid bb without the danger to create an overpowered beast like an 8torp double damage bonus abbadonas for black amarr hulls with hybrid guns there are the eom ships iirc they are shield tanked too there you have your amarrcaldari crossbreed with hybrid bonus but why would you want a crappy hybrid ship if you can get a tachyon boat with marauder layout shield tank and godly tracking bonus but one thing would be nice removal of the crappy split weapons on merlin four turrets pls oh yeah and caldari turret dread would be great too for whatever they are good in this day and age
oh they will not they still must do these t3 fregbswhatever and the tornado and patch the game and balancingits not that i made this thread to discuss what could be these new ships i just want to be heard and im sure im not the only oneim a caldari hybrid pilot i fly my ferox and my rokh with t2 mods i could use a tengu or an eagle but no sorry the only thing left for me is to skill up to the vulture and large railgun specialization lvl5 with only 7 months of sp nice catch pccp would say  but you must skill for it and buildem  cmon kid look at these  its p i r a t e ships with long range  cmon its awesome  i want one  small hybrids at least the blasters are still usable basically its a t1 harpy without the 5 dps but 5 shield it would become the new rifterbut 1 turret slot for the merlin wow i really would love thatand a phoenix with more turret slots is making me dizzy

gm lelouch1 our goal with the skill queue was to make skill training more manageable for players who cannot find the time to micromanage their skill training 237 especially when it comes to shorter skills which can now be queued up enmasse we had concerns at the time that a longer skill queue might result in decreased player activity which is the reason for the limitations2 there are currently plans for this3 skill training needs to be paused due to the possibility of the characters attributes changing due to implants in either jump clone4 answered by ccp grayscale here
i can answer as a jump capable pilot eve currently displays a sphere with the radius equal to your jump range  ie encompassing the area you can jump to however using the 3d map and especially in cluttered regions it is difficult to see which systems  especially at the borders  are still covered in the spherea graphical redgreen indication would be much clearer additionally the suggestion offers several improvements such as fuel consumption per jump i would like to keep the itemgoing off on a tagent what i would really love to see would be some kind of a measuring tool which would allow you to see the distance between systems both in ly and in jumps without having to be in one of the systems yourself i dont see ccp implementing a dotlanstyle complex jump planner but at least a simple yesno can i jump from a to b could be easily answered only using the starmap
thanks for the answer trying to get some movement on this thread to help the csm outnda hurting you much trebor
get out of highsec or learn to loot quicker moar tears indeed
stfu you dont like our play style big deal doesnt change the fact that its broken and seriously get rid of the ugly ass pink make up
damn this is a hopping post glad i brought it here via akitas suggestion
this made me laugh as i just said something very similar in fi great minds and all that
great trolls think alike this is about a mechanics issue not you should go somewhere else issue if you have a point to make on topic please do if not please gtfo
its not your can or loot so you need to improve your loot collecting abilities
ok troll lets try it this way currently the mechanics say its not my loot in all honestly its who ever takes the loot the point of the thread is to allow a mechanics change to all the victim his corp and the aggressor to gain rights on the can i agree if i want loot i should move faster towards the can that isnt the issue i want kill rights on people who take loot from the can i created more death in eve means a better eveplease give any other reason other than the its not your loot why its not a good idea
dont agree with you  troll amirite youve still not given a good reason why you should have any rights on the loot
right this way you can make sure after a suicide gank you dont have to stress out beating the scavengers to the lootwhich i can fully understand your position been in that position myself however the current first come first serve situation is working out just finefit tractor beams to your ships have a dude in a noctis do something that might require rubbing two brain cells together rather than asking ccp to change mechanics and  up things more than it is now
you clearly dont understand the thread ok if you suicide gank you are dead and you cannot pick up loot for 15 mins so anyone could grab it and dock in plenty of time next time read the thread understand the thread then comment
trolling is saying the same thing over and over again i should have rights on it for more death and destruction maybe he steals and i kill him maybe he steals it and gets away maybe he steals it i attack him and he kills me either way more combat
there is already pvp involved with the current loot mechanic simply saying i should or i want is not a valid reason why the system should be altered in your favourmaybe if you actually came up with a good argument as to why you should have those rights granted we wouldnt need to keep asking the same questions
i have said good reasons over and over noob corp loot stealers have no threat it can be a 3 day old alt that just does that to harrass and follow empire pvpers
sup

1 if an issue is brought up it should be discussed baised on merit not ignorance or bias2 this is my main account and i only have 1 toon per account3 i have been in a couple of corps since coming back from my vacation and each one has been war deced because people saw us mining and or in lowbie ships and decided that we where easy targets so instead of trying to pick a fight with someone who can actually handle them they pick newbie corps to pad thier stats with easy kills this is not pvp it is griefing if this isnt an issue to you it is to the new blood that this game needs to keep it from becoming the next star wars galaxies i can rember a time when ccp proudly displayed the number of active accounts they have on the home page i havent seen it there for a while granted the number of signed in is displayed but that number i am sure is still displayed because it hasnt decreased as much but if this issue doesnt get fixed swtor is coming soon
yes to removal of local from nullsec nothing id enjoy more then a nullsec exit from wspace without local to give me away then we can just take our abc from the twisted wrecked hulls of nullsec mining bots
1 plexes and missions  offer the same amount of loyalty points for both 2 make it that systems can only be captured by completing a certain amount of both plexes and missions3 make it that stations in a system cannot be accessed by members of opposing factions4 add two new factions  sanshas nations and concord sanshas nation faction can capture systems in all four existing faction areas if sanshas capture a system it is locked down and all stations inaccessible to anybody exept sanshas faction or characters who have a positive rating with sanshas faction all sanshas nation members gain an automatic 10 security status upon joining offer some good new faction mods for loyalty points gainedmembers of concord faction must have security rating of 4 or higher to join they cannot hold systems but can help flip sansha occupied systems to their original owners by doing plexes and missions there also concord are allowed to dock in all stations in faction systems apart from any occupied by sanshas again they can gain loyalty points with access to new concord faction modsthese simple changes would breath new life into faction warfare imo
how did i feel when i could no longer make choices and tradeoffs with learning skills and it became a shallower experience with less rewards for long term planning pretty ty does that please you
no no no no no no no
id just like to add that one of the nice things about eve is you can get 90 as effective as those vets in insert skill here in 10 of the time it took them to get to max level so while you may not be able to reach vets skill levels very fast you can become competitive in a decent amount of timeits still not going to be right now and some skills like cap ships will still take a very long time but t2 frigates and cruisers and a whole bunch of other t2 fitting skills taken to level iv are still easily doable in the newbies second monthin case anyone think vets are somehow unbeatable ive seen more than one vet get toasted by a newer player with lesser skills having all that high level polish with every relevant skill taken to five or four makes a difference yes but it doesnt make you invulnerable
what i dont get is some in this thread that says buy sp nooooo go buy a toon off the char market well isnt that buying sp people get attached to their mains and even some alts they want to see them progress through the game but also a lot i know hate the sp gap so if your saying to go buy a toon that has a lot of sp why not have a way to get more sp for your toon faster to me just a bunch of hypocrites that troll these forums
open up the code or make tools for user created content ie ships missions artwork eve has a ton of tallent that would work for free just to make the game better i searched for this in other topics and was really shocked i couldnt find anything im sure this has been brought up in the past but if it has i think it should be brought up again just think about the possibilities just have the devs decidcide on what to release and what not to
just think of all the time devs would have to spend making sure people werent inserting pen15 into that game and moderating content and checking for python scripts
true but if they used a tool set like some other games i have played they wouldnt have to worry about some things i know its a huge labor intensive investment but in the long run it would pay off i think yes you would need more devs looking over the content but you would need less devs creating content
no disscution at all i quite like this idea
supported conditionallyif implemented it should be implemented as part of a package of changes to missions andor to pvp that also makes missionrunning fits viable in pvp
topic starts  20091025just look t how mutch ccp have done so far 
sure why notthough i just have fittings saved and load fittings from the list each time which sort of makes me ambivalent to this
its just like the cynogatecloak effect update in apocrypha here is a selection of posts after seeing the cyno effectpreapoc dude that is awesome from localpostapoc lol that was pathetic from corp chatedit supportz
it seems they did this to bore miners even more possibly to make it easier to find the macro users i support this thread either way
arrr
yohoyohoa pirates life for me yaaaaaaaaar
bump it support it love it
roughly estimated 30 or even more of 00 systems are empty there are no players in ityesterday i was flying around 00 and i have seen more then 30 emtpy systems without sovin between some good systems full with 00 players but statistically 00 is empty as far as i have seen so go there and be part of itccp has messed 00 in a bad way so there is really no need to buff highsec anymore
it seems to me majority of players are still in hi sec and will remain so unless hi sec carebearing including industry is going to get hit by serious nerfbatmore isk doesnt make anyone want to go for pvp its fundamentally flawed thinking pvp is cheap you only need rifter or rupture whatever tech 1 crap shi and you can kill  if you cant manage to do even that you are not going to bring out tengu for pvp
so what im not in the business of telling other people what to do and neither should anyone else be play pvp if you like its no affair of mine but i have noticed a tendency from certain sections of the player base who insist that there is only one true way if someone wants to ponce around in a tengu in 09 or higher let them eve is a game not a cult or religion if someone gets a kick out of preying on newbie frigates and blowing them to bits they may be objectionable and a pain but that is their rightplease stop trying for a onesizefitsall approach after all we play eve because presumably we like doing so and part of the attraction is the open ended nature of the game you never know someone might be a minister of religion in rl but in eve the baddest and worst pirate imaginable if so good on them if the industry in hisec is to be cut down to size as you suggest whos going to provide the ships ammunition rigs etc if 00 and nullsec are so seriously disadvantaged as you seem to be suggesting a lot of 00 residents also have alts in hisec in order to provide the material used in the mega fights we keep hearing about
i agree entirely i dont think that hisec corpsalliances have the motivation to move to 00 because of the entrenched positions of the incumbants and why should they be forced to eve is i have always assumed a sandbox where you can play any way you want if you are happy roaming around inventing doing pi etcin hisec why should you be forced to move either to losec or 00what a lot of people in 00 seem to be saying is that they want to have their cake and eat it too have a presence in 00 so as to form blobs and knock the living daylights out of other blobs and at the same time keep one foot in hisec so that they can make and develop the materiel need for the blob fights i read once that bob remember them had a major manufacturing base in alentene wheres that hisec of course note this quote here if this is not the most contradictory statement in a long time i do not know what is of course trolls are always with us and it maybe that this is a glaring example but from what i have seen reported about statements made by csm in their fireside chat this attitude would appear to be widespreadim not going to bang the drum about the attempt i am making to organise some kind of slate of hisec candidiates for the next csm election but if anyone is interested they can contact me ingame
your perfectly right a high sec player who wants to invent or manufacture shouldnt be forced to go into lownullsec but by the same token a nullsec player who wants to manufactureinvent shouldnt be forced to go to highsec which at the moment they areas you point out yourself did you know an industrialist in my alliance that is goonswarm just so you know since that seems to be a target of your dislike pointed out that if every single manufacturing slot in deklein the 00 region we live in was devoted entirely to the invention and production of t2 ammunition one full fleet thats 256 people could expend the entire production capacity for a full month in just one hour of continuous firingthats why we in 00 are looking to get some parity in 00highsec production we dont want to take anything away from you however if 00 is supposed to be about creating empires it is somewhat ludicrous that we cant even produce our own ammunition let alone ships modules and infrastructure you say we want to exist in nullsec and 00 simultaniously thats the point we dont we want the complete opposite this char im posting with is a purely highsec character shes my hauler alt to get things i need from highsec i dont want to have to have this char but at present i do to get the items i need
can you explain how and why nullsec players are forced to do their researchindustry in highsec then can you tell me why there are so few stations in that region as it seems the capacity is lacking if that many people can and do expend that much ammunition in such a short time frame assuming it was needed etcid also ask what happens whenif your supply linesinfrastructurelogistics are interruptedfailbetrayed do you fall into oblivion without the resources you need or do you log on that highsec alt wholl always be there to bail you out if you go from null imports 80 of their goods to importing 5 then that is taking away from other people who used to be supplying them out there and now dont have those people to trade with the same is true for things that happen in 00 to other parts of space like moon goo it is a null only good so why should people not in null have to deal with null players to get it how about some parity there you cant boost one area without taking something away from another the more you boost it the more you take away if we go for balancing we are messing with the way these different groups and areas interact with each other and if done enough we ruin iti tend to think the idea that you could take a handful of supplies and rebuild the civilized world in the middle of nowhere with nothing but a few tools is ludicrous if the point is to go out into nowhere and have nothing to do with the rest of the game then eve doesnt need to be on one shard and the point of the game is destroyed if there are fewer and fewer ties to different groups of players in different parts of space the dependencies is what makes the whole single shard universe work and meaningful there can and may need to be tweaks here and there but to make it so nullsec dwellers can do whatever they want without ever needing to trade with other areas or make use of any other part of space low wh high is stupid
sov nullsec has the ability to increase its manufacturing capacity in the time i have lived there i have not seen then exhaust mineral supply or mined out belts i wont contest the fact of nullsec being dependent on highsec manufacture but there are ways around it in current game mechanics pos slots outposts upgrades also while living in null one issue i never had was not being able to find an empty manufacturing slot if current resources arent being used to their fullest why should other areas of the game that are using them be punished
to make it clear imho i am the most beautiful person here in station just the way of walking is not like it should besometimes i am thinking of just shooting into the mirror i need a gun
a button forward to regular email would be all i need i would never touch the evemail window again thenalso i do not need the eve ingame browser i am very happy with firefox time spended into this apps is wastedsame with evevoice i prefer teamspeakccp likes to redevelope the wheel again and again instead of bringing us new content for the eve universe
not supportedi love incarna and i love to see more of it soon and fixing old stuff first sorry to say but nothing i do is broken so im good maybe theres some sovereignty sht going on in 00 but frankly i dont care about that those alliances are mostly botting rmters to begin with so far as im concerned none of ccps extra time should be spent on them anyway
this is what i thought incarna would be from the beginning i was disappointed that doesnt mean i think it was a bad step i just think they skipped a lot of the finer details this is a perfect idea
dear i was going to let it pass but if you mustdo you need your argument validated that badly that you wanted to skew the terms yes thats why i quoted that particular segmentif people dont care then they wont mind the outcome which is in my favor and just what do you think politicians do they debate amongst a controlled number of representation in other words i would have an opportunity to reach and educate each person voting contingent on the terms described above i would be all for it
then go for it put a vote and keep on bumping i feel confident the solid reasons against this have all been already stated on this threadmy comment on government was to attack your logic that only a irrefutable logical argument can silence you but i hope you do see that there is no more logic to be argued here and what do politicians do yes i will use your own analogy the debate is finished i think politicians have a vote after the debate i believe  there is no new things to be said your bump is only an attempt at generating new readers and hopefully for you new supportersboth of which can be better achieved by you posting a vote thread which incidentally was my suggestion 2 posts backwe are now entering metadebate so i think i dont need to say anything more

agree with you on most pointsthough you mistake my wish i just want to see facts of this nerfbat that gallente got hit with not just rely on anecdotal evidences as mine and your opinion on ships both can differ given our experiences in the game so can the opinions of people who each think that its not balancedso what was the thing that ccp that nerfd gallente and only gallenteim just wary that this is an endless cycle if taken overboard and we will all be here in 1 years time crying rebalance amarr nextim for rebalancing but also use of caution in doing sobesides just because nobody calls for a proteus doesnt necessarily mean that a proteus cant whoop a tengus nose if fitted for it the capability of the ship has a lot to do with the fitter and this is really just an argument for maxxed out lvl5 optimal dpsehp fit vs optimal lvl5 dpsehp fit right i also think its possible that fcs dont call for certain ships because they favour certain tactics that they know differences may demand them to adapt and do something different for example the very fact that gallent bcs arent that popular means that they are cheaper so from certain perspectives for a isk tight gang being gallente pilots could mean they spend less isk for their warchest these are just some potential positive effects that differentiation gives us its not always good to think of optimal lvl5 toe to toe shoot out comparisons in a real economy like eve another thing to consider is that although matari ships rule in spec comparisons traning a good matari pilot takes much longer than an equivalent gallentean or caldari they have to train projectiles armor tanking and shield tanking and missles other races especially amarr have much less places to spread their sp to be proficient in a wide range of shipsdear me but i digress
that is not really true you can fit next to any ships fitted with missiles wit neuts to amarr and caldari both have pure turret and missile ships and some hulls that need tank cross skilling to be effectiveat scorp shield harbinger  curse etcgallente are just as much as a split stat race as minmatar today and also require high sp amounts in lots of combat relateddrones guns as well as in support categoriestank speed cap to work
gallente ships originally fielded drones much like carriers do  extra drone per level the server couldnt keep up with it so thats why theres a hard limit of 5 drones per subcapital ship drone hp and dps got buffed to compensate but this was way before my time so im unsure of the specificsblasters got nerfed by way of two things first nanoing ships was nerfed again unsure of the specifics due to it being in eves age of antiquity this meant that you could no longer out fit a heavily armored gallente ship in such a way whereby it could still dictate range and disengage then again you could get ridiculous things like a 1200ms dominix blasters were also hard hit by the web nerf look at a vindicator or vigilant to see the only effective webblaster ships for referencegallente ships were hardhit by the ability of warp scrams to shut down microwarp drives this means that within 10k  incidentally the range of the primary gallente weapons system  the ship once again cant dictate rangegallente ships were hit bad by the explosive hole  im lead to believe at once point armor had low thermal resistance instead of explosive resistance hybrids no longer do good damageim sure someone who has been here since the beginning can expand upon these pointsverify them and offer up new ones but these are the ones ive heard about nobody calls for a proteus because it isnt a good ship its most effective role is as an armor brick minimegathron or as a cloaky uboat it is nerfed on drones it is crippled by railguns and who in their right mind would take a 15bln isk ship into scram range the fits are simply too situational to offer any kind of tactical flexibility and it makes too much of a juicy target to bother taking on roams its ewar fit suffers from the idiotic state of gallente ewar bonuses bonus to jammers wot that wont stack properlythat is an incredibly weak argument when youre talking about a difference of 13mln isk tops either way the isk doesnt matter as much as the fact that you cant get on killmails and youre more likely to die by the time you are using these ships on roams chances are you dont want to spend 20m buying modules and parts then burning through 20 gates to catch up to where the action is better to just bring a useful ship which fits with the fcs tactical doctrinegallente are out in fleet fights for much the same reasons the only ship that is ever called for is a lachesis and its a distance second to a huginn anyhowthe gallente pilot has to train everything the matari pilot does with the caveat that hybrid skills are so useless most train projectiles anyway and fit them unbonused onto gallente hulls then theres the necessity of nearperfect support skills so your ship wont cap out or drone skills to take advantage of the droneboats the sp cost is massive for very little gain
my first training was gallente but i wanted to pvp so i crosstrained amarr zealot is a great ship i prefer pilgrim to arazu and curse to lachesis harbinger over myrmidon apoc over mega abaddon over hyperion and personally i prefer amarr caps over gallente caps players who fly amarr do very well thankyou good fcs are good fcs because they know the capabilities of they ships they want in a fleet and the capabilities of the ships they might face if a player doesnt know how to best use a myrmidon hes not an fc more than once fcs have one simple rule when calling a fleet i want the best combination of dps logistics and support i can possibly field leave your megathrons at home i actually had respect for your arguments until you said this seriously its an advantage to have a ty ship beacuse its cheaper than a good one it makes financial sense i can only shake my head it reminds me of when canadian soldiers were deployed to afghanistan in their forest camo because the government of the day wouldnt buy desert camo it tricks the eye they said one of the good gallente ships is the ishtar but for it to be any more than a mission runner it needs to be shield tanked therefore a gallente pvper trains shield myrmidon dominix and ishtar are all drone boats exclusively gallente need to train drones but not just drones because the diemost brutix and mega are all hybrid platforms gallente must train hybrid with the same support skills required by matar matar need to only train projectiles and dont jump in with missile boats each race has one or two of them except the caldari they have mostly missile boats with one or 2 hybrid platforms
1 for removing nasty aur at least from the balance popup
the issue is that most stay for a week or two and never convert from the trial account and never stick around long enough to start being involvedadditionally skills plays a huge role for the semisolo highsec carebear which a lot of players are these are important people for making the economy worketc even if they dont do much with the interesting parts of the game and it is from these that some of the itnreesting people come
you seem to be thinking along my linesneural remaps for plexand the rationale is sound so yes supportededit and expounding a bit on the rationale in full the gist of it
nah you see you set goals planned ahead thought long term long term in eve being mere months not years this is beyond people like the op because they fail at eve they insist on everyone being able to cheat
reported for sticky
we already have the option to buy skill points basically by buying a higher trained characterif anything its not the skill point time that drives new players from the game its griefing and the lack of options when your first starting outwe need instead of speeding up the skill training or allowing folks to buy skill points better tutorials for the new players that help them learn the different aspects of the game including remapping overview settings and pvp better warnings in the tutorials on how to avoid or minimize getting griefed ect and most importantly more things for the new players to get involved in more missions like the sisters of eve epic arc more dynamic missions that help teach and guide new players on skill plans and help them find what they enjoy in the game more things that allow the new players to go out with lets say an npc fleet to get used to fleet mechanics ectrather then try to fix something by breaking something else lets improve the game and fix it at the same time all the above adds to the game will help improve the new players experience and actually get them going on something they enjoy and hopefully keep them in the game
rofli shot coffee out of my nose there
uh please op do us all a favor and search the forum and read the related topics before you start yaspc threadi hate repeating myself so im not going to say again all the reasons why the proponents of this line of reasoning is wrong illogical amounting to cheatcode console gamer logic search and read the other threads on this topic to read the arguments that have already been saidinstead i will add my obligatory 1 comment for this yaspc the sp system in eve works because it keeps the game fun for everyone those who only play casually are not at a severe disadvantage to those who are hardcore live in parents basement gamers who can play 237 in other games those who hack more sheep or spend more time training get better faster this is fine for those other mmos not for eve eve has lasted 8 years because of its unique never reach a level maxcap way of handling xp in the sp systemthose new players that eve loses because they cant get with this program or learn to have fun without maxxing out skills first should go away and play something else we really dont want you here new eden would be just fine without youyet another skillpoint cheati hear star wars old republic is out
as much as i never thought id feel this way about this subject im kind of on the fence about it lately the op does have a valid point my first break from eve was in part due to this very thingi felt i could never catch up with those who started earlier i oppose the idea that it should be no big deal to speed up your training but what if there were consequences what if there was a booster that would do it for a short period of time but had the possibility to bring severe consequences of some sort maybe there could be a chance based sideeffect that by taking it you would lose a skill level or two on a random skill instead of it working as intended or maybe you could only use such a booster once or twice a year to dire consequences of some kind if you tried more often i feel that offering a slight boost to skill training speed via methods like the above might not be as game breaking as some think and i feel it would at least offer a glimmer of hope that even though youve not been playing 8 years youre not entirely locked out of the race to the top though it will cost you a lot of aur and some risk to be able to take advantage of thisjust some crazy thoughts
but the problem wasnt that you couldnt catch up it was your mistaken perception that there was an issue in the first place
i never thought that it was a deal breakeras i said it was only a part of why i took a break still i feel that the skill system is genius but not perfect primarily because of this issue
ok for all those who are worried about catching up answer me this questionhow many skill points does it require to be an ace assault frigate pilot with max weapon tackle and tank skillsill give you a hintexactly the same number as anyone else with the same skills regardless of when they started playingand that is the beauty of the eve skill system you can catch up just not in the way youre thinking about it you view the total number of skill points like its some kind of magical talisman when in relaity at any given time 75  80 of that number is completely uselessconsider thisif im flying an amarrian freighter the 8 million skill points i have in gunnerythe 5 million in missilesthe million or so in t3 subsystemsthe millions in caldari and minmatar not to mention capital shipsthe millions in dronesall of those arecompletelytotallyutterlyuselessjust like everyone elsemore skill points give your character more options and thats all
it is definitely perception and it is some reality for a new player to have the same opportunities as me they would have to buy a ton of accounts and wait months or would have to buy a new characterand i am not suggesting that people can buy a ton of sp just that they can accelerate it for the first year i am not threatening your 100m sp characterswhether that is by the accelerator which already exists for new characters or by remapsnote that it has nothing to do with me i have multiple characters over 40m sp and have run out of things interesting to train on a number of charactersi would have no intention of using this myself it would just be to help new players
the issue is not a matter of skill points its a matter of having things for new players to do while they wait for there skills to train that makes the game fun and exciting for them already a new player gets two remaps when they are first starting out and this helps speed there training up a lot already specialize in something remap to match it to be useful then remap and plan a training plan for the next year what you ask for is already in place for new players with that two remaps a year secondly speeding it up anymore will actually hurt the game far more then it would help when you start making it easier what happens is you get a bunch of insta gratification players slowly but surly they take over the game and it changes from being something challenging to do to super easy with no actual work or player skill to accomplish anything after that the game dies as folks get bored with it and leave much like a few other mmos that have died out
agree signed supported its up to the eve community to stop all things that will breakruin the sand box and if you dont like it here is the door
im proposing granting corporations the ability to own and maintain capital ships as a corporation vehicle here is a list of changes that would go along with my proposalmembers with the role to purchase corporation goods could purchase capital ships for the corporationcorporation ships could be handled by authorized pilots via a flight contractwhen the flight contract ends the pilot will lose access to the capital shipthe flight contract can include collateral to help ensure a pilot returns the ship to the proper locationthis way if you dont have the right pilots online you might be able to get backup pilots more easily depending on how much you trust them
which has been resolved alreadyget it
i start a new character change the name immediately to mrbadguy farm make sp make enemies sell the character it reverts to the original clean name but you thought of that already right you probably just forgot to cover that caseand you mildly brushed off the main reason against you which is how it will make fcs job and local scanning suck no please dont rehash the aka alias again without some miraculous retrofitting that addresses this and yes you have to address this problem not skirt around it or make it seem like its not really that bad of a problem if you want to debate whether its that big of a deal only a consensus vote can vindicate you
well i can understand your pain my first ever battleship was a rokh and i used to love harpy and vulture ive got max skills ah well minus drone skills with all of them siege warfare spec 5 and all that useless crap truth is i get better results flying minmatar or amarr ships now of course i would kill for a 7turret ferox and vulture or an ishukone or better yet mordus scorp boxyshipwithgraycamofetishthe mordus scorp is my wet dream scorpion  gray camo  marauder layout  hybrid damage bonus  resistance bonus and enough midslots for full tackle now of course that wont ever happen would even skill up frog ships for that
would you marry me  3the scorpion hull could indeed be an amazing turretboat like the npc gurista scorpion sadly they made the navy scorp a navy ravenbis mordu rokh now were talking
for all the time and effort gone into the new turret system it would have been nice to have battleship turrets easier to spot in relation to the size of the shipits not an urgent issue and i suppose its probably an art dpt thing but their far too small
turrets look pathetically undersized on battleshipsheres an idea of how battleship turrets ought to compare to hull sizeplease visit your user settings to reenable images
ok guys ive locked down the categories prioritization will go live sometime this weekendmuch obliged for your helpafter reviewing all of this i am thinking that i need to go back and totally redo the csm categorization system sometime this fall lucky me
quick test on sisi shows 27 to be still broke adding advanced cargohold ii does not change the size of the cargo bay untill you make the ship activewhat categories are you thinking of changing to
if by dynamic you mean repeatable then no fix and or finish the content yes balance the bpcs yeseach cosmos agent mission series offered is a specific storyline mission offer that gives a large faction standing increase when completed only available once in the life of the character keep that as isthe epic arcs is a much longer series of missions that can be repeated every 3 months for faction standing increase keep that as isover the years theres been lots of proposals written about cosmos which end up getting passed over for other proposals about csm ccp nex prices etc
the fact of the matter is you already got a kill be it from a wardec or can flipping or how ever it is you got the kill more combat is not a good enough reason to change it there is a ton of combat in the game as is new players in high sec have plenty of risk as is sooner or later your going to probably kill them there are plenty of ways to track it without adding in what your asking forprovide some valid reasons why this should change other then more pew pew we want actual factual reasons other then he stole my loots and i want to kill him crying
if i want legal ownership over someones ipod or fancy camera wallet or bagel irl all i have to do is destroy their car first to give me legal rights to the items contained thereinthis is how it should also be in eveoh wait i am incompetent just like the op
i lold
hahahaha funny i like this
currrent mechanic allows theft with no recourse dont be nieve and belive the victim or his corp ever get to shoot the noob corp loot theif furthermore if he did just happen to to be the worse loot stealer ever he would lose a 2million isk thrasher hardly a prizeif someone posted that a possible exploit of this idea or was a ccp coder and said maybe its to hard or even it in the hello kitty online plan doesnt allow such violence maybe i could deal with it but i havent seen that stop asking why and ask why not
lol yeah bring rl comparisons to this and see how badly it goes for you
which is wrong they are flagged to the dead guy who owns the can and his corpno what you are asking for is stealing without recourse but in your favour under some misguided self entitlement argumentbut heres a thought lying about the current mechanics over and over doesnt this make you a troll by your own definition
its not stealing if its a war well atleast it shouldnt be
waiting to see how badly it goes for me
ok lootboxing title belt match one boxer wins fan runs into the ring takes belt runs away what exactly do you think the boxer is going to do he is going to beat the guy downwar country invades another country the invading country wins gets to have its way with the spoils of war if another country tries to step in they either fight and the invaders and win or die to stop the spoils of war being takenbusiness a corporate take over happens company a does a hostile take over of company b during the company c illegally trys to steal assets of company b after the hostile take over takes place company a and c now have a legal dispute and take it to the courts to decideanimal kingdom lion kills a antelope a hyena wants to eat the antelope hyena comes in to get some taste meat the lion splits his skull and now has two mealsin your eve universe currentlly what is allow isthe fan who stole the belt is now the heavy weight championthe thrid party country who came in got the spoils of war while protected by the uncompany c gets a stern talking to but is encouraged to continue to steal since there is no real action that can be taken against themthe lion doesnt get to eat dies no more lions hyena poplulation swells to the point they starve out due to there not being any lions to kill their food for them
it must be a new forum record for the most fail rl analogies in one threadcongrats
wow seriouslyfirst off the belt is not owned by either boxer it is owned by the boxing commission and it is loaned to the winner of the fight till he looses a title match to another boxer at that point it is loaned to the new champ secondly the fan who steals the belt and gets away is going to be charged with theft by the boxing commission if the boxer that wins beats him down then the boxer is going to be charged with assault and punished accordinglyto put all this in game terms for youyou fight another player and win on your way to go grab the loot some newb pops in and steals it from the wreck btw it is not your wreck it belongs to the person you just killed if you attack the newb concord comes in and blasts you outa space for assault much like the police would do to the boxer if he attacked the fan the owner of the wreck now has kill rights on the thief much like the boxing commission would have rights to press theft charges against the fan for stealing that beltyou fail to provide a reason why the loot belongs to you at all and you fail to provide valid reasons to why you should be able to shoot themlook at your options to be able to retaliate against them and you will see that you have options put them on your watch list declare war against there corp suicide gank them move down to low or null sec and live where you can protect the wrecks of folks you kill so that you can loot them
wrong the fighter gets to keep the belt he loses the title
lol i like how they are fail since you cannot dispute them
dispute rl analogies to a game of internet spaceships yea ill get right on it
noit has been presented in a intellectually dishonest ignorantself centered point of view congratulationsand and christ stop using toon if you want to be taken seriously i am in a one man corp so what learn what griefing is apparently you have no clue as it pertains to this gamereally this has been this way from the start and eve has not died but has grown
newsflash issues only have merit if people give it merit if people believe it does not have this either due to ignorance or bias then it will not have any it works like this in rl too you think people become friends or hire you for a job based on merit aloneyou are posting on a forum open for all players to see and presenting that a change is needed you need to convince us not according to ccp unless someone or a group of people actively hunts you down over a prolonged period of time and follows you no matter where you go in the game for no other reason than just because they are not griefingno you are at war stop being a victim get into cheap t1 frigatescruisers with a bunch of friends and take the fight to themnot every game is for every person some people like the cutthroat youareneversafeanywhere ethos of eve some prefer a more chill laid back consensual atmosphere where they can be left alone and unmolested unless and only unless they voluntarily choose otherwise to each their own the problems start when people from one group or the other venture into the others territory and then claim things need to change because my type of people want enjoyment too and it just doesnt work like that because the two ideas cutthroat vs consensual only are more or less mutually exclusive
this goes too far essentially getting rid of war decs altogether it would prevent for example a pve missioning corp from declaring war on an opposing corp of regular ninja salvagersgood idea but more than double for wars against a nonallied corp say 20mweekit already works this way sort of at least when the aggressor is losing aggressors who attack a carebear corpalliance looking for easy kills but end up losing ships instead almost always let the war expire or better yet retract it asap the end that needs fixing is when the defending corp is losing as it stands the war can drag on forever no matter how much the defenders lose you can pay ransom to the aggressors to leave you alone but when word gets out that you paid up a flurry of new decers will likely pounce on you worse yet the original aggressor could break his word and keep the war going even after you payyour proposal is a sort of enforceable war ransom system which is interesting that kind of idea might work if it somehow deters new aggressors from jumping on a target after they pay maybe a corp that pays ransom costs more to attack for a certain period of time
this is a nonissue and does not have merit i am not biased i am in an industryfocused corp war decs are core to preventing eve from being hello kitty online or worse wow
i agree you shouldnt be able to leave alliance or corp while in war
ughroleplayers are the worst
hey i think the ops onto something there
thank flying spaghetti monster that reasonable people are on the csm so that horrible ideas like this wont even be considered
restricting technetium to wh space is just silly as is the jump bridge suggestionremoval of local is a no brainer and i really like the idea of mercoxit only being in wh space
im surprised this issue hasnt been addressed yet loot log exporting is a critical feature ive just been waiting for my account subscription to die out since it went missing if its not working again before my subscription is up im just saying screw it and moving on
1 plexs are generally a lot easier than missions doubt they would ever consider giving the same lps for both but some lps would be good in line with how much easier plexs are2 good idea would need to change how missions are generated would be a pain having to hope the mission is in the right system may be we could have plexs with mission style objectives you warp in and get a message what to do3 oooo nasty be pretty bad if you lost your system when it was your base with all your stuffz however might be too 00y for ccp4 again maybe too close to incursions to do right now but when they move on away from incursions might be a good way to put it to bed sansha are pushed to a lowsec area next to concord space sansha vs concord fw continues long after eve has moved oni agree with you something needs to be done there are not enough corps who want carefree pvp to keep fw at the level it needsyour ideas about making rewards for plexing worthwhile are rightcash and lp rewards for plexing how about system wide bonuses and instation benifits if your faction own the system the control bunker acts as a warfare linked commandship giving you bonus prices at the station for repairs etc are reduced 10 poss in system require 10 less fuel and the gate and station guns work for you may be that last one is a step too far how about alliances in fwhowever im sure many of these ideas were put to ccp at the roundtable discussion on the subject at fanfest what ccp forgot to send anyone to it oh
isnt that csms job facilitate communication between ccp and the players
1 the way it works is you grind complexes and get tags someone else grinds missions and gets lps if you want to create say a faction item you need lps and tags and a blank to cook it therefore you need people doing complexes and missions to make stuffs what you propose would upset this dynamic and people would drift more towards fw complexes because theyd get their cake and eat it too2 this has merit but the last thing we need is to make fw more complex 3 whats next gate guns shoot at opposing factions 4 more factions sounds ok but i dont know sanshaconcord would be the way to go for a start youd need hisec and lowsec areas held by sansha in order to have this work or youd just end up out in stain getting vaped by pl supercap fleets maybe throwing open conflicts between serpentisgallente or khanidblood would mix it up a bit in the peripheral lowsec areas  and especially in khanid as theres not much life in derelik or khanid regions right now
1 farmville in space2 need to revamp mission system to allow for targeted assaults good idea though which is why missions also play a part in my vision3 never going to happen ccp doesnt like the idea of arbitrary restrictions also leaves you with a rather big explanation problem in regards to multinationals bending over for ragtag militiasbest you can probably hope for is denial of service for hostile members4 screw sansha and double that for concord bloods serps and guristas are all a lot more interesting rp wise  rp is the reason you added it right dont bother answering i know its only for lp whoring purposesthe potential for a pirate expansion to fw is one of the reasons why i want it revamped adding them now when it is broken as hell does no goodone out of four on par for fw threads guess that is ok  par is pretty low though so doesnt mean much but meh
1 some lp for plexes would be nice but no where near the amount you get from missions2 mission are finished in 23 mins there would be no time to counter them3 i like this idea but with one change if you already own an office in the station you can always dock there  youre paying for the docking rights too may get more militia to start basing in low sec to defend systemareas4 other pirates not sansha or concord spread the love around to othersmy 3 ideasa nice and simple remove all navy npcs from plexs youd have more pvp as people would be more willing to fight 1v1 in them instead of waiting 510 mins trying to get support that can tank the navy while rest fight no one like going into caldari plexs just to get ecmd all the time and die rp wise  navy needed in high sec due to incursions so down to militia to carry on the warb fix the dt spawning of plexs since the start of fw its been a case of if you cant login and plex right after dt then youve lost because the system just wont spawn every completed plex at the next spawn tick using a you dont need faction specific plexs like now as no npcs complete a plex basically a control timer point behind an accel gate in black rise it respawns anywhere in black rise right awayagain would lead to more pvp as it wouldnt matter what time zone youre in anymorec how about when a system goes vulnerable it also becomes cyno jammed rp factions last attempt to hold on to the system stops none fw players deciding to just hot drop more sc than the total number in a militia fleet in for easy kills youd still be able to have caps in there of course youd just have to move them in ahead of time
actually it was the roleplay aspect wanted to give pirates a faction to join and obviously a polar opposite is needed to counter them so i though concord would be apropriate however id happily go along the serpentisguristas route as new factions added to the mix
this has been an issue for years and unfortunately has not always been an issue there was a point in time when it actually worked perfectly then for some reason it got ed upto set anything in the overview you have to customize it like crazy just to get it to show anything properly lets say you want to only see people in your fleet and you have xpilot is in your fleet well if he had good standing but you have that unchecked well then you cant see him in the overview same thing with wartargets even if you check xpilot is at war with your corporationalliance if he met the criteria of something else you have unchecked then they wont show on the overviewim sorry but i just want the overview working like it did in the pastps dont know if this was brought up before also but i was too lazy to find it and bump it so heres a new one
10
ah because one imperfect expensive and unpopular way that relies on actual characters being trained at the usual speed and paid for is already available for silly people who think its some kind of i win button we should totally destroy eve by allowing selling of sps gee i totally see your logic there actually i doubt you could even define logici really  thats your argument ok i recommend thinking before you post again it could help
why lazy selfish ignorant malicious intent towards eves future unaware of the fun that comes from actually winning at a game without resorting to cheatsspeak up
training is timebased and time is something eve is running out of simple as that
so lazyeve is hardly running out of time its the only mmo im aware off thats been updated so much since launch with the stated intent of keeping it going and competitive with new games for as long as possibleeves subscriber and record total concurrent user numbers have done nothing but rise year over year really  try to have some clue what youre on about before you post
no one wants to force anyone to do pvp or move to nullsec the problem is balancing of risk vs reward  or better effort vs reward since theres not much risk in sitting in blob and shooting at primaries in a a ship that is going to be reimbursed by the alliancepeople in nullsec have to build an own infrastructure pay sovbills upgrade their space and defend it after they conquered it  and for what to get plexes that are on par with highsec l4s if they happen to hold space with decent trusec or worse if they dont ridiculous industrialist opportunities compared to highsec moongoo may be an exception but the typical grunt wont see much from thatshoot red crosses in absolute safety without ever having made any effort to achieve said safety all day long if you want but adjust the payout accordingly
rofl plexing and running sanctums in 00 makes way more isk than running lvl 4sif you only manage to make as much there as in lvl 4s you might want to scratch behind your own ears firstyou want people in empire punished financially because they chose to remain there only because you feel punished in your wallet in 00but didnt you choose to go there with all consequences
systems with sanctums are badly nerfed most system dont have sanctums anymore you heared about that 
good luck trying to find sanctums in places like providence and if you make less money in l4s than in havens you should check your lp to isk conversion ratesnobody ever mentioned financially punishing anyone the csm logs and the upcoming 00 changes are aimed at buffing nullsecs industrial capabilities so its not entirely dependent on highsec as living in highsec doesnt require any effort or coordination at all income possibilities should reflect that this can either be acheived by buffing nullsec income or nerfing highsec income but wasnt matter of debate either in this thread or the csm summit except for said long overdue buff for nullsec industryi dont live in nullsec  would be pretty ed given the current income distribution
right on man got a wife and two kids to feed at home right  playin this game for fun you got bills to paypeople on both sides of this argument need to get their heads out of their asses this shouldnt be about bloo bloo my space money it should be about making every playstyle enjoyable nullsec is being revamped because current mechanics esp sov and scaps are  nobody gives a  about your anoms and to the glorious wh whiners on the other end deal wiz it you dont need ark in c1 wspace grow the  up and get into a bigboy wormhole if you want highends and good sites there was no discussion of removing highend roids from c46 so the serious wh folks are not going to care just the s building carriers in their c1 for no reason
the problem with null sec isnt the game or the mechanics or ccp its the leadership they got their sandbox and this is what they made ccp has tried to straighten some stuff out but that doesnt change the people if null wants to sort out the problem they should start by looking in the mirror
the csm meeting minutes actually stated the csm wanted c14 abc removed so no apparently c4 dwellers are not serious enough for the csm to care about i even lived in a c3 for a few months the issue i have is the csm trying to nerf all other play styles into oblivion so that nullsec has a fair reward for the effort they put forth and while i agree they are right between moon miningabcsded 710plexs and other null sitesanomsadmittedly nerfed but not for everyoneofficer spawnsetc id have to think the issues with null arent fixed by nerfing other areas of the game but by making the rewards already there more accessible so what if someone takes a hulk in a c1 2 jumps from jita is there a grav sig there at the time how do you think it will fare when a ship with weapons comes through the same holec1s are not safe regardless of the system the entry point is in this only took me 1 time to learn
agree with op but in a literal sense we need another forum a separate forum what goes on in high sec is the meat and potatoes of this game we shouldnt even have to talk to those people those people are annoying and mess with my relaxation time those people are just awful i dont know whats wrong with those people its like their fingers are attached to their butt that they speak out of yes those people should be in a different game a whole different server even banish them to singularity give those people singularity forum since isk flows like water for them playing with 100 isk ships out to be like being on a level playing field for those people those people could maybe even get monocles for 100 isk we could also ask for forum features to filter out those people those people just make noise they are like children with a new bell maybe null sec should be the childrens section
in retrospect can you explain why high sec players should be forced to null secrofl there are enough production slots in null sec if the pos setups would also run manufacturing setups propperlybut as it is most pos in null sec are either for jumpbridges stagingpoints moonmining and sc and titan buildingits not asif there arent anymore moons left for other production setupspeople moving to null sec knew and know that stationless systems which arent npc space can have only 1 outpostpeople moving to null sec knew and know that the infrastructure of empirespace isnt in place there and most likely wont be in space therethese are facts those moving to nullsec knew and know and yet they complain about it isnt that a result of a choicejust like its a result that a high sec player cant find officer spawns mine moongoo mine abcs or run sanctumseach side made their choices and now both sides complain about the lack of contents the other side does have hmmm one of the most heard quotes in null sec is that you have to be able to defend what you have if you cant defend it then you shouldnt have itits space where the might of the strongest prevails a fact every null sec resident is aware of or at the very least should be aware ofin high sec it isnt much different with the contant wardecs corporations being decced by griefer or merc corporations and disrupting the usual gameplay dont you think such a corporation can survive for a longer period of time without the use of altsif you cant maintain your supplylines be it in null sec or in high sec you are doomed to withdraw and rebuild elsewhere i dont think you give marketeers enough credits those who cant adapt are forced to other ways those who cant will perishisnt that the normal way in eveas stated previous you cant boost one area without taking something away from another the more you boost it the more you take away if we go for balancing we are messing with the way these different groups and areas interact with each other and if done enough we ruin iti tend to think the idea that you could take a handful of supplies and rebuild the civilized world in the middle of nowhere with nothing but a few tools is ludicrous if the point is to go out into nowhere and have nothing to do with the rest of the game then eve doesnt need to be on one shard and the point of the game is destroyed if there are fewer and fewer ties to different groups of players in different parts of space the dependencies is what makes the whole single shard universe work and meaningful there can and may need to be tweaks here and there but to make it so nullsec dwellers can do whatever they want without ever needing to trade with other areas or make use of any other part of space low wh high is stupid
id bet that a full 90 of players who consider 00 to be their home have multiple altcharacters sitting in high sec whether those characters are actively being used or are just sitting aroundid bet that 100 of new pilots start out in high sec many of which never even go to 00 before moving on to other games  meaning that they havent experienced enough of eve to say which parts are in the most urgent need of helpnot saying that high sec doesnt need help but using population statistics in a game based around the use of alts is beyond ridiculous how about just stating what you feel needs fixing in high sec often using many different alts
i have 1 character in null 3 in low sec 7 in high sec my four accounts voted for people who have null secs best interests at heart despite an overwhelming number of the characters being in high sec you will find this is common for most of null sec so it should come as no shock that though many characters are in high sec their accounts votesupport null sec issues
perhaps if high sec carebears bothered to vote they would not be in this picklelook there have been alot of stuff for carebears in the last few expansions so its time null sec gets some attention better luck next year
i never said they should however listeningreading ccp soundwave in his interviews ccps general attitude about high sec and reading the may csm minutes i am concerned that is what will happen ccp using their stick once again to direct players to where they think they should be and play as they think they should playi surmised as much but the other person made the point that null couldnt create their own goods and the capacity they had was inadequate so i asked why that was seeking to get them to tell me who exactly was stoppingforcing them to not have that ability to show it wasnt a design flaw or not possible i dont complain when i am in a wh i cant use stargates or run to jita right quick or in empire that i cant find abc to mine etc i asked because the other poster said theyd like to not need their high sec alt to get what they need to make the point that theyd always need their alt when things get dark the only way to never need that alt is to sunder the one universe so the alt cant bring stuff in for them making it bettereasier just does that it wont make it perfect and the idea that youd never wantneed to deal with other parts of the game is stupid as it destroys the point of eveagain if buffs were made to nerf the relationship from high to null there would then be too many producers with too few consumers only if the null boosts were not good enough that the goods from high would still be profitable to lug back there to sell would the trade from high to null continue general trading would probably still work and be viable to compete with null industry but also with the now tougher production market producers would perish in this competition most likely small time and new players wo the means to survive the drought or haul their crap out to 00find someone to do so for themyou and i seem to agree on just about everything that was covered though it seems you have the wrong idea as to where i am coming from
will the next csm actually give a  about the game as a whole and not just their own personal agendafrom what i have heard and seen the current one is far to concerned about their own personal agenda and could care less about the game the only thing they seem to push for is whatever boosts their play style the most and cries out for nerfs to the rest of the game that does not tickle their fancyit seems like most of the csm is simply nonexistent they seem to only become active when its free trip to iceland time why do the other csms tolerate this behavior maybe they dont care either as long as they get their free trip on it what was the second longest time to deliver basic meeting minutes i do not see the csm improving on delivery time anytime soon it is painfully obvious their treasured new technique on conducting such things is not working do they care enough about the game and the players enough to actually put forth real effort into what they said they would do during all the forum and local spam to be electedthis csm is indeed one of the worst groups put together to represent the players since its inception do everyone a favor and start actually doing the job you said you would do or resign as soon as possible you wanted to be on the football team and prance around with the jersey on but you dont want to contribute when it comes time to get in the game and do something the funny thing is your sit on the bench in all the games wondering why no one will come up and ask for your autographs so patheticyour current form is an absolute disgrace essentially your free trips and paid accounts are paid for by us the players it is time for you to man up and earn it dont you think instead of asking for knee jerk nerfs to things you dont understand and telling other players to kill themselves when they dont agree with everything you say
i remember your previous post when you suggested that all the characters in eve should be reset to 0 skill points after that post i have doughts about matters you bring up
it seems you are complaining for absolutly nothing and you ran out of arguments to rant on and the worse part of all is that you started this thread you are the initiator of this so you should of foreseen ahead this lack of arguments in the first place shame on you

i think the most important thing as far as getting black ops to be used more is not to buff the ships themselves but rather to buff the black ops actions which they are designed to be used forso what im saying is instead of trying to upgrade their stats there should be changes to gameplay outside of the ships that make using them a much more popular strategy
the only things that black ops need are better tracking explosion radiusvelocity and torp speed for the widow and covert ops cloak not so it can jump in and warp undetected but so it can also warp around the system undetectedwe waited in belt so long once i actually fell asleep once i finally make contact yes black ops is adzactly a wtf pawn mobile in 1v1 situations as well it should be when it cost more than a carrier but you add a couple more ships and it can quickly become a trophy kill to even the noobest pvp gang as it is now just bring a buddy to rat in the belt your in and wait until somone takes the bait now you have even more mid slots for ecm and some backupcovert cloak isnt overpowered because of the saftey in numbers philosophy that already neutralizes the black ops today it just gives the pilot more pvp opportunities some of which will cost him a billion iskif you can afford to pvp in that everyday you deserve to and no a large  of people cannot afford to do it now wheres my blops carrier it could be a regular carrier that can still use drones while cloaked thats alloh yeah the compromise could be that the blops could only cloak from 0 to 34 warp speed making it scannable withought making it impractical and as far as jumping in a fleet why not just give it a mass limit like whs say enough for a fleet of 6 bombers or mabe a stealth carrier hmmmuntil then if you warp in on me ratting alone in a lach dont bother calling for backup dont waste time trying to run my alts are flying a widow and a command loki my lach doubles as a cyno straight to my triage mom fleets teet and for you its already way too late
in a recent interview ccp soundwave suggested that they will be repurposing the black ops like they did with the bombers any hopes and maybe speculation on what they might turn into in the near future
this ccp youre doing things that are usually great and all and thank you for that but still it takes you years to change some stats regarded as overly stupid  how hard would it be to see that black ops are underused  then how hard would it be to change like 3 or so values and to see what happens  its not like eves going to collapse if you buffed then a bit too muchreally two versions of the bo that would fix everything the combat black op for quick im in  im ganking you and oohh session change timer is done i killed you im jumping out t2 resistancesshieldarmorstructure hp according to its combat battleship statusabout the same dps as right now more or less 1k per shipmore powergrid 2k on every bos seriously the sin have 11000 at max skills you cant even fit 4 neutron blasters without needing any pwg module that is awfullless stupid bonuses agility speed  in my humble opinion  panther battleship bonus  5 damage 5 rofbo bonus  10 bonus to the velocity factor of stasis webifiers 10 web rangethat would prevent the target from going away at lvl 5 that would be a 15km web range with t2 and something like 195km web range with t2 and overloadredeemer battleship bonus  10 reduction to cap use 5 rofbo bonus  20 reduction to neutralizers cap usage 15 reduction to neutralizers durationthose bonuses would allow fast reduction to neuts duration  neutralization capabilities but without using too much cap as capacitor is needed to jump out afterwardsin battleship bonus  5 damage 10 drone hitpoints and damagebo bonus  15 bonus to warp scramblersdisruptors range 10 remote sensor dampeners efficiencylooks like a big arazu with a jump drive can scramble at 189km with t2 and overloadwidow  battleship bonus  10 bonus to missile velocity 10 bonus to explosion velocity and signature radiusbo bonus  30 bonus to ecm target jammer strength and an other one maybe like target painter bonus nothing to say here except that with bos being sturdier less ecmslots will be needed and that makes room for target paintersand the second version more like covert gang support and that means  t2 resistancesactual shieldarmorstructure hppoor dps like a good cruisers dps but good ewar capabilitiesno covert ops cloacking its already really difficult to catchincreased jump rangedramatically increased fuel bay capacity 10k or reduce the fuel needed per ton that would fix the problem aswellspecial command bonuses maybe create a new set of bonuses like things that would be usefull to cloacky ships  scan resolution  reduced delay before locking for recon cruisers that would successfully create a ship that can jump and bridge ships for quite a long time that can jump on the field covert cyno is 30s bridge is 20s so you can actually get on the field right after your covertmates so you can give them bonuses also dps would be so poor that it wouldnt be used as a combat ship cloacky t3 would be cheaper and would have the same tankdpsand just in the end i would allow this version of the black op battleship to have a fitting service it doesnt sounds too powerfull to me since the black op is supposed to be an undercover mobile base of operation for covert gangsfinally its all about costcapabilities for such an expensive and skill intensive ship thats what i would want to get in the end
you missed the point on all countson voting and the ambivalent there are always exponentially more reads than replies and since my contingent terms  as you quoted  were to have those reads on my side since they dont care enough to reply they wont care enough about the outcome either silence implies consent i would be guaranteed a meaningless victory still want toon the analogy i have not nor is it physically possible for me to debate with every eve player debate isnt a one sided read and post but an exchange as you said a vote can only be had after a debateyknow i can be crass too but i have enough respect for how thoughtfully and levelheaded you used to post as usual tell me if i missed anything as in the past you did provide me with valuable insight on how name changing should evolve

yes
supporting a popular idea that ccp doesnt give a  about for the 1000th time
at the very least the wallet isk balance should be able to be moved back to the left so the 0 aur amount doesnt take up an extra line of blank space lets keep this topic on the front page till ccp sorts this silliness out why they ever thought that much more blank space thanks to the 0 aur would be ok is beyond me
i see your point op but allowing any sort of increased training speed for new people would ultimately be abused more than it was actually used furthermore anyone who quits eve because they dont have enough sp really never took the time to understand this game anyway it is not at all difficult for a new player to play with the big boys pretty quickly in this game in fact that is one way in which eve contrasts from almost every other mmo out there that ive heard of anyway in a lot of games you have to play all the way to the endgame just to be viable to participate in endgame stuff in eve training is not linear but rather branched out you can train one area pretty well in anywhere from a week to a couple years depending on the area of focus and when youre done with that or before youre done you can branch out and work toward something elsei think what we should be doing is making sure new pilots are aware of what they can do to join in playing with the veteran community they need to understand that battleships are not ultimately better than frigates or that running level 4 missions andor mining veldspar are not the primary sources of income in this game once people get past those and other misconceptions like those they will be much more ready and able to enjoy this great game
indeed as ive stated in the other irritating sp for mt threads one of the great things about eve is you can get 90 as good as the vets in a particular skill in only 10 of the time it took them to max it outin fact most players i know rarely get tier two and higher skills above level four at least till they have every other faster training skill they want so they have more time to branch out rather than spend ages getting that final 10 improvementive only has this particular character for 14 months yet i can fly every races bcers minmatar bs i fly the typhoon fleet issue which is the most sp dependent t1 bs there is  it requires three weapon systems  drones projectiles and missiles and it has a damn tight fit every races weapons and ewar are at t1 or better i have t2 scout drones and the rest at t1 almost every mod my bs uses at t2 i fly t2 mining exhumers and can fit all highsec t2 crystals gallente transports and freighters covert ops cloak run five rd agents at once 10 rd jobs at once can have 129 open market orders social skills are all at iv exploration skills are good enough i can run any site out there i can fit 4 implants fly a noctis at level iv and theres stuff im sure im forgetting as well as stuff i tried but didnt get intothis guy is my highlowsecwh generalist otoh i have some specialist toons that have become extremely good at one job in a fraction of the time it took toovhon to become a highsec jack of all tradesyes youll never be able to rush your way to flying cap ships in just a couple months but you can get into t2 frigates and cruisers and be 90 as good as vets in that time thats leaving aside that t1 ships hardly become useless even at high levels but back on point  with t2 frigates and cruisers youve heaps of options in 00 warfare and if a mere two months is too long to wait well  eve is definitely not the game for you
if you want new players to stay put an alt in the help channels they need ui help a friend an invitation to a corp and usually a friendly ultimatum that they must subscribe to be brought on its not much more complicated than this specialization is important in the beginning early introduction to fleets and pvp even at the frigate level fleets and ewar are force multipliers that can balance skill points detract from greed pve isolation with team fleet activities that pay more or are more funi think i will use this argument with them if it comes upthanks d very simple
you can already buy skillpoints herethe people that are too stupid to realize the character bazaar is there to facilitate quicker sps arent going to do well in eve and quit anyways
already addressedpeople are tied to their mains this is true for everyone it isnt the number of skill points it is for many who you identify with to begin withthe character bazaar is not some part of the game or something we should defendand yes i know and you know that in just 34 months the player can have a useful number of skill points for all sorts of thingsbut what matters is the players perception at 14 weeksand face it some players want their mains to be the ones doing thingsyou all are just as bad as those who said that removing learning would kill eve
its not the skill points that are the issue though man its the fact that most new players when they try the game have no clue what to do when i started out i had no clue about focusing my skill training or how to remap my stats properlyi had a few friends that i met that actually started helping me out and including me in doing things with them that made the game fun we as a community need to make the new player experience better by helping them and including them in activities the game needs to improve on the new player experience by adding things to help them out and provide enjoyment for them while they train as wellmainly its on the community not the game mechanics that will keep or drive players away from the game and we need to step up to the plate and actively try to keep these players by showing them what is out there in the game and help them with setting up training ques for what they want to do
no it does notpeople spend lots of time training up chars to sell themif anything make the character bazzar apart of the arum store
i agree the ball is not all in ccps hands at all is it does anything come to your mind to try to sway others to this point we have a good amount that try to uphold the cold harsh world idea but its almost exclusive as if treating a noob friendly is a sign of weakness the schools we have are good but im not sure they address the 2 to 4 week hump as well as personal welcoming i think the shaping we do in the beginning is important too surprise noob ganking only seems to make them greedy withdrawn pveersive drifted off topic perhaps we need a proposal for the players instead of ccp
dont let the dream die folks
ive been holding onto my boobs dream for a lot longer than eve has been around so never fear 
breast equations should take into account age and muscularity of the character long live old nattiesi support this
i dont understand why any of this is usefulpeople can already use the corp wallet to buy cap shipsit is possible to control who can fly cap ships with starbases or corp hangars in stationsit is possible to deny someone access to a capital ship using aforementioned mechanicsit is possible to collect collateral from corp members already
this would make more sense with supers than basic caps dreads however should be alliance level ships
it is intrinsicagain it maintains the conflict of purchasing a character with a silly name again there will be no clean name because there will be an aka recordstill better than the alternative of no accountability in character transfers old and vindicated fcs arent looking for names but hostiles standings will transfer and names are available in the aka if you think my replies are skirting the issue then provide more detailed information on how exactly they are and we can proceedstill better than the alternative of no accountability in character transfersyknow i can be crass too but i have enough respect for how thoughtfully and levelheaded you used to post as usual tell me if i missed anything in the past you did provide me with valuable insight on how name changing should and continues to evolve
id like to give this thread a chance at some exposure bump
id love to see fw get some attention as well as null
yes yes and yesgive
ive never seen the new turrets unless i zoom my bs in so far it stops me from being able to see anything else thats just plain dumb
the size makes them look like secondary weapons not primary weapons i understand that having cartoon like proportions would ruin it but reallife battleships have main guns that are quite viable
and still frigates tend to have exactly that cartoonish look especially with autocannonsits fine on destroyers but looking at my frigates makes me zoom out in disgust
in no particular order here are my priorities21314161920223638434481818181 cant emphasize that one enough127142please add the motd for alliance and corp channels topic link should be in the hot topics thread
will need to repost in proper thread in a day or so
most of these items have been voted on before nocan you also include the rank that the item achieved in the previous round of voting and any action taken by ccpeg assault frigate 4th bonus  5 in august 2010 crowdsourcing 7 in november 2010 crowdsourcing and still nothing done
would be a nice thing but a clean vote would be best and then in the after action report include that infosuggest you link this thread to the actual crowd sourcing thread as the feed back thread at lest copy all feed back over here so it does not get lost in the responsesor link responses on the front page lolitem 19 seems to be noted as complete so people do not vote for it
cosmos and all 1time missions need some loveive done most of them for caldari and amarr and they are confusing and hard to track where you have and havent been an epic arc type journal series would be much appreciatedespecially with the tag circle and tutorial agents but that is almost another topic altogetherat a minimum id like a way to track these agents as a bonus the cosmos items could use some love and remove the darn complex items to craft them their fitting requirements are greatbut no one can build them due to the crazy items needed the skill requirement should remain
it was to a previous poster after you commented on them stfu
problem is you failed even harder by trying to use rl analogies than you did in the first place when you cried that someone stole someone elses wreck and you couldnt do anything about it but stomp your feet because you are too incompetent to have someone at the ready to scoop loot
but a boxing match is between consenting participants a hauler that gets ganked by a heavily armed battlecruiser is not an opponent in the ring of honour but more like a mugging victim in a dark alleyway and the battlecruiser pilot would be the mugger who beats up the victim and then complains when another thief shows up out of nowhere and runs off with the victims walletto use another analogy lets say that jimmy was playing with his toy car in a nursery but then he started crying because he remembered that mummy and daddy had been shouting at each other and then he heard the sound of smashing glass then mummy ran off with blood streaming down her neck and the police came to take daddy away then sarah shows up and takes his toy car away from him so he gives sarah a lecture of the theory and ethics of property ownership then a lion and an antelope appear
u mad bro
m8 u jus jelly u cant be pr0 in hisec where the bigbwoys play
u is rite bud i is jelly
we pay to legal mug them
not mad in any way i am suprised at the stupidity of some of the eve community but not mad at all dont think two characters that dont do empire warfare and a character that doesnt undock have any idea what i am talking about its very clear you do not thank you for your posts clearing up the matter that you dont understand but this is about empire war mechanicsask yourself with current mechanics is there any way to kill a noob corp loot stealer noob corp thrashers is 250m from the ship before it pops it dies he scoops he warps he can stay docked for 15mins or return to the field where the can creator is knowing the can creator will kill anyone that can kill him over can the can flag lets say the victims corp gets in fleet to come kill the noob corp loot stealer they land on the battlefield and have two targets one that fits guns and is a pvp ship that shoots back or a speed thrasher with salvagers on which one is attacked again the thrasher has already dropped off the loot he stole as stated before no realistic threat to them
what you are asking for is the ability to steal and not be stolen from its part of the risk of being a high sec war dec corpthe loot thief already has to deal with the agro timer for the loot he stole from the owner of the ship and his corponce again as you can not seem to get this threw your thick skull the loot does not belong to you it belongs to the owner of the ship that you killed as such they get retaliation rights not youyou want to own the loot then go mission you want to be able to shoot at folks that steals the loot outa a wreck of a player you just killed then get out of high sec its that simple
no
moar tears please
a wild alt appearedactive repping is ok for solo pvp if you fit the ship right but has inadequate utility outside of 1v1s for the following reasonsactive tankers generally requires multiple repping modules capacitor injectors nano pumps and nano membranes to work properly which makes them vulnerable to alphas and lacking dps so they are unsuitable for group roams where passive tanked dps ships are superiorat relies heavily on capacitor boosters which can be used up in a matter of minutes giving at ships a serious lack of stamina on roams cap boosters arent for sale everywhere but on the other hand most systems have a station with a repair service which is all passive tanked ships need or else they can ask their logi for reps the ats are too logistically intensivewith the present game mechanics its logically impossible to balance them anyway you cant make it so that active tankers can take enough dps to compete in gang fights while still being balanced in 1v1 encounters thats because armour reps only have two relevant attributes armour rep amount and time cycle between reps so heres my attempt at suggesting a fix for armor tanking firstly compare the gallenge myrmidon battlecruiser with the amarr vengeance frigate the myrmidon has mediocre resistances meaning that a single active repping module doesnt achieve much at reducing incoming dps but players fit two or three armour reps on the myrmidon and simply plow through the dps of their opponent this necessitates the use of double cap injectors rigs all low slots dedicated to the active tanking so no damage modules and nonracial guns the ubiquitous autocannons to save cap and fitting requirements the active tanking myrmidon ends up as a niche ship with lacklustre dps and low capstamina that can certainly grind down individual opponents but isnt much good for anything else a lot of people just ignore the ship bonuses and shieldtank itthe vengeance on the other hand has great armor resistances which naturally reduce incoming dps this allows players to fit a small armour repairer to take advantage of that fact and youll see many vengeance frigates which run active tanks without all of the hassle a myrmidon has to go through they can fit damage mods and rigs and dont rely on capacitor boosters furthermore a vengeance can roam about at will just as well as any passivetanked frigate the difference here is that the vengeance is not forced into a niche fit in order to active tankobviously one is a frigate and one is a battlecruiser and there are many differences in that regard but i hope people would agree that active tanking ships should be more similar to the vengeance than the myrmidonthats why i suggest that you should recieve resistance bonuses in addition to repairs this would obviously need balancing and you could go about that in a variety of ways you could tweak the ratio of resistances to armour rep add stacking penalties increase fitting requirements of armor rep modules as i pointed out its presently impossible to balance active tanking between solo and group fights because all you can do is adjust the amount of raw dps that gets repaired but whats key here is that you can adjust resistances and armour rep amountobviously this would increase the durability of active tankers vs multiple opponents as the increased resistances would tank far more damage than the armour repairing would against solo players a reduction in armour repair amount persec would be needed to balance it out in solo fights the resistance bonus would have a similar effect to an armour rep bonus anyway active tanking would not replace passive tanking with nano membranes etc because its still cap intensive
it would also make active tankers troublesome to kill when they have logi support giving them muchneeded extra durability in fleets additionally if players were using a single repping module instead of multiple mods their cap boosters would last much longer making them less of a logistical headache on roams they might also feel more at liberty to fit damage mods like the vengeance does or an armour plateextender obviously they should only be able to fit smaller platesextenders than passive tankers which would further increase their utility in fleet fights the amount of lowmid slots on some ships would need to be revisitedideally a certain amount of armor rep amount persec would be transferred to armour resistances so that a ship was similar to the way it was before in solo fights but also better at tanking greater damage in larger battles for example i imagine that a hyperion could fit a single large armour repairer to improve its resistances and then a 1600 plate so that it was more comparable in fleet durability to a passivetanked abaddon while not being a copy of it i think that the upper limit on how much raw dps you can tank should be reduced in solo encounters which could allow for reducing the cargo space needed to hold cap boostersof course amarr and caldari already have resistance bonuses on their ships which are much more useful than the repair bonuses of gallente and some minmatar ships thats tricky
you are comparing a battlecruiser to a frigateyou are comparing a tech i ship to a tech iione of those ships has a resistance bonus
obviously but i only compare them to try and make the point that i think resistance bonuses might be the way forwards for active tanking its an anecdote about the differences in how you fit those ships and sort of sacrifices needed to active tank them not a serious analysis of a vengeance vs a myrmidon
an active tanked vengeance has an insane tank its one of the few things going for it but to suggest this should be a standard for active tanking in general would just make things ludicrous plates do not provide resists repsboosters do not provide resists either tank style needs to consider use of resist modules and not everything has to be fleet viablei dont want to sound overly negative about your suggestion but i dont think there is much merit in improving resist profile  active tanking i do however agree that passive tanks currently offer too much ehp i wasnt exactly over the moon when ccp buffed ehp across the board since it impacts on solo and small gang guerilla tactics
i think you focusing too much on the vengeance example i wasnt necessarily suggesting that active tanking ships would all have resistances on par with a vengeance and just because those things you pointed out dont provide resist bonuses now does not mean that ccp could not choose to make them provide resists in the futureack spelling
there is already an easy answer to thisthe 75 to rep amount should include incomming repsthere fixed 5 to resists make internal and external reps better but 75 to internal is only good for internal so make it so the 75 includes incomming reps presto fixed
you missed the point my logi shouldnt get gcc when he reps me in a lvl 5 yes we carebear it up on the side or someone shouldnt get gcc when they give my gallente fail guns a tracking link boost so what youre basically saying is that because im 10 i should have gatestation guns shoot me 237 just because i have outlaw status you heard the man ccp make lowsec even emptier
the ship turrets look greatbut the icons are terriblejust terrible i cant tell whats what without hovering my mouse over modules and its been a month or so alreadyplease revert icons or lighten the contrast on the new ones dark icons against a dark backgroundreally
the new turrets are awesome
the icons appear to be an afterthoughthey lets grab the image for each turret and resize it in ps and use it for the hud iconsthis takes an hour or so of work for all the modules as opposed to have to spend days recreating the icons never mind that the original ones were just finewith the failures seen in the icons and the problems with cq and with the dismal quality of nex store items it seems that the one thing that ccp is really missing right now is a good graphics artist
welli dont like the idea of t2 bpos and would prefer invention for bpcsthe players with the t2 bpo should be compensated accordingly and not just get 100 run copies but the removal of bpos would be good for eve today tomorrow and 5 years from nowno i dont own any t2 bpos but i did stay at a holiday inn express last night
op you just have to learn how to fly a rifter i know its a big sp leap for some of us but its a worthwhile trick for those of us in mining corporations or anyone really for that matter
op i think your ideas are absurd but i also think removing abc from wh space is also absurdi am in favor of greatly reducing the amount of mercoxit found in 00 and perhaps significantly reducing the abc found in weak sissy wh systems its so cheap 
hi allif ccp had a reason for doing what they did or someone can levelheadedly explain why this happened ill revoke the proposalbasically with incursion ccp added 20 more storyline missions as far as i can tell there is a total of 1 storyline which is where most if not all of the mindlinks in the game come from this kind of skyrocketed the price up as it used to cost maybe 100 million isk to buy all five 10 million  4  50 for the mining one now the mining one cost 380 million which in comparison is the price of a capital ships skillbook and the other 4 total about 125 million at 47 46 30 and 1 im guessing ccp did this to nerf mission bots or they just werent thinking too much when they added the missions in to please the mission runners with new content i wouldnt know as my security agents always give me transaction data delivery materials for war preparation or a new one where you deliver lock breaker hybrid ammoi know this sounds like a whine about pricing because it is i can see the one nanite book costing so much because it only spawns in 1 a couple of sites one of which is cosmos and everyone is fine with that as its how it always was but right now cs pilots are getting screwed over for the cost of a full set of plus four implants for the combat links and the mining link sets you back 380 to 450 million all this seems to just be because ccp didnt check their facts or if they did they didnt tell anyoneit has been mentioned that they could have did this to make it so you need multiple cs pilots instead of just one good one to swap links but that would be a nerf to titans motherships carriers orcas rorquals tech iiis commandships and battlecruisers thats one epic stealth nerfthanks feel free to flame or support or whatevercyrus
if anyone gets me the proper number of storyline missions that i should take into account ill redo the math im on dialup though currently and internet browsing is too painful to want to really hardcore forum warriorheres the numbers to show why mission runners shouldnt be too ed and people who dont like the missions but do love the bonuses mind links give should support me as if they were more available and cheaper more people would use themi assume storyline agents do not have to give their divisions missions as i have had courier transaction data delivery and mining materials for war preperation come from a security storyline which i got running nothing but security missionsif this is the case i have had 3 different missions out of dozens pulled over my time the two mentioned and one where i have to transport lockbreaker hybrid ammo ccp said they have added 20 new storylines in incursion and the one mission gives the mindlinks this means you have 1 in 24 missions give you the thing for a 42 percent chance of getting that missionso if you were to follow long statistics and say that out of 1000s of samples you will ultimately be rather close to that 42 percent that means that you have to run 288 standard missions each time to get a link at 7500 lp per mission which is easy to attain in low sec you get 216 million lp by time you get that mission everyone gloats they can make 1000 isk per lp so you have at this point made 216 billion isk off lp alonefollowing another statistical assumption the pricing minimums reflect that 380  47 mean that you seem to be around 5 to 8 times more likely to get something other then a mining link so to get the coveted 380 mil mining link you would in the long run have to run 5 to 8 sets of 288 missions generating 105 to 1725 billion isk from lp only before you get that good rewardthis puts your mindlink to total profit margin at 2 percent or for the mining link 37 percent on the low end and 2 on the high end of the 5 to 8 spreadill be honest my math is bad so the isk values may be off on how much they will make and i assume there is more then 24 storylines total so really they most likely have to run more then 288 missions long term to get the 1 storylinepick your tldrtldr missioners for mission runners its only like 2 percent of your total profittldr non missioners look how much they make dont let them whine about taking a 50 mil loss on 216 billion made in lp alonetldr cs pilots sucks to be us right now
seems the whole courierimplant thing is causing some inflation thats seeping down to the plex level have you looked at nomad implant prices its the opposite side of the courier mission equation agility directly affects travel time and the capacity for churning missionsi certainly hope plus 4s stay affordable enough to pvp in them
as i am unaware of any bad things that would come of making these implants cost less you have my supporti miss being able to switch out a combat implant for a mining one for mining ops
yep mindlink prices went up by an order of magnitude supporting a measure to increase their supply again

himy main is named hodge666 been playing for over 4 years now love eve spend alot of time on here as im sure alot of others do6 days ago my account was hacked all items sold all isk removed the items were made into contracts for the local channel of arnon for quick sales and my account user and passwords were changed i got hold of ccp who closed my account to stop further damage tho the damage was already done last thing ccp said was that my account has been moved to a team that can deal with it well i have not heard a thing about it since so i did some resurch and it seem this happens alot and worse ccp dont give you back the full ammount of what you lost in isk mod or itemsfrom what i can tell i lost 190ships 2000 items and about 5070bil total in assets and isk now if this happened to you would u be edtaken me 4 years to get that collection and i want it back there is just no point playing other wise im not going to spend another 4 years doing the same thing to have it all removed again so some thing has to be donei didnt goto any dodgy web sites never gave out my passwords or username to any one never even hinted at itif this has happened to you i would like to know what ccp response was to your losehopfuly be playing again soon with every thing backhere is a link to some of the victims and what seemed to have happened
until last summer we experienced regular issues with mass hacking a couple of times a year usually around christmas and then again in the middle of summer nowadays this is pretty much constant with hundreds of accounts being targeted every day many of those are old trial accounts or accounts that have been disabled for years and dont hold anything of value to the rmt types unfortunately there are still a lot of accounts that do have assets and isk that end up being cleaned out  even the characters themselves being sold off the damages are sadly not repairable in some cases
this is one of those things that doesnt even need discussion its as simple as thisrace   method of damage aka how it kills schittamarr laserscaldari missilesgallente d r o n e sminmatar projectile weapons

welp i goofed i have to stand against removing high ends from c4s because that makes no logical sensei dont think the csm is carrying this charge soundwave is convinced theres too much love in eve atm and hes right the agenda as far as i can tell is to appropriately disperse some resources to generate more compeition conflict and playerdriven gameplay nullsec is taking its lumps too so i really cant imagine youd think whs are being targeted and nobody else i think the lucky hulk pilot is a stupid example sorry mittens a more apt description of the problem is permanent residents in these lowclass whs reaping nullsec level benefits when the mass limit of the inrouts dont allow for an equal capitalheavy response you could argue the dangerous nature of operating there outweighs this safty for your pos but i think thats grabbing at straws tbh ive seen wh corps build multipul carriers in a c1 just to  show off and basically make an offensive of their little nugget an impossible task for all but the most determined foe with many many days to kill it just doesnt make sense to allow for that when the other resources present are already great incomeas i said its not so much a matter of being safe in space as it is being relatively hard to remove completely from said space i think low class wormholes have a lot to offer aside from the high end ore i really dont see their removal as a line in the sand worth fussing about
my personal position in the matter of wh and abc is that removal from c1s and c2s would probably only affect their target audience of daytrippers and those who are abusing the limitations so im really not opposed there but between my alts and myself i have and will again live in a c3 as a small group i do not see c3s as a place where abc needs removed and would rather see the entrances reconfigured not to spawn in highsec than discourage longterm dwellers in c34sthat being said the bulk of my discontent with the csm opinions is the idea of essentially nerfing non 00 play to make 00 more attractive whs are one example of this additionally there was talk of nerfing highsec industry or making certain universal parts of industry nullsec only activities im not a wh only advocate i am however against ccp or the csm making everyone outside of 00 miserable to make null seem more attractive by comparison instead of fixing itnull has significant isk earning opportunities that no other area in the game has even after the nerfs 00 is still in my opinion undervalued and underutilized with a few good changes it could be great while leaving the rest of the game intactas far as soundwave goes hes fighting human nature no game mechanic in the world can beat that
you lost me therefirst i live in npc 00 with good truesec most of the time null has great opportunities to be exploited sure but you live under the gun for it i am sometimes cut off from my farming areas for days or weeks because of sov warfare and i dont even take part in it my experience in wspace was similar except for the unique feature that i rarely had to batton down the hatches for half as long the worst thing ever to happen to me in my c2 wh was when a small gang of wh roamers reenforced my pos and forced me to invite one of my mates to help me drive them off while i pos gunned they quickly dispersed after finding out my pos wouldnt simply kickoff at their leisuremy simple point is this i think the risk and reward mantra is what they want to project here i dont see a huge armageddon coming on because high ends cease to be in c13 wormholes although ill repeat they do belong in c4s per my judgement take it for what thats worth or because ice leaves highsec assuming the worst case scenario where nullsechigh class wspace becomes the bottleneck for all industrial ventures in eve we will just see even more vigorous attempts to colonize these areas and replenish the starved marketplace which will undoubtedly be in high demand for the materials in question
to op vote in this thread and dont include any null sec votes some nice work is being done if csm goes against hard numbers ccp can always dismiss their direction as detrimental to the company null csms will represent their voters but here is a chance to let csm evolve
super posthi i live in highsec too i only play for icarna can we attach our fingers to each others butts in the future
but dude your lips are so real they belong in null sec
the statistic that 80 of players are in hisec is provided by ccp so presumably has some basis personally i would expect the numbers are skewed not only by hisec alts of 00 players but also hisec based daytrippers into lowsec or nulsec and scout alts of hisec based players while there may be uncertainty in the exact fraction of players who a based in hisec i dont think there is any doubt they constitute the vast majority of the player basei want to see more attention paid to hisec not to make hisec players richer but to make the game more interesting for themive been playing the game over 3 years now recently ive noticed that many of the players i grew up with in eve ie who were newbs at the same time are leaving playing less or giving up their second account talking to them they say that theyve been getting tired of the game these are guys who have been around for a while have been in 00 roams or ratting setup wormhole ops etc but remained based in hisec and spent most of their time missionruning or mining the issue seems to be that once youve mastered l4s they become stale pretty fast and if you are not going to move to 00 because you are a casual playerhave rl commitments or it doesnt suit your play style then there isnt all that much else to do incursions are a good recent addition to the universeproviding more interesting hisec gameplay will benefit many players and should benefit ccp by giving them better player retention im not wanting to see hisec boosted to the disadvantage of nulsec just for a fair portion of ccps development effort going to enhance the game for the silent majority
was just reading the assembly hall where the csm chairman has confirmed he only represents the interests of his constituents presumably goonswarm and has been generally bad mouthing those with a differnt playstyle
no the chairman is supposed to direct the meeting they have an extremely heavy hand in which topics meetings actually discuss they also shape the flow and they are free to shape it for their own ends i wouldnt say they are to represent all the people that would be impossiblethe csms were elected on their platforms imo they should try to stick to their platforms if they want to represent the people that voted them in with mittens in charge goonswarm will play ccp from both endswhat ccp doesnt see is that influences like goonswarm create a unique player base adapted to respond rather than create think of how new players perceive this just how evil and dark is the average science fiction buff the loud noises are the vocal minority a few babies bawling in a restaurant full of peopple ruin it for everybodyim convinced null sec is filled with spoiled rich bawling children that are used to getting their way by throwing tantrumsturn it all into high sec
i beg to differ according to the ccp document defining the function of the csm it is to address issues in the context of the greatest good for the greater player base the various statements made my csm members would suggest that their objective is infact the opposite of their job descriptionsee page 2 of the linked document under scope of csm
the current csm doesnt care about the foundation of the csm because that would make them look at the boring stuff and we already read that this isnt really what they want to dopersonal projects have a higher priority and the high sec playerbase is to blame for this high sec has enough players in it which arent null sec alts to blockvote in atleast 2 or 3 csm members and even blockvote the chairmanwomanyet the lack of interrest in bothering to set up a propper campaign cohersion and the ability to be vocal when it matters is what turned the whole csm into a null sec promdanceeven if we would get some good high sec candidates the high sec population would be too lazy or unfocussed to vote because its so much easier to complain afterwards be it on the forums or in their corpchatsalso getting a few serious candidates without bickering between eachother is a harder task than meets the eyea pure high sec player would also not be the ideal representative he or she should atleast have some experience in lownull sec to have a somewhat more balanced vieuw
we control your game now
from readings of the last emergency meeting from the csm it is clear they did talked for the player base and i dont know how you can rant about their work for us
what exactly is not correct with cq the devs said at first with cq we would not do much more then walk around the captain quarters and that is what cq has been released i am shure there is much more exciting features to be released in the future that will make us forget incarna limitationsas of lag its pretty amazing to consider that eve server is in the top 500 servers in the world and this for a video game every patch ccp works on lag issues but devs have also suggested to players to add ram to their machines to reduce client side lag so complaining about lag when you have a pentium 3 with 2 gigs of rams doesent make any sense
i think the point is cq should have been left out of this expansion and introduced with the whole station walking thang when ready cq is utterly pointless as you cant do anything of worth atm so while you are correct in saying cq is as cq was promised do you honestly believe it was worth releasing in its severely limited state then theres the fact that cq retrds just about everything that was so easy in the hangeras for lag not everyone is going to have the land required to keep 2 gigs of rams let alone the sheep dogs needed to keep them under control i did love eve for 2 years but the  cheated on me so i dumped her 11pm tomorrow my last account expires and im not going to miss it one bit whats happening now is naff and whats likely to happen is even worse have fun

planetary genocide31429687577798299109123as for the orca thingnumber 80 you can still have the orca pilot eject the ship from the bay have the aggressor switch ships literally in space and then the orca scoops the other ship which makes options 1 and 2 unviable for this sort of thingalso i dont support that one anyways because it means ninja salvagers will get less fun kills to read about on blogs and because ive stolen a couple ships by having an aggressed carebear switch with the shuttle in my orca
oh my i hope ccp have written the list of why things are as they should on a notepad somewhere safe because listening to this could really mess the game up too many examples to note them in this reply even stuff i like i dont wanna see them like this

normally i would give my vote to fw issues as well but there are so many now and so many duplicates and ccp cares so little apparently it is futile to vote on them the csm should do some cleanup and merge themwhere is the boost gallente issue having to lose positive points to downvote issues is an idiotic mechanism

no mention of bringing back some means of viewing pilot standings either through the show info window a button in the standings tab marked show all for example and my personal preference or through other means a new agent service for example though that doesnt help 00 residentsnor of the silly placement of the capsule in the minmatar cq meaning that youre naked and disoriented in front of the entire hangar above a very large drop

i dont think so you can raise this in ah but likely it would be rejected due to the cost of all the database accesses required to display that info however as a manual get damage report option it might have a chancecrowdsourcing provides input to ccp that is helpful in adjusting priorities if you look at the most popular items in previous crowdsourcings youll see that more than a few ended up getting implemented  in particular smaller items that are easy to fit into scheduleswe tried to trim the list and caught a lot of these but there are always going to be some mistakes if you find one email me at treborcsmanimeigocom with an explanation of why you think the item should not be on the list and ill update the wikii plan to do a recategorization of the csm wiki entries in the fallhey it means your votes count for more what do you think of the idea of selling extra votes for aurum btw i solicited for help doing a filtering pass i guess you missed it it was stickied we eliminated 2030 items from the listi can combine items after the votes are in so if you have suggestions for items that should be combined or general categories of related items like ui balancing etc then contact me

it seems some of the issues have duplicates the destructible outposts for example some of them are just subissues of another larger issues made separate contract api is separate and is included in contract overhaul issue as well or something still keep up the good work trebor nb to some people put a comma right after your character name in your ballot not any other punctuation or just space you should just write commaseparated values your nick comma number one comma number two etc make others job easier please
tek handle328466874141145
it was rejected becouse the issue is so big that any specific advise about a fix would not be helpful and a succesful fix would require a lot of workcsm instead of voteing for a specific fix pushed for a ship balance team dev and once the larger issue supercaps gets fixed he will work on hybrids soon after

holy hell yes blops have so much promise to be such an awesome fun toy to use in game but theyre currently sooooo limited sooooo overpriced and soooooo underpoweredfor example the widow vs the scorpion hasless structureless shieldsless armorless targeting rangeless rig slotsless pgno turret hards 4more thermal resist 10moresmaller sigbetter scan res12 more ms1 more high used for cloak10 more cpu used for cloak1 more launcher hardits just not a good tradeoff for the money scorpion is roughly 50m maybe 70m fitted widow is nearly a billion fittedso for the price of a dozen scorpions i can have a scorpion that has some awesome nifty abilitiesbut it fundamentally less good than the scorpion no thank you
this point may have been raised already any buff or review should seriously consider the fact that it takes considerable time training skills up to be an effective blops pilot yet the class is largely something of a gimmick or novelty due to its ineffectiveness unless blobbing with them or used as a poor mans titan
here is the thing folks if you dont want to get gankeddont put your haulershulks right next to low sec space i guess what people fail to remember about eve is that the ruthless and most clever are always the ones who come out on top this isnt world of warcraft there are no safe zones if someone war decs your corp are you going to come on here and cry about that two or just sit docked up for a week  as for ship insurancewhy wouldnt it pay out  insurance should be through a private company in no way based on concord the guy that said carebears are ruining eve is right damn straight they are every time i watch ccp give way to more and more of their stupid requests i say goodbye to a little more of what eve was why not just make eve all high security space maybe then the qq will stop
this makes perfect sense and should be implemented exactly as the op statessupported
supported
trial accounts should only remain open for 6 months if even that they are only trials and thus were free ccp has always reserved the right to remove any accounts that are inactive though has never done this1 for trial accounts onlypaid accounts should never be deleted except in the case of a banned account if an account is permanently banned it should be deleted and wiped as it is only taking up space and names as well as potentially causing harm to the game  such as holding shares in a corporation now uselessfree up names and free up spacesounds good to me
supportin dis because i had a trial 7 years ago that i forgot the username to and so had to use my char name with 2 at the end like some useless mouth breathing gotitd be even greater if i was somehow allowed to delete the 2 of my character name afterwards
why not use the mines from the old tie fighterxwing games if youre not familiar with them they are essentially sentry drones with proximity activation in a mass field they can be dangerous but one by itself is just a nuisance it made it possible to pick off the mines one at a time with some good aim and standoff piloting plug in a new mine skill using the sentry drone skill tree geared to max number anchored and an anchoring distance skill tied to it and anchoring the maxed skills would allow you to anchor bubbles close but not overlapping minefields add in a minimum distance from celestialsanchored objects and each other just a thought
the most fitting fix then would be to put back the drone buff once ccp gets servers that can handle it
thank you everyone who took the time to elaborate the details of the nerfs they all seem to be innocent by themselves addressing different issues but as a whole they affected gallente most but they all seem to affect fleet pvp exclusively i would support then some selective buffs to a couple of ships to make them fill some holes in a fleet composition but not a broad based racial wide buff  unless its the aforementioned drone one  his is because i am comfortable with an imbalance in the sense that some races are better at fleet battles  or any other single aspect of eve  than others so long as they enjoy an advantage elsewhere in the game for example solo pve or pirate ships i dont know if factional war is such an example but the fact that gallente leads fw scoreboards may indicate something there or maybe not
you may well be right but all i am saying is that as long as its good at something unique then its a difference that adds character to the game perhaps if uboat strategy comes into demand the proteuses will be called for  im speaking generally i dont think that each  for instance  t3 ship should be equal to others in terms of functionality or effectiveness for something specific like dps or ehp if that were the case then we can argue about why matari frieghters are the weakest and how everyone prefers gallente iterons as long as gallente ships give something unique then its okay just because their abilities dont make them too useful at the moment in fleets isnt a good reason to make some largescale buff that may cause other imbalances elsewhere that being said buffing the speed of some fleet geared gallente ships or boost their drones some how would be acceptable
do it
 yes
110 supportive had countless converstaions with others on this subject gallente ships are obsolete as it currently stands they require armor tanks which makes them significantly slower than other races except amarr while requireing extreme closer range in order to be effective it doesnt seem to make sense by the time you get in range youre already into half armorsuppooorrttttt

it doesnt bother me but if it bothers some of yall then supported
supported id also like the wallet sum to display in those bigger numbers and their old position
that is actually a good pointthere were already two sources of mt in eve prior to the aurum store1 plex2 character bazaarboth impact the game about as much as allowing characters in accounts less than 1 year old buy the accelerator implant
taken individually sure but if you add skill acceleration then you make a explosive disruption in the game more than any one of these individually can makeyou institutionalize character farming and make it very easyalso those other 2 means have legitamate uses allowing people to play for free or sell their subscription time and splitting accounts respectively sp cheatings only use is to get ahead of others for mt
well beg to differ on that when you buy a char from the bazaar you are buying the sp not the toon people dont go looking to buy a char cause of the name or race etc they buy it cause it has the sp they want to fly the ships and mods they want yes someone has done the time in training on it but the person bought it cause they didnt want to do the training no matter where the sp came from they are buying sp so if ccp does ever do this service in any form just is an extension to what already exists just would be another way for anyone to get the sp whether they use just isk or buy plexes to achieve it this way just opens up more ways of getting to your goal
problemsince the keyboard shortcut revamp the ctrl keys behaviour has been atrocious not even simply unintuitive it is working its damnedest against the player there were several bugs  fixes to it which made me believe it was going to be fixed back to how it was before the shortcut updates but its evident now that the current functionality is intendedthe old behaviour for the control key was as a modifier for other actions for example ctrl  lmb on the overview or a bracket would lock that target this is how the key is normally used by 99 of software and is how people expect it to behavectrl on its own would freeze up the overview so target selection was easier on a busy grid where the overview could jump about as new targets appear  come into range etc this was intuitive and practical in its behaviourthe new behaviour is a disaster yes ctrl  lmb still will target a ship you select but now ctrl on its own will target whatever bracket or overview target has focus this is causing problems for a lot of people furthermore there are many other keyboard shortcuts that rely on hitting ctrl and another key with the current behaviour theres a very good chance you will end up not only activating the shortcut you wanted but also targetting a stargate or random shipwhy is it a problemaside from the fact it is frustrating in a combat or even in a pve environment this works against you and can even lead to you getting killed targeting a stargate or nonhostile by mistake is undesirable not only because you are wasting one of your target slots you could shoot at the wrong thing even simply yellowboxing the wrong hostile ship in a fleet situation can lead to you getting primaried yes mistakes happen and you can easily do this yourself accidentally but to have the games keyboard shortcuts working directly against you is simply poor interface designthis is unacceptable and needs to be revertedfurthermore the alt key as default for look at interferes with anyone that runs several client or even wishes to alt tab to a browser window from time to time fortunately this can be disabled simply enough but it is another example of the poor improvements that were madein closing i propose the ctrl key is reverted to its former functionality where on its own it would freeze the overview and ctrl  left mouse click was needed in order to actually lock a targetthank you for reading
supportedmaybe they fixed it because it wasnt broken
supported in principle but i do not support the specific backstep to the old functionality as an alternative i propose the followingif the userspecified shortcut is only a modifier key or a combination of modifier keysthen the designated action should only be performed when the left mouse button is clicked on a valid target while the modifier key combination is being held this will be irrespective of wether the background has focus or the overview has focus since the act of leftmouseclicking simultaneously sets the focus anywayfor example the user designates control as toggle lock target overview has focus and something was previously clicked in the overview pressing control or pressing and holding control should do nothing pressing and holding control and then leftmouseclicking something in the overview should lock the targetif the userspecified shortcut includes a nonmodifier keythen the designated action should be performed when the key combination is pressed and released while a target is preselected or when the key combination is pressed and held and then followed by a leftmouseclick on a valid target this should be made to work regardless of whether the background or the overview has focusfor example the user designates a as align to and w as warp to the user emerges from olbra stargatejondik that is the user just jumped from jondik into olbra and is holding gatecloak the user then leftmouseclicks and releases on the bracketinspace for stargateeystur so that stargateeystur is selected and the background has focus the user then presses and releases a this should make the ship align to stargateeystur the user then presses and holds w because w is still being held this is not a complete command and the ship does nothingthe user can then either release w which is a command to warp to stargateeystur or keep holding w and leftmouseclickandrelease in the overview on the row for stargatealtrinur which is a command to warp to stargatealtrinur obviously this will take time since the ship wasnt aligned to stargatealtrinur
kinda hard to follow sd but the warp to on release sets off a lot of bells and whistlespressing a key should activate a function releasing a key should cease a function so as to stay consistent you realize if you press your w key to preload a warp and your fc cancels warp that your kinda in a pickle when you release that key something is going to happen this idea might work real nice on your personal programmed keyboard dont think its good for the masses thoughbig fan of kiss things should be no more complicated than they need to be i think ui team tried to add some slick functionality like you described but its better for inteligent keyboards and such we need intuitive response on the ui before programable even with programmable keyboards functions are difficult to sort and standardizesomething should be done though ive read a few of these threads and still find myself flying in odd direction not targeting who i want as ls mentioned im generally flailing like a noob once something worked that was slick probably worked as intended just as your warp on release key could be nice for certainrevert would be better than nothing ccp documentation would be nice too does any exist anywhere
that or at least make it not activate with other things at the same timekeyup  keydown mmk
confirming targeting is bull atmalso when multiboxing clients do some totally weird stuff while switching windows totally wrong windows are opening etc imagine when you have map loading in middle of fight
thats because when you alttab it does a look at because of the keyupdown issue 
i shouldnt have to support this thread its a goddamn disaster this new feature even exist but supported
supported i dont like targeting friendly carriers
supported i dont like targeting sleeper structures
i dont like targeting wormholes by accident either
i dont like living in fear of pressing the ctrl key to freeze my overview
the functionality should be split between two keys and you should be able to map them both to the same key should you choose
in fact you should be able to map as many functions to a single key as you want
supported sort this out ffs

suppored if i shoot one more freaking gate instead of the target bc of the dam ctrl key acting reatarded im gonna emo rage quit fix your stupid mistakes ccp

yes
nothing else is indestructible in this game makes no sense this is thats gamebreaking by default
problemsthe only way to activate a ship after incarna is to use dropdown menus which are horrible even for late 90s previously a player could drag and drop the ship in empty space while docked in station and that ship would become active draganddrop was eliminated making the only available option the dropdown menuadditionally a player could previously doubleclick on empty space in station to open the cargo hold of an active ship without opening the ships window thats no longer possible so the only way to open the cargo hold is to open the ships window and then doubleclick the active ship there should be equally accessible options to open the cargo hold both with interface and keyboard shourtcutssolution make a new division on station panel that will hold the active ship double clicking the ship icon there will open its cargo hold draganddrop a ship into that area to activate itvisual representation
hows the csm doing these days im sure hammering out the mt and nexum stuff is their most pressing concerns at the moment

i noticed that a topic that continually is spoken about in the forums is missing line of sight los may seem as a minor game mechanic that has the potential of really screwing with lag but there are so many ways to overcome the cpu load that i plead with you to pass it along to the development guys at ccp i dont claim to have looked at the over 2000 los comments on the forums but i have looked for any responses from devs on this issue i havent found any that doesnt mean there havent been any im just saying i and quite a few others would simply like to know if true tactics that are derived from this concept will ever be implemented its simply a natural human expectation that i cant shoot at something if there is a wall roid titan station between me and iteve is realmake it so
lol yes tears only thing that bothers me is the amount of carebear wow players crying about people want to shoot theives
whater ever happened to the idea of viceroyalty mentioned in the on the drawingboardsectionfor those who dont remember here is a brief recapviceroyaltyviceroyalties are systems in low security empire space which are administered by a player viceroy on behalf of their corporation or alliance they will allow you to both turn a better profit and defend your chosen system from pirates and act as both a way to populate lowsec space and an easier first step on the road to 00something that will change lowsecwould like to see this idea revisited
how about changing the procurer to be a gas specific shipi mean how many people fly a procurer when a retriever is only 17 hours away
bumping for the love of pirates and everything we dont stand for p
for the geniusses out therelow sec is still empire spaceif you are a pirate with 50 or less sec rating then assisting you in empire space is considered assisting a wanted criminal and as such you get flagged as a criminal aswelso not supporting this because the same people that got to that low sec rating are the same people that tell their victims that eve is a game of consequences
nothing wrong with them  theyre fine
anything anyone in eve has that offers a permanent advantage that is not available to other players no matter how small the advantage no matter how hard they work for it is wrong and bad for the game
signed the sentiment for keeping them in is ungodly pure and simpleif there werent any tech ii bpos maybe invention would become more interesting and profitable
the nerf bat hits ships drones modules ammo etc for game balancing all the timethink of how many hours you trained for a ship for it get nerfedits time for the nerf bat to hit the t2 bpos for market balancingccp has already said that invention is working as intendedt2 bpos provide a unfair advantagesigned
i propose that anything i dont own and cant be bothered to acquire for myself be removed from the game or massively reduced in value
just remove all of them  with 0 compensationthe owners already got rich due to this imbalanced featurebtw most of them got it free in the first place due to stupid lottery
yes because i dont have any
just another unknowing playermost t2 bpo owners now spend billions of isk to get their bpo most bpos were sold to new parties and only a rare few are in the hands of those who won them in the lotteryso those new bpo owners did the math to find out their break even point and found out that after 4 to 5 years they were going to see a return and started to plan that long aheadother new owners saw the tendency of t2 bpos rising in value and bought some in the hope that in later years they could turn a profit selling them again and in the meantime maybe sell off some bpcs copies of themnow lets see what elese needs to be removed then in this gamelets remove the last state ravens from the game because they have just more dps than a navy raven or even a golemsame for other rare ships obtained in some contest which prevented people who werent in an alliance to participatehow dare ccp force people into alliances to participate in such an event and make me pay lots of isk to get one of those ships afterwards that is if there are some going to be soldits always the same people see something they cant have or atleast cant have for a long long time and instead of looking to the whole picture just want that thing removed that darn sore spot that seems soo unobtainable well not really unobtainable but heck i am too lazy to try to get one and find out afterwards it takes ages to actually make a profit from them
not supportedyou have the chance to buy t2 bpos the same as everyone elseplus with invention there is absolutely no need for this change
no soon you will be ably to buy one for aurum not supported
agreed
no and this seals it op has no clueif you want free mindlink go do missions few hundred mil for mindlink should be next to nothing for a guy who can use it
1 post with your main its hard to take a five month old character seriously on this subject when you have 0 kills and are young enough that you could not even have the ability to use all five of the mind links your corp has a total of 1 kill you were not on ill also go out on a limb here and say that if you are a corp that only recruits finns that play minmatar with no sp requirements you probably have not had a lot of help learning about this game from corp mates though it could just be it could be there from before you joined and you left it2 i admitted to not knowing exactly and not being able to forum warrior properly or it would take me days i do now know that the nanite control book spawns from two sites one which is cosmos area based and another which can show up at random in low or 00 and even with me being wrong on the location that does not detract from the fact that except for the one bug which was quickly fixed allowed a level 1 mission to drop them for a while they have never had their availability changed3 nighthawk and damnation which are arguably the two most used cs ships in the game only cost about 200 million and 180 million respectively the implant to get it to do its job properly should not cost as much as a capital mod4 the links were excellent when they were cheap you could swap them out quickly if you need to jump from one cs to another if you were going from say an armor fleet to shield fleet and maybe be out 510 mil if you were in a bad spot marketwise with current prices you are either buying a new cs in implants every 4 swaps or you are telling your fleets that they have to wait 24 hours whenever they change tactics and need a different csim pretty sure i do have a clue
4 i think you pretty much figured it out now links are good and ppl keep switching them like monkeys so obviously price goes up since they still can afford them
thanks for responding with your mainthe price didnt go up though because people are switching them people have switched them for ages and if that was the case the price would have at least risen well before incursion it forces the assumption that either the price went up solely because ccp decided to add missions in and diluted the availability to the point the price rose 10 times from what it was or suddenly at the same time the missions were added the amount of mind links received per day stayed the same but the amount of people using them went up tenfold i do admit people fly around in cs ships more now but for solo work there are things much better you could use slot ten for then a mindlink those are the extremes of the possibilities and the answer most likely lies somewhere in the middlei will give you that ccp may have done it so more people have to fly cs instead of just one person being good at all of them but usually when they make a change that drastic to fleet tactics you hear of it from them in some blog that generates a threadnaught as far as i can tell the only thing ccp ever said on it was that they were adding the missions
id like to see more storylines hand out mindlinks alternatively they need to be made available in the lp stores for a modest fee 10k lp 10m isk maybe

problem two missions in the soe epic arcchasing shadows and our man dagan require new players to face relatively difficult npcs and retrieve a mission item from the wrecks since many new players lack the skills fitting and experience to deal with these npcs alone it is common for them to seek assistance in local other players offer assistance and in turn steal the required mission item the mission will not reset since the target npc has been destroyed please correct and mock me if it in fact does resetnote that there is little potential for profit from the majority of players requesting help in killing these npcs furthermore the penalty for being unable to complete the mission is higher than say having your damsel in distress stolen and involves a massive loss in potential standings gain significant for a new player isk and a 3month wait to attempt the arc again experienced players rarely if ever require help or fall victim to this trap while some may view it as valuable to introduce players to the mechanic of mission item theft i submit that there are better places times and mechanisms with which to do itsolution redesign chasing shadows and our man dagan to not require the retrieval of a mission item the subsequent mission requiring the delivery of dagans corpse should grant the mission item with a slight flavor text rewrite to say that his corpse was retrieved by others nothing else need be changedprosimproves new player experience increases player retentioneliminates small source of petitions decreasing gm workloadencourages players to get their first taste of fleetingbenefits an overwhelming percentage of new players both those that would have been victims and the rest that get to enjoy an improved soe experience for a small amount of resourcesconsone step closer to instanced missionsexpends small amount of resources on a very specific part of the gamenerfs sheroo griefing bootldrstealing kritsandagan corpses is pretty profitless and hurts the new player experience make those two missions not require an item to be collected

1 eve isnt a walk in the park its a walk in a warzone
even players who dont ask for help have to deal with being scanned down and having the mission invaded fair enough and normal enough for eve but the missions always spawn in sister alituras system mission crashers just camp the system at the very least mission crashers should have to travel a bit for their kills so the simple solution is to have those missions spawn randomly like a normal mission
1 bad idea tbh people already afk run plexes with disposaalts i also think its the wrong approach to deting plexing2 people mostly use fw missions as a way to grind isk on altsto be honest id rather see a total rethink of this to make system capture more of a pew pew thing3 i am torn has some merit but not with system capture as it is id have dug it if nisuwa station turned into a gallente outpost with gallente sentries etc however not if it did so because a bunch of jobless ers plexed the system while i was at work4 more factions is sort of interesting
back when the initial call went out this year for things for csm 6 to discuss with ccp i made a thread about the alliance logo process and how it was flawed and should be fixed here we stand today with the july 2011 crowdsourcing thread up and yet there isnt even an option to vote for a fix which interestingly was on the ballot for the last two and has been suspiciously removed from this one i decided to bring this up in a new thread instead of the crowdsourcing thread because i felt it may spark a discussion and that is not what that thread is forccp and csm please fix the alliance logo process to allow the players more freedom in thier logo choices incarna and future expansions are all about the social aspect of eve and yet hundreds if not thousands of alliances have exactly the same logo because the current process is too flawed evegate and walking in stations is all about players interacting with each other in new and interesting ways and yet many alliances have the same default logo for one reason or another and are unable to differentiate themselves by creating a brand image so to speak around thier logothis has been an issue brought up since csm 3 each of the csms 3 4 and 5 have voted unanimously for ccp to fix this issue and yet the only change was to make the community approve logos before ccp denies them the same way they did before at least thats the only change i can see and alliances still wait extended periods of time before thier logo is implemented some as long as two years im sure many an alliance has disbanded before thier logo was approvedalliance directors should be able to add thier own logos to thier alliance and it should follow the standard set by corp and player bios where you can report the logo as inappropriate at which point ccp reviews and removes those logos possibly with a graduated punishment system to prevent people from uploading the same logo againat least give this issue a chance and discuss it it may not seem important to those alliances whose logos are already in the game but the rest of us would like the process to work better so we can add our own logo
mistake post fail
problem eve pve content is boring repetitive scripted and nonfunfix add more types of missions with more varied or unpredictable playspecifically missions not tied to a specific location in game with longerterm duration current missions allow a pilot to take a mission complete it turn it in and collect a reward all within the span of a few minutes or hoursi think it would add a new and fun element to the game to allow missions that spanned days or even weeks in duration but operated differently than current mission typesinstead of having a set location that the player warps to one time completes and is then done with have a mission with a nonlocational basis the mission would spawn objectives or enemies over time wherever the player went and the player would simply rack up points on the mission as he went eventually turning in the mission for a reward when a certain quota was reachedfor example the player could receive notices of plexlike spawns in his system or nearby systems within a couple jumps or the player could have small spawns spawn on grid with him at random intervalsadditionally it could be fun to have chase portions of missions where the player would need to kill a particular spawn which would warp away from them and need to actually be tackled perhaps going as far as jumping to other systems or spawning reinforcements to help it escape

proposal corprate wallet accounting managementthe multiwallet divisions for the corporate wall are all well and good however could use some upgrades to make them more corporatly functional1 have management system so that player taxes for bounties and mission rewards can be assigned to a the players assigned corporate wallet division b fixed corporate wallet divsion for all staff2 automatic funds transfer wallet to walletallow for the setup of automatic funds transfer from one wallet division to another division based on preset dollar figure or based on a  of another accounts funds example new recruit is assigned to wallet division 5 if the funds in wallet division 5 exceed 10 million transfer any access to wallet division 4 etc etcprosthe account management function would allow for easier management of finances for all players existing corps would be able to assign new members to a lower financed walled which would allow them to manage trial periods for any corporate members allowing them access to the corporate funds including those directly earned by that player without accessing all of the corporate monies or manual management

unified with another idea can be deleted
well since you ask i actually have an athlon 64 dual core with 4 gb rami was speaking from a personal perspective when i said things had changed when i first started playing eve i had about the same experience as everyone else as far as performance went since then i have upgraded my main box to the spec above but like a lot of other applications the devs seem to have been more interested in adding new features and thus expanding the code base rather than optimising performance now im more or less forced to run the graphics on my machine at minimum levels of detail just so the game stays playable i know that this is partly my fault for running under linux and that there are things i can do to increase performance but money is tight just now and i would have expected that with the setup i do have things should be better than they are for me cq is unusable as it runs so slowly as i say that is partly due to the decision i made regarding choice of os but to insist on everyone using it is unfortunate i would like to have the choice to go back to ship spinning something i hear may be reintroduced so that may in time solve that problem the other thing is to me the perceived lag in the client stations jump gates and distance updates etcseem to be very slow and sometimes do not appear at all now i know that this may be due to my setup andor the pathetic broadband i have but i can only speak about what i see that is not to say that things have not changed for the better they most defintely have the playing experience is richer has a better introduction to the game there are more things to do and explore and so on all in all a game i would be loath to stop playing but just because things are mostly going in the right direction does not mean to say that you should not speak out when you think things could be improved after all thats why mass tests are run from time to time but having the full user base looking at things should always bring to light areas of the game that could usefully be tweaked

problem will be the minefields themselves think about it you can literally spam a gate with 1000s of mines if you have like 100 minelaying hulls well actually you will drop like 10000s of mines if it can be done this will cause 2 big problems1 with suggested damage amount for example half a damage of bomb it is like 50 bombs triggered to explode that  is extremelly powerful if you give them a very long aoe range like if its 30km youll literally dd the gate and all who enter i can see 2 possible solutions though a if their trigger range is like 30km first ship decloacks should ignite the full minefield and only the first uncloaked ship should take the damage it will be like that as others are not moved and gate cloaked at that moment b or mines should only explode if there is a ship in 1km proximity of themselves with a blast radius of 1km so 1 ship can try to dodge minefield or at least not dded in the instant it jumped to system and also it will some how pain the jumping in fleet but not dd everything at an instant ruining the game for attackers2nd problem is the great lag it will generate as you know u cant spam containers around a gate to create lag as it is a known exploit think about it any sizeable alliance can spam 1000 maybe more mines around gate well even it is on the grid it should work lagwise it will definitively give the processor something to calculate as proximity and damage wisein conclusion if you want minefields they should created like that you cant mass them in an area maybe to cover a gate you can put down 10 of them at most a minefield may and should hold of a lone or very small enemy gang but it shouldnt be the new titan with aoe damage it wasnt fun at all if you want system defense another good idea is paying bills for gate sentry guns and even faction npc guards they will create some defense  isk sink which is much needed anywayand to add the insult of minefields they shouldnt generate kill mails so ppl shouldnt randomly minefield every gate in 00 to get afk mails for one i will lay fields every fing gate as long as it will generate kms p
thus my tie fighter mine idea theyre just like sentry drones they fire lasers projectiles missiles there is no aoe or bomblike effect large numbers could be devestating to a single ship which is the point but a well tanked group could survive in tie fighter the real game mechanic point of the mine fields was to eat into your tank a bit and soften you up
i guess i didnt describe this properly the minefield would be an anchorable module much like the mobile warp disruption bubbles they would also have an ammo bay with a limited number of mines these are not launched into space they just vanish from the ammo bay as the minefield damages a target they are aoe only within the minefield and effect everyone friend or foe the module can be targeted and destroyed just like bubbles the minefields come in three sizes small medium and large just like the mobile warp disruption bubbles each minefield would have three settings dense fielduses half of the onboard ammo 50 you get a max of two attacks normal fielduses one fifth of the onboard ammo 20 you get a max of five attackssmall fielduses one tenth of the onboard ammo 10 you get a max of ten attacksthese would not be a new dd they would just make certain routes more secure yes you could close off an entire system mine every gate but youd be unable to leave as for the spamming around a gate they cant be within reaction range of each other as that would set off the other fieldfields there are limits to their effectiveness damage reduction as with bombs and limited number of uses and should be comparable to bomb mineral regs for each mine and mwdb for the fields i dont remember do smartbombs and ecm bursts hit gate cloaked ships i want to say they do but its been a long time since ive run into themi think no killmails for the owner of the minefield would be best as wellas ive said before the lag issues bug me that is why ive tried to stick to only mechanics that are already in game mwdbminefield bombsmines damage stylereconpart 3 its a level 4 mission that im sure most of us have donelet me know if i missed something
sniffle i guess im not part of the discussion theyll never go for aoe mines aoe is just too easy mode
does the person who lays the mines take aggro when it attacksexplodeswhateverin the past the issue of mine aggro was cause for all sorts of drama
yeswhy is this issue not in july 2011 prioritization crowdsourcing list
i support this topic buff hybrids
the only gallente ships i see old players pvping in these days are the ishkur vigilant long point arazu thanatos and the nyx and even then its rare please rebalance the gallente
no on this this would buff caldari as well yes on making some gallente ships better in ways like using rails or speed bonuses or something racially congruent the list of gallente ships used in fleets looks longer than caldari ones not to mention the proteus and myrm are popular ships for wormhole corps i hear so it seems there as uses for gallente ships just not null sec fleets instead of balancing the traditional linear and boring way why not give gallente a bonus related to their advanced automation technology if ships had crew this could be used in a very story congruent way gallente ships need fewer crew minmatar the most etc just an idea in fact ill start a new thread on it
supportedin the same time put the isk amount to the left side where it was used to be all the years back

please read the rest of the thread first as this has already been hashed outits not the same 1 institutionalizing something bad is worse 2 its not the same as the bazaar somebody has paid the time to get the sps and once sold the fruits of that effort moves with the character selling sp is not the same as the time penalty was never paid by anyonei dont do the explanations justice as they werent mine but just read the thread again so that you dont waste anyone elses time
thats correct they cant i only started a year or so ago im having fun you dont need to be able to fly titans to enjoy this game i like the way the skill system statifies players into capabilities based on skill level even a week old noob can find important stuff to do in 00 warfare after several months you should be able to handle anything pve with a group if necessaryyou dont need to buy sp to have fun in this game and thats why we play to have funthe only one thing i would like to see is neural remaps for plex as few as 1 remap per year for a plex would be good enough beyond that no sp buying

nothing overly fancy would be needed just small bit of travel
itt  ton of virgins who struggle to say hi to girlsno way im supporting this i would much rather ccp spend development time on real fixes than some breast mechanic so you nerds can  easier to your avatarsgetainglife
how about a couterproposal ccp gives all the people like you a character remodel so that you dont have to look like a malfuctioning femmbot or a stuck torpedo launcher im sure it was fun playing with your breasts in the character creator but i guess its not so fun anymore after you realized how silly they look in real life
note vote yes if you believe there should be unique rewards for fw vpedit 2 ok so you guys brought up some good points lets narrow the discussion on how plexes themselves can be redesigned to 1 promote pvp through mechanics that reward staying and fighting rather than warping off a stabbed condoratronexecutioner and just running another plex elsewhere 2 how rewards can be implemented along with the above to avoid exploitation 3 meaningful occupancy besides herpa derpa deny docking rightsmissions lets think about something thats outside the box the whole denying docking rightsstation servicesmissions has been beaten with a stick over and over againcurrently there are no rewards for obtaining victory points nor is there a reward beyond the initial standings boost to participate in the fw faction war occupancy war by means of capturing plexes the initial standings boost is not enough to create incentive to create any longterm involvement with fw plexing there should be long term rewards for plexing and participating in fw one way to accomplish this is to offer unique incentives to participate in fw plexing new faction shipsitems should cost enough vp that at least a considerable amount ie those involved in actual occupancy war of effort had to be put forth to obtain such rewards to avoid farming from those not directly involved with fwsome ideas these are just a suggestion for adding new ships for vpnavy ewar cruisers as there are none in gamenavy destroyers as these are not in the game as wellnavy battle cruisers as there are none in gamei dont have any ideas for anything else but the proposal is that there should be unique rewards so they do not affect highsec missioning or normal fw lp storesi know a lot needs changed for fw but this is just one step im sure once ccp gets around to it they will add more than just one small change and will hopefully revamp fw
i definitely think this idea is worthy of discussion and so gave it some supporthowever ccp would need to make plexing involve more pvp i know you dont want to discuss those other changes but that sort of ties our hands in this discussion if plexing were to remain exactly the way it is except you could then buy navy ships for doing them i would not support the topicif they improve plexing making it more pvp then i would be very much in favor of something like this
pretty much what this guy said
why should there be such rewards for plexing in the first place id much rather see militia wide benefits when securing systems than individual payouts which inevitably leads to massive abuse as witnessed with current missionsas for the shipsnavy destroyers are not really needed and would beyond a doubt be a significant hit to afceptorfrig viability revamping existing destroyers to sport the few gunshigh bonus paradigm to cut operational costs would benefit everyone without breaking anything how ever navy ewar cruisers would be awesome they should remove the lowtier navy crap ospreyaurogorexequrorscythe and replace them with these bonuses should remain as is but they should get the standard navy boost navy bcs even if you base them on the tier1 models there is simply not enough room to fit such a thing in below tier1 bsonly way would be to make them not follow the navyboost system ehp slot and performance which makes them much less desirable and thus porbably redundanteither way if vp is ever to be part of the rewards system the access to them has to be heavily revised plexing game is all about who has the most alts or the biggest blob postdt which makes this proposal nonsensical without first tackling the underlying mechanics ie what the others said 
new ships for no other reason than to bandaid the broken fw systemnot supported
ok so as far as plexing mechanics go i think everyone can agree that shooting npcs is not pvp as well as the imbalances between them dismotivate pvp the current king of the hilltype system can be exploited with an army of alts with an after burner fitted frig but on the other side fw plexing offers one thing unique to just about the rest of eve cosmos plexes aside ship size restricted arenas of combat giving opportunities for players of all ages and ship size preferences thier own niche i think this mechanic should be the core of any new plexxingoccupancy system i think we should focus on reducing the available area to fight over at any given point in time to promote pvpthe problem with the current system that is the population density of fw is so low that people capture plexes and more often than not dont see a soul or is too remote for the opposing faction to scout you to return to their base to reship appropiately for the size of plex get back and get some pvp in addition to the issue where even if you do get back often times the other side will blueball you either it be alt or main and will just run a plex elsewhere the solution is to make the available areas for militia to combat eachother for occupancy condensed i do believe hirana and others have suggested fronts the concept that only systems that border eachother of opposing occupancies can be targeted i think the idea is good but with so many fronts as militias push just a little into eachothers sovreign systems that i think the same underlying issue will surface with many people just avoiding pvp and going for occupancy objectives where the opposing side is not since the available systems that can be attacked will increase and massive blueballing will ensue so i think that the available area to be fought over should be condensed even further tweaking to the fronts concept or even random constellation focused typed stuff or whatever else lets discuss how we can condense militia objectives whatever they may become in the future to promote pvp
no one see this as a problem
this has been complained about in the forums i think it was mentioned as to be addressed in a dev blog or in the info that came out of the emergency meeting a bit fuzzy on where i remember reading it though the addition of more clicking than needed especially when there had been less prior to incarna is a problem that needs to be addressed though
supported
i really think we should just accept that csm will not be much help for fw nor should they they do not play fw and didnt run on that platform having them try to do homework to figure out what ccp already knows directly is not a good use of their time fw is very good in several ways1 the missions are an excellent way to do low sec missions it is much better than any player had ever proposed in the past2 the idea of having ship restricted plexes to fight in was a great idea3 the special lp store for fw participants and unique items was a good idea although many of the items are pretty worthless amarr armor plates anyonethe big problem is that the occpancy plexing mechanics is mostly a pve activity  when it was supposed to involve lots of fun small scale pvp understanding why that is is and how to correct it is not as easy as proposals like give blasters better tracking the csm members play in null sec because they like null sec this is fine but their solutions will likely involve making fw more like what they enjoy  null sec this will make eve less diverse people in fw often are not in null sec for a reason moreover asking people what they do in fw isnt really helpful ok people do allot of missions and very little occupancy plexing does that mean ccp should give up occupancy plexing and only work on missions since that is what the players are interested in no the rework of fw will require 1 figuring out what sort of gameplay ccp wants to create  which hopefully will involve ccp wondering what sort of game play is missing from eve as a whole here i would suggest eve is missing a way to find quality small scale pvp quickly2 figure out how they can develop mechanics to promote the gameplay they want to create
thanks for the support so far not a massive issue but id imagine a lot agree that they could look a little bigger
i dont really fly bs but it would make sense to see some big honking guns on them they should look menacing
commenting in the other thread is not really practical so ill just put in here that 124 is already in game and although 32 and 145 are sort of duplicates i voted for both of them
im unable to find anything about railgun or hybrid rebalancing on the list what is the status of this issue in regards to the crowdsourcing
as we all know you lose security standing with concord when you knowingly aggress pirate an innocent player it quickly affects your security status causing you to be unable to enter high security areas id like to propose that ccp give players security standing improvements and bonuses for fighting and killing eves most wanted players not only does it give purpose to pirate hunting but makes it more rewarding and fun this is a winwin for the eve community and something i think could be fairly easily implemented id appreciate the players and the csms support on this issuepurposeto give empire pvpers and lowsec players another way to improve their security status and to promote more pvp in these areasprosencourages more pvp in lowsecimproves players security standings so they dont have to waste time ratting in empirenullsecgives pirate hunters and bounty hunters new lifeconspirates die more often and become afraid to yarr yeah right
add in tradable kill rights and you may have the groundwork for a working bounty hunting system
shooting blinkies doesnt hurt sec status as it is in low sec maybe a sec status boost on a kill that could work
this subject is up for review by the csm
proof oh an 42 posts and no one is supporting it says a lot
well since the csm subjects are points based and the subject doesnt effect many people at all i can understand that
bolded the important part ccp wont make such a drastic change in eve just for a small handful of peoplethe current csm is still discussing things with ccp that that first csm discussed with them cough poses and corp management for example hell everyone is still trying to get ccp to make the font larger as its next to impossible to read on bigger monitors andor higher resolutionswhile i do not support your idea i wish you the best on your endeavor for it
just becasuse it doesnt effect alot of people doesnt mean it doesnt need to change while on the subject when you kill a npc whos loot is it if someone steals the npcs loot you can kill them right
you do have a point with this however i believe the rp backstory behind it is that since npcs have bounties on them which are paid by concord that concord allows you to claim the loot for killing themnow if concord is going to start paying me for every player i kill i can see your point
so if it is sanctioned by concord all is good hmmm interesting
no also if anything rring should cause aggression timers too
if you do lvl5s then you can find this very annoying but it is fair imo if you use pirate to tankdps then you can just ignore the loss of standings with empire faction not like you can go high sec anyway make choice between lose sec status on your alt by remote pirate or lose empire standings on nonpie while use the pirate to rr
please add two topics to crowd sourcing vote173 rebalance gallente hulls174 rebalance hybrid weapons systems
perhaps add each mindlink to the respective lp store for militias that would bring prices down a ton in addition to adding another isk sink
compared to other implants mindlinks are still incredibly cheap relative to the advantage they give they are also cheap compared to the ship classes required to deploy them with full effect fleet command ships or t3sthey used to be cheaper doesnt seem in and of itself to be an adequate argument for making them cheaper
i think the current price is fair apart from them mining one i guess maybe add another couple storyline missions which drop it lvl5s but when you compare mindlinks to hardwires and faction implants you get very good benefit for relatively low isk
kva2000 adds 5 to the shield hp of one ship market price 140 million iskseige warefare mindlink adds 15 to the shield hp of 2256 ships increases the power of seige gang warfare links by 50market price 45 million iskif anything a simple comparison indicates that mindlinks are still considerably underpriced compared to their utility why should a mindlink cost less than 10 per point of bonus given than a standard skill hardwiring

playing the game of eve online as ceo of a mining corporation i have been in need of an improved corporate wallet system that includes greater flexibility and functionality with particular emphasis on divisional wallets and their limited usethe mining corporation and its organizational structure as i have conceptualized it is consisted of multiple mining crews each of which is assigned to one of the six remaining divisions div 2 thru div 7 whereby division 1 serves as the central command or corporate headquartersat each of the division levels in this corporation i have assigned a squad leader whom is typically the orca pilot in each of the separate mining squads or crews as a matter of corporate agenda i have always intended that each squad leader in this corporation be allowed to have full control over and assume full responsibility for his or her entire assigned division within the corporationto this extent i happy to say the organizational structure of this corporation is basically sound and it works out pretty well for us in every aspect but one and that one aspect is the limited functionality of the divisional walletscase in point over the last three months i have been developing a new mining division as outlined above and assigned a corp member to div 7 as its squad leader upon that assignment i deposited 500 mil isk from this corporations master wallet into the divisional wallet belonging to division 7now as things currently stand with the divisional wallets in eve online my appointed squad leader is not allowedpurely by game design or a lack of it to make purchases over the open market directly from the divisional wallet this is in every waya very stark contrast in correlation to how ceos and assigned directors of all corporations in this gameare able to or have been afforded the ability toconduct needed financial operations within ones own corporation however and by whatever means that corporation is comprisedwhen my squad leader opens his divisional wallet he is afforded only four options as a means of financial transaction for his division they are as followsgive money  take isk  transfer isk  change divisionso if my appointed squad leader wishes to purchase needed skill books that is hisher assigned leadership responsibility for the purpose of training present  future squad members also hisher assigned leadership responsibilitythe appointed squad leader must first transfer isks from the divisional wallet into hisher personal wallet before he or she can make a corporate purchase with corporate funds for corporate purposes surely we can incorporate something into the divisional wallet system of conducting corporate business with a little more finesseshall we say
i already answered this in your thread in the features and ideas forumthe person has to go into the corp wallet and then click the change division button and select the division he has the roles for now he can use the corp wallet to buysell

this proposal is to reestablish security status as a working game mechanic againsecurity status of all characters and accounts from the same ip address share the same security status if a player plays at home and at work then the security status will be that of the lowestthis change will squash those who recycle alts for suicide ganking help improve the low sec market and help get more players out of high sec
and make it so if one characters corpalliance gets wardecced all characters can be attacked freelyor in other words no
1i dont want someone else that uses the same isp affecting my eve experience i dont have and cannot get a static ip address and every few days the ip address i get from my isp could changealso until ip6 is common place the sharing of ip addresses by
well what about my dynamic ip also vpns are very cheap you can even get a 3 hour trial at some long enough to gank someone also what happens if i play at a friends house
terrible idea heart is in the right place though mind is elsewhere
need more thumbs up guys
horrible idea
doing anything based on source ip address is stupid come back when u get a clue
clearly the op doesnt understand the meaning of recycle when it comes to an alt in eve it means to recycle the character slot not the character by killing the alt and making a new one to replace it just to clear up the confusion
i use a laptopi have good sec status anyway just sayin my ip isnt fixed
if you are correct this is the part that needs fixing imo it should reset on the next downtime and may already do so in which case the newbie who gets his item stolen is inconvenienced but not totally screwededit on second thought even if the item doesnt respawn it could be obtained on contracts or by pulling the same scam on another player maybe no fix is needed just better informing new players of their options
qft
not supportedmission loot can always be found on contracts and stealing them for resale is a profession for somei didnt do too many mission when i started but i did this one and i didnt find it too hard though it did take me several tries before getting a fit that worked
as the soe epic arc is classified as for new players it is my understanding that you can have the mission reset by petition this means the player gets the item back im sure gms would have a problem with a player petitioning for a reset repeatedly though it would make sense for these missions to be reworked for the sanity of the gms
stop the dockinggames please
1 boosting loyalty points for plexes is a good idea if plexing was done right but its not now the other militia needs to know when they are entered so pvp can take place there2 this goes in the opposite direction of where occupancy needs to go occupancy is already too much of a pve game it needs to be more of a pve game3 bad idea this will just lead to large blobs at the front lines instead of the many pockets of small gangs we get in fw moreover people would just pile on the winning sidenow if you were to say you cant dock in the other militias stations then that isnt so bad so if a system was occupied by amarr then a minmatar militia pilot wouldnt be able to dock in a 24th crusade owned station in that system 4 well i think they need to fix the mechanics first adding factions just gives us more of the same but yeah after they fix the mechanics and fw is truly great and the militias are packed then start adding more factions
i like the idea of restricting docking to enemy militia based on the control of the system but i can see that being problematic code wise as youd need to switch stations from tlf to 24th every time a system changed hands each militia should have a home system which can never be flipped but there should be a large incentive to capture and hold a system
specifically all forum spammers who recently started the we are umbrella group posts from the sheer numbers they are likely bots anyway
the odd thing is they didnt spam much in cp where it would have made the most sense
the topic was removed becouse the process for submiting new logos was revamped and the wiki for the topic was updated as ccp is not going to allow just anyone to submit an alliane logo the rules are very strict about who can even have one while we might soon get custom tatooswhich will be moderated the way you want for al logos becouse they are linked to so many players will always stay very restrictedthe submission back log was getting very long with the new processes that has hopefully been fixed and the format rules are easer to understand while what you want would be good there are a whole lot of other topics that need working on first before logos have another set of changes
soundwave is right the problem is that much of that love is focused on incurions ive run lvl 4s and 5s as a mission runner 4s are solid risk free income ive run sanctums and they are riskier but a bit better income however when i get into a good incursion fleet i make laughably overthetop income that puts all other income faucets in the game to shame no risk no investment in sov or standings just join a fleet with the right people and laugh all the way to the bankccp makes new content then takes the carrotssticks concept of getting people to use them to an extreme older players have seen the trend and follow it to their financial advantage while new players are still scrambling to get in on the income source that by then is so last expansionas to whs the problem with whs has always been the ability to stronghold them not only is it easy to close up incoming whs that can bring risk to your space but you can build up caps to defend the space which would require a long time with concerted effort for an opposing force to build up the fleet needed to take the residents on at this rate whs are going to become more stagnant than null used to be
easily adjusted if they like change the payout its static afterall lp or lp store itself but i agree its over the top atmmalcanis law in action no change can ever benefit newbies more than vets in this gamethat was exactly my point and the reason why i agreed lower class wh space shouldnt have highends its simply too much incentive to entrench in them and thats exactly what weve been seeing it makes perfect sense in a c6 where cap invasions are not just possible but a matter of time but the low class wormholes should be solely given over to transient life subcaps etc there should be no happy corner to hole up in and reap rewards whist garunteeing that you will outgun your opponents due to game mechanics
highsec peons should know their place
hey guys i need some help with wording for a proposal i want to bring up in the assembly hallheres the long version right now when flying in space your camera stays static relative to well space your ship spins and turns beneath you and your camera doesnt move unless you move it this is all well and good but i find myself using a lot of mouse clicks to make my camera face forward relative to my ship because im ocd like that and i like that view it feels more natural to meso id like a simple option that lets me tell my camera drone to stay put relative to my ship and let the rest of the universe twirl away as it will kind of like theuniquemaneuver the shuttle pulls at the very beginning of this
corrected that typo for you
considering they didnt bother to learn a damned thing about wormholes then started calling for their nerfs when they learned their bots didnt have exclusive abc access
the current csm suffors the socalled  carpal tunnel syndrom this narrows their vieuws in just one focussed direction without a broader perspectivenow they have this csm july 2011 prioritization crowdsourcingwhy bother to look where the most people gave their complaints and suggestions and actually do some of the work they were elected forthey just open a poll so people select it for them so all they have to do is look for ways to adapt it in a fashion they have to put in a minimal effort unless it suits their own purposeswe wouldnt want them to do any boring stuff would wethe csm is effectivly avoiding any of the real issues and focussing on their own projects which they can do because their pets blockvoted them inthis csm will never be a csm for all players but a csm for the loudest mouths which in this case are the null sec carebears that want it easiermore incomemore targets  easier targets ofcourse toomore infrastructure because high sec has that so they want that toonerf high sec to death and force people into their arms because they need fresh blood to sustain their outcries for more specially with new elections they will have to blockvote their candidates in again and that only works if you have the people to blockvotei wouldnt be surprised if krutoj holds chair next csm there are enough alliances in 00 now who owe him thanks for their new parkingspaces in venal and surroundings so white noise and raiden will most likely deliver a lot of votes towards that goali am expecting a countermove from the goons to get their mittani in the chair soon enoughthey will already be plotting in that regardcsm is just as much about metagaming as playing in 00
would you look at that it really is possible to talk with your mouth full

bumping for great justice
its trivial to fit a hulk to have 30k ehp more if you can arrange gang bonuses in which case 3 thrashers would have died to concord long before killing his hulk furthermore if they got his pod in hisec then he must have either been afk or he never even tried to warp his pod outconclusion untanked hulk was killed while the pilot was afkyou cant balance game mechanics around people who make no effort whatsoever to protect themselves
i agree to both points hereyou should protect yourself more else you are asking for it but fitting to defend like a tank in hisec shouldnt be the norminsurance should not pay for concorded ships not at least the standard insurer perhaps make a commune pirate insurance fund that is funded and operated by pirate players if you want pirate insurance
so now a measely 30k ehp makes you able to defend yourself against gankers lol if only and so what if they lose a couple of trashers thats the definition of suicide ganking remember and besides a 30k ehp hulk is a very inefficient hulk its not really a viable setup other than used by some posters in their htfu responsesyou can however balance game mechanics around people who are allowed to kill with near impunity and get paid out by concord for their losses upon doing so especially if its highsec
preys take all the risks and predators lose nothing even if they fail the gank quite a hello kitty world to the piratesconcord blow up your ship and then pay for it is just absurdi simply suggest the solution of removing all insurance pay to ship loss within criminal countdown no matter by concord or by other player and selfdestructionbut since the blog in 2008 alrady said it will be fixed in near futurewhy is nothing done yet
3x t2 strip miners arent a viable setup really why not may i ask to me that seems pretty decent yeah you dont get to fill all your low slots with mlus well boo hoo i dont get to fill all my lowslots with damage mods eitherminers can chose to take the risk of fitting minimal tank in order to gain extra reward but the flip side of that is that if they fit more tank they reduce both gosh its almost as if they have to make a choice based on their playstyle what the sec status of their chosen system is etcat the end of the day the eve economy depends on ship destruction everyone takes their turn and theres no reason that miners alone should be exempt from this  especially as theyre the ultimate beneficiary the idea that miners should be able to sit untanked and safe in hisec churning out minerals without fear of ship loss is as obviously foolish and unbalanced as the idea that there should be pvp ships with 100 resists for people who dont like the idea of losing fightsfyi a hulk with 3x t2 strips can be fitted to have over 39k ehp with a gang booster in system thats tanked to the level where two battleships would probably fail to kill it especially if the hulk pilot used a few trivial tactics like orbiting his can t1 1400s have appalling tracking and hulks are smallbut the idea that the game should be balanced to suit people who refuse to fit any tank refuse to actively pilot their ships and refuse to accept that they are at risk them same as anyone else when they undock is simply whining for special treatmentps as an exercise for the interested student what do you think might happen to lowend mineral prices if hisec mining was made safe
ah you want realistic insurance i will repeat the offer i have made many times i will support more realistic insurance if you will support more realistic police you know ones that dont turn up within 30 seconds always get the right guy and always win every fight and dont charge anything for their servicesto date noone has accepted my offer no idea why if i wasnt constantly being assured that concord have no deterrent effect that punishments for aggroing are essentially zero and that hisec is more dangerous than 00 i might start to assume that people just want the game to be realistic when it suits them and dont care at all about game balance
maybe nobody responded to you because you didnt really give 1 proposal but as laundry basket of griefs with some so impractical that cannot be implemented effectively if you want to implement a tax system so that the police are paid or have a way for the police to investigate crimes then at least you will have a proposal instead of just a sarcastic rebuttal to a threadi too would like a working crimimal justice system and i even went as far as suggested some foundations for its implementation in past threads search for money laundering and lowsec fixes but the short answer is that its impractical with present technology unfortunately
what you are saying are all conceptually true but you have to make a provision for beginners who really are just learning their way in the game in highsec and should be entitled to a gank free existence though beginners would not likely be flying a hulk given they are helping the economy that you are benefiting from in the end without miners you would be paying ever increasing costs for your mods and ships so you should cut them a little proverbial slack eventually a depression would occur if all the miners were thinned outthat being said yes they should be thinking more about how to balance their defence vs profit ratiobut all that being as it were pend insurance should not pay for ships loss under criminal flag its a simple easy to implement distinction criminals should be penalized for farming in highsec they are not losing much anyway as these are suicide attempts anyway and they wont be in expensive ships in lowsec insurance will pay as you are not criminally flagged gankingthis is fair to both sides
i believe someone made a law about using that argument
1 u said so yourself that beginners dont fly hulks so how would suicide gank nerfing help them it doesnt it only helps the nonbeginners who r still too scared to use the same space they farm their killmails in2 funny the many hulks in high sec belts overabundance of minerals and their low prices say otherwise how did u come up with this depression is this occurring in some alternate universe of yourscare to explain that part cause in case u didnt know gcc still happens in low sec
well if we boost concord the macroers will go wild all players must be in position of being possibly killed dont break the sandbox ideadon not boost concord nerf security status cleaning now it is possible to get from 10 to 2 in one day in a bomber in just one day adjust it to the timer not to the systems like isk rewardscutting insurance is quit stupid besides 200 000 isks of insurance for one thrasher wont change anything and bigger gankers are dependent on security status just nerf security status
cosmetic onlyif ccp manages to get some more revenue in vanity items thats fine by me everyone is entitled to spend their money has they think its best and if some player wishes to have a monacle and a golden bs i dont care as long as that wont give a player an unfair advantage over others if on the other hand this items affect the gameplay in any other way other than visual then ccps eula and their stance on macro users and isk farmers will have no meaning at allin business you never change a winning horse for eve this basicly reflects what the players love most about this game which is the sandbox and the fact that you have to earn everything you have in game

why not they go for aoe warp bubbles its the same thing but instead of scramming you they just damage you a loti would say the anchorable kind would need to be launched for corpalliance no drama llama here move along 
do you have any thoughts about the mine types i mentioned or is it aoe or nothing
you cant catchup that is the point can you catchup to people in real life can a freshmen catchup to a senior in uni can you catchup to your siblings
not supported just because even if you cant catch up skill points wise you can become deadly if you understand what your current skills can do and if you understand game mechanicsalso you can buy characters from others which basicaly means catching up and most times even surpasing most characters so basicaly there is already a very nice and clean way to do what you want to do
annoying as hell 
still working as intended 
seriously why the hell did i make my alts breasts so huge if theyre not even going to jiggle and can anyone tell me what are the hot keys for making my busty alt take off her shirt in cq its not like someone is watching
cmmon ccp this is all about immersion voluptuous breasts immersed in nanoelastic bras that adapt to gravity shifts nex implants for all sizes nipple piercings realistic feedback with pupil dilatation and pants bulging while cloth deforms realistically to accommodate the new volume small wrinkles forming on tshirts as the jugs jiggle plastic surgery as a new profession with those superstensile plastix finally finding their buyers on the market nanopaste implant repair for modules damaged during sharp corners or abrupt drops out of warp that smash the delicate pilot facefirst into the podjust imagine ganking that freighter to find it was full of plastic implants and as the last shot ruptures the plastic wrap they all drift into space an hemorrhage of fake boobies floating in zero g and as they float towards the speechless passerby and enter the near field of view those 3d glasses finally start to make sense as you see the little ballshaped objects wizzing by your head its all in the details folks one innocent feature altering eve forever and having more gameplay impact than all the identical cqs superimposed into a manyfold srsly this wasnt even up for voting in the croudsourcing eve is real make boobs real
if ccp implemented a system where everyone in the militias knew when plexes were entered and got rid of the stupid npcs then i would be in favor of giving rewards for plexing this thread goes into considerable detail about the nitty gritty pros and cons of very many proposed changes
awesome idea i totally support this
the devs already said they would bring station spinning back in an upcoming patch so just wait for it
o nice idea
supported for scale
supported my paladin deserves bigger tachyons
in case of turrets bigger is better
wonderful another argument based on real lifetm logic for a sci fi spaceship game wonderfulthese arguments inevitably lead to anime like stupidity like this yamatoand i would rather not allow eve to degenerate into yet another gundam gamecan you see the turrets on a star destroyer no and so it should beedit not to mention rl battleships were not much bigger than a small eve cruiser or destroyer exactly where you think the sizes looked right
the problem with scale is that its deceptive without reference just because a ship is bigger dose not mean that the turret needs to be larger the picture posted in the thread of the us battleship uss iowa has a calibre size on its main guns of 410mm almost half the size of minmatar medium artillery many of the ships in eve online have totally borked scale maybe ccp can confirm this but i dont know if the turrets have been modelled to scale or not however this might well be a case of the ships in eve online are just so much bigger than even the largest of sea fairing warships afloat today
scale is what makes them appear undersized not supported
yes my apoc looks pathetic i cant even zoom in enough to see the gunsthis needs to be done
actuallyyes you canyour just not looking in the right spots o p
it was retained as a issue becouse while fixed the second generation changes  carbon ui broke funtinality and needs tobe tweaking again
too late now but the fw issues need to be reviewed there are many duplicate ones that need to be mergedthis way the issues will be underrepresented as votes for the same issue will be spread out over several more or less identical issues
for some reason what i typed didnt show up im not sure i understand your post this is exactly what im suggesting
i agree it doesnt make any sense it is easier to gain sec status in 00 when you cant even loose sec status thereboost brosec
basically the new player you just allowed to manufacture stuff in one of your pos can now end the build timer on the almost completed titan this is not right
install deliver and cancel should be 3 separate permissions
if you allow a new player into your corp that is building titans and give him factory manager role you deserve to have every running job cancellededit also supporting the op or even better arushias idea
this should be one of the many permissions issues fixed in upcoming patches along with pos permissions and one that allows only corpies with it to access fleet fit ship corp hangars
10
supportedalso it should visually expand as you mine like a pufferfish
this is indeed broken
proposal each ship class has a maximum number of ships of any class that can red box it at a given timeinterceptor  t1 frigate  2assaulty frigate  3cruiser  4 battlecruiser  6battleship  8whywill make blobbing more difficultpointless and create better fightsexceptionsjoining a fleet stops this mechanic so an fleetfleet fight will not be constraigned by these rulesexpolitsmanipulating this mechanic eg moving about in an intercptor red boxed by two alts is considered an exploit and will get you bannedsketchy idea far from a finished proposal but if something like this mechanic had been in from the start we would probably now see a better game for the solosmall gang players
the option to blob should remain and not be removed outright several ways to encourage smaller fleets like gangboosters on squadwing basis  negative gang bonuses as size increases mechanics favouring small over large objective based sovereignty chatter intel huge fleets detectable from afar read neighbouring systems due to comms trafficyes to mechanics that discourage excessive force no to mechanics that arbitrarily removes it as option
1 you just made pretty nuch anything bcsized or bigger invulnerable because logistics can fix it much faster than 8 people can shoot2 you also just made most ewar ships pointless as in most cases it wouldnt multiply force projection enough to pay for one less dps ship3 you are opening fleets for griefing from spies who can just put one crappy gun on the targets and prevent a significant amout of dps4 why those arbitrary numbers and why not a different set of arbitrary numbersi dont see how having to micromanage what is every single person in a 250 man fleet shooting would create better fights in any wayso basically this mechanic will never come to effect since you know most of the time when two people fly together they form a fleethow would you monitor and police this
the blobs will just join a fleet also very vulnerable to griefing
i really like perpetueum mechanics blobs get reduction in scan res and some other stuff not really important stats for fleet fights and also aoe on death i dont think they would put it in but it would be nice just for a change
really should just give formations that favor small gangs with agilityspeedsig bonuses as those would be the benefits of a small fleet in a fight however there really isnt a way to prevent people from just making a bunch of fleets each with the max pilots to still get the bonus there really isnt a way to stop people from bringing more by restrictions sticks or carrots the fighting mechanics need to change so the benefit isnt overwhelmingly in the favor of putting more pilots in one location this really works out to the need for a sov overhaul
not supportedthis is a sandbox not the game for fair prearranged fights linear rules of engagement are for wow wot and others that are not truly massive go back to wow or empire
1 no2 according to csm minutes local intel is being revamped so its probably best to wait what comes out of that
anyone thinking what the black ops ships need is a covertops cloak is blatantly clueless as to their application
people want to use them to ninja rat rather than pvp mostly because they are pretty bad at both it would be nice if they were more useful id prefer pvp though
thisalso blackops and fleet mentioned together another one is not blackops and thats not blackops
care to share1 generic cloak usage  cloaked speed boost  no targeting delay  warp visibly to grid then cloak up should the target arrive out of range motor closer before dropping cloak and firingso i get there first and hope my prey comes to me2 covert jump bridge  the ability to send other troops spies into battlefield3 covert  generic jump drive  the ability to follow spiestroops into battle of course unless theres a cyno back home waiting for you youre going to be visible the whole way back while your covops compatriots can cloak through all the camps along the wayso yeah looks like a black ops should get close to the battlefield then send a recon ahead to light cyno then he sends more covops into the fray finally he turns around and goes homewhat
while i dont mind t2 bpos your comparison with limited issue ships is really just stupid they are as their name suggests limited selling them is a one time business bpos on the other hand continually produce revenue and if not stupidly lost will do so forever
so op did this thread turn out the way you wanted or have u applied to hello kitty online
1 your ignorance in this matter is the problem and your bias towards you not wanting to be war decced is the problem if you declare war on someone they dont get to choose if it is valid or not you declared itperiod2 who cares3 if you dont want to be war decced then dont join a player corp that simple stay in the newbie corp and you cant be war decced dont like that answer too bad that is how the game has always beenthat is how the players as a whole want it youare a minority and probably one of the very very few that think the way you doin closingthere is no probblem except your misguided belief that something should change because you dont like it not everybody agrees with you as far as i can tell nobody that has posted to this thread as of yet has agreed with you
hello allafter incarna was deployed i gave my character a new outfit but after i clonejumped she wear the old one every single time i have to recostimation herits a little problem and maybe most of you arent bothered by that but there should be a option to customize all clones at once maybe a button like adapt clonescheersernesto
oopss sorry error delete pls
personally i think destroyers are pretty boring ships just get allot more guns and tank than a frigate no real tactics or planning even if you like them there are only 4 and really only 1 that works well minors would just be thrashers online if you excluded all faction ships there are very few t1 frigate fits that have a chance against a decent destroyer but yes i do support this change since its just pirates ships excluded the problem is allot of this is theory crafting since very little pvp goes on in plexes anyway

is this when crowd sourcing is going wrong
reposted minus permission from a thread on the forums of eve university in all of its insignificance
dear alli have read in the dev answers threat that it is not possible to rehaul the pos mainly because the art team has stuff to do for a whole year i am sure there are a few other things of coursethe only thing that could be keeping the art team busy for a year is incarna and i want to say this clearly players have been demanding an overhaul of pos for more than 5 yearsit is far more important that station environment it is affecting a huge part of the player base unlike stations which are only for leisure when there is nothing else to dowhy are you wasting time on something that will impact 10 of the players in a miscellaneous way and leaving something that is severely impacting at least 60 of the playersdo you realize that the difficulty of handling the game is among the main reasons that stops many players from joining after their trial is the extreme unnecessary complexity of interface based things such as ui pos skill training among so many things virtual goods is an extra source of income when you have a large enough player base on a very stable and accessible game its a luxury the most important aspect of any game is to have a user friendly handlinginterface i suggest that csm raise this issue to ccp

uhh so you want us to make at least 7 positive votesbut that means one of the 7 votes will only get 2 points since we only have 20 points to spend and not 21 and there seems to be no way to determine which of your votes will receive 2 instead of 3 points

you are obviously not following me when i said depression which is perhaps my fault for assuming that its obvious to anyone with a knowledge of econ that if you thin out the miners workers farmers proletariat you will get price inflation which will cause a run on the banks in eve that would be a buying frenzy on ships and mods and fuel which will cause the economy to stall as you get a flight to quality in assets average joes cannot afford bread anymore and you get a depression like the one in 1930 get itgcc gnu c compiler
agreed we can go the sec status route it deserves its own thread true true the pend payouts are small for thrashers but think about the other ships that one may get criminal flagged in and the cases where this could happen
agreed empire space is policed criminal should not be rewarded10 sec status character should also be podded by gate guns and concord on sight 
honestly it might be best if you refrained from making suggestions and comparisons in this thread until you know at least the basics of the subject being discussedgcc  general criminal countdown pirating in low sec generates a gcc just the same as doing it in hisec does the only difference is that there is no concord response in losec if you jump into hisec after committing a crime in losec you will be concorded
you are so amusingand no sense of humormy point only is that if you get killed in lowsec criminals under gcc still get paid said in another way insurance wont pay only if you get concorded faction police npc any other way it will pay including lowsec
u r obviously mentally incapable of simple reading comprehension reread the part where the many hulks in high sec belts overabundance of minerals and their low prices contradict the alternate universe ure describing derp get it or would u like an explanation in terms even u can understandand whats your reasoning behind that point oh other than an alternate universe ure dreading which isnt occurring in eve id normally suggest to step away from the screen but in your case u might want to alttab to the correct one u know the one for tranquility that way u wont easily mistake some other game for eve
worth for ccp to take a look at
i support this proposal i dont want to see suicide ganking nerfed but i dont believe criminal actions should get insurance paybacks rl insurances wouldnt do it for criminals it shouldnt be any different in eve
on the rag arent we im going to ignore your ad hominem comments as it only serves to erode your credibility calm downat any case back to econ 101 the current state of the universe overabundance of hulks and minerals whatnot is supporting the current prices yeah so if you reduce the supply then you get higher prices et cetera you could argue that that may not be a bad thing and maybe you would be right but any sudden large destabilizing change to the market is a bad thing
how to fix mineralisk sources and sinks is another story and should be viewed in that regard just make a new assembly hall thread and discuss it there  it shouldnt be fixed by players suicide gankingimo hulkageddon is a huge excuse for an event thats just a cover for some fun in a sandbox
alas i can only read what you write if you mean death by concord say so if you mean criminally flagged say that theyre different things if you mean one but say the other then its hardly anothers fault for not catching your meaning is it
supported
supported
this is a long time problem ccp needs to address i support this proposal i like to see a queue for onlining offlining and unachoring pos modules i also would like to see ccp fix the problem where i type in my pos password and not see my parked ships get launched 200300k away that really sucks why would i park my ships inside my shields and see them get launched out when i type password to get back inside the shields doesnt make sense at least give me the option to launch ships out my pos ive had 3 orcas launched out my pos because of the game mechanic i wanted to setup a pos seperate from my corp pos to protect my important capital ships from theft with launching ships i cant manage to do that
reactors and siloses shouldnt require starbase config  it is just silly
good proposal agreed
agreed there are features i got excited about that never went anywhere great namely faction warfare and exploration i want them to stop making the equivalent of ingame minigames and instead take a long hard look at everything we have already and fatten those features upargus
they never listen theyll just add to their nex
i support this proposal i see this more profitable than their nex that ccp has recently done i think there a larger base of player who might want to change their names than buy a 70 eye patch ccp offers in their nex
this ties in with another proposal to remove all ancient trial accounts and what have you to free up names supported
i dont think you get the bit where the op is proposing deleting old and unactivated trial accounts i support this generally and support it additionally because of my own situation i dont consider deleting trial accounts that are unused and have been unused for 5 years or more to even possibly inconvenience the modern playerbasenow ofcourse you are going to explain to me how exactly having several thousand unused trial accounts from 2006 on database provides any positives to ccp except for that sole one where they boast about how many accounts they have or the playerbase ofcourse if you decide not to explain this kindly gtfo
i support this proposal especially on trial accounts for people that havent been on awhile and were not trial accounts maybe a different proposal i suggest those have their names stripped away from their characters and not deleted if they decide to come back they would have to make a new name but not lose assets or skill points i know a lot of people that just want to take breaks from eve just a suggestion on that matter trial accounts though delete them all
if i understand it correctly please keep in mind that i havent played the game but they sound an awful lot like laser towers from x3 which in ones or twos werent an issue but got dangerous in larger groups though it mostly depended on ship typethose could be useful almost like personal gate guns the only thing i could see being an issue with that style is overuselagging though if it required a certain sov upgrade than it would work max around one gate or something
i thinks would be a interesting i believe you should be able to use them but only in certain areas in the game i think should limited to where you can use them like anywhere that is 00 space there should also be a counter to the mines as well either make a new ship type minesweeper or make modules that can dectect and destroy them plus there should be some kind of limit on how many you can use or something if mines do come back into play there should be a lot careful thought on how they are suppose work this is a very tricky area
you need to redesign your proposal as the guy above said its too tricky make your idea less vague with an application in the eve universe maybe i just dont understand what you mean what reason is there to include a new weapon system into evejust for variety of weapon systems
when it comes to real life and real world business some people will beat others in spite of the time factors involved hehe dive been unable to get some friends into eve mostly because of a mindset against any games that have been around for a long time they get into games when theyre new and then stick around to become uber vets they refuse to be noobs in a game thats already got big boys etc i dont think that faster training times would change that mentalitypersonally i do not find eves training time a deterrent its a very interesting game if i get to a point where the training time is making me jump up and down ill do something else while the training gets where i want it to bei understand the plex and character trading micro transactions to be a mechanism that counters illegal gold farmerscharacter trading outfits i dont regard these to be products of the eve economy although thats a smooth rationalization both plex and character purchases give tangible ingame benefit for real world money still ccp benefits goldfarmers lose and it could keep eve online thriving in bad economical times so thats enough for mesapph
i dont support this proposal no newplayer should be able to come in and just have it easy i for one wish my characters could catch up to other players with higher sp but i also know they had their accounts longer than i and had the time and patience to have that high sp new players should just learn to wait for things like the rest of the community or go play world of warcraft where there is a level cap
supportedi target at least 3 acceleration gates a night i never noticed that the overview froze when ctrl was pressed before but considering how insanely handy that is i cant believe they got rid of itdunno how relevant it is but having to click back outside the drone window for drone commands to be comprehended is also pretty annoying at least let the drone hotkeys still work when the drone window is highlighted
1in a mission i double click the next accel gate to approach it then start the ctrlclick down the overview to lock enemiesoops locked the gate too now my hot weapons want to start pounding the accel gate and ive wasted a targeting slotplease fix
thank you for the support so far people its clear this affects people from all walks of life
going to give this another nudge back to the front page it is a very fair and balanced proposal need some more thumbs up for this guys
thanks for bumping forgot to chime in on thisno supportwill make non blockade runner indies even more gankable
use a orca with a cloak thats what i do anywho a cloaky pos does sound cool though trinkets makes it all stargate atlantis lol i like a cloaky pos but i dont want them really in the game
personally owned structures have been requested for quite some time since the pos of today are more of a corporate owned structure with far greater upkeep and maintenance than the average player should be required to spendwe can anchor a secure container in deep space with nothing required to maintain it other than poking it with a stick once a monthso why not allow much smaller and far more manageable posoutposts and no not the big ones amarr refining outpost amarr repair outpost amarr tactical outpost caldari refining outpost caldari repair outpost caldari tactical outpost gallente outpost minmatar refining outpost minmatar repair outpost minmatar tactical outpostthe models are already in game all ccp needs to do is put 2 and 2 together and give people small structures for their own usewhose to say these small outposts could even support external defenses like a pos or even a force field bubble bigger than a single ship
anything that helps poss be better than their current boring soul destroyingly boring and even more boring not to mention ugly and uninspiring selves
i think its worth looking into
i support boobies im ready to launch a ingame campaign if i must my full 100 support
we should all wear i 3 boobies bracelets to show our support for jiggling breastsalso we should fix shadows theyre horrifying didnt ccp develop soft shadows my computer can handle it do want
please please please fix gallante boats and hybrid turrets
fyi the csm has several active proposals concerning fw and they can be voted for by you via their current crowdsourcing prioritizationsee the dev bog for info i highly recommend putting in votes for the fw issues if you care about getting changes
boo hooshame what x gallentius has to say is the most interesting and frankly only noteworthy contribution to this thread lol yes even mine now hurr durr and yet you wish to dismiss it
arent there enough mechanics where you shoot red xs in eve already why not make fw occupancy the one mechanic in all of eve that promotes small gang and solo pvp plus i think giving bonuses to the winning side will just make everyone pile on the winning side
sure why not i suppose i support ya nothing wrong with studying and reviewing fw
a star destroyer has a bunch of little guns on the sides and all around i know this because i am a nerd thats more of choice of guns and roles then saying that arbitrary a large ship doesnt need larger cannons lots of small guns might be better for smaller targets frigs and fighters of the rebels it is called a destroyer after all and i think the ship might not have the largest guns because it is also has more of a role of a carrier star destroyers if you watched the movies are used for transporting many tie fighters troopers and even those giant 4 footed walkers and the smaller 2 footed ones ever noticed that before the empire does anything on the ground a fleet of star destroyers are in space so it isnt a literal battleship if you think about it the galatic empire engineers could have chosen to have the same hull get rid of the large cargotroopfighter bays and opt for larger reactors or ammo storage to power 8 large main cannons able to blast equally impressive holes in the largest of ships furthermore for big ship on other big ship combat it makes more sense to have the largest caliber guns for piercing shields or armor use a pea shooter that is normally used for swating flies and its just going to bounce just seroulsy look at real battleships the main guns are decently sized not all guns are but those are secondary weapons and doorstops not to be confused with main armament secondary weapons eve does not really deal with save rockets only main guns are counted with a hard limit of 8not only does having decently sized guns on a ship make it look cooler it adds a bit of realism furtherpoint the presence of other things out of scale is only a further sign that more things should defiantly be fixed in that departmenton the same subject frig guns should maybe be reduced in size though personally i think while maybe a bit too large are still more in scale then others for being main weapons and defiantly carriers should be five times larger then they are currently so 5 times larger then a battleship and super carriers should be 10 times as massive as a regular carrier
star destroyer isnt a battleship what battleships does the empire use then wait im not going to let you draw me into a fictitious scifi argument that will end up in a star destroyer vs enterprise debate the point is that you only get ridiculous sized proportionally guns in japanese anime your real life example doesnt apply because you eve cruisers are bigger than the uss iowa
exactly my pointyou cant see them without looking for them with a microscope as it should be
star destroyer suck end of discussionot i fully approve this idea and taking a look at this is imo worth it before i have to start explaining it again
battleship turrets look like theyre at the correct scale on cruisers or battle cruisers so supported
speaking of the yamato and iowa
made a comparison myselfthe 800mms are bigger then the 1400mms
what happened to hybrids 
yes long overdue
signed
as long as it doesnt give an easy grind for killing 10s noob ships or whatever then this suggestion has merit encouraging antipiracy would be a geniue stroke by ccp or people like the op
your heart is in the right place but there is a big loophole here pirates will shoot their own alts to boost up their standings unless you make it so that you also have to have a positive standing in order to benefit from this but that just means that pirates will try to keep their status around 0 and have a 10 alt around to farm sec status withfunny you mentioned the bounty system as this is exactly the problem with the current bounty system
as with all things nothing is unexploitable i do both appreciate and welcome youre input it only helps this issue become more viable and closer to being considered by the csm and ccp
for the record while i understand your reasons for wanting this change i still disagree with the merits of your arguments in favor of this change i continue to support the current theft flagging mechanics unless a better idea can be proposededit just had a thought i remember someone proposing an alternative in the thread that begat this one wherein the wardecing corporation pays extra for exclusive loot rights also another alternative i just thought of and like even better perhaps a noninterference clause in the yulai conventions that give the wardecing corporation the right to a discounted andor shortertimed wardec on the thiefs corporation or on just the thief himself still with paying for the right to the short single pilot aggression timer
mine would be easier very clear you steal there are reprcussions not like now
its like that now you steal from the owner and there are repercussions
so wait whatadam and bob get into a fight with chuck sitting on the sidelines watchingadam blows up bobs shipbobs wreck belongs to bobs corpbut since adam already has aggro to bobs corp he can take the loot without problemsif chuck takes the loot from bobs wreck he will gain aggro to bobs corpso when bob and his corp get back to the wreck they can continue shooting at adam and can start shooting at chuck as wellsounds like repercussions already existhence why this thread has zero support so far concord is not your mommy for you to run to saying he stole my cookieconcord is your dad saying well kick his ass and get your cookie back
you either cannot read or dont understandi pay concord for a war dec on a corpalliance i kill a pilot in that corp while killing his other corpmate a noob corp loot stealer flies in takes the loot from the first pilots wreck he then warps and docks in his 1 million isk thrasher he is able to undock fly to the gate i am sitting on and stay there safely due to the fact i cannot shoot him because concord currently wont let me and the corp i am at war with cannot come because i there protecting the loot theif concord is your dad saying well kick his ass and get your cookie back yeah i am trying to get the rights to get my cookie back as for not getting zero support its up for review by the csm appearently a few empire war people think its important
so we have some people saying its a fair mechanic about it being empire still and all that jazz im still going back to my original comment about being able to pod my corp mate in highsec but i cant receive a remote sensor boost from him or reps outside the being gcc kinda seems broken too me just sayin
distraction tactic thats a completely different topic and comparing unfairness factors are not fruitful in debatesincidentally that tactics main legitimate use is for wargames and fleet exercises within corps
i dont support this proposal i dont believe in fair fights
continually produce revenue yes but so do t1 bposthe amount that a t2 bpo can make is the price of the bpc copy either you save yourself from having to buy it in the production of your part or you just make and sell these bpcs its not that bad because the price of these are controlled by people using invention to make their own bpcsis it a bit of an advantage over someone who has to resort to invention or buying a bpc yes a bit but its nowhere near the money factory that you think it is its advantage is almost completely nullifiable by the invention profession if you despise them then start an invention guild and undercut their bpc prices
itt people whining about t2 bpos while technetium moon owners are the ones creaming 90 of the profit from the t2 supply chain
hell yea we are
why buy a t2 bpo if doesnt hold some kind of advantage over copyinventing people spend billions for t2 bpos for a reason because of its significant advantage invention works just fine t2 bpos should be removed from the game
what does the competition regulation say to t2 bpo holdings
currently ship bonuses are not applying to drones ie damagehp there is a hideous work around which is logging off and back on again whilst in a station or in space waiting for your ship to disappear which is supposed to fix the issue but i find this rarely works this means i or anyone else who uses drone boats can not pvp at all i have no idea until its too late whether or not my ship is performing how it shouldplease csm apply pressure to ccp to get this fixed asap instead of messing with the stupid ing nex store that has nothing to do with gameplay
lets bring attention to thisi dont have droneboats so everything is fine for me
with exception to leaving the system if you probed out a wormhole for example and left it without bookmarking it you should be able to warp back to it from your solar system map alternatively add the ability to trace your steps and warp back to the point you entered warp from
waste dev time because you are too lazy to bookmark no tx
next time you will learn to bookmark your sigs should be a lesson learned and not repeated i consider this a waste of dev time myself i dont support this proposal
actuallyso long as you havent switched ships yet your scanner window will still have the last set of signatures youd picked upalso when you visit a wormhole it will put an unstable wormhole marker on your solar system map so you could just drop probes again and scan that location to get the sig hitoh and bm next time
lmao who hasnt been griefed from other corps cry me a river and go play wow and complain to them about unfairness better yet girlie go play hko
i like it the way it is right now but i may like limiting mercoxit to wh space though
two i can think of your standard skill hardwiring affects 1 pilot ill be honest i dont really ask whats in my comrades heads but i bet no one other then the supercarriers run that implant a lot im guessing supply for that item is low as the demand is low but when someone does want one they are willing to afford it for their supercapital and  or 5 some odd billion xtype full officer fit mission golem  rattlesnake  stupid expensive fit shield thing so really your implant is once again my argument that a cs pilot to do his job has to blow the equivalent of a capital ship mod to do the role of a battlecruiser in the case of the golem or whatever that thing is a trophy ship they want to stick the biggest most expensive crap on there and have the isk to burn to do it comparing a cs pilot wanting to be helpful to a mission carebear is apples to a steak dinner orange doesnt work cause as they are both fruits its still in the ballparkthe second is the rate people pod cs pilots in the jumbo fleet fights it is lower but i could still safely say that its greater then they pod bss or whatever as the enemy doesnt want the pilot to fly over to a offgrid carrier offensive or dock defensive and just hop in another damnation as you can fit a few per carrier and infinite in a outpost in a little fight you always try to pod him as your gatecamp roam whatever is still going though there do to the want to screw over your enemies and drain them with the exception of maybe a claymore cs huggin combat recon and arazu force recon in the fleet where the claymore better be running the information warfare mod the opposing team will pod the cs knowing that if he wanted to do his job properly hes got at least 50 mil in that skullarguably you could say that well the supercaptials run slave implants or things like your kva2000 and get podded too id then ask you to look at a sc only pilot and ask how many times he gets killed and podded in relation to a cs and also the percentage of their implants to the ship
why not put them in loyalty point stores
organizing contacts in folders isnt a new idea matter of fact ccp allowed you to organize your contacts in folder before they came up with their new system of keeping contacts as you are aware ccp lets you add a contact by giving them a personal standing to yourself this is great but i wish they never got rid of being able to use folders as well i use to be able to organize my contacts on why i added them to my contacts i like to keep contacts organized on why i want to keep in contact with them by either wanting to kill them minining keep a eye on known enemy titan pilots or business and trade partners i like the individual standing but i want to see folder intergrated back into contacts
hell yes i like to see a dev road map
i would like to request that the export feature be brought back as well it saves a lot of time  hasslealso would like to second the idea that ccps response was dismal surely the game should be to players wishes
yesloot log export was a vital part of the payroll process for my corp needs to be returned badly
this needs to come back
to whom it may concerni would concur with the op on this eve engineering has been using the loot export feature basiclly since it was added to automaticlly process mining operations accounting billing invoicing performance metrics and audits it was one of the primary inputing into our mining tracking systems that feeds to our bank software since its removal we have had to type in the loot history manually on a daily basis i have lessed the pain by writing a loot history data entry program that assumes alot of data for you but the old way of right click export was way better i have filed bug reports and petition with no success i would perfer to see it logged just like any other chat channel so the file is written to automaticlly on a disconnect or session change that file could then be picked up compared parsed and inserted directly into the database with no human work needed that way miners could have a physdo real time statistics on their operations i could bring back the iskhour meter to the ingame browserand why is ccp soundwave not a fan of export features this troubles me for the general web developer and industrialist i could not see any reason not to have more exportable data in fact ccp devs could take this opertunity to better the feature and make us all happy respectfullycomdscxo ee
i support this proposal
i moved this out of the main crowdsourcing page so my vote could be counted34143 docking timers should be changed for aggressors corporations issuing war decs should also be given a longer docking timer they are the ones wanting a war and should not be able to play docking games if the war is not going their way i see no point in someone war decing and then turtleing up or allowing an attempted ganker who fails the chance to dock up right away47171 mining system wide comets this will help in keeping belts from drying up to fast and the ability for ice and minerals to come from comets also ccp can add some danger to mining from rogue rocks or debris flying around the belt and off the comet the rocks and debris are able to be targeted and shot at or slow so you can move your ship out of the way
good post you mad
i really doubt the mittani needs any help trolling these forums
to skip over the whole mass limit for a hulk in a c1 issue because that should be obvious id mainly like to say that from actually living in a wormhole though my play time is poop all at the moment the risk will actually increase if you were to try to mine in a wormhole that close to jitathe logic being that when you get a high concentration of players in one area the chance that one of them is in the mood to go wormhole diving is increased and that you end up having a very bad dayto remove these ores from any wormhole is a very silly idea and my best suggestion is for the csms who have never lived in w space to do a bit more research before anything like this happens im pretty sure they would be high on the list of people who would tell me to do the same if i started to comment on 00 and sov mechanics and started making elementary mistakes
hello i was expecting some trolls but not even that

for black ops range i completely disagree in 00 you already what we can call a ghost camp who sometimes can decide to be on and scramble one ship and activate is cyno to jump and destroy youfor the moment the only way to counter that is to also ghost camp system where are the possible bo and fleet to attack youso if a guy can jump through the whole universe no funother situation you want to do a roaming or solo pvp which is almost impossible nowadays if you take a target somewhere he can covert cyno you from i dont know wherei think its a bit unfair situation for that too so no more range or get a titanor please if you do that allow cap and super cap to jump through gate
for the gun why not include a setting except for launcherthis setting should include soemthing like ratio range dps tracking with some emphasis among the racesfor exemple you can gain more tracking on a hybrid more range on a projectile more dps on laser something like that and of course this setting should be done in stationthe other parts of those change should be done in the same way on shipsmore dps more pg need less tankmore range less tankmore tracking more cpu less fast like this it add a bit of surprise on the fleet config and lead to the need of more stategies in real time
t1 cruisers are quite craptastic because they cant fit into any roles in fleets they need to have substantial bonus to one narrow area to compare with t2 for example give omen 10 greater range than zealot stabber 10 faster than vagabondgenerally i think t1 cruisers should have more range because they arent fast enough to evade dmg or have big enough tank to take dmg battlecruisers are kinda the bane for cruisers cause they are just too good or have the right qualities for fleetsso id go with something like remove one cruiser per level bonus and give them static 50 optimalspeedfalloff bonus noob friendly and role giving fix offcource to fit the long range guns they need wsome other fixes too but heres the general idea and not every cruiser needs those bonuseslike the ewar cruisers
 remove the tier system and buff the underdog t1 cruisers nerf battlecruisers so they dont obsolete cruisers to such a ridiculous degree  increase cruiser mobility across the board right now the speed gap between t1 cruisers and battlecruisers is w
ccp needs to go back to the roots to the beginning of eve look how things where back then look at what ships had which roles look at the doctrine of all the races and sub racespirate factions and then look at how the new things got added what has been changed to what effect and how those changes evolved though time and the following patches by doing this patch by patch change by change there will eventually be balance amen
mea culpaokay so then back to the argument are you in accordance with me does it sound fairsound not to pay insurance to those concorded i mean i loath to use rl justifications normally but our own car insurance doesnt pay if you crash your getaway car while heisting a bank 
i agree its bad game design i would like to see a nerf of that mechanicmost people are saying it should be still possible to gank but with much more effort
yes i would agree with that sentiment im not trying to get rid of gankers im just trying to make crime not pay in that way you will still have thrasher ganks and thats fine its eve afterall but you will make a criminal think twice about ganking a freighter with a bs gang unless they are sure of the loot drop will make it worth it and thats all im trying to say and steven levitt said it best no life insurance for suicide bombersactually his quote was more like why do suicide bombers not have life insurance
i think its worth remembering that eve insurance is a ship replacement mechanism in a game not a contractually agreed payment made by a legal entity working in a framework of laws that closely resembles the one we live in it bears only the most superficial resemblence to the financial service we call insurance in our real livesinsurance for gankers does seem nonsensical at first sight but it isnt more nonsensical than concord is in the first place its certainly a lot less nonsensical than an insurance company that only requires a single 30 premiumpaying insurance to gankers is no more unrealistic than paying insurance to pirates missionrunners people in wars people who live in 00 or any other common ship loss scenario no real insurance company would pay a single cent on at least 99 of the ship losses in eve why pick out suicide gankers for special treatmentperhaps the simplest fix would be to rename the service from insurance to prepaid hull salvaging contract or some such and change the message to pend salvage drones have recovered sufficient material from your ships hull to pay you xyz isk then people wouldnt get all bent out of shape about the apparent contradictions of calling a ship replacement mechanism insurance
except that concord rules explicitly state that break its laws and your ship is forfeit im not going to argue the inconsistencies in concord or their mandate but just because something doesnt make sense isnt a good reason to make it more non sensical not getting paid by insurance is in line with the intended concord philosophy which is that aggressing in high sec will cost you you cannot mitigate these costs by running away from concord nor should you be able to insure away your ship at any rate the cost of most ships are less than the mods on them but anyway its the principle thats worth discussing 
and what do u define as a large destabilizing change and be sure to use past events not events that u magically predict is gonna suddenly happen when nothing has changed for years if anyones on the rag its u seeing as how ure still so butthurt over suicide gankingthats not what he was getting at hes pointing out that ure fixated and crying against suicide ganking only while using a flimsy cover of criminal most likely because u dont get that that criminal covers more than suicide ganking u want realism how about no insurance for bringing your vehicle into a war zonesee aboveactually ure doing exactly that after that sentence try again plz because selfdictating whats intended or what others should or shouldnt do to suit your liking is such a convincing argument just to change what u dont like
supported however it isnt concord that pays out insurance also insurance should not cover selfdestructs and losses in nullwsec there is no concord communications network to record what happens there there is in lowsec
some of the problems i see folks repeating a lot in this thread and i myself agree withmining is not profitable in nullsec due to risk vs rewardnullsec imports almost all lowend minerals from highsecnullsec mining is almost completely done in gravimetric sites negating the riskreward aspect of nullsec when it comes to miningtech 2 production is not viable in nullsecsolutionsincrease yield of all ore for lowsec and nullsecincrease lowend mineral yield of highend oresincrease ore yield specifically in the belts make them more profitable than the gravimetric sitesallow players to anchor poss near asteroid belts say 200km away this would give miners some cover fire and a place to warp to quickly in the event hostiles enter systemprovide research agents in nullsechow to prevent these solutions from nerfing highsecbalance overall ore yield bonus for being in nullsec such that mining in nullsec is profitable enough to cover the risk but that a substantial amount of minerals still come from highseckeep lowend mineral yield from highend ores lower than yield from lowend ores example spodumain could yield say 100x as much tritaniumpyeritewhich makes it a significant amount but leaves it lower than veldsparscordite spodumain also yields some megacyte making it useful to mineprovide research agents with the pirate factions thus making them more difficult to access but make them more profitable datacoreswise easier highsec agents will still be much used
i also think we should make rorquals something that has to be defended perhaps pilots still get boosts from a booster in the same system who is offgrid but only half as much so if you have your rorqual out there in the belt you get twice the boost from itas far as putting the rorqual into a pos at the belt perhaps instead of a normal pos at belts there could be a specific defensive facility made for belt anchoring it would be much smaller and cheaper than a pos so you could have lots of them in one system but it wouldnt have a big shield around it instead it would only provide cover fire and maybe some mineral storage room
what exactly am i meant to be supportingyes i want improvements to 00 and while the idea of having smallgang targets beyond sov structures sounds good seeing is believingbesides in 00 these days small gang is considered 1000 drakes  maels  supercarriers
no

im only going to respond to this one as the others dont deserve any further response and will only serve to spin the discussion further and further off topic needless to say my point is that the logical debate is over how many new arguments have you seen posted in the last while right so qed time for the votesilence does not imply consent i would shiver to imagine the country that you would govern if the laws were written that way its a fairly simple task for the forum mods to tally reads and not count rereads by same posters right this is your motion so the onus is on you to prove majority support ambivalent votes to not count as supporting you they count against you as the people didnt care enough to click a button to support it so where is the vote thread already quit stalling edit my personal stance just to remind you actually is that this would be fine so long as you can address all the accountability problems surrounding it i personally have nothing against it just that there are too many negative side effects to outweigh any positives another one to consider is that forum posts are done by name and forum posts are very important for investment auditors in gauging the ability of the bond issuer to make good on their debts this would add extra complexity to their tasks not all issuers like to give out their api and another potential complication to put on the con side of the scale when you weigh the pros and the cons of this proposal
friendly bump for new support
oh i find the reason behind this amusingi would only agree unter above ruleseti pity you
welcome to any country that votes the populace that does vote never equals the total populace that could vote but you dont see them waiting around the ambivalent are therefore mine since these nonvoters would not be counted against any legislation meh youd have to ask someone at ccp about that but i doubt they keep data that specific sounds like you want them to monitor ip addresses and do statistical work for one lowly proposal i thought you were all against inconveniences and unprofitable work see the above and all the posts prior and youll realize that you still dont have coherent terms or the concept of voting that and the fact that it wont even result in anything and that it is way too soon i dont even have a complete proposal its evolving and i havent reached nearly enough people now whos being selective in her argumentsyep the onus is mine and im handling it i actually do have a plan keep posting these negative side effects and accountability problems and ill keep enlightening you the tools will be there to verify an entity without using api the aka system even more so in the current situation that gray zone is inhabited by entirely unverifiable character transfers if youre loaning out money and not doing your research well been keeping up with the us economy
they are meant to be used to defend gates both allies and enemies will be hit with them they can be anchored targeted and destroyed as with mwdb or you can simply throw a few suicide frigates or drones at them to set the field off these are not the old single placement mines they are a minefield a bubble of space where there are mines entering that area sets them off dealing damage to everything in the bubble the bubble would be just a graphic showing the outline of the field maybe just a sphere of red dots or something simple no need for distortion field used with the mwdbs meant to be used with mwdbs to so a target cant just warp out the image i have of them is put two bubbles up covering most of the gate area in an anti warp field around the edges of the warp bubbles place minefields so exiting the bubble means entering the minefieldthe reason for a new weapon system is to just shake up 00 alliances old tactics are old add something new into the mix supercaps would find it hard to enter the system when their cyno ships cant make it past the gates open the cyno in the bubble sure then the cap will bounce off the gate straight into the minefields
you probably just explained why ccp took the mines out the game in the first place
you are probably right but i still think they would be a welcome change up to nullsec
you could always include this idea to the 00 fix list if something like that already exists
i support this product
no support dont get podded with your implants
for the slim chance that ccp will change it and for rippin the monocle outta his dead lifeless eyesocketjust for the lulz support
i thought the advantage of being a capsuleer was that this advanced jovian technology permitted one person to pilot a ship that normally requires a full crew the lore is that capsuleers are special because the way they train skills and pilot a pod permits their one brain to replace an entire ships crewin short the capsule is the advanced automationi agree with you on buffing the gallente ships and not just hybrids in general more pg tracking bonuses give me that and ill find a way to make the ship faster
actually checkout the article in the latest eon crew has always been there in your ship yes as a capsuleer you need less crew but there is crew nevertheless ccp have not released official numbers as likely they want to keep the freedom to change the numbers for play balance once they do release the populus patch ccp im taking credit for naming this patch if you use itbut here are some round figures they released as guidelinesclass minimum crew npc minimum crew capsuleershuttle 12 0frigate 210 13destroyer 1030 620cruiser 2075 1050bc 40170 15100bs 200550 100300carrier 7001500 350700dread 6001200 300800supercarrier 15003000 10001700titan 600010000 30006000

the imperial star destroyer is a carrier strictly used to enforce imperial law in an areatheyre guns are not small just theyre turbo laser banks the big ones are mounted on the sides because they are most often employed in broadsides episode 4 or a new hope depending on how old of a fan you are the laser that were shooting at the tantive 4 a cruiser more or less were regular laser cannons that are mounted all over the destroyer for smallship engagement if the isd had used its main cannons the tantive 4 would have been ripped in halfalso going to the point of size the battleships employed by the empire would be more along the lines of victoryclass cruisers which are about one fifth the size of a isd but covered in turbolasers and the acclamator class slightly smaller and used as a lightbattleship to suport the victoryclass so yeah battleship guns need to be bigger and carriers should be largerin arguement to your original arguement the battleship iowa has big guns for killing big ships and bombarding entire enemy fleets and the bigger a ship is the bigger its guns have to be in order to counter other ships of the same weight class in other words a decent battleship cannon whether laser or artillery or wahtnot should look as if it would have the ability to rip a smaller ship in half without effort not saying it should be able to just as far as appearance wise because lets face it shields and armor can do funny things
not biting here you have an impressive knowledge about sw lore which means you have an impressive collection of sw fan literature congrats so 200 turbolasers on a isd and still a carrier hmm i think that the lucasarts games created to date would disagree with you but fiction justifications aside do you actually have any real numbers on the sizes of the turbolasers i would have thought that this would be the most obvious argument you can use ok let me google that for you and end your argument with a picture gee looks about the same tiny sizes as eve ships huh funny thatplease visit your user settings to reenable images according to thesemodel specs why the stress because sw lore is full of inconsitencies often which stir up a lot of fan debates non of which is our primary concern here so dont use these for any basis of argument just illustrating how futile a fictional lore argument can be star wars empire at war star wars rebellion to name 2 that i know victory class acclimator class are just inferior isds in every way according to fictional specs  unless you speak for lucasartslucasfilms you should not be commenting on what you think the roles of sw ships are or their design methodologies or their functions going down this path will turn this debate into a lore vs lore discussion which should be left in the realm of sw geeks as they rarely result in any meaningful conclusions
first off the link is just them trying to use the type of special effects used in the movie to create ideas about the lasers and you cut out half my arguement and that is that in rl cannons on a ship are designed to defeat other ships of specific weight classes as in a us navy destroyers little artillery piece would take forfrakkin ever to do seveere structural damage to a battleship unless you get a lucky shot off at at either fuel or ammunition storage while a battleships cannons are designed to take out anything they can hitmy whole point is that small cannons regardless of the size of the ship they are equipped to can only take down targets of an appropriate weight class and considering that on a ship the size of a lets say abbadon armor plating on a ship that size just to ensure structural integrity would be prettyd amn thick meaning only really big ass guns would be able to punch a significant hole in it so it just doesnt look right that battleship cannons are that small the cannons at the size they are at now look like they could at most punch a couple tiny holes in another battleship which doesnt even seem threatening realistically a gun that would do significant damage to an abbadon or appriopriate weightclasss ship would ahve to be massive same with capital ships theres a reason why battleships had the 4 or 5 depending on what style battleship your talking about had those huge artyillery cannons on them while destroyers even today only have a couple singlebarrel artillery turrets
did you actually read it instead of summarily assuming that i didnt hint jump to the part with the following lineit is also interesting to note that an early concept drawing of an imperator class star destroyer by geoffrey mandel describes three different sizes of laser cannons also note that there are a total of 200 tl cannons mounted on the vessel i was just providing it as a reference like any good debater does  just google for the rest if you want to read up on the other stuff about sw tls because your argement is silly you are using real life logic to try to justify things in a science fiction genre essentially you are saying to all the film makers and scifi creators of the world that their artistic decision isnt practical exception being the anime genre which i have previously pointed outwell the reason i refuse to engage you on this fiction argument is because it can lead to no where if you want to argue real life ships then do so on another noneve forum if you want to argue sw physics then as long as you stay within lucasarts fictional canon of laws then we can discuss that but it is a fallacy to make arguments that span fictional universes andor reality to justify propositions in othersand besides your reality argument doesnt even hold water in the sw universe isds and sw capital ships all have proportionally small turrets and they do in fact shoot each other to pieces as anybody who has seen any sw movies can attest toedit  and who are you to decide what is practical this is science fiction not science fact
can we now move on without star wars
no we cantfakt ist that a stardestroyer empire class is armed with 60 turbo lazors 60 ion cannonz and all the tie fightersmy battleship only got 16 guns so they have to be big
oh you should have imo big guns on your battleship but never reason with star wars in any form in eve ever
i think turrets are in scale to the ship when compared to their caliber so i dont support any rescaling without a changing the caliber or rescaling the ships themselves with the new mauler being the first and thus at the moment the only ship that is in scale ccp indirectly admitted that current ship models are not in scale whereas i feel like the turrets could be when measuring and calculating the relations some are too big some are too small however overall turret scale seems to be believablethe 800m autocannon is 14m long on a 1000m long mach this is just 14 of the ships length the problem is not the cannons being too small its rather a mismatch between shipsize and caliber as the turrets are in scale more or less if you just make the canons bigger it breaks the scale the muzzle of a 1200mm artie is supposed to be 12m in diameter  not 12m or 120m eveni will support this if you add the demand to rework the calibers to stay in scale with the bigger turrets and the future ship sizes
oh i already made the shipsize caliber comparison showing the scale is used from real life naval bs its from this threadcomparing pictures of the bismarck and the hurricane with 720mm will show you that the turrets are not in scale as intended because they are supposed to look biggercan you accept this explanationi admit that all that talk is difficult without having something like the international prototype meter in eve
in the future would it be possible to break the list down into basic sections mining manufacturing ui null sec misc wh space empire drones balancing etcim trying to go through and narrow down what i want but im finding myself staring at this giant list of stuff
helloi see in the proposal here 
supportedseeing how the boosters market will be expanded in the later iterations of incarna this may help bring more demand for boosters as players fail to pay other player their dues when they they caught at the gatehowever as a side note there is an item in the july 2011 prioritization crowdsourcing list that mentioned about allowing covert cynos in high sec so i have no clue how that could effect demand assuming it becomes a priority at all for the csm
hmmm ive been copying to my alts the bookmarks that ive been collecting im now noticing that in a massimporttopeopleplaces operation for bookmarks it takes about 14 seconds for each bookmark to be imported my alt has 13000 bookmarks thirteen thousand and it looks like importing another thousand bookmarks is taking four hours

helloweve all had times when weve spotted someone in wh space but they were gone  cloaked up before you could get their name i am proposing a tweak to the wh local mechanics in that if you spot someone in the system they get added to the local member listnow heres the twist they are only added to your local if you are the only one that spots someone they do not show up on your corpmates local or anybody else in system and obviously you wont know when the player leaves system just like it is today if you speak in locali think this would be a valuable feature for intelgathering while not compromising the secrecy of wh space this would also make it easier to add people who show up to contacts and watchlist since you wont have to type their name out and can just drag them to your contacts list again you will not show up on local unless you are spotted uncloaked and even then you only show up on the spotters localthoughts

i like it sounds hard to encode 1 for them to look into it though
no thats dumbits perfectly fine the way it is if you cant find someone in time to see who they are from your fleeting glimpse as they warp off then to baddef do not support adding any sort of extra intel features in wspace local one of the main attractions of wspace for a lot of people is the complete lack of local functionality so long as you dont speakyou want good intel learn to cov ops better or go back to kspacealso why would you make a post supporting you own suggestion right below it remember to switch to your alt next time
not much of a twist at all is it youll just drag their name into corp chat from your local chat and say spotted this guy youre basically asking for exactly what local wasnt meant to be in wh space an intel tool
so now you can just park your scout on an active wh and walk awayas a karate expert i do not support thiswho does this right click on target in overview show info add contact done
almost everyone supports their own post it was not my intention to post with another alt of course you will im not saying that you wont however i gave that example to show that they wont show up on anybody else localyou raise a valid point i did not think of that
i agree its not like your ships sensors cant record this data when you arent paying attention
its not like you should have to play the game or anythingyou want instant intel and safety go to kspacethere is absolutely nothing wrong with wh local

okay so this isnt a new idea but a summary of my thoughts on its potential implementation and how it can both add new depth to the game while at the same time allowing for some rebalancing issues that gallente players have been whining about for a while crew yes its not my idea it has been around for a bit im not going to go into the details of the proposals already out there on the topic as the credit for them belong to others the most popular to date wasthe one by greg vaganza which made crew gives bonuses to modsmy proposal is aligned to the one where crew affect the performance of your modules on your ship each ship needs a complement of crew which you can buy on the market price should differ depending on region as npc corps will sell crew just like skillbooks now here is the other point crew will not boost any existing performance of a module it will instead become a requirement for modules to function at 100 spec lose crew and your modules start underperforming game terms this will be penalties applied to mods due to losing crew but kael you ask this will gimp people as is and add a fuel to the use of modules in a manner of speaking well yes it does in a way but the alternative is more dangerous having crew add bonuses to existing modules may break existing game balances of module performances okay its a risk either way but im leaning on the making crew necessary as opposed to a optional bonus the reasons for this hopefully will be obvious later on in the post when your ship gets structure damage you will start losing crew lives hardy crew may be able to withstand more damage before dying where weaker breeds of crew will dies quickly perhaps base this on crew experience which cab be earned  making players attached to their veteran crew perhaps veteran crew can even give bonuses to select modules or overheating mechanicsthe gallente problem gallente pilots complain all the time about their ships being generally unfavorable when compared against their racial equivalents these arguements while flawed because they always come from people speaking purely from a pvp and fleet battle perspective still have a bit of merit after the web nerf the common response is to buff hybrids but this is a messy solution as it will also affect caldari causing a potential buffnerf tailspin to infinity why not instead give gallente ships a very small crew complement requirement they are the lords of drones and automation afterall minmatar should require the most crew or have system failure penalties higher than other ships they are made quite flimsy afterall but kaelie what about wormholers yes they will have to now carry some extra crew with them into wormholes its a but of a hit and im hoping others may have some good ideas on how to mitigate this side effects to game mechanicsbattleships with lots of crew can take a lot of structure damage  and resulting crew deaths  without much affect to their performance frigates on the otherhand will suffer the most from loss of crews as they have small composites and cannot afford to lose too many this potentially opens up a new type of tank the crew tank ships that can suffer huge crew losses without much penalties to their performance other possibilitiesweapons that attack and kill crew essentially inflicting damage on the enemy ships performance while leaving the ship itself undamaged minmatar crew can be used in place of amarrian crew for amarrian ships emp damage to stucture does not harm crew this is just a rough idea thread and stands on the shoulders of many older crew proposals but i felt the need to put my thoughts on this with the angle of using it to bring balance to gallente without changing any other game balance using this tunable mechanic which adds depth to the game involves the market as a commodity and fits within the gallente story somewhat
also to the hybrid lobbyists out there the fact that hybrids cannot use onboard guidance systems most often quoted as a gripe about hybrids vs projectiles actually becomes a boon with crew dynamics not using inboard tracking means losing crew doesnt affect hybrid tracking while on the other hand kill off enough of a matari crew and the projectile tracking speeds get a serious penalty as do lasers and missile rate of fires etc im thinking along the lines of each module having a crew requirement and unless your ships has the excess crew available to man the module you wont be able to online the mod something like cpu or grid requirements as you lose crew in mods or structure damage you can refill the mods with crew if you have excess in the ship or live with reduced mod performance the inspiration for this idea came from starcontrol for those of you too young to remember google it starcon ships hitpoints were its crew complement  the crew served no other purpose other than as a tactical target for your enemies to exploit thus you need to protect them if you want your ship to continue functioning currently eve has no damage mechanics  damage does not affect your ability to fight besides thermo damage which is binary  crew gives the possibility of this new dynamic and tactics that will come from it
i like some of the ideas and general direction adding a lot of depth to ships for the most part crew on ships are their to maintain and repair systems they are not manually reloading missiles as such all of this is being done by automation and controlled by computer systems on your ship so crew dying only is really going to effect the ability to maintain and repair systems all of the core functions of the ship are controlled by the capsuleer with this in mind you could have it so modules take damage like when you overload them the damage they take is dependent on the incoming damage to your ship the more crew you have a live and or the better trained the crew the longer they can repair module damage and keep them from burning out so what happens when you actually want to overload you do away with thermodynamics and heat system replacing it with ship crew when you overload your push your systems beyond 100 they will burn out and fail after a certain amount of time like they do now however the quality of your crew allows you to run them for longer before a burn out replacing the 25 heat damage from thermodynamics the other nice thing would be crew repair modules over time like nanite paste so crew has a peak performance to repair modules better trained crews have higher peak performance allowing you to take more module damage or overload for longer before the crew is overcome and unable to keep the module working and it burns out then ad a new aspect to the game and treat crew a little like bpos where you can research them and improve their production quality you can buy cheap crew hands at any station but they wont be highly trained a rag tag crew of misfits however you might invest training your crew it would allow you to train and sell crew on the market better longer trained crews selling for more money obviously other rare or not so rare items might be combined with the training to specialise them making faction navy crews or whatever and these crews might sell for a lot more isk but be way better training or even specialise in certain areas where you might get a bonus to heat and or operation of the modules
i like your crew training ideathough im not convinced on the getting rid of thermodynamics mechanic completely i wanted to keep the proposal as minimally disruptive to existing play balance as possible which means not uprooting any existing system which may upset balance but im willing to bow to the popular opinion on this it is a valid variant to the ideai dont think its necessary have the crew only just to repair things the capsuleer may control everything but the performance of the mods can very easily depend on crew for instance you have a turret with 04 rads tracking you have always taken for granted that it works at 04 but the unsaid fact is that it works as designed when sufficiently crewed if you lose sufficient crew for the turret then it starts to under perform the only diff between a capsuleer ship with this turret and an npc ship with the same turret is that the npc boat will need much more crew for the turret to work  spec basing from some of the arguments put forth in the latest eon article on crew
so that doesnt help gallente at all it just makes them cheaper
i
i dont understand why its not possible to use a t1 ship in the game except for mission i mean except bs and bc there is no use of t1 ship is it possible to rebalance bonus of ship or create new role for those ships second if you look at the 20 best ship in the game why is there any gallente in pvp world at the moment you have four kinds of fleetnano ships i run more faster than you ishtar nano hum no rangealpha fleet hum i have 500 tempest you will die primary megathron railgun  lol dpsbaddon fleet no ammo big dps good range good tank megathron blaster lol range lol tank  you are more than 500m cap fleet  cool cyno open  5s later station down bye noob we are too strong for you thana nyx erebusso except nyx and erebus where are gallente ships in all of that  and moreover where is the balance between all races  between all kinds of ships 
this belongs to assembly hall because  
the problem with the lack of gallente and caldari ships is that hybrids are underpowered and nonturret weapons arent popular in fleet pvp as far as tech 1 frigates and destroyers not being used thats usually just because almost any pilot can afford and bring at least a battlecruiser tech 2 frigates are about as cheap if not cheaper than the pilots who fly them so nobody cares much for joe cadet and his atroni will say this however electronic warfare has a way of making small ships suck if your opponent is using any kind it makes you perform disproportionately better in larger ships i believe therefore that electronic warfare should be revamped such that it doesnt single out small ships as much  make medium and large stasis webifiers which have slightly reduced effect when used against small ships they should still be effective against small ships but its a bit unfair when your frigate becomes a sitting duck because a guy in a hyperion used 3 webifiers on you your frigate likely doesnt even have 3 midslots and now he can hit you with large railguns likewise small webifiers should be less effective on larger ships since its equally unfair when his hyperion can now be hit by dreadnoughts just because you put 3 webifiers on your cheapo rifter larger webifiers should also have a slightly longer range bhaalgorns shouldnt be the only battleship that can put webs on a slippery target big ships cant move much so their weapons have longer range ewar should do the sameheres some possible statssmall webifier  8km rangemedium webifier  12km rangelarge webifier  16km rangesmall webifier vs large ship or large webifier vs small ship  60 effectivenessmedium webifier vs small or large ship or small or large webifier vs medium ship  80 effectivenesswebifiers like target painters should have a diminishing return when several are used it should not be possible for opponents to slow you down to 8 speed a frigate cannot even take cruiser weapon fire very well it doesnt need to be vulnerable to battleship fire to go down quickly this change by itself might fix webs without the above mentioned changejust food for thought
an easy way to reduce blobs is to make game mechanics where pilots need to be at several distant places at once in different types of ships fw almost had this right in its plexing mechanic but ccp screwed it up by putting a bunch of npcs in there and not letting players know when plexes were being taken
i think the answer is not to restrict people from blobbing but to give solo pilots more tools for dealing with groups widerrange aoe or ecm pulse weapons might do it multiplewarhead missiles chain attacks think mutalisks from starcraft no advantage over a lone enemy but good for hurting several close enemies launchable decoyshowever this will likely just delay the inevitableits a drawback of fighting in 360 degree open space if this were earth terrain you could break up enemy hordes by using choke points and geographic barriers in space theres nothing you can use you will ultimately need to bring your own swarm if you want to win engagements with swarms
i think its good to make minor disadvantages for huge fleets and there should not be extra bonuses for it either bigger fleets should tend to win but a 100player unskilled fleet should not tend to beat an 80player skilled fleet do this and drake blobs will become a noobish tactic overshadowed by well planned fleets with mostly ships that arent drakes
yeah i agree
if you do not get the final blow for a kill the kill log should still be shown in your kills i hate chasing whoever has the kill log to see what was destroyed

hahahahahahit takes 45 years to make enough isk after paying for the building materials to pay the bpo cost no one imo ownes a t2 bpo to make isk on the stuff it builds it is an investment at least thats how i and all the bpo owners i know think of it yes we make more isk then invention but they are not the printing machines your jealousy has made them out to besince we are on this subject it took years for chribba darkness and a few others to build up enough trust and reputation to be able to sucessfully run a third party service that i will never be able to have so i propose that ccp remove third party services why should they have an isk printing machine and not mei also understand that some people are making isk buying bpos researching them and selling copies they are making isk out of thin air they worked hard and spent time researching etc saved enough isk to buy a good bpo i propose that ccp nerf bpos so that they cannot be copied put an stop to all forms of isk printingoh yeah modules should never drop when a ship is destroyed everything should die why shoujld people that wait patiently and put effort into piracy make any iskmining to just because you can bot a few asteroids why should you be able to create isk out of thin airman this could get exhaustive in fact how about we close the markets so people cannot buy low and sell high why should people be able to create isk by saving up their isk until they have enough to buy commodities and then the patience to resell them when the market improvesthis is getting fun i love looking really stupid in forums just like the op no wonder he is doing it
i was thinking to enable a bit of sport in the gameit will be great to add a feature to enable match and bet on those match with rulesexplainationit will be great if we had a system to organize fair match team a versus b where the bet cant be superior at the maxpriceshipteamsumpriceshipandfitlike this no cheat in the match for that its needed to have a special fleetwhen you are in those fleets you will be able to fight each other in any space sec and enable the tv featuretv with the grid centered on one ship where if each ship is a node i center on the max density of this graphlarge viewand to watch from iniside look at on the ship which is on tv
sounds like this should be in the bugs forum instead
missle bugmore drone bugssame problemps its not on the known issues page maybe try to file a bug report in again
ive posted in here to bring the attention of this fault to the csm i have already submitted a bug report however i did not know that there was a similar issue with missiles i wonder if any other modules are effected by this lack of skillsbonuses being appliedplease pressure ccp to get this fixed asap as this is a gameplay issue
maybe you misunderstood the purpose of this forum this should normally be used for topics that require debate or discussion if its a bug then i think reporting it is good enough i wouldnt bother going through csm which is more of a mediary party to discuss player ideas before proposing to ccp for a bug when you are likely going to get faster response in forums which ccp reads more directly or making a bug report petition which will be the quickest i think
allow the purchase of faction ammo in higher quantities at the same rate at present you can for example buy 5k rf large ammo for 24k lp and 24m isk i would like to be able to buy 50k rf large ammo for 24k lp and 24m isk and 500k rf large ammo for 240k lp and 240m isk it is absurd that it actually takes longer to convert the lp from a blitzed level 5 mission than to do the mission itself the ui is simply incapable of handling large volumes
fap fap fap fapso glad i voted for him
i dont know if it is possible but could we have a recall vote on mitanni its pretty obvious that he does not have the interests of the majority of eve players in mind on the contrary he appears to hold most in some sort of contempt if he is openly stating that the sole reason for his running for election was in the interest of a narrow exclusive part of the game is he a fit and proper person to be sitting on the csm obviously i wont be holding my breath on this just saying
where do you draw that conclusion from1 this forums consenus holds no weight it is not representive of any eve community at large for one many players do not participate with any forums whatsoever second there is a large percentage of bittervets and nullsec players that avoid these forums on account of their inconceivable levels of stupid2 nullsec is not narrow or exclusive you too can play in nullsec if you wanted whether or not you want to is irrelevant there are many many people playing the nullsec game and many of these people have more than two accounts some of these accounts are based in highsec vastly inflating the highsec majority of playersthe mittani had the lions share of votes from accounts that bothered to vote its pretty simple really
well if the discussions about hisec representation have not convinced you by now that we need to put up a slate of hisec candidates fro the next csm perhaps the following diatribe from mittani might well arrogant is one way of putting it contemptuous of and derelict in his duty to all the players of eve selfserving selfrighteous might be a few more that he might like to add to his cv as for the number of votes cast in his favour as pt barnum is reputed to have said you can fool some of the people all the time  those people who voted for candidates from 00 and are now being ignored or worse might like to reconsider who they cast a vote for next time
there are no hisec representatives in the csm because there were no hisec candidates that were as voteworthy as the 9 best 00 candidates
leave it to a carpal tunnel syndrome victim to come with an answer like thatthere might be that other reason that 00 blockvoted like mad to get their candidates in and due to the fact there were too many high sec candidates which couldnt get a blockvote the dispersion of votes there kept em out
my point exactly we need to have a slate of credible hisec candidates to ensure that we are adequately represented on the next csm to ensure that the our interests are adequately protected which with the current csm is not going to happen
a credible highsec candidate would have to be campeigning long before anyone else due to the fact he or she would essentially be rallying a playerbase that is incredibly diverse lazy and fearfulhazarding a glance at the highsec forum names that would have a shot at garnering such support i dont see anyone whos game to do it so if you want your opinions better represented and youre tired of our 00 politics hogging the show i suggest you get out there and find a candidate whos willing to take on this task and be damned sure theyre good at epolitics
thank you for making me smileactually roar with laughterlooking at the current  representatives  i can say that being good at epolitics is the last thing one can say of them
say what you will about the mittani but he has pretty much won eve politicspeople who dont know very much about eve like to spout off about the nullsec block of sheep voting for their alliance leader overlords but each one of those sheep is a real person with 5 or 6 accounts most likely who is genuinely interested in nullsec affairs and on average far more organized than the average highsec dweller voting for an alliance leader doesnt make a nullsec player any less of an individual just a smarter selfinterested onenullsec needs to offer a far more gratifying reward than highsec thats the risk vs reward mentality of eve the fact that players congregate into large blocs to mitigate that risk is the natural outcome of our species politcal naturewhy shouldnt these large alliances of people who are forced to work together in a game where trust is nigh impossible be given greater access to resources than a person who logs in for a few hours a week to play a single player game
the current reps were elected by voting blocks at the alliancecoalition level so their need to politik is not as dire as someone whos representing a veritable hoard of unrelated mission runners miners traders industrialist suicide gankers wardecers explorers and whatever else the highsec carebears do i wouldnt go so far as to say theyre politically inept mittens seems to have a much larger fanbase than just gs and co evidenced by the fact he got many more votes than were cast by his constituentsbut yes any rep for the squalid masses is going to need massive epolitical clout on the level of chribba to even begin to draw out the numbers needed to compete with nullsec blocks since i more often than not find myself agreeing with the alliance reps i dont really care if this happens or not but im really skeptical of anyone who suggests it could happen
well if you had bothered to read the whole thread it may have given you a clue that this is what it is all about im not saying that getting hisec organised behind a slate of credible candidates is going to be easy it is true that the people in hisec are individualistic in temperament and not easy to organise i refute your implication that we are lazy and fearful the socialistic nature of 00 is not something that appeals to me and i suspect many others why work for the priviledge of fitting someone else out with a titan no the contempt and disdain that it obvious in the utterances of people connected with 00 seems to me to be a more than convincing argument for getting a counterweight to the selfserving attitude of the 00 representatives on the current csm anyone wanting to contact me in game is more than welcome this is going to be hard to pull off but it needs to be done for the sake of the game
look out nullsec jaxon grylls is on the case
is that kinda like bear grylls but in highsex
good luck with that if being social doesnt appeal to you though im almost certain youre off to a poor start of course stranger people have been elected
i am fairly certain i roamed null sec before mittens even thought about starting in evei have done about anything eve has to offer from missionrunning to sov war small pvp solo pvp industry in all aspects trade etcthe null sec players however have to realise that they can nerf high sec to hell but that will mean they will nerf their 00 game too since high sec cant exist without null sec and visa versanull sec messed up a lot of the null sec life themselves but instead at looking how they themselves fecked things up its easier to point in other directionsccp made it possible to blue a lot of other alliances and corporations so they blue eachother to death in a few big coalitions and then they cry that 00 becomes stagnantthere are enough options to increase a commercial infrastructure in null sec but the very nature of null sec dwellers messes that up for themselvesow and yes you can look at my kb stats and find them wanting a lot but guess what those stats mean jack cause they tell only a small insignificant part of the whole picture
go read up on game theory and come back when your donealliance bloc proliferation is unavoidable in a sandbox especially as the game grows
the only thing thats keeping the art team busy is world of darkness and possibly dust
yes i think debingjos has it right cq is only a symptom of what is going on in the background it looks to me as if ccp are trying to kill two or more birds with one stone buff eve and at the same time reuse the artwork for dust etc no wonder the art dept are busy
how come the only gallente topic is ewar you really didnt think hybrids might be more of an issueplease please please explain

maybe it would be wise to address and add some gameplay features before fixing the shipsadd new modules for example burst warp immediately warp 50km forward draining 75 of max capgive guns accuracy and ships hit area so that fewer shots hit if target is further away or if ship is smalleradd stuff to grids asteroid 150km from a gate station 150km from that gate and asteroid concord base 200km away from all those other elemens you can then warp around between those points during combatcooldown based modules would make the game more exciting and tactical than just activate and watch it roll forever for example ecm effect duration 4sec cooldown 20sec  no more complete lockdown mwdwith more powerful acceleration 15sec duration 60sec cooldownthere are hundreds of ways to make combat more exciting just look at other games maybe its just me but i think eve pvp is just waiting for an hour and then target set orbit and fire
careful anna your ad hominem arguments if i can even call them that are not becoming you and indeed showing lack of objectivity on your part detracting credibility from any sound argument that you may have made in the past im going to ignore your points as they were nothing more than unsubstantiated personal jibes directed at me from an uneducated position made to illicit some emotion response though on your war zone point corps pay concord to be able to fight wars and fighting a war is not against the rules of concorddestabilizing change is a sudden jump in mineral prices but anyway this was a digression a point i made only to inform one previous poster wasnt you i believe that if you killed all the miners everyone in new eden is affected
go right ahead after all that is what someone does when she cant refute it once again ure not mentally capable of getting the fact that ignoring everything isnt gonna get your selfserving idea considered but hey maybe ure the one trying to troll so go right ahead neither is allowing insurance for criminal losses in high sec or low sec u just simply dont like the high sec partactually u stated to me the same thing in an earlier post to which i stated time and time again whatever depression scenario ure describing isnt the case with eve which makes your scenario the digression as u even stated like i said before ignoring everything isnt gonna get your idea through but ure here to try and troll then continueid love to hear it
no actually continually to make metapersonal arguments is exactly what one does when they run out of logical ones like what you are doing please do go on thoughi would like to point out that just because you said that my depression scenario wont work doesnt mean its true without some backup facts to your counter postulate for which i am still waiting for so what is your reasoning that this wont happen in eve again is it now im doing your work for you here by trying to guess what you meant because eve has infinite minerals if so then your argument is on shaky ground because without miners all the unmined minerals in the universe cant keep the prices from shooting up if you do have any other reason that you think so please do share
i think ccp should implement an afk mechanic and anyone who goes afk from not moving their mouse or doing anything for a while will be decloaked if youre actually sitting there looking at your screen when it happens no problem just recloak afk decloaking should not activate the recloak timerthat way people have to at least check up on their afk cloaky once in a while its one thing to hold up a system its another thing entirely to go to the bar while your character holds up a system
i think the solution is quite obvious sov 00 needs an upgrade that raises the sec status of the system so people can bot in peace protected by concord there still might be problems with suicidegankers though but im sure that another system upgrade involving increasing ship resists to 100 would solve thatafter all eve is supposed to be a sandbox so if people want nullsec to be an effortfree perfectly safe carebear paradise then ccp must respect their wishes
fine by me and i presume all the alk cloakers out there thanks for the solutionill just leave this herenerfcloak whiners need to stfu protect your space if you want it nice and safe dont cry to you mom demanding that ccp changes the game to make it easiuer for you
i dont live in 00 so forgive me if this suggestion is naive but here goes an alliance could create its own afk cloaker insurance fund everyone pays a modest premium and on the rare occasion that an afk cloaker actually decloaks and kills a ship or two the owners get a full refund therefore if you see an afk cloaker on local you could still keep mining ratting or whatever without worrying since youll get all your stuff back even if he comes after youthis is one way to adapt to afk cloakers without any kind of rule change by ccp
i dont know what exactly is being done with ccp on this subject but i know they are doing something about it i dont have the exact source but 1 dev wrote somewhere here that they are working on the problem i dont know if it will be out on the winter expansion but it will go outand yes i agree something should be done about this since theres no counter whatsoever about this afk cloakymy guess is they will make sure that cloaky will appear on scan when using probes i guess but really idk what they will do
they are doing something about it where is your sourcethis is all by the by now anyway as a nerf to local is incoming with many changes to be madeas it is local that is the issue here not the cloak
i see no problem here sticking a cloaked alt in another system to monitor what is happening there is the same as using a spy or recon unit in real warfare to find out what your enemies are up tomost big alliances and any serious null sec fleet commander uses these to watch for counter attacks coming from neighboring systemsthere are some players that leave alts logged in 237 sitting cloaked in a system just to grieve the locals but this is not really an issue once you know who these are you can just ignore them if they are afk they are no threat they can not attack you they can not tell anyone else you are there if they do attack you or tell there intel channel they you are in that system then they are obviously not afk the players that exploit this mechanic are not a threat as they are afk the players that are a threat are obviously not afk and thus not exploiting using this mechanic as intended for stealth covert ops and spying
actually one idea that might actually fix thisif players were removed from local chat while they are cloaked this will actually increase the covert ops side of the game that spys could be in system without being seen until they make a hostile action at the same time afk cloakers will not be able to grieve because if nobody knows they are there and they do nothing hostile they will just be ignored as they should be in order to balance this however they should add some sort of anti covert ops mechanic a way that someone can specialize in tracking down a covert ops vessel the whole point of covert ops is that knowbody knows you are there until you attack but if they go to the point of removing all non aggressed covert ops cloaked pilots from local we need to have a way of detecting them by actively looking for them when we suspect they are in the system
since theres no counter whatsoever about this afk cloaky are you on drugs or just really really lame you cant think of anything nullsec players can do to defend against a lone afk cloakermay i please know which nullsec system you inhabit id like to run my covert ops ship out there and permacloak on an alt since it obviously scares the crap out of you d this is so cool  i can shut down a system with one ship and apparently nothing can be done about it whoopmeanwhile back in reality if you cant think of a single way to deal with a lone afk cloaker youre either a carebear botter renting a 00 system or have never actually been in 00 yourself either way  wouldnt a game like wow be better suited for you
can you say insurance fraud
in this discussion cowards are ground to inactivity by a single unseen ship and expect ccp to come and hold their hands for them in what is deemed dangerous space
cosmetic only or no either way im not saying yes and i want my vote to count against those who do say yes
oh my god yeswhen ccp release a full wis multiplayer environment people will use it however it still needs to be optional as suggested by the opwhy would i go through all the process of having my pod removed from the center of my ship go through the annoyance of being ejected from my pod showering off the goo and getting dressed in my 1000 japanese boutique jeans to get a bit of ammo put into my cargo hold
proposal i have been doing cosmos missions for amarr i got lots and lots of blueprints which are totally useless as they cost several times their tech 2 equivalent and they are worsei checked the contracts  players dont buy any not the blueprint not even the finished product they sell for peanuts and the contracts all expire because of the takmahl modules neededit is a joke a bad one they are all meta 6 7 8  and nobody is interested who decided this and what where they thinking  the materials cost several times their t2 equivalent and they are barely better than meta 4scheck the contracts the players are not stupid nobody wants to buy cosmos blue prints i got 20 in my station and arent worth the paper they are written in this is a basic balancing issue i would like to know if you are aware of this and if anyone is doing something about it please dont say they are a collectors item or worth it there are no buy orders for either the blueprint or the finished product and in the rare cases  a meta 45 will be 510 times cheaper with similar performancethis doesnt require any cosmos missions redos just modify blueprints material manufaturing requirementsit has been more than 2 months noone from stellar council said a word or came back to me in game or eve ill remember this on election time i request you do the sameno more free holidays for this council of stellar management not with my votethey are supossed to be representing the playersthe least they could do is read players proposals vote on them and give an answer and put it in the to do listall the stupid furore about noble exchange  ccp was never going to think about super modulesammo ships for real money  they are not suicidalthank you for your votes up at least some players are readingthis would take a couple of days coding if that by 1 person
i see no reason why you shouldnt be able to change your name so long as you retain all standings and have an alias history similar to corp and alliance history if it is a tool used to avoid negative consequences then there is a problem
no one has been able to refute this as yet
i had a long response to each one of your points but ive reached the extent of my caring to argue any more of your trivial nitpicky half justified retorts they will only serve to drag me into a tooth and nails catfight of a debate which no longer is serving any purpose or reason hey thats why i said call a vote already you seem to revel in debating every moot point to the level of absurdity making any counter argument logical or otherwise that anyone may give only adding to the massive digression from the topic at hand and us further from any satisfactory conclusionyou have many who have stated in very clear terms the problems with your proposal and problems with the proposed solutions you offered to the problem unless you have any new ideas this thread is dead to me ask for a vote or not i really do not care either way or continue to bump your own thread with no new insights until you get tired of it the nays have spoken the ball is in your courtthe fact that you have taken to arguing with me with personal vigor is proof enough that you feel that if you can somehow trump me then everyone will rally for your cause in truth its just serving to show how dead this debate is and how you have completely lost your objectivity pointing that out to you is my parting gift to you for your valiant show of tenacity only a vote will reveal if you have managed to convince anyone of merit of this proposals worth kael
this is a debate forumi take it youre ignoring my post
that brings a tear to my eye jagga  friendly bump for support
i think it is more that people just dont care to refute your constant ignorance that you show in every thread you post to
i dont know how you got so much support but i think your proposal is absurd firstly your point that someone with implants wouldnt want to jump clone out to do nullsec roams has debunked itself people with implants can and do go outside of highsecby using jump clones i do it all the time having implants in most of the time is great but taking a few hours weeks even in nullsec can totally be worth itits all choosing how best you use what you have removing the implants removes that choice you may as well force players to fly the race of ship that matches their character thatll make everything a lot simpler
i dont only like this i love thismore moneycirculation more things to craft and possible more nullsec visits from alot of players but please make those ladarcites spawn in lowsec more often1
im curious to know where you got that impression i was just doing my due diligence in questioning oversights i see in the proposal im a little confused though at how you have gone from your original plan of to remove just the basic non pirate onesokay if we are to work with your new proposal just remove the non pirate ones then how does this solve your original problem of highsec people not wanting to go to null for fear of losing them especially when they are orders of magnitude more than the regular 15 implants if im missing something do let me know but it seems a little incongruentto more directly answer your perceived problem though and forgive me if someone said it already is to use jumpclones they are easy to get and any highsec person will get one for null sec playtime i therefore counter propose that any perceived problem of highsecers afraid of nullsec or nullsecers not training fast enough is not a real problem with jumpclones
yea ive been presumed by many on the forums to be many things but never pvp until now ill add that to my collection of baseless accusations i have gotten truth is i argue on the side of reason and balance whichever it may be
1as a player who spent most of his time pvping in null sec i have mostly used 3 and 4 implants only the difference this makes over the 4 years i played could be well over 6 million skill pointscarebears have all the advantages of safety in high sec 
i support this idea however id peraonally would like to see them removed completely without a replacement apart from giving everyone 5 in attributes it would be the easier solution and would still have the same benifit without adding a slightly strange new mechanic to the game
how would i go about doing that im sure there are 00 fix me threads out there ill try to find one
i support anything that means more monocles are destroyed
i havent reached the serverside limit of 50 fittings yet but only because im too damn lazy to import my hundred fittings from efti can understand the frustration this is causing people
1completely support thisi also think its unreasonable to think they can sell extra fitting space if you want us to pay money then give us something of value worth paying above our subscriptions not for cheap limitations
let the players modify a little the ship apparel add decals and colorsand please dont add aur madness to this
why not aur i mean rationally speaking its a vanity thing and also having a custom job will require some more server power on ccp side for storing the extra bitmaps for each player which means a cost for them i think they are justified in asking you to pay for it dont get me wrong i would love it if it were free but arguing for capitalism sake i see that this would actually be something that the could sell for aur that people may actually buy which wont peeve off the antirm activists
fully supoported i really dont understand why it was changed it was working just fine as it was
absolutely support the change to ctrl key functionality is horrible
thank you spank for speaking up for truth and justice
why wouldnt a person just open the escape menu select the shortcut tab select the combat tab select the lock target shortcut and click the clear shortcut buttona person can change it to any other key if the targeting with keyboard is still neededunless the control key still causes problems when it isnt set as a shortcut
this would stop the random locking of ships when using a ctrlwhatever shortcutwhat it wouldnt fix is the usability that existed prior to the keyboard shortcut changes and you just end up with a different key with has exactly the same problems1 cannot freeze overview without risk of locking a random ship2 cannot function key  left click to targets ships of your choosing without risk of a random object being locked
it doesnt randomly lock ships it locks whatever you have selected in the overview if the overview has focus if you havent clicked in the overview and click out in space or some other window first so the overview isnt in focus then you can ctrlleft click stuff in spaceor are we just talking about just having a shortcut that freezes the overview
we are talking about both it is poorly implemented at presentit might be acceptable for someone in a mission running corp such as yourself but even so there are plenty of mission runners that also find this frustrating in a pvp situation it is highly unintuitive and liable to get you killed
ok so am i to understand that the freezing ability and the locking ability come as a package with this shortcut
can we haz a fix please
ctrl and alt both modifier keys should act on release if commands are programmed directly to themalso option to disable entire apply functions to item which is selectd from overview would be really kewl
1ill come back in six months and see if they fixed it or not
please explain why it is important for a hauled to be able to recharge their capacitor while cloakedunless your trolling of course
not empty quoting
spoken like someone whoes never warped across resbroko pthe idea is good but 100 is ott a 5075 decrease would be nice though
this and sometimes i like to be able to reengage my mwd after i drop cloak why do you need a cap recharge while cloaked
those who need cap after decloak just have to fit a cap boosterone less highslot the better for what those highslots anyway on a non combatal ship and the combatal less dps fine as well they want to cloack they have to accept penaltiesalternative fly in fleet and there is no need to cloak right100 cap reload while cloacked is fine there is no problem as long as it been dealed the right way
and this a bad thing because everyone should have the ability to haul goods through dangerous space at no risk other than the cargothe raison detre of blockade runners is to fill this niche why bother with br at all if it can be done in dirt cheap flying canswhy should system size matter at all if it is big you have a long warp in which to regen if it is small the warpinitialization takes an insignificant amountif it is so big that your cloaky hauler cannot make it in one warp after a mwd burst then your problem is that you are not using the proper ship for the job or fitted it to compensate bet even a small battery is enough to account for lost regen  isnt that is after all what eve is all about
its like when youre a parent and your two griping kids wont give up on fighting over candy then one of them says they can settle it if you buy licorice for one and mint for the othersupported because i dont see any problems with it and somebody else wants it
i am glad i am not the only one that wants to see this happen i think if ccp is going to make a claim for the most realism possible then they shouldnt fall short by forgetting boobs and fat in general
the problemt1 cruisers are largely obsolete for pvp because of the simple fact battlecruisers exist battlecruisers offer only slightly less mobility no loss in the case of the nanocane for better firepower and defence and thanks to insurance a rather insignificant price gap the result of this is that the majority of tech 1 cruisers have no real role compared to the equivilent battlecruiseranother contributing factor is that the tier system and general ccp fail has rendered a number of cruisers seriously subpar this proposal aims to go some way to rectifying both problems through fairly simple changes the overall intended end result is a situation where both cruisers and battlecruisers have a role and that someone with the money for either would actually have to think for a minute before picking their ship rather than going straight for the tier 2 bc id also like to stress  battlecruisers stomping cruisers in a 1v1 is fine nerfing battlecruisersfirst step  nerf insurance payouts at least on the tier 2s the big problem with pricing on cruisers vs battlecruisers is that they use the same mods and rigs in very similar quantities but that the cruisers get a few mil in insurance wheras the bcs get 20ishas an example a while ago a friend and i did some price comparisons using the rens markets at the time and the difference between a kitted out rupture and cyclone factoring insurance was a laughable 4 million so as a first step nerf insurance to make battlecruisers as pricey as their performance should require im well aware that price is not an overall factor in balancing but this should actually give a price gap to consider in addition to the other factorssecondly reduce bc mobility their speed can stay see below for why but slightly nerf their agility to widen the gap with cruisersthirdly this does not apply to all bcs but their stats are getting slightly absurd in places the drake for example isnt far off being a battleship in ehp and dps with hams id swap out the shield bonus for missile velocity or even precision this brings the ehp down to the level of the others without gimping itfrankly im in favour of nerfing the tier 2s down to the level of the tier 1s all round but thats outside the scope of this postbuffing cruisersthe first major change id make is upping cruiser mobility across the board the main reason to pick a cruiser should ideally be their mobility but right now their stats dont quite back this up a moa is a mere 200ms faster than a drake and the agility isnt far off either the hurricane is the biggest offender here going easily around 14kmsso buff cruisers to be faster than bcs allround right now cruisers average 1215kms without being speed fitted up this to around 15 at the slowest and 19 maxcombined with the bc nerf this means a cruiser gang has significantly higher mobility than an equivilent group of battlecruisers but the hurricane is still a workable option where faster gangs are concernednext give the finger to the tier system and start buffing i wont go into too much detail but the omen caracal moa and thorax to varying extents all need a grid andor cpu buff the stabbers slot layout makes it a complete joke at the moment compared to the rupture so give it another low and a few more drones say 20m3 bayas for the maller give it a damage bonus rather than cap as well as some drones but keep the speed way down omen for a faster laser platform maller for a tankgank ship the ideal end result  cruisers are lighter faster and more economically viable compared to battlecruisers and also have a greater number of viable classes battlecruisers are slightly toned down but maintain their role as anticruiser and generally higher dpstank platforms for gangs where speed is less of an issuethoughts
up the warp speed3uas for all the t1 cruisers i would like to see 4 or 5uas
i like it thatd work nicely
play balance tweaks are rarely as simple as you put them moving things around rarely only affect the things you are movingsome things you may not have consideredmaking cruisers faster will this mean that cruisers will go faster than some frigatesdestroyersnerfing insurance payouts this wont do at all did you think about the fact that battlecruisers are much more often ganked in lowsec and null than cruisers this is because they have bigger sig rads and can be found easier in plexes nerf the insurance payouts and you make happy days for pirates not to mention having insurance payouts differ by ship is just too technologically complicated its a bazooka vs fly scenario200ms faster is a great deal faster are you talking about maxxed out with mwd speeds battlecruisers are supposed to be slightly modified cruisers afterallcurious to hear why you think they are not economically viable presently vs battlecruisers a caracal is 35m and a drake is 10x that you can get a caracal up to 20k ehp and a drake to 30ksounds economically viable to me
increasing speed is not the key problem in cruisers as i see them but its a nice and working buff anyway the thing is even with that speed cruisers cant compete vs anything else but vs frigs and destroyersbut if cruisers had range theyd be completely viable as a gang vs battlecruiser gang or as a part of a sniper hac or bc gang it would just open so many possibilities
i dont think we need to nerf battlecruisers also i dont feel that drake dps is something to be desired drakes seem to be the least powerful battlecruiser aside from the ferox which cant be made to function properly i think the problem with drakes is that their damage isnt low enough for the incredible tank they have id just leave the bonuses the same on the drake and lower its base shield by a small amount also battlecruisers have higher insurance payouts because they cost morecommand ships are quite a bit cooler than any tech 2 cruiser but theyre not overpowered when you consider how much they cost the skills required to fly them and mainly the fact that they dont really hit all that hard they just have high ehp so they dont die while boosting buddiesyoure right about mobility however most cruisers diaf because theyre not significantly faster than battlecruisers given that the average tech 1 cruiser has around half the powergrid and maybe 23rds the slot options bringing its slot options nearly in line with heavy frigates they should be substantially more mobile instead they are sitting ducks that cant dish out much of any helpi propose all cruisers have max velocity increased by at least 10 and perhaps signature radius decreased by 10 it wont make them a ship of choice but itll make them useful within niches or when you want to save cashlastly i want to strongly iterate that the stabber is in no way underpowered in fact i would propose that its powergrid be reduced by like a hundred with six high slots and mobility more than befitting a cruiser this thing is just a larger version of the destroyer it should not be capable of fitting 4x 425mm autocannons and 2x ham launchers and still have room for a good nanotank fit in fact the main reason a fit like that is overpowered is that autocannons have excellent tracking meaning this thing can nano and hit at the same time while using fullsize weapons it should be using 220mms or 180mmsi think the moa and ferox could perhaps use a powergrid buff they cant fit their intended weapons at full size let alone put on a good tank the thorax definitely needs a powergrid buff its the exact opposite of the stabber being either able to nano or to dps without any room to do both and its tank isnt much either dont forget its intended as a blaster ship so its not very good if it cant get into target range i see thoraxes mostly used to catch people off guard warping in right where their opponent will be and using webifiers to prevent them from getting away it certainly doesnt chase very well as i found out when i outran one in a webbed stabber its drones got me because i didnt get out of webifier range in time in seconds id have been home free as i have seen medium drones have quite a bit of difficulty hitting me in a stabber when im not webbedi havent flown amarr cruisers so i cant speak for them
then i believe the problem is not that the turrets are incorrectly scaled but its the ships that are incorrectly scaled i mean i can be 2500m away from a can and it sure doesnt look like it can fit 5 hurricanes in between me and the can the scaling is just bungled
so we now have a rough understanding of the scaling in eve its messed up not only in the guns department we dont know how ccp measure scale in the game id sure like to know because commenting on this topic gets hard as it goes into a vague directionthis topic needs more clarification on what is all to be fixed some kind of conclusion imoi have some ideas but no time right now ill maybe write something down in the next few days
i think this is a great idea in fact ccp could elect representatives who would get together with representatives from several other top games and share players around for mutual benefit these representatives could study what makes various types of players like what about a game and identify these traits in the player base players who like microtransactions or who want highsec to be buffed can be gently led to hello kitty island adventure likewise players in hello kitty island adventure who believe their gaming skills and ability to mash face against keyboard for hours on end are being wasted those players can be lead to world of warcraft and similarly players in world of warcraft that exhibit such tendencies as being able to make a viable noncookie cutter character or correctly counting items in the guild bank could be led to eve online where they will have a much more fulfilling experienceoverall i think this rebalancing of players will greatly increase game morale and keep the masses paying out of pocket for these great games supported
oh my thanks for the gigglesi support this in spirit though as i believe you are sort of saying this tongue in cheek its funny and worth a discussioni personally think that no official process need exist though these people eventually get bored and leave the game yay or they get frustrated an leave the game yay im confident that ccp and csm have enough knowledgeable folk that nobody really gives any such posts any credence what we can do is to keep a list of them on a sticky so that we can all ignore their posts without having to waste time reading them you get on the list by posting 3 of such requests and you get off the list by publicly renouncing your ways

agreed wardecs need new mechanics paying for wardecs then seeing there members jump to a new corp is pathetic wasting isk in the processmake wardecs free or put something in place to make wardecs better for the better of eve
for the better of your eve maybestop pretending youre a leet pvper becuase you station camp defenceless carebears youre the pathetic one stop wardecing people for the purpose of griefing and theyll stop corp hopping i know plenty of corps that get wardeced regularly and quite enjoy the experience
well why should i pay for a dec which is ineffective everywhere in eve is ment to have risk or should we turn off pvp in high sec
wow with all the well thought out and compelling arguments against the wardec system how people continually abuse it to pick random highsec corps to dec just so that they can hover around jita to shoot people i never thought i would see an argument to change the system to make it easier for grieferswardecing costs what 2mil isk seriously if this is a dent in your wallet then you should find a new profession i think the other arguments were proposing to make this even higher highsec is for carebears really with all the other problems that eve faces today like a harsh new player experience and steep learning curve do you really want to make it even more unfriendly to carebears or newbies im of the feeling that constant griefers should just man up and move on to lowsec or null sec if they want to pvp or do fw hovering around trade hubs to shoot people in highsec is so like kicking homeless people
stop decing 10 man corps who have no intrest in pvp and no real ties to being in their corp pick a target that cant be disbanded so easilyessentially the targets youre decing that all just drop corp because they have no ties to the corp and it means nothing to them to just form a new onefind a corp with assets poss higher player numbers a corp for whom disbanding will have ramifications and dec them youll get a better fight and thats what youre looking for right good fightsi mean theres no chance youre decing corps with 515 2 month old nubs just so you can grief them rightie wardec works fine pick targets right and youll get wars try and grief nubs and theyll just disband

thats what i said 
update i am a bad and there is already a thread on this that i missed when scanning for dupes please show your support in this thread the sentiment is the samemany people use more than a handful of ships and when you have a couple of different fits for each of these ships it is very easy to exceed the current limit of 50 fittings this is especially true for those that provide help and advice to groups of pilots and regularly need to have a variety of fittings for a variety of ships on hand to pass on to others regardless of ones reason for wanting more slots the current limit is far too restrictive and there is absolutely no merit to imposing a restrictionwhen they moved the fittings serverside it made little sense to anyone perhaps for corporatewide fittings it was logical but certainly not for personal fittings when the fearless internal document was leaked it was indicated that charging for more fittings slots was a possibility the document has been claimed merely to be a testbed for controversial opinions and to open debate on some issues but the simple indication that they would be willing to charge extra for what was previously a free feature is just too insulting to ignoreit is clear that the only way they could justify a limit on fittings is by claiming it was a strain on resources something that would not be true were fittings to remain client side there was no other reason why this change was necessaryi am disgusted that this game is being deliberately gimped in order to try and grab more money from our walletsallow us to keep as many clientside fittings as we wish and stop trying to moneygrub its pathetic cheap and insultingin closing return personal fittings to a clientside feature and remove the arbitrary limit of 50 fittings
oh dear forgot to support
another whiny complaint thread from lady spanknothing new here btwthere are already several threads about this very same request
boohoo
indeed add a fitting tool incorporated to the game so players can think of which fits he should do
absolutely support there was no reason to take that from us other then as spank said grubbing  off us for extra fitting slotsthere are games in which this sort of thing is acceptable ccp league of legends buying extra rune pages for example but i dont pay a monthly sub to play loli do pay a monthly sub for eve 3 of them in fact i dont see how you can possibly justify taking an existing feature from paying customers and then offering to sell it back to them laterremove head from anus ccp seriously
wormsholes should show local when ccp allows capital ships to cyno in as well as remove mass restrictions from active wormholesthe rest of us have to deal with gristle in the gravy why should you be special
it has nothing to do with sensors if you read the background lore its everything to do with lack of the fluid communication network in wspace
short answer nolong answer nooooooomore serious answer wormhole space isnt like dusting crops in known space boy we dont want or need a local channel that provides free intel for any and all that cant or wont use the tools the rest of us make do with that is all
end of line
noi can speak for my corp when i say that we in no way shape or form would or could support this ideakspace and whspace are different and unique leave them that way
doubt it can be coded to apply to individual clients even so merely seeing a ship should not be enoughminimum should be show info on pilot a completed lock on his ship or a wh tag command that perhaps requires a specific pos module
no multiplied by all the isk in eve
absolutely not
i propose four thingsa allow gms to delete characters aur balances if we petition asking for that or better yet allow players to do this themselves saying we can buy nex store items and then delete said items is not good enough  we do not want to give ccp metrics supporting mt in eveb make future free aur be a time limited redeemable gift like other free gifts have been i find the current situation insulting as i do not support mt in a subscription sandbox mmo with a player run economy and thus do not want a positive  or better yet any aur balance showing in my walletc allow users to disable aur balance display in the walletd move the isk balance back to the left so the stupid pointless aur balance doesnt take up another wasted blank line at the top of the wallet even if you give us c id still like the isk balance back where it belongs ccp  we westerners read left to right it is natural to look first top left for info
update a gm just deleted my free aur  so it can be done and i encourage everyone against mt in eve to petition for aur deletion as well yay
hey us asians read right to left so lets not be too racially biased here and eve is coming to japan this year
counter suggestion if they are going to offer a gift make it something that isnt merely a cheap attempt to coerce the playerbase into using a crap feature
ccp should give everyone a few aur then most of us players will be able to sell that aur for isk while people who have too much isk would be able to buy discount aur for a while
the current rendering of ships looks good but gets old fast and needs more diversity there are a lot of ships around stations and the zoom is close enough that you can see the rendering on them normally what i suggest has already suggested by many but with a slightly different method of integrating it into the system first is the addition of decals i have read what some people have to say about painting their ships and the decal idea is nice for wearing your badge on your sleeve so to speak militia alliance corporation decals etc someone else mentioned that you can use them as a badge of service for being in the militia or for loyalty to a corporation you can set standing limits for being able to use these decals as a reward for hard work so long as the list of decals is managably short i believe that a lot of people would love to wear their colors the second is for the people wanting to stand out more the addition of multiple paint themes for people to choose from allowing for custom paint jobs would put too much stress on the server but if there were only about a dozen or so different themes to choose from for each ship then i believe that would be much more managable decals and alternate paint themes allow people to have more choices and lets them stand out more in a crowd the paint shop as someone else called it would be in certain stations and anyone has access to it as a reward the decals should be easier to receive allowing it to be payed for in isk but the full ship paint jobs would be more of a luxury and should only be purchased through use of nex the current clothing idea might work better whenif the station lounge allows players to see each other but otherwise it is too limited people see each other in their ships far more than in character so i believe a paintjob would have a lot of appeal to players if the extra rendering hurts lag time too much in large fleet battles then there should be an option under graphics to turn off all custom paintdecals business by allowing choices for ship rendition people have more variety and i believe it would satisfy a lot of people possibly even bringing back several of the people that left with the addition of nex it will further drive the sale of plex cards to convert to nex increasing sales for ccp and stabilizing the plex market for players through steadier purchases so long as the resolution of the new paint schemes is the same and is added in both client and server side then there should only be 1 extra call to the cpu for the render model that should minimize the need for extra hardware server side to handle the extra renditions thank your for your time and consideration i have spoken with many people in game and the idea takes like wildfire which leads me to believe it would be a profitable investment
i believe this is already in the works as far as the corp and alliance logos are concerned paint jobs are a nice touch too and im sure it will be another thing you will see soon in the nex store
no to 173 yes to 174
why on why has this not been added the wait has been long enoughsurely
supported but its why i unsubbed my three accounts maybe ill look into eve again when they fix this but waiting two years for them to get off their backsides to tackle this is really enoughim going to go spend my time on something yknow fun
support on some gallente hull changes but no on the hybrids buff unless you want to buff caldari as well
because that is already on the list of ccp tallest hence not needed in the crowdsource im too lazy to look up the link but its been linked already in a dozen of hybrid complain threadsedit i think someone did actually link that in the crowsource thread evennot supported as its pointless
i want the old warp sound too
elina tan you dont seem to get it paying real money should not give you any advantage ingamei can agree with plex being the one and only exception because its based only on ingame currency that means the person who gave up the ingame currency gave up something that was definitely of value to them even if the only way for you to pay for more research slots was for someone else in game to sell them to you it still wouldnt be fair because the person selling them might not even want them but everyone can use more isk
actually if you have high standing with a npc corp you should get free research manufacturing spotsthat is my view
i actually will support this it seems silly at first glance because eve is supposed to be a harsh world but missions pay so little that if you lose your mission ship very often you end up losing more than youre making thus rendering your time spent missioning effectively wastedobviously you should need to spend time planning your fit but players should not be required to go outside eve like evesurvivalorg for instance just to make ends meet when missioning a good agent should be able to tell their employees a little about what theyre up against especially if theyre expected to face something requiring a hundred million isk ship and are only going to be paid 5 million for it
solution to this problem get in a corp that can teach you the proper eve mechanics pve or pvp corp doesnt matter cause they will teach you how to play correctlyin your case its a code 18 the problem is at 18inch of the monitor lol
i like your basic idea but i think youve got the implementation all wrong its as simple as this pay double subscription and be allowed to train 2 toons at once on your account this has the advantage of you being able to cancel the second subscription and still use the character and the disadvantage of only being able to log into one character at a time seems fair to mei know which option id choose and its not the one i already have
i disagree the new icons are an abomination i have to wait for the icons to load just to scroll past the turrets in my station cargo every time i log back in to the game add to that the fact that i can no longer tell what im looking at let alone not having much difference between types of turrets and to top it off there is more difference say between heavy pulse lasers and focused medium pulse lasers than there is between heavy pulse lasers and 125mm railguns just to throw out one of the many possible examples
icons are supposed to be an easy to recognise representation of what that button does it should also be significantly and recognizably different from the icons around itthe old ones were just finethe new ones are total crap
hicrowsourcing is a really good tool for the csm but it suffers from inherent flaws with this thread i just wish to bring this to the attention of the csmwhile voteing for issues is very democratic and seems all do good the reality is it does not reflect the seriousness of issues now what do i mean by that you may askwell issues that are race specific will automaticly be at a disadvantage since only players of that race are likely to vote in the affirmative moreover now that you can vote in the negative its to the advantage of other races to vote against fixing issues with opposing races however fair or real problems thay may have this issue can in some cases be further compounded by the face that the 4 races are not equally popular and the least populated race is thus at a further disadvantagei ask csm to consider this because the only real gallente issue on the crowdsourcing list is to buff gallente ewar while true this area also sux for gallente its not the most pressing problem can anyone guess what im thinking of do i really have to say ithybridsthere i said it
not supported there are two races that use hybrid turrets as there main turret of choice caldari the most popular race and gallente which you say is the least popular raceboth races have 2 forms of major dps caldari have missiles and the gallente have drones only the gallente can apply both hybrids and drones at the same time with no penaltyhybrids are at a disadvantage right now but that is not the major issue with gallente the major issue is that they are to slow to apply there best dps fix the gallente ships hybrids are fine the way they are
whatever twist the issue any way you like its still an issue i dont care if they fix hybrids by fixing the speed or whatever just get it done anyway i just pointed out the issues with the way csm is prioritising you did notice that rightedit btw i cant remember seeing caldari turrent ship in low or 00 they might be there but then its very very rare
i see the same thing concerning gallente hybrid platforms most gallente ships i see are drone boats domi kicks  btwanyway addressing the gallente issue isnt my highest priority and im sure that the majority of the pilots out there dont care about race or anything of that nature they wont vote against fixing hybrids but they wont vote for it either
i agree the vast majority of players will not vote for hybrids balance and thats my point exactly the issue is extremely central to to all gallente and a very small number of caldary crazy enough to waste sp on a broken weapon since so few players will vote for it it will not get the attention it desrves based on the impact the iussue has on affected players minor issues will get promoted over this to the detriment of players who did not know not to train gallente
some time ago i read the last released summit meeting minute and one of the topics discussed was the difficulty logistics pilots have with the watchlist being limited to only 10 peoplethe minute also contained a statement from ccp that while acknoledging that some pilots have valid reasons to need a larger watchlist they could not simply raise the limit as this functionality would start taking more cpu power than it shouldthis subject is also one of the items of the current csm crowdsourcing and one of the replies in one of the original threads suggests that perhaps raising the limit of some players in the fleet would already acomplish alotthis proposal is to go exactly on that direction letting the players decide who in their fleet need more ppl in their watchlist and who could do well with a shorter list to compensateit goes like this fc chooses b base value between zero and ten fc selects l a group of pilots such as logistics to receive the benefit for all pilots not in l the watchlist becomes limited by b for all pilots in l the watchlist limit is increased by 10  b  size of the fleet  size of lsize of l the value is truncated and the reminder is distributed in round robin if there are no pilots in l then all pilots have the standard limit of tena few notes the scope of this op is only the maximum size of the watchlist its not meant to discuss if it has all the necessary info logistics pilots need to do their job nor if it woult scale well with a much larger number of people in it letting b be variable may be overengeneering fixing it at some reasonable value may be enough i wont discuss how the ui will acomplish this op but it needs to be easy for the fc to selectdeselect the pilots that need a larger watchlist and it must be visible for all pilots their current watchlist limit on a side note if this is really taking that much server cpu then perhaps the algorithm implemented is suboptimal because by fixing the size of the list it should have a linear behavior or perhaps this is already the case but the code is still doing unecessary operations like creating the same message multiple times instead of using a memcopy if one pilot is being watched by many others the message could be created at most once per tick maybe there is one or two low hanging fruits here for team gridlock explore
courier contracts currently i have an alt with a freighter and a cloaky hauler when i move to a different staging system i have to contract my ships and the cloaky hauler to my main then recontract them to my hauling alt just so i can put them in my freighter as a courier contract this is just plain annoying i propose that courier contracts can either be made to ones own self or allow ships to be placed in a freighter when they are rigged second proposalallow changing of skill training to be done by simply pressing the apply button on the alt toon on an account a warning message pops up that states that training will stop on the other toon i think it is annoying to log on and off 2 characters on the same account to accomplish a simple task like this
1 for second proposal if your silly enough to train two characters
its more of having the second toon on the account and wanting to train a small skill
i think that perhaps using the courier contract system to fit ships into cargo should be counted as an exploit then again thats about as silly as getting worried that a million cubic meters of maintenance bay are being converted into a hundred thousand cargo space via fitted industrialswhy dont we just let ships be placed in cargo holds and why dont we just allow carriers to carry cargofilled ships if the problem is that people will stop using jump freighters when they can use carriers instead then just make industrials bigger want to move that cheap piece of scrap without a full cargohold get over your rigs already and repackage the darn thing
the game mechanic is already in place i am not saying change how things are transported i am simply stating that you should be able to setup a courier contract with yourself
please vote for the crowdsourcing initiative here thread locked
no nothing to do with price at all it makes them more resilient to penalties to mods due to damage crew loss
just because an etard gets elected to csm doesnt mean the game is going to be changed to benefit themselves on a whim zulu throwing the tard line over the whole wh abc ores thing gave me hope that ccp is not just going to bend over and make poor game design decisions in the future just because the csm are more interested in altering game mechanics to forward their own nullsec agendas rather than help influence game design for the sake of good game design i hope ccp realizes thisthe time and effort nullsec alliances spend to screw eachother over to rmt could probably have been better spent in the real world
which is exactly why anyone who is crying about abcs in wormholes is a moron the csm is a sounding board not a scrum team they use their knowledge of the game to offer advice to the ccp ccp is still responsible for their decisions if you honestly think its a cart blanche to bend the game to nullsec will then wow you are ed
to be honest these hulks in blue nap fest space are safer than highsec hulks move abc ore to high sec using failttanis logic of risk vs reward here as anyone can gank you with some cheap dessies in such a densely populated area of space versus the only thing around you in nullsec is friendliesclearly abc ore prices are determined soley by the output of the occasional miner that finds a grav site in a wh once a week mines for an hour or two and theres no more abc ore left and not the legions of bots churning out abc ore 237 with respawning roids and abundant availability of sites
obviously rather than fixing my car i should just take a bat around the neighborhood and beat the  out of all the others cars to make mine look appealing
not trying to troll here but tbh this is a pvp game at its heart its got to be balanced around pvp complaining about it just makes you look stupid
you should stick to theory then because most 00 nubs have the faintest clue about realitysadly enough most high sec nubs know just as muchthe fact is that most problems that exsist in eve currently are player driven
exactly my point player driven and inevitable nullsec exists in a realist paradigm where alliance continuance relies on doing what it takes to win rather than what is funnext time i promise to yield to the mighty intellect of killer gandry
did you study to get this dimwitted or did it all come naturalseems if i talk to you like your mitty does it might get through your thick skullpeople in nullsec dug their own problems and now they want high sec and ccp to undig themthat is the reality of null sec
just dont vote for nullsec players for csm unless theyve previously served on the csm and proven to be level headed people after good game design not etards who think csm is just a joke and a means to further along their alliances nullsec agenda and make money off rmt chances are a highsec player will be more level headed than this csm
please visit your user settings to reenable imagesi cant even insult you because you fail so miserably at logic what are you even trying to say
as long as votes are based on forumsreading login news  there will never be a representative part of eves player basethe day you get a popup do you want this yayno its democratic but dont ever think eve was ever anything but major powerblocks running the gamecsm is voted in by 90 of the people who have an agenda its like real world politicsits not representative and its aparently what ccp wantsonly whine is you pay 15 to the powerblocks
i dont think the artwork of dust can be used for eve at least not in any significant waythe other thing i can think of is making the nex store items which would be the case only if ccp has the most ed financial advisers ever trying to profit from micro transactions instead of do a half decent job at marketing and increasing the subscriber base
eve has its own art team its split 5050 between incarna and fis stuff
i like your idea as well but shouldnt it be in features and ideas

a thought that would greatly amuse me in regards to dreds and scs add a class role to dreds to increase damage done against larger targets say super carriers and titans  by 1015 per level this does not make them more effective against smaller targets but it does make them dangerous to supercaps and gives them a reason to exist again it also makes supercaps lives far more interesting in the presence of dreadnaughts  black ops really doubling the current jump range and giving them another bonus or two would almost make them useful a damned cov ops cloak would also do a world of goodfar as other things go up the damage on rails a smidge so they are at least on par with lasersmissilescannons
as ship balance is a complex task with many interrelated moving parts finding a overall balance between the ships of the races while still allowing for different racial tactics and philosophies all while not breaking anything else is a herculean task complimentary to all of the existing proposed changes in this thread i emplore readers to consider as well the adding of a new mechanic in order to tune out any current perceived problems this new dial will allow devs to dial in balance without affecting anything else avoiding the problem most encountered when tuning game mechanics that is if course unforeseen side effects that disturb the balance in another aspect of the game this new proposed dialtuning knob is the implementation of crews in ships we have always known that they were there and with the latest eon ccp even published the crew complement rough figures for ship classes this new mechanic while not the holy grail will allow game designers another degree of freedom in tuning the balance between ships without potentially messing up the existing balance i put these thoughts into a thread which is very much still a discussion topic which i wanted to link here as i felt that any discussion of ship balance should also consider this as a supplement to rebalancingcrew
much like what uve been doing when the only flimsy argument u have was shot down so early and easily thats probably why u feel its so personal when your ignorance is being pointed outu know what else isnt true if you thin out the miners workers farmers proletariat keyword being if since a is false b does not apply and your argument hinges completely on a false assumption of the present situation in eve in case u still dont get it your entire argument in a nutshell is if a then b only a is already false to begin with at this rate though u most likely still wont get it and will just try and troll some more after this so plz continue your lack of arguments and nothing but continuous complaining will only further prove to ccp the whiny and scared carebears u really r
girl please calm yourself im a carebear ill add that to the baseless accusations list i made an argument really i thought it was just a passing observation that if everyone had a certain attitude towards miners gank them all there are too many dumb hulk pilots then the economy would suffer i thought i was just making a plea for sense and nonpartisanship and against knee jerk uneducated comments but if you want to call that an argument knock yourself out and i concede to your superior intellect on showing me otherwise 
1 id suggest moron as well but uve clearly proven that time and time again2 i was merely being lenient when i called them arguments because u might wanna try what u call observing your own posts they were about killing off all the miners not necessarily having a condescending attitude towards them funny how someone else can observe your posts better than u actually know them which goes back to 1 because even though ppl do look down upon them ive got good news the miners r still there and the mineral prices r still low well its not really news at this point but for u it is since apparently u finally got it but at least u can rest easy with the closure u so desperately needed during your harrowing ordeal with your own imagination 3 looking back at 1 its not surprising it had to be broken down to two simple letters before someone like u would finally get it but whatever works i guess
wow anna really all this anger and hate because of this benign statementoh i know you must be still a little raw about the gcc joke 3
great solution to afkers remove local and so it is just like w space problem solved i also think that the same should be for low sec as well let high sec have their local since it is controlled by empire
1 the issue isnt afk cloakers its your awareness of them if local were made into recent speakers all around so the only faces you see are people who spoke in the last 15min youd have to be paranoid all the time instead of just when you see a strange face2 in the spirit of 1 try living in whs instead of 00 where you never know if theres someone lurking i notice the op talking about solo ops in 00 and yet counters the wh argument by saying then have some friends guard the whs and pull watch so wh denizens are supposed to travel in groups for safety but 00 dwellers should be allowed to solo through life3 the issue isnt afk cloakers as those are two completely distinct and separate words cloaks are the counter to probes and should be left alone in all regards asking for probes that scan for cloaked ships is like complaining about ships with too much ehp and asking for armor piercing ammo that ignores resists the paranoia comes from not knowing whether another player is afk this could be remedied in a number of ways have a little mark the depicts when someone is afk then you wont try talking to corpies who havent been around for hours log players out after lengthy periods of inactivity there is nothing in the game that requires your presence but not your involvement if someone is cloaked and providing active intel they are chatting with their fleetcorpalliancewhatever that conversation means they are not away from the keyboard however if they are hidden in any regard whether thats cloaked or just mwding into deep space and the player is nowhere near their desk that person is truly afkof course there are ways macros could prevent someone from timing out however macros are illegal and would be dealt with on their ownin summary cloaks arent the problem as everything needs a counter cloaks are the only true way to counter probes leave them alonego after the real problem the presence of someone in your system that you dont knoweither remove the knowledge of their presence fix local make it easier to tell if theyre actually a threat afk flag orwatch your borders better and kill people when they invade
its that creeping thought that keeps gnawing at you in the middle of the night isnt it the idea that someone somewhere might be afk cloaked in a hulk

i like it
what i mean is that the attribute bonus on the pirate implants will be removed while still giving their secondary bonus extra armor better shield boosting and similar this way players will not miss out on skilltraining while jump cloning even if they will be cripled overall in performance but from my experience people tend to be willing to be a bit gimped for a day as long as it doesnt make their skills train slower i dont want to use the old clichUFFFD of you didnt read the post but it seems like you missed part of my argument on why this change would make people more willing to explore the worldonce again this suggestion is not some kind of force players to do this but rather remove some of the roadblocks stopping alot of players from experiencing different aspects of the game
i did read it but it was a long time ago so maybe i forgot some partsokay then working with this proposal i would ask why you think that people perceive the negative aspect of having their skills train slower i mean isnt it a choice any player makes to either use 5 implants in both clones or not if they put the same implants in both clones there is no slower training just increased risk of losing a set in null but that is the price you pay for training the same speed you do in empire i mean if you remove all the s from the implants then everyone trains slower everywhere anyhow but your response is to add  boosters okay so my counter proposal then is why not add those  boosters but leave existing implants alone why gimp somebody in highsec who has no intention of ever going to nullsec nor care to hey lots of play modes fit into this fw trading rd carebear ratting why are you gimping themi think that adding s to new boosters is a good idea if not there already so that people can use their non implanted jumpclones on boosters in null to match the sp training that they have in their 5 jumpclone in highsecdoesnt this make everyone happy solve your issue and most importantly doesnt force anyone to do anything that they dont want or muck with existing mechanics
yes i could see that working looking at the boosters as a 1day pass so to say for the player that use them for the intention of having a day out of their standard clone as i stated earlier im not a game balancer but rather a player that want a change so i suggested a big change but truth be told i would be happy with the boosters being an alternative that is you can use either an implant or the booster while the effects are non stackingand as someone else proposed earlier in the thread if the cost of using boosters constantly for about 3 months or something would be about the same as buying an actual implant i would be happy
10
i guess then its good that i am a game balancer if you change this proposal to add attribute boosters then i will gladly give my support edit though i would also insist that the price of these new boosters be free floating market prices and dependent on what they are manufactured from or perhaps an lp store purchase at discount
undecidedwhen i first read the post i thought it was a bad idea then after reading a few more posts it started to make a bit more sense for newer players they buy implants of any quality they often cant afford to keep replacing them too often older players can circumvent this with jump clones but younger players often dont have the required 80 standing to get one therefore newer players are less inclined to pvpon the other hand however if implants were not seeded but were player made prices for these implants should drop and also have the same desired effect
not supporting this idea implants are working just fine as they are they give reason to pod someone and they are one of the ways you can really hurt someones wallet
proposal appears to be trying to limit the financial loss associated with death by replacing a destructible item with an item whose effect is persistent through death andor a cost over time unassociated with death not supported one of the appeals of eve is that combat is risky and death is at least a little bit meaningful unlike in other mmos
perhaps it was originally such a proposal and i will be against if it that were the still the casei think it has become more of a proposal to add some boosters which give some implant like qualities but only for limited time like a week i was under the impression that dying will still lose you the bonus but the booster would be cheaper than the equivalent implant that would give the same bonus thus making it more affordable for new players
this is true that the idea has changed a bit over time when i originaly made this thread i honestly came up with it as i wrote with that said i will try to write up a new more balanced and explainative thread that will hopefully be up during next week i will also offer some of the people that gave me critics more than i hate this idea the opportuinity to read my draft to look for holes that can be improved
i agree that there should be some sort of mine fieldsjust like in real war there are tactical environment modifications like mine field and trenches so should there be in spacefor the record however mines were removed because they caused so much lag and it will be difficult to incorporate such a system without a lot of it
i think my reworking of the idea earlier in the thread mines as 1shot drones bypasses most of the original objections
i support this if they cant fix the bug that prevents you from warping your pod outin any case it would encourage more newer players to pvp but on the whole i think people should be able to lose what they fly with so if they can fix the recent warp out bug then i am against the proposal

gallente was my first race i learned all weapon and t1 ships subcapital after starting pvp i crosstrained to minmatar and amarramarr have fantastic range versatility with scorch  they do not need to range dictate they hit hard at any distanceminmatar have many advantages switchable damage types ship speed weapon do not use cap due to speed and agility it is possible to use even long range turret in pvp artyso what we have for pvp from gallente there are only drone ships all other ships have better min or amarr counterparts

also ctrlspamclicking bottom on overview and also dropping a bubble doesnt work anymore since all other action keys are locked when ctrl is clicked nowat least give us the ability to assign multiple hotkeys to one action
wow thats an awfully long way of saying ctrl should only act as a modifier key which is what lady spank is sayingand is what ctrl has been used for ever since the silly key was invented in the first placesometimes ccp it pays to do things exactly the same as everyone else in order to help your users and especially people new to the game fly their ships reliably and experience the least possible frustration with this game this is called principle of least surprise
it locks whatever has focus at this time that may or may not be what you clicked on in the overview just now as an example say you just warped into a mission space clicked on your fleetmate in space and selected approach now you want to target the bad guys if you do the obvious thing and start ctrlclicking things youll end up targeting your fleetmate first then everything you click after the first thing you ctrlclickedthats a separate issuewhat we are talking about is the misuse of the ctrl modifier key to become a postactioncommand key where you have to click then press ctrlctrl is a modifier key and changing its behaviour from what people are used to throughout every other ui on the planet makes eve that much harder to play and like and thus keep playing ccp will most likely not get the answer your ui is screwed up on exit surveys theyll just hear i dont like it
supportedone is not a happy teddybear
whatand target ships by selecting them then clicking the target selected item button in the selected item boxor is there some other way of targeting things thats a genuine question
10
supported im tired of targeting acceleration gates
supported
supported i too am sick of having to carefully select a distant planet before thinking about targeting anything with my scram hot to avoid accidentally concording myself
how this got deployed is beyond any reasonable explanation i noticed it within minutes of login after that patch and it has been driving me nuts ever since its been a helluva long time ive forgotten what its like to target something without having to do some voodoo on the ctrl key while frantically clicking in the overview fix this crap before i break my keyboard out of sheer frustration
ok so people want the control key to only do what it does by holding the key and clicking targets the ability to click your targets and press a key to target afterwards is something people dont wanti can kinda see that but i feel you go back to the idea where a person can just remove the control key as the shortcut to targeti mean if you remove the control key as being an entirely separate shortcut button you can use it as a modifier for any other shortcuts you have without the problem of targeting whatever you have selected when trying to use another shortcut
yet again all this does is shift the problem over to a different key and does not return the previously useful functionality
from just testing out the key it appears to only target stuff selected in the overview when the overview is in focuswhen i selected things out in space and then hit the control key nothing was targetedwhen i hold control and click something in space it targets what i click in spacei can hold control and click to target in the overview or i can click something in the overview and press control and it will targetmight i ask if people have a shortcut set for toggle lock target im not exactly sure what that shortcut does and havent tested itfrom what i can tell is the problem is the fact that the overview is kept in focus when people press the control key and thus they target whatever the overview has selected
i support this as ccp hasnt accomplished much so far and at least this would be better use of their time
yest2 bpos have been a ridiculously unfair advantage for those who go them and they continue to be so
1oh and i support the idea of shopping card strongly you dont know how many times i wrote things i wanted to buy in the notes and then lost them or forgot them shopping card or list is a must
both the tabbed wallet and shopping cart are excellent ideas supported
isnt that called a wardecthis is meant to be a full feature not a pvp status your first point completely eliminates the faction in faction warfare the second point removes it as a career anyone can do it at will at any time and the third doesnt make any sense  you cant be in fw and be loyal to an outside corp and shouldnt beplease actually observe how fw works and think about how it should work  not how you can tear it further down reducing it to little more than a spaceship version of a wow battleground
to be honest i think the battlecruiser tier was ccps original attempt at t3 cruisers that went wrong which i feel is why most of them are quite broken why is why a dilema ensues when trying to balance the t1 cruisers in terms of price and ability how could you really make the t1 cruiser class better without making the battlecruiser class obselte
this is already the case but no  the majority of frigates would still be faster and a lot more agile but the gap would shrink somewhatinsurance has been nerfed before and if youre willing to risk a bigger ship then you should be able to take the loss i am indeed talking mwd speed and yes they should be a great deal faster have you noticed how stupidly small the speed gap isumm no battlecruisers are not modified cruisers they are larger ships that use cruiser sized weaponry in larger quantitiestry not being utterly clueless about the ships you bring up in discussions otherwise your credibility goes out the window ill address this idiocy point by point a caracal is 35mil plus fittings in case you havent noticed a proper t2 fit will outweigh the hull cost several times over the cruiser however gets a much lower insurance payout than the battlecruiser despite a minimal gap in module cost caracals do not get up to 20k ehp without making huge sacrifices usually on the gank side of things come back here when you have a caracal with 20k ehp and good dps 30k ehp on a drake are you even putting modules on it mine has 80k with just a three slot tank and good dps on top of that dear god youre cluelessnot really no why would i want to fly a caracal when i can just get a drake that does the same thing better with a minimal price difference the only thing caracals really stand out at doing is swatting frigates and lets face it  what cant swat frigates these daysstabbers are hilariously underpowered have you taken a look at their stats umm ever with the fit you just suggested its inpractice dps and ehp are utterly pathetic and it has no antifrigate defences whatsoever by the way your ham425mmtank setup is also impossible its over on grid by about 200 and still puts out pathetic damage and has a paper tank so yeah i get the feeling youre either looking at a different ship entirely and stabber was a typo or that you just never even tried efting itright the trouble with this is factoring that insurance they dont cost more insurance only covers the hulllet me put it this way on a t2 fit cruiser the hull cost is around a quarter of the final total meaning insurance covers barely anythingon a battlecruiser on the other hand the fitting is only slightly more expensive than the cruiser but the insurance payout is much much higher the result of this is that the price difference between the two gets skewedi thought id made this pretty clear  im talking buffing cruisers to give them a different role to battlecruisers the only thing cruisers currently offer besides stuff like the blackbird is being slightly more mobile than a bc and that mobility gap is way too small right nownot only this but the miniscule price gap means theres very little reason to pick a cruiser if you have the choice
supported  all you see is canes and drakes
although i wouldnt switch the drakes kinetic bonus for a velocity bonus as that takes it into caracalcerb territory and were trying to differentiate these classes and i would nerf the tier 2s down to tier 1 levels in slot counts fittings and base hp
removing a mid from the drake would be an excellent first step if the bonus isnt changing in my opinon anywaythis would mean like the ferox it has to pick between a full 3 slot tank and proper tackle gear wouldnt be a huge loss to the hml drake admittedly but the ham version would have a serious choice to make as a web is pretty important there
no thats a rather heavy handed nerf to an already well balanced classtier in low sec the problem seems to be canes not drakes canes do excellent damage and are really jacks of all trades drakes have a lot of things going against them they tank opposite of most other bcs slow to lock slow to apply dps do less dps than most other bcs less agile and have a sig radius a mile wide the only thing they really have going for them is the engagement profile and the shield brick
the proposal isnt really aimed at balancing tier 2 bcs against each other but balancing cruisers against bcs have you encountered any cruisers except for fwrvbthrowaway suicide roams lately if you did i bet 90  of them were rupturesi was just referring to canes and drakes because the cane does tremendous dps thanks to op acs with awesome agility and speed while the drake sports a bs tank and can be fitted to to good short range dps as well  hence those two are the most commonly used onestheres practically no reason to fly a t1 cruiser when you can fly a bc and it only costs a couple mill more after insurance  hell  some hacs are matched by bcs in some roles whereas losing a hac costs 10x as much
yesmake them big and scary they should look intimidating and proportionate to the ship sizefrigs look more intimidating up close than cruisers and bs because of the size of the gunssame like in real life bigger gun vs small tiny gun
i have spoken to a csm rep about this idea and he is in support of it what he wants to see is what ideas we can come up with to keep this change from being exploited thats where i need your help anyone have any ideasabout the only thing ive thought of is put a max on what you can gain in a 24 hour period
at the current time the only exploit that i see in this is pirates getting out of pirating by trading kills with eachother fixing their sec status by sitting outside station and podding eachother that ends up translating to people paying money to fix their sec by paying for pods i see no issue with this you have my support good sir
if you want to cut down on the time spent in nullempire ratting sec then the gain from pirate hunting needs to be so high as to be easily exploitable  not a good idea note there are a lot of pirates in some areas but they generally avoid fights where they may die and use all the tricks in the book to ensure they dontdo what the veto guy mashie suggested and move secgain to lowsec with an appropriate boost to gain per rat  gives you more ls pew as well as hunting ground for antipiratesgain for pirate killing couldshould be part of a bounty overhaul though
there is a way to get round the exploitsecurity status can only be gained by destroying a ship and the gain is directly linked to the isk value of the ship making sec status farming a very expensive business
problem there is does that mean the hull price or price for the fitted ship and how is it determined checking jita at the time of the killas far as the op goes i dont see your cons in reality pretty much the first thing you learn when dropping below 5 is dealing with the fact that everyone takes potshots at you in vulnerable situations theyll deal with it just fine as it doesnt change anything
supported
this is the best idea to combat pirate alts and friends farming eachother after a act of piracy less likely to be exploited with putting risk on the table also add to that have the gain also tied to skillpoints of the char if podded
heh thanks kaelie  further to your point  im brought back to the age old request to be able to ignore people in the forums however the ignored should know theyve been ignored a running count under their portrait to the left of their posts else its no incentive to change or depart and if an ignore is permanent theyve no incentive to win back the favour of the person ignoring them so perhaps ignores should be limited to a week in length this would also help keep visual ignore counts from being appropriated by trollsedit actually now i think about it i far prefer a way to vote on players rather than ignore them in order to help ease them off to something more suitable that way wed still see what the sp for mt crowd have to say but their post would be so faded im thinking how massively does it that everyone would get the message theyre being a bonehead
dont forget to add star wars galaxies to the list of games people should considerwhoops guess the game is no more i wonder what happened to it
wardec is a very good system when not exploited certain players feel the necessity to dec noobbearmining corps for easy kills and are hurting the retention of new eve playerswaredec fees are way too low it is allowing bad pvpers the ability to get killmails from inexperienced pilots in highsec pvp should be everywhere but as example a 3 man corp should not be allowed to wardec a mining corp for some free kills the idea of wardec is very sound and is an aspect i really enjoy about this game warranted issue between corpsalliances should be resolved with warincrease the price of a wardec to 100mil a week for single corporations 250 mill a week for alliances this is still not alot of isk it will lower the amount of crap pvp griefers or aholes looking to get their monthly sub paid for by easy exploitswhat this will accomplish 1 increased pvp in low and null sec the baddie pvpers will have to face facts and do some real pvp2 more inviting atmosphere for new players having all your  blown up by some  that you have utterly no chance against is not pvp and gives this game a really bad rep 3 wardecs will mean something besides mark the 3  heads on your watchlist and watch local4 killmail boards will be more fair as messed up as they are i feel that the worst exploit of killmail boards is the fact that you get points for easy killsi dont see any cons to this
1 no it really wont2 no it still wont and you sound mad too3 still no im afraid 4 nope and i dunno how you worked this out to begin with
no im not mad my corp has dealt with griefers like this before they either cancel the dec or dont log on but thank you for your well thought out responses can you tell me why you have come to these conclusions
as a highsec player i have to agree with you here sure people might think of highsec as care bears but thats because they keep going against the week targets the unorganized groups the small corps im sure there are more than enough highsec corps and alliances out there that are more than willing to give you a fight provided that they have the ability going after a bunch of miners and manufacturers is wasting peoples time the victims because of lost income while staying docked for a week and the aggressor because they are wasting resources hunting down a target that is much better at evasion than they are at hunting and yes 100mil for a corp and 250mil for an alliance isnt much its maybe a day or two worth of serious mindnumbing work which is actually another game mechanic people dont really focus on when it comes to this issue with the war dec fee so low and the high possible losses it is unfairly biased towards the aggressors they only need to put so much into the war and they get so much out of it for example the other day i was talking to somebody who managed to clear out 2bil worth of items from a highsec corp in a few short days although to be fair im not saying that this is a common occurrence its just an example so to be quite frank id even be for a system that increases the fee as member count increases
i have to agree with the op as well ive pvpd in alot of games i have always loved pvp and enjoy the challenge of it a three man corps that preys on a high sec corps that have no chance against them imo is the worst kind of pvpr they are not challenging themselves and in eves case are getting undeserved killmails i do not and have never understood this type of pvp it is not challenging for the aggressor so personally i wouldnt waste my time with it it would be nice to find a group like this in lownul on my small gang roams to show them one aspect of real pvp in eve
the current number 100m seems like a arbitrary number that could be too high or too low i have another idea to determine the cost1 million per member on the war decking and war decked corp per weekand when war decking a alliance as a alliance or corp you add together what would be the cost of war decking each individual corpthat way the cost of making a war is proportional to how much concord needs to look away for people being attacked or attacking that way it would be 200 mill for two hundred man corps to do a war not mutual and if two 10 man corps 20 mil the cost would scale based on how many people get tickets to pvp so a larger corp could pay for pvp at their level and a smaller corp could pay for pvp at their level also have it 2 week limit for war decks to remain active then 1 week off so no constant wardecks with rotating corps ytali convention not letting people hinder business forevergriefbribe concord off all the time
start charging too much for wardecs and people will just resort to suicide ganking and awoxing younerf to solo pvp and a nerf to pvp in general there are ways of avoiding wars if you are too cowardly or incompetent to deal with them and if you are that incompetent then you dont deserve to make a name for yourself as a corporationwardec fees are a nominal isk sink and should not be increased just because you are risk averse crybabies
youre missing the biggest con of allthat everyone that has memorized written down put into spreadsheets 3rd party apps databases fitting tools webpages all would have to change it too you are right that the names are a little confusing okay lotta confusing at first but once you have them memorized its not really practical to rename them
a smaller con is that names give things personality character and fictional substance it differentiates establishes branding and gives writers background material to work with in works of fictionwho make the malkuth line of launchers who knows but i bet its a caldari megacorpwith the competing corp making the arbalest line the companies wont be calling their products missile launcher 2 in real lifeperhaps a counter proposal should be to make the meta level visible in their name when you mouse over the icon that should solve most of your complaints i think why not in the name itself because of the same reason in my previous post the database names should be inviolate
i like the personality of meta level items  in fact i wish t1 and t2 items had the same unique names let icon badges denote tier
eve is too hard
better solution would be to give the icons meta marking just like officer and t2 have maybe number of tiny dots representing meta lvl meta 1 one dot meta 4 four dotsthat is if the names cant be changed some few modules need namechange anyway
keep meta names thats fine if you use certain items enough you can figure them outjust change the fracking hardwiring implant names i remember looking at them once i saw a beancounter implant give a bonus to industry and another beancounter for something completely different then theres the codes for their names i once bought a 5 implant thinking it was a kza when it was really kxa at the time i was relativly broke and that didnt help anyrant
and in both of your examples above i notice that the common denominator is you why should ccp screw up our enjoyment of the game because youre an idiot
the implant names are pretty silly scifi names or alphanumeric codes that dont correlate to their actual function sure i can live with that but when every gorram implant has the same name even though they have different functions something needs to change even if i memorize what the name is when i sort a list of them by name and still have to page through them to find the one im looking for the naming scheme is brokenif nothing else put the alphanumeric code first in the implant name  ie sx2 gunslinger hardwiring  eifyr  co
there will be some work thats mentioned in the cons but is that an excuse its like not cleaning up a room because everyone got used to it being smellyas for the personality and lore i suggested putting these in the description rather than the title theyll still be there but without messing up everythingproblem with that is when youre browsing the market you cannot see the icons without without going to details tab and then youll have to scroll through tens of items back and forth so that wont fix it

hi sec is meant to be safer if you want unrestricted wars go to 00 or wspace
i dont know whats more pathetic the lack of imagination or the fact these guys have carebear alts themselves as well
well i would recommend that you change the title to griefing carebears and you might get more support as there is already a noticeable tax for players in npc corps as for your proposal not sure why you are going to bother posting this crap when ccp will never be enacted it as it will hurt there revenue stream
i agree the game should be centered around your personal desire to grief people who have no reason or desire to fight you instead of simply targeting the abundance of people who both have reason and have the desire
i actually dont think the idea is bad by itself i just think it was placed here by mental incompetents who should pass such ideas along to their betters so they can present them right
as csm i promise not to bring this up at the summits
this thread should be called can i aggro and can be summed up thuslyand why not why can you pay concord to kill the  out of 50 players but you cant pay concord to kill the  out of just one and why not make noobcorps war decable to solve this its eve its a sandbox weeeeeeee

youve a point but typically i expect these kind of issues to be sorted by the devs localising the ui not trying to make one size fits all users at the very least it makes sense to me to go with the preference of the majority of usersstill which side the isk balance is on matters less to me than reclaiming another wasted blank line at the top of the wallet ccp  please put the isk and aur balances side by side if nothing else
it is actually quite nice for those who use the feature it helps getting rid of leftover aur that doesnt buy anything unless you break another plexalso nice for those of us who pay our sub with iskeven though nothing of the above applies to me i still consider it a better idea than another useless gift ship

whs are not some obscure part of the game that nobody ever hears about or gets into even more so whs are considered null sec and technically that means they fall under null sec mechanics which makes the fact that he doesnt know about them an even more glaring error
youre arguing about sematics now when i say nullsec i mean conquerable space i would really hope youd have assumed that you must be newunless you have an interest in whs you tend not to spend much time in them pretty simple really
so if i understand correctly this guy fee seas is the alt of our beloved csm leader maximo this is freaking burlesquei guess we get what we deserve me for instance when i vote for the csm reps i look for a canadian and i vote for him regardless of what he or she writes in his electoral platform maybe we should carefull to whom we give our vote toby the way i took the time to read what he wrote and seriously i cryed laughing so hard at least he has the talent to keep his audience well entertained
ok while nearly every single person who lives in high sec and has had even a cursory encounter with whs knows how silly illogical and nepotistic this issue is its not going to make a difference because cms is run by nullsec that being said i think we need to get some organization and create a proper party with proper high sec candidates for csm so that we can stop this from happening and get some representation in csm for high sec as such i know there are some people out there who are trying to organize something or are calling for the organization of some party if you are one of those people shoot me an in game mail and we can start figuring this whole thing out regardless of what the null sec griefers and trolls say high sec can get easily organized if people put even a little effort into it
you are so clueless its cute just so you know whether or not ccp decides to nerf abcs will have nothing to do with the csm ccp brought it up to them and the csm isnt really pursuing it beyond yeah that seems ed when presented with ccps data until they release the data you should really refrain from knotting up your panties to many times
or alternatively you are taking a wider view of what eve has to offer and not confining yourself to one aspect of the game surely eve is big enough for everyone to play as they wish after all who makes all the shipsrigs ammunition used up in pvp
altsi do a lot of industry i mean a lot a lot of pvp players do ive done mostly everything from mining to invention to jump freightering the only thing ive avoided is t3 production and cap production there isnt some arbitrary rule stating that if you use spreadhseets you cant pvpwithout the carebears the game continueswithout the pvp there is nothing
so i take it youre new then
everyone can votenowehere in the rulebook are nonnullsec players restricted from voting the csm has long been ignored by nullsec to the point that the one one prior to this one was so unabashedly unrepresentative of nullsec that we as players organized to play a bigger role on this csmuse this as an opportunity to rally yourselves and perhaps collectively wet your little carebear panties on the next csm or dont i dont care
for someone who doesnt care you attempt to be very vocal
just tired of the level of stupid
there i said it i know im a  i need to htfu you can has my stuff etclet me elaborate i lost a myrmidon in dodixie trying to be a hero i wanted to show some griefers that two could play that game so i manned up and laid a well fit myrmidon on the line against a curse i lost    not to a curse mind you to a machariel and some neutral rr and a curse the machariel bumped me off station repeatedly and the neutral rr did what neutral rr does it was what i expected and so obviously thats not why im quitting eve againi am quitting eve again because eve doesnt give me the ability to be a herolet me elaborate    in my real life i am just some  im fairly athletic and fairly smart but really im 1 of nearly 7 billion people im nothing special but in eve online the promise was that i could be immortal i could lead an empire i could amass wealth and fame and be glorious but lets face it the endgame of eve is not being a hero of any kind its being a villain and not even a super villain who dominates the galaxy with an iron fist just a plain ole burglar or purse snatcher or child molester serial killers and mafia dons are as high as it goes and even those are rare i was killed by thugs they beat me up and took my wallet thats it and thats about as much as i feel like i could hope for in this game i guess i could just cower in high sec and hoard loads of valuables also either way very disappointing i had hoped to be a captain picard or a han solo seriously hell i would have settled for an ace rimmer none of those are an option though and heres whybully modulesi would include the warp disruptor warp scrambler any kind of interdiction really stasis webifier ecm jammer energy neutralizer and microwarpdrive in this classification these modules interfere with other players ability to pilot their own ship and the older the player the more these modules can exert such control they allow other players to disable my ships engines ie they disable my ship 1 modules does 5 gigajoules per cycle thats it hold me down shut off my weapons shut off most of my defensive capacity and run circles around me in vessels of greater size and resources    and usually its players who could have beaten you in a straight up fight anywayccp knows these modules are unfair which is why most npcs only use one of them if anysuggestions make all modules in multiple class variants frigate cruiser battleship capital why should a frigate be able to interdict web or jam something 10 times its size let alone 1000 times its size make interdiction chance based like ecm or give a ship 500 points of warp strength and interdiction modules and warp core stabilizers 100 or 200 or 300 or 1000 faction points of warp scramble strength or allow us to just follow other players into warp and chase them around until they dock or just remove interdiction entirely since players will fight to the end either way so long as they have something worthwhile to fight over make it impossible to use a web and interdiction at the same time just like it is impossible to use 2 afterburners or an afterburner and a microwarpdrive at the same time or make it possible to use 2 afterburners or 6 afterburners or microwarpdrives or some combination of that anyone whos seen worlds scariest police chases knows that its hard to stop a car how about a thousandsoftons interstellar spacecraft from the far future it should be very difficult not very easy the energy neutralizer should never neutralize more energy than it takes to run the energy neutralizer or explain how this relates to the laws of thermodynamics or how about making the nosferatu more effective so if someone kills your energy with their energy you can take some of their energy think about it you can kill x gigajoules but only siphon xn gigajoules where

even as a troll its a terrible effort
x and n are real whole number integers also wheres the reverse shield transporter that would be a good counter to someone shutting down your shield booster with neutralizers the microwarpdrive needs more drawback its premise is that you use the ships warp engines to go faster hence a scrambler shuts it down so a disruptor should shut it down too if it were well balanced ccp would let you use it in deadspace periodmining imbalanceveldspar is 01m3 mercoxit is 40m3sthere is a reason low sec isnt heavily populated and this is primarily it mining veldspar is safer and more profitable because for the time and equipment needed to mine 1 unit of mercoxit with utterly no protection i can mine 400 units of veldspar in high sec also the increasingly powerful npcs that patrol the belts make mining higher valuable ore an impractical intermitten activity at best for new andor unaffiliated playerssuggestion make all ores equal in volume and remove belt npcsgame slantgames are ultimately games because all the players have a chance at winning more veteran players with more experience obviously have an advantage but giving older players access to more advanced equipment sometimes having functionality that more novice equipment doesnt even have takes that whole dynamic and multiplies it it should be enough that an older player gets to use an armor repairer at a capacitor discount because of his skill but that he gets to use a ship that also has an armor repairer capacitor discount and an armor repairer that has a capacitor discount and use a more advanced implant that gives him a armor repairer capacitor discount    etc etc etc    well it just gets assinine older players can afford better equipment and fit more of it onto the same ship at some point the line has to be drawn as to how much better an older player is going to be where is that line who knowssuggestions  remove skill restrictions from everything or at least relax them remove the double bonuses ships have if a brutix has a hybrid and armor repairer bonus give the eos and astarte better hybrid and armor repairer bonuses or two different bonuses but dont give 5 bonuses to a ship whos stats are already much better than its t1 counterpart its overpoweringaggression mechanicsi had a rude awakening about the whimsical nature of aggression mechanics once i was in null sec in a hurricane i jumped through a gate and there was an interdictor so i reapproched the gate as he dropped a bubble his buddies came and began to attack i returned fire and went to jump out of the system gong nice try    see in null sec where you can attack other players at will beyond the reach of the empires where the gates are unguarded out there in the wild west    the gates still lock you in the system    for shooting back as an american us citizen i was raised with the understanding that if someone attacks us we are allowed and even encouraged to defend ourselves we are not punished i understand how difficult it would be to implement a reasonable force aggression mechanic so we could protect ourselves without being punished but locking someone out of a station or hanging them out to dry at a stargate for selfdefense is quite frankly ass backwardssuggestions in null security space i say aggression smagression unless they aggress against the gate or station let em play in low and high security space lockout anyone with a global criminal countdown for 15 minutes why would an npc corporation aid and abet a criminal anyone else who is engaging in combat must be engaging in mutual combat therefore let either of them dock or jump at will make dealing damage the only concordable offense make everything else aggression towards the player and maybe his corp make bumping an aggressive act if someone is fighting another person on the street and i shove t
hem to the ground thats aggression its simple if x amount or x percentage of inertia is transfered from player a to player b start the 15 minute countdown for player a or how about just making a hard enough collision inflict damage to both ships bam aggression or just make players able to pass through eachother why is any can a playercorp member drops automatically the belonging of the entire corp and if stealing from a can is an act of aggression why cant we unaggress by relinquishing what we stole and maybe paying some restitution i cant kill someone for stealing my garden gnome most especially not if the thief gives it back right and if i do shoot at or otherwise engage the thief that certainly doesnt give him the right to kill me as far as i know killing someone while attempting to rob them is special circumstance eligible for the death penalty so you shouldnt be able to kill someone when they tried to stop you from robbing themthats what i have for now i probably should have posted this the last time i disengaged from eve but i didnt want to seem angry or negative i think the game is great and i will probably play it again at some point in the future i just hope next time its for more than a couple of monthsfly safe
8410not bad too much effort though try and keep them shorterhere like thisnice post 
bahhhhhhhhhhhhh hahhahaah we all have stories to cry on me it was in tintoh system i was doing a lvl 4 mission and some rat bastard came in my mission and started to loot my junk so i left and whent to get my wolf and told him to undock so he did in an osprey lol and he neut my cap and his drones chew me up so i went back got my drake and told him to come out again and he did with a hurricaine and his autocannons chewed me up i blew up two ships in 10 minutes my ego suffered more then my wallet the question is can you dig it
well again i see from looking at other threads that a lot of people are asking for a high sec organization that has some kind of solid and real political power well what are we waiting for send me an ingame mail and we can start figuring this stuff out maybe set up a channel for us and once the fundamental communication issue between us all has been dealt with then we can start thinking about getting our candidates voted in i also agree that candidates shouldnt be pure high secs they should be pure eve players who really care about the game and for everybody to enjoy it not a select few with loud voices again send me an in game mail and we can all start to figure this out
i would wager that at least 13 to a half of highsec characters are nullsec alts all paid for by the l4 mission runners of course at the end of the day csm players run on a platform whether its highsec or nullsec or whatever they are still their to represent their platform why you idiots need to whine about this for weeks on end is beyond me but im really enjoying the tears so i cant complain
hmmm if we are the idiots then what does that make you for keep comming here to yap
someone has to throw tomatoes at the poor clowns in the stocks
got this idea off of vindiciacomvirtualgoods business models usually leverage virtual currencies as a form of aggregationtypically to entice customers to buy a larger amount of credit and purchase goods and products they want since transaction costs are a larger percentage for lower price points it makes sense to offer incentives for large credit purchases for example if 1 amounts to 100 credits offer a bonus promotion of 600 credits for 5since the prices of items in the nex are likely to remain fairly high i thought that something similar could be applied for eve something like 1000 more aurum for 2 plex 4500 more aurum for 6 plex etc its just an idea i wanted to bring up since i was doing some research on mts putting on flame ant suit flame on if you must
not a bad ideai dont really care about mt one way or another but id be surprised if ccp didnt implement this at one point or another
ccp is discovering the harsh reality that prices are inelastic when it come to vanity items
i like rule number 2 the other day i made a post and answered my post with one of my alt just to keep the thread going this kind of thinking will bring you prosperity and success

i supports everything here
this modular system should be applied to all structures pos station customs office outpost
aparently we cant have this due to art teh art i dont care what it looks like as long as it workskeep the same models it dosnt matter no one will care as long as poss finally workive run poss many many poss and they are horrid roles access mails managment so many things everyone has already stated  the art fix poss
i must agree with the 6 month thing but not necessarily purchasing remaps my issue is with the fact that after 6 months of a particular remap you have generally exceeded your need for said remap at that particular time new ships require training but after that training new ships need support training for mods and whatnot and with all the different professions available if somebody decides to turn a new direction they are stuck until a remap is open very restrictive if that period of time is a year were not getting any younger and i see no problem accelerating every players training time by 5 yearly due to more productive skill trainingi support the need for change but not the means by which this thread is suggesting
well said
as you read in my proposal id rather just see ccp simply give us a neural remap every 6 months the sad reality of it however is that ccp isnt likely going to introduce things like this unless they can get extra money for it thats just the result of going with greed these days  my proposal isnt so much to propose buying sp but ere to give ccp an incentive to do the right thing whereas theyre currently unwilling to do so unless they see a bag of money first
why not just cut to the chase and do away with remaps and indeed statistics altogetherno seriously though thats the logical end point of where this is all going just have a set learning rate of whatever skillpoints per hour with no dependency on statistics or implants and leave it there then all this petty whining for just one more little extra advantage can ceasesince the whole point of time based skilling is to eliminate skillgrinding and free us up to actually do stuff we want to then lets do it properly2500 sphr for every account all the time
signed for no insurance payouts for ship losses to concord i also think ships destroyed in criminal action should have their wrecks impounded by concord which then can be purchased back by the victim for a percentage of the market value of the dropped modulessuicide ganking should be part of the game in my opinion it should not be profitable for the gankers or so punitive on the gankeesyes im a carebear or whatever you want to call me and yes im obviously speaking from the position of someone who has been on the wrong side of a suicide gank i know that eve is a harsh game but i think it would still be plenty harsh were it no longer possible for a few people in t1 battleships to destroy my mission running ship worth hundreds of hours intensive isk grinding in a completely unavoidable attack and actually make a profit from itif im honest i couldnt care two flips for the game experience of people who choose to play eve like this if i had my way suicide ganking would only be for matters of honour or revenge and you wouldnt make a single isk from it there seems to be a group of people who like to use eve to indulge in playground bullying simply because they can they like to pick on carebears and laugh at them when they get upset then hide behind internet anonymity and the excuse that its just a game if someone spent hundreds of hours making a functioning replica naval warship then took it to the park to sail would you snatch it out of their hands and stamp on it because its just a toy its scummy behaviour and the people who engage in it are at best extremely thoughtless and at worst bullies
well at least youre honest that you want a completely unbalanced game purely in order to advance your own narrow interests in it that alone earns you more respect than most of the weaselwording whinersthere seems to be a group of people who think that they should always be allowed to win and never have to lose if someone spent hundreds of hours putting together a local baseball league which you then would you throw a tantrum when you got caught out and your team lost and threaten to sue the opposing team such people are at beat extremely thoughtless and at worst childish entitled loserseve is one of the few games which doesnt tell everyone theyre a winner just for trying its one of the very few mmos that its possible to lose thats what makes it special and if you dont like that aspect of it then i can hardly understand why youre playing it
all i saw from u was nothing but qq about how ganking a few miners somehow leads to the end of the universeoh i knowure slow since it took u so long to finally get it and u dont like being made fun of for it if its too much for u u can tell me to stop and illconsider it
1dont agreesuicide ganking needs buff not nerf
lol dbut seriously either grow a backbone and deal with the lone afk cloakie in your system or press for no more local in 00 or local that only shows people who chat growing a backbone is obviously beyond most of these whinging carebear botters so expect more whinging remove local threads soonthough without local theyd actually have to defend their borders uh oh effort required that wont work then
i didnt see the proposal anywhere but i think ill agree all cosmos storyline modules definitely need to be boosted on attributes to make them better than meta level 4 and t2 modules this would make them a sought after itemthe prices for the materials bpcs and modules is player driven cant help that all the materials to build the modules can be found in the various cosmos complexes the agents send you into also some of the storyline modules are actually better than meta level 4 and t2
friendly bump
just read this now interesting proposal but must be balance vis a vis the loss of income for pve missioners essentially makes implant income for industrialists only which leaves only factional and navy ships as income for mission runners or am i missing something else
that is why i was trying to use current ingame mechanics but i say that as little more than a novice in the programming field
and thats why i think with the addition of crew damage you can at least say that a gallentean fleet can withstand the most damage and keep hitting minnis have high alpha but wear them down and their ships start falling apart slowing down loose turret tracking according to ccp lore the required crews rank with gallente needing the fewest at the low end of the range then amarr caldairi finally matariit sort of opens a different dimension in fleet tactics i think you can hit hard and fast with matari but if you are expecting a drawn out battle on a long expedition into enemy 00 territory or wh and will be far from crew resupply gallentean ships will win the endurance race so better bring some along for fleet durability
supportedand personally i think that not only hybrids should be buffed but also drones and gallente ships in general im not saying that we should be oped but we do need a few boosts here and there

maybe i just have too many characters with moderate to high sp although i dont have near as much as some players but i just dont see sp as any sort of achievementit definitely isnt something to be proud of or valuedbut i know that many of the people who leave eve leave because they feel they can never catch up there is no level 80 that is the max level which would cause them to catch up to those of us who have been playing a long timenow yes many players who have played for a while understand that there is an effective level on different ships i cant get any more sp that improve my ability to fly a zealot for example but newish players come from other mmos where this is not the case so they havent internalized thisisk is actually the more correct level in eve and we have had gtcsplexsetc for a long time and no one suggests they go awayand yes as already mentioned people can buy a character with isk but people still often identify with their characters and this is not a solution at all for new characters
can you justify this stance sp learning path is a long process you can waste time training the wrong thing you can be impatient and train the pilot skills or you can play it slow and stead and train core skills its a strategy much like choosing your major in uni i believe it is the only level mechanic in evei think most people who enjoy eve would agree that these players should just stick to playing wow or sw galaxies oops that one died i dont remember whyi disagree here isk can be bought stolen loaned etc isk is less of a level differentiator than sp more precisely learned skills not just raw sp or standings
your opinion is bad even though i dont support buying sp im sick and tired of words earned and easy and such all it means you paid money to ccp and waited nothing more no accomplishment nada
nomore people would leave over this than stayi promise you im absolutely certainlet those who want to be instant gods go play other games we dont need their kind in eve
simply poor interface design
thanks for posting
supported
agreed your description of this issue is 100 accurate i didnt even know this was the issue until i read this thread i target random stuff all the time now supported
well written proposal and although im new i can tell the change or revert proposed would make much more sense
fully supported
lets get this sorted asap please
when camping a gate or station i usually have a few bookmarks around it as do most ppl i think however when a possible target is flying around the distance the bookmark is made i still have to guess if heshe is close to it and how far i should warpso i suggest showing your own bookmarks in space so you can see clearly if the target is close to it and how far of you have to warp to be able to snatch it
i agreeid probably do that some time someday but mostly itll just be used against me guess ill just have to htfu 
supported t2 frigs are somewhat poor choice now
in may 2003 eve came online too america 1 week sooner then in europe and there was only isk as currency only 5000 players could get online or server gets a break down4 years later the plex came for those people who could not afford money too buy playtime plexes where created with soul purpose for those who could make around 300 mil isk too buy playtime for a monthanother 4 years there was the aurum and how game technics work here i find strangesome people do not need plexes too play eve but now they make the aurum and too get too the aurum you need plexes whysecond why is not possible too get aurum directly through isk because plexes are then high then low in price too obtain while isk is a solid currencyi think the ones are are familiar with the concept plexes the step too aurum is easy but for people who buy playtime through other currency like the euro or dollar the step too aurum get difficult as they make the step too plexes the real currency that flows through ccp gets thinner is ccp planning too get no currency at all anymore and make plexes there base currency in eve
i like anything that doesnt involve forcing my ram to load a million character polygons right after and possibly right before loading a million ship fleet polygons in a game that already has the worst memory management ive ever encounteredi hope youre right though the fact that they didnt give this option at release only makes me fear the worst
reppyk i wouldnt listen to page too much she obviously isnt listening to youim not sure what youre trying to say about faction ships and im too noobish to be expected to but ill agree with you its pretty clear hybrids are a main weapon at least among tech 1 gallente and caldari ships caldari seem to be about evenly balanced between hybrids and missiles with all read 1000000000 damage ships focused on either missiles or hybrids never on both together this doesnt mean a missile focused ship doesnt have a utility high it cant fill with a hybrid and vice versa but nobody can reasonably expect the other types of weapons to get much love on the thing the closest thing to a compromise between missiles and hybrids is a merlin and as far as i can tell it only has half and half to reduce its dps because it tanks so well the funny thing is that it does a lot better with missiles even though it has a hybrid weapon bonus when i was a noob i was killing stuff with my rockets in one used the other highs for nonweapons cause i never scored any hits with hybridsand hybrids are very clearly the main weapon gallente have their ships generally have larger drone bays than other race ships but only a handful actually have drone bonuses yet the increased drone bay doesnt even come close to making hybrids work on those shipssupported because you seem to know what youre talking about
im just talking from a general standpoint with focus on balance and lore so please dont jump all over me question what pirate faction would that be i always thought skill combos for the pirate where lore based not arbitrary decisions just to make the game mechanics symmetrical guristas operate in gc spaceangels are influenced by mg due to their tight alliance with each otherbloods span am territoryand sansha is a caldarian but was banished to amarr fringeshow would they be able to fill the missing combos and indeed why should they besides making some people with some sp invested in certain races sc skill happywell khanids are a weird oddity they arent really a separate faction entirely more like the thukker tribe but playable so their ships are really amarrian and as such need to be play balanced in the larger amarrian scale i dont think it would be fair to give amarr another navy ship without giving every other race one too
amarr gallente pirate faction is equilibrium of mankindthey all use amarr hulls with railguns mounted
heres an example fit like i was talking about i cant fit mine exactly like this due to not having advanced weapon upgrades but its more than possiblehighs4x 425mm ac2x hammidsyt8 mwdys8 abweblowstracking enhancerarmor explosive hardenerdamage controlrigsantithermic pumpantikinetic pumpancillary current router powergridnow obviously this cant take hits like a tough cruiser but thats irrelevant considering how swift it is with about 11k ehp it is a lot tougher than a destroyer its less agile with a 54s align time vs 44s in an unmodified thrasher but its top speed is higher despite the armor rigsalso its no dps king it doesnt have to be either if you want dps use a rupture which though high for a cruiser is still pathetic the stabber can keep up with destroyers easily as well as any frigate it gets a web on add to this that its dps is quite a bit higher than a destroyer 176k w max skills vs 140k thrasher w top weapons and max skills 154 dps w assault launchers so this thing is quite good at taking out the little ships its tracking obviously isnt nearly as good as a frigate but ive found it still has little trouble hitting them medium autocannons track about half as fast as small pulse lasers and have considerably higher range despite losing very little range from ammo unlike pulse laserssignature radius comparison35m  rifter75m  thrasher105m  stabber130m  rupture240m  hurricanefrigate average about 41mdestroyer average about 83mcruiser average about 130mbattlecruiser average about 285mso as you can clearly see the stabber blurs the line between destroyer and cruiser when it comes to signature radius as well as several other aspects this gives it plenty of utility and if it looks as good in practice as it does in theory it should be a pretty useful hullbut you cant really know if it works till you try it i have and it does work
duchess do try to keep baseless inflammatory remarks to a min and your credibility will also benefit we arent trying to shoot you down here just asking due diligence questions if you want general consensus then the onus is on you to explain to the public thats us the justifications for your arguments in plain terms and we have the right to ask for clarifications without any beratinganywaysokay this is true now that its apparent that you are speaking from a purely maxxed out t2 standpointso am i correct to assume that assume that your numbers are also comparing a fully t2 maxxed out drake by my guesstimates comparing fully maxxed kits on the caracal and the drake we have about 30m vs a 60m kit of which only insurance covers only 2m and 30m respectively this i presume is the source of your gripe1 general point have you considered the effects of your changes on nonmaxxed out t2 fits it does sound like a maxxed out t2 modded caracal is not a smart idea but then what if the simple answer to this should be that you shouldnt fit one like this maybe the progression should be as you sp up caracal with t1 fits then when you can fit some t2 mods go drake then when the mods for drake overcome the price move to cerberus higher insuranceso im going to put forth a postulate which you may feel free to refute postulatethe market based solution would be not to use t1 cruisers for pvp on a 1 on 1 basisas you put it now that we understand each other t2 modded t1 cruiser hull is not cost effective instead of resorting to game mechanic changes what if this just means that if you want to use t1 cruisers or any ship fit them cheap relative to their insurance prems and just use more of themie t1 fit caracal may not match a drake nor should it but 1 of them may give the drake a problem a t2 fit caracal is not cost efficient so instead you should use drakes instead if you can not everyone in the game can fit t2 maxxed mods so changing mechanics only based on this situation is dodgy and you can easily inadvertently make a t1 fitted caracal be able to destroy a t1 drake which then doesnt seem right considering their price differencesreally what the perfect fix would be is if insurance worked on the mods fitted but that would be too complicated as ins would need to be invalidated each time you refitin summary im not against any changes you proposed perse just the economical justification the role of a t1 cruiser is multifaceted just because it isnt a good choice for pvp doesnt mean it needs a buff to be maybe its fine that its a pve missioning boat only or a noob ship if you buffed them it would take a bit away from the role of hacs wouldnt it
overpoweredness of tier2s was evident since the day 1 its kind of sad to see people barely realising it now but its still better than nothingeach tier2 bc is to lose 1 high and 1 medlow slot  and this is the prerequisite of making them actually balanced both with cruisers and command shipsstupid penny pinchers and abusers may now go  themselves
true if hull cost and slotlayout ratio was static 3mil hull could have 8 slots and 30mil hull would have 80 slots  3mil hull costs about 3 modules worth and 30mil hull costs 30 modulesif you buff cruisers you need to increase hull cost to maybe 9 mil even then the slotshullcost ratio isnt comparable between cruiser and bc but it would help
that fit you suggested needs awu v and a 2 grid implant and still has half the ehp and dps of another cruiser also it costs significantly more than a t2 frigate which would outperform it in every way sorry but youre making a really terrible case for this ship all the fits i have are mediocre at best and the ones youre suggesting are just a mess stabber needs a buffpretty much yeah t2 is the standard and pretty much mandatory for a lot of ships and setupslasers underperform without scorch and have you seen the prices on meta hmls just as a couple of examplesthis is exactly the problem we have now actually battlecruisers are regarded as a higher tier of ship when what they should be is an alternative with pros and cons of their own hac vs bc is a choice that needs to be weighed up and is not a straightforward upgrade either way bc vs cruiser should be the samethe suggested changes are not because of their performance on a 1v1 basis in fact im pretty sure i specifically stated the situation of bc  cruiser in a 1v1 fight is absolutely fine right nowthe problem is that their role has been taken over almost entirely by the battlecruiserand 1 t1 fit drakes would give t1 fit caracals a problemseriously any suggestion you make on use of cruisers at their current performance i can just as easily apply to bc hulls resulting in the cruisers getting obsoleted yet again i happen to have a budget fit for the drake myself which offers close to t2 performance at a fraction of the pricethis is why cruisers need a buff anything they can do bcs can do better with the obvious exception of the blackbirdthere is no way the changes suggested here are going to make it a smart idea to engage a drake in a caracal the buffs and nerfs on each side just arent big enough to make this a viable fight but they are big enough to give cruisers a role seperate from bcsthis is a terrible situation more viable ships  more variety  better gamenope hacs would remain more or less where they are  a significant price increase for better performance and roles that bcscruisers cant fillexample the current harbingerzealot decision would then become harbingerzealotomenalso how would you justify some ships being broken for pvp pve and as noob ships because you dont have to look hard to find hulls that fit that description
lvl3 mission boat for players with 100mil isk okay it may not be much but this is a valid role for t1 cruisers people who are more combat oriented in the game perhaps can think of more alright lets look at the situation in the reverse instead of saying hey there are these cruisers which seem to be not useful for pvp can you instead try to describe the fleet hole that you are trying to fill with cruisers is there a hole what i mean is tacklers are frigs you have bombers covert the dps tank is the bc what other role do you see that can be useful in pvp herewhat im trying to tease out or perhaps bring to your attention is buffing something is fine when you have a objective that you want the buff to achieve just making a cruiser a faster but lighter tanked dpser in a gang one must ask is there room or even need for a lighter tanked dpser in a gang why not just use the bc costif you wanted to go and rebalance all these lesser used hulls then i would have imagined you starting with the dessie i mean at least cruisers get used a lot in pve missions for people on tight budgets dessies have no use at all anymore except that of a budget noctisfunny situation may be after a cruiser buff people start complaining about the uselessness of dessies so they buff dessies to be as fast as frigates then people start complaining about how t1 frigates are completely useless and unused as everyone uses dessies when they want a fast hitteri personally am open to a careful controlled buff on cruisers maybe making them a tad faster is alright but i defer to ccp to run the numbers on the balance here i am still of the opinion that they already have a great role to play in pvp ie a budget battlecruiser for those not using t2 mods i like that i can throw away my cruiser without much financial hit
thats not a role thats grasping at straws a ships usefulness for pve is purely incidental and should never have any bearing on pvp balancing i hope you dont seriously think that 15 or so ships existing purely as newbie trash is good games design did you even read any of the op the whole purpose of the mobility buffs and nerfs is to split the two ship sizes by speed making the battlecruisers as slow as their size should be and the cruisers considerably more agile and much better fitting in a gang that requires itthis principle is already applied in practical pvp  when was the last time you saw someone bring along a drake to a nano gang the problem right now is that the gap is too small relative to the tankgank difference and the economic issues only compound thisseriously the proposal outlines very clearly what the distinction and role between the two sizes should be and all you can say is that cruisers are fine because they have stupidly nichUFFFD pve rolesof course precise role will differ from ship to ship as a few examples of post buff caracals and omens will make very nice ranged damage dealers stabbers will be very workable cheap nanoships mallers will actually be worth flyingetc etc etctheres so much potential in the current cruiser lineup that a bit of well placed rebalancing would neatly sort outby the way right defer it to the people who made the dramiel go 6kms and the omen not even have the grid to fit basic weapons and an 800mm plate among numerous other blindingly stupid design decisions
 opthe balance of t1 cruisers is fine one point you brought up was speed they should be slow so you want to get to t2 or specific ships i remember it took me 3 days to get into a tech 1 cruiser it should perform as suchnotsupported because it would
how exactly is the balance fine when half of them are utterly mediocre and the other half are largely obsoleted by bcsthis is one of the stupidest arguments ive ever heard it takes a couple of extra days if that to get into a drake from a caracal does that mean it should perform barely any betterconversely it takes much longer to get into a hac  does that mean it should be an unstoppable pwnmobile what wipes out any bc that gets in my wayeven a 2 week old player has usually figured out the game doesnt work that way come back when you have something remotely intelligent to contribute
wow trolling your own thread huh yea hacs should wipe bcs cause it takes more skillsresources to get there maybe u want to play wow
 right except they dont they have this thing called different roles it seems youre only capable of thinking of ship balance in the very simplest terms namely biggerpricier is better once again the game doesnt work this way and i suggest you try to understand that
do you see the should there nerdrage much cya
according to you who seems to know about as much about eve as the average wow player go off and learn the basics before trying to debate balance changes
nerrrrrrrddddrrrrrrraaaaggggeeeeee rrrrrrrraaaaaarrrrwwwwww
oh look ad hominem attacks last resort of truly stupid people who are way out of their deapthanyway anyone have anything to add to this proposal that isnt based on a 12 year old counterstrike fanboys idea of how eve should work
maybe we should get our ships back too when we die and no podding in lowsec all you are doing is saying we should water down this game so an aspect that you frequent will go better for you this will not benefit the game as a whole just what you do
supported amarr get shafted the worst by this tbh only 1 useful combat cruiser and it isnt even laser bonused
i want more variety in the game rather than an entire size class being relegated to newbie trash for no good reasonyou want the one with the biggest shiniest thing to win all the time sounds much more like the wow player attitude to me but hey it seems youve either not read or not understood the op because youve made no points at all to refute or counter a single thing ive said all you do is rage and spew insults no coherent argument whatsoeveredit that last quote is a prime example actually worthless strawman arguments not based on any evidence or fact
the ideal end result cruisers are lighter faster and more economically viable compared to battlecruisers and also have a greater number of viable classes battlecruisers are slightly toned down but maintain their role as anticruiser and generally higher dpstank platforms for gangs where speed is less of an issuethoughtsare basically your points1st there are t2navyt3etc cruisers that serve this purpose 2nd would change the mechanics of many aspects of the game to serve this little niche you are crying about fail sorry 1edit look at the big picture ex think of how badass a drake speed tank would be thats right it would be too badass
and would continue to do it better than the t1s your pointumm no it really wouldnt it would make cruisers a viable alternative while refining the bcs nichUFFFD down a bit from allpurpose pwnmobilehaving a large number of ships ingame that have no real purpose is not good design simple as why is a greater number of viable choices a bad thing the rocket buff a while ago made several previously broken ships workable thus adding more choice same principle herethere are no core mechanics changes in this proposal just buffing a number of broken ships and more clearly defining cruiser role
think about this for just a min before you reply i would be able to dps fit my drake to solo lvl 4s that is not a correct game mechanicas for your t1 comment well thats the benefit of flying ships better then t1s i assume you are a poor pirate and are looking to exploit because your op makes no sense when you really think about it
the main problem lies within t1 cruisers and bcs filling the same role but for a marginal price difference and a few days of training bcs are practically better at everythingmy proposal would be to give bcs a fitting bonus on bs class weapons not just an increase in grid and cpu cause that would be abused so they can fit the small tier bs turrets which dont get used by bs anywayget rid of some highslots so the overall dps would stay the sameeffects they would still be a highly mobile decently tanked dps platform for low cost compared to a bs reminder solely losing the rigs on a bs costs more than the entire bc loss but cruisers could get under their guns thanks to bs class weapons crappy tracking  sigresolutionthat way both had their niche
please point out where exactly i suggested enabling drakes to speed tank because if i did that was one hell of a typooh look more strawman argumentsi had the idea a while ago of putting a tracking penalty on bcs similar effect overall
this makes sense
so all i see you doing here is twisting around what people are saying for your benefit gg forum troll gg
please point out where exactly i suggested enabling drakes to speed tank because if i did that was one hell of a typo
prestidigitation
i like your idea but i think it needs tweaking if implemented as you describe pilots will probably find it an easy and dishonest way to raise their security status simply by shooting an alt with low security statussupported with reservations because i think it is a great idea if it can be made to work
i have hard time seeing this would make any difference because no one is shooting blinkys anyway even tho they can pretty freely aggro them anywhere
supportedit seems like one way of getting around the aforementioned exploit pirates killing alts to improve sec status is to scale the regained sec status to the amount of damageproperty destroyed that is if the pilot takes out a pirate in a shuttle he gets next to no standings increase if he takes out a fully loaded bs carrying t2 bpos and bunch of highend ores then he gets a substantial standings boost basically if a pirate wants to game the system they have to loserisk a lot to do it
this gives them the incentive to do so when you pay forreward a behaviour you get more of that behaviour from people
i think that would work however ccp would have to improve the system that determines the base value of the stuff on a ship especially in the case of blueprints
how do killmails do it an avg of jita mid prices  that could work dont forget to factor in insurance costs as well pirates alts are really only losing the insurance premium and the base price vs jita repurchase price difference not the cost of the ship
yeah theres no way that this could possibly be exploited wts sec boosts provide me with a supply of t1 frigates any kind and pay 50mhr and you can shoot me until your sec is 50
i agree and for the extremely predatory pirate who wants to pod kill and then go fellow pirate hunting so he can hang out and drop pvp cans in highsec this is perfect
everyone who supports this thread in spirit though not necessarily the implementation needs to go read thisbounty changesthis will basically address the infrastructure mechanics that this proposal may be able to take advantage of also please vote for it in the crowdsource vote thread so many other things will be possible once there is a working bounty system in eve
umm not sure if this has been suggested but what about scaling the sec status gain by ship sizetype tech 2s faction and bigger ships yielding a bigger gain than frigates etc and rookie ships and shuttles giving no gain whatsoeverin any case great ideaedit oh and im also in favour of this system only working for people with say 1  0 or higher that would need tweaking additionally tech 1 should give a lower gain across the board to account for the likelihood that theyre insurededit2  now that is interesting
there is only one issue i can see with this and its my own 10 status your idea will move me off 10 if i shoot another pirateim not against it just wonder if we can limit this so only those with sec status of 5 and above will gain
makes very much sense you currently lose secure status if you aggress an innocent player therefore it makes an awful lot of sense to reward you instead of punishing you if you help concord get rid of pirate scum in highsec1
hi all1st time poster after 12 months in evepetitionsit seems an odd statement when individually asking for assistance as the term petition for me at least and many i have asked  relates to a collective of people all petitioning for the same outcome hense petitions should be revamped to something more in line with help request for helpassistance attention required commentgateswhen warping to gates we should come to a complete stop rather than bouncing off the gate and heading back into spacebposthere should be a seperate market category under blue prints 1 for bpos the other for bpcssomething i would like to see implemented customisable ship colors  corp names and or ship names on sides of vessels bridge view option   as opposed to chase view all the time  buying a crew  purchased on the open market the better the crew the better the enhancement of your ships performance operationally fuel  varying grades of fuel the higher the grade the better the warp speedwell thats it for the time being go hard  full throttle on your thoughts and criticismscheershuntsmanthe house of 5trippers
theyre called petitions because you put an idea out there whether that idea is to fix something or have something corrected then ccp folks get together and sign your petition if they support you getting your stuff back or they dont because the logs show nothingtheres always some variance in where you come out of warp sometimes you stop 2km away sometimes you overshootmarket can only list items that have the exact same stats hence why only brand new bpos are listed anything thats been modified such as research on bpos or bpcs has to be listed as a distinctly separate item which is handled via contracts1 custom paintjobs corp logos and such have been asked about for a long time they may or may not be coming through the new noble exchange2 there is no bridge view because there is no bridge your character is floating in a goo pod like the matrix and is experiencing everything through virtual reality what youre seeing is what your character sees3 crew is also often asked for but really unnecessary for the most part everything is controlled mentally by the pilot the crew is only there to make sure the tp in the bathroom is stocked and the hallways are swept if they were added to the game it would just be another slot to minmax like rigs4 fuel is already an issue for cap ships when it comes to jumping if every ship had to keep an eye on their fuel gauges or risk floating in enemy space it would be a huge pita besides thats what the capacitor is for if you want to warp faster get a better ship or fit hyperspatial velocity optimizer rigs
bpcs cant be sold on the conventional market though only on contracts this nullifies your suggestionunless your suggestion is to have bpcs sold on the market as well but that has its own issuesship colours  theyre working on that doubt well see the rest thoughbridge view  like a nose cam its possible i suppose edit though now that i think about it it would be useless as you wouldnt be able to see anything around you only in frontbuying a crew  been suggested a bagillion times no one knows if its coming or notfuel  our ships have no need for fuel it seems
what i believe to be wrong with dscan currentlyuniform short scan duration regarless of rangeidentification of names of ships as well as the ship model the actual ship and not ship type eg bestower and not industrialdscans role in eve online  points to take into considerationa lot of people use dcan religiouslyits an integral tool for gang and fleet strategyany changes or fixes to it would need to be fair and reflect the current dscans abilities and shortcomings at a tactical level proposed changesscan duration should tie in with its current scan range scan results should not include shipnames or discreet ship model names but ship class namesscan results should show distance to target but without a numerical indication of scan range deviation of 25 based on user defined scan range explainations the longer the range the longer the scan duration and therefore the less server requests for max range dscans in busy contested systems its totally logicaldscan should not be able to identify shipnames or shiptypes like rhea or capsule or vagabond but be able to identify hull size or approximate ship type from sig radius and categorise them as say freighter capsule or cruiser there should be no way such a short scan on items within a 14au range should return such detailed information so quickly because of this its immersion breaking even if youd hate that both a vagabond and a celestis would come back as a cruiser it makes much more sense than the current systemthis form of returned result would have tactical advantages if tied into ships signature radius as active mwds could skew results into a larger shiptype eg a battlecruiser with an active mwd could be erroneously categorised as a battleship this would depend on tests to check whether this has any increased server overheads otherwise it could just return the ship classits an outlet for racist sexist inflamatory and profanic messages though hardened to this from years of fleet chat links in retrospect itll probably help with game promotion if kiddies starting out in eve in hisec arent asking their mothers what a blue waffle is when they see it as a ship name on dscanwhat this sort of ship identification nerf should be rebalanced with is the dscans ability to pinpoint distances but with a varying degree of accuracy accuracy thats not based on levels in astrometrics but fixed across all shiptypes and all skill levelsusing the dscan should be a skill that pilots learn by practice and not grinding spmuch like probes distance approximations should carry a level of deviation so for example the max dscan distance of approx 14au should have a sufficient deviation derrived from its range in percent i put this figure at 25hence a 14au scan with a result of 1 contact at 12au would mean that that contact can reside in a space anywhere within 9au and 15au due to the deviation of 12aus at 25  3aus the shorter the range thats scanned the smaller the deviation even though the percentage stays fixedan explanation of this deviation for game immersion can be that scanning to a longer ranger requires a boost to signal strength and that this boost negatively affects scan resolutionhow i arrived at this percentage was to approximate a contact that would lay close to the maximum scan range and push the deviation out to a point that it would likely encompass not just a single planet and its moons but likely a few planets this form would still require pilots to rangefind contactsthis is an approximation of the way many pro pilots use the current dscan to calculate contacts distance by constant rescanning and range finding using approximate km equivalents of aus then ranging smaller values until the contact can only reside in a few specific areastbc
continued the only downfall is that to scan at a tighter deviation you need to be closer to the contact to me thats logical as scanning at larger distances should distort sensor resolution o maccloud
these proposed changes support and further encourage blob warfare while making intel gathering tactical assessment for small gang and solo pilots impossibleblobs dont need the intel while it is critical to guerilla fleetssoloersedit also you havent actually stated why this change is needed other than a single statement about wanting to protect kids from reading naughty words in an online game
how in holy hell did you get to that assumption from the changes proposed my guess is you actually couldnt be arsed to read what i wrote and dont understand whats being changed and how it relates to combat and sologangfleet strategiesblobs need intel as much as gangs and soloers whats ridiculous is the fact somehow u think blobs will get more information than gangs or soloers youre completely totally and utterly wrong in this
the current dscan mechanic isparticularly illogical in physical termsis a conduit for unnecessary antisocial profanitiesan easy button for intel gatheringthe ui is horrible
 scan duration should tie in with its current scan rangedont like it makes it harder for people to scan you down perhaps but they have essentially all the time in the world as i dont know theyre doing it so what remains is just the negative effect that this proposal makes it harder for me to see combat probes in system coming
well i wasnt going to put any actual numbers down on the max 14au distance scan duration bt was thinking aound 10 seconds so unless you know sum1 who can scan u down from start to finish in 10 seconds flat id be amazedbut the typical 4au scan duration would be along the lines of 1 secondtbh im envisioning the scan duration vs range graph to be exponential or relatively exponential in shape so small and medium range scan duration are actually shorter than current scan speeds with the recal warning
dscan should be passive instead of the clickfest it is nowhave it use capacitor depending on the settings setting could beanglerangeresult type ship probe wreckfrequency how often you get resulthigher values would cost more capthere could be limit to frquency to prevent lag if you had max range 360 degree scan with all result types you could be limited to one scan every 20secscanner would have to be reactivated manually every 5 minutes to prevent people forgetting it on and lagging serverexamplesbelt ratter could use 2au range 360 degree ship and probe result types and hed get a result every 2 seconds and it would cost 01 of max cap with every resultscout could use 7au range 10 degree ship result type and get result every second and would cost 005 of max capnoob would use 14au range 180 degree ship drone and wreck results but would be limited to a scan every 12sec and it would drain 25 of max cap with every result
trolling aside i can see where you are going with this miss spank i really do feel that someone that suicide ganks you has that right to do so because they are doing it on a fair playing field that being risks are the same for both parties because the mechanics of high sec that being the concorde beat stick and the risk of being in space in general i think you are steering away from the issue the issue here is players exploiting the wardec game mechanics they obviously do not have a legitimate grievance with said corp they wardecd and have no business attacking them im not saying take that option away what i am proposing is changing the rules a small amount as to stop obvious exploitation sephiroth i like your idea better then the flat rate i put out i think that is a really good idea if not taken advantage of but i can see myself included people making tons of alts and putting them in corp to avoid a wardec maybe put a limit on how much it would cost or somethingkin netics and lakitel thank you for your perspectives on this
though im not agreeing to either statement to raise or leave the current wardec fees i do think this above statement is unfounded i dont see how making fees more will make pvper want to waste more money by suicide ganking suicide ganking has little relation to wardec fees and its only governed by the amount of isk a gankee is carrying put another way wardec or not if a pvp gang sees a gank target worth taking they will suicide gank it not wait for a wardec on a corp
recently i became aware of a real case of a corp being destroyed in a matter of a few weeks by frivolous wardecs this upstart corp had succeeded in gathering a treshold number of players like 40 most of them were newbies just a few weeks old but also a couple of real veterans 3 6 7 years old with previous experience of living in lowsec and 00for these this corp was to be a new start a new voyage through eve everybody was excited about this new joint venture and what could be built of this corpbut even before it really took off the wardecs started to drop in my guess is the recruitment visibility drew attention anyway the young players whith limited rl funds who relied on plex to be able to play were pretty much forced to leave the dropouts affected things badly in the corp ofc but so did the consequtive wardecs some old player tracked and hunted alone but ultimately didnt dare to do something you see he would risk hurting his corp even more prolonging the war by giving the pvpers what they wanted a fightit didnt really matter i guess because the corp died anyway the more people dropped off the faster others followed themultimately the real loss here is not the corp or the rare occasion of an assembly of people with chemistry goals and time zones that could have worked well but the dozen or so new eve players who quit playing for goodthis is not something that is good for eve and thus not even good for those pvp players who only think about their vain killboards and make these wardecs to have easy targets in highsecso yea i think something should maybe be done about this
excellent point and example of the retention this is causing unfortunately i am sure the griefers do not care about retention know what it means nor understands how it effects them
i think another point that we should bring up here is when new people are starting out now they are having a much much harder time then when the veterans started its really night and day the ratio of average skill points to new players is much higher which is in turn making it much easier to be a veteran i think i can simplistically state it like this noone will play with you in your sandbox if you keep throwing sand in their face
quoted for infinite truth why should ccp have to step in here when its well within player abilities to mitigate this problem
again you are steering away from the topic this thread has to do this the obvious exploitation of wardec mechanics not avoiding them please reread and reply ontopic i would like to see the other perspective and not a short troll reply
that was on topic lady spank put it perfectly  wardec mechanics dont need changing its just a simple fact of eve that if you start a corp you need to be both able and willing to deal with problems that will ariseits perfectly possible to do so and as such changes are not neededoh but of course if it was a troll reply or had no merit youd be able to refute it why dont you give that a go come on surely its an easy point to answeredit and heres another question  do you really think wardecs would be so widespread if people didnt practically paint a target on their ships most of the noob corps ive seen wardecced were practically begging for it  lax recruitment advertising themselves as carebears and not having a clue how to deal with the consequences
i am replying to everyone while i can to be respectful you are still offtopic avoiding wardec is not the issue at all and was never stated by me ever lady spank was offtopic as are you please reread and reply or not if you dont get it
ok ill put this nice and simply for you because you seem to be a pretty simple personpirates blow up your general comprehension along with your shipyou made a whine thread saying wardec fees should be increasedthis suggestion had the aim of reducing wardecsthis suggestion is unnecessary because the means to deal with wardecs are already available to players who arent too inept to use themunderstand yet or do i need to use shorter words
ok well i guess you dont get it or you are trolling either way you comprehension needs work
is this your point because besides that you were showing me your leet comprehension skills if so again let me restate this thread is not about avoiding wardecs it is about aggressors spamming wardecs on new players to exploit killboards and result is hurting retention of new players thus hurting eve as a whole please if you have something to add ontopic please do so with a little more maturity
your solution to which is increasing costs which is pointless for the reasons outlined above seriously do i need to use shorter words or something here maybe draw you a diagram
ok i give up if u refuse to address the issue i cant answer you
i just did you tool you suggested an increase to wardec costs i explained using nice easy words why this is a stupid idea you then threw a hissy fit about it being off topic when in fact its answering the key point of the op  the mechanics change
ok maybe you will understand it this way ill just tell you what whats correct you are supposed to be responding to the topic which is your opinion on aggressors wardecing easy targets to get killmails and the effect it has on retention of new players if you have an idea for a solution great please reply with your thoughts do not just focus on a minor suggestion to fix the problem but the original post the whole post i have outlined the main points above i do not know what else to do to make you understand this whats your highest level of schoolingedit also do not focus on what others replies that were offtopic it is not part of this thread
a significant change to game mechanics was part of your post i answered it if you dont want people to respond to it remove that point
i can agree with the op but i dont think a flat fee is the way to go i have heard of and experienced people that do this i gotta be honest if i didnt find a good corp as i did i would of left a long time ago this will make it less profitable and less inviting for people to pull this crap so i can see how raising the price would effect how much it gets done
so agreed its almost as if you read my recent post on the matter 1
wardec fees were once much lower than they were now they were increased because ccp caved into pressure from whiney carebears who want a riskfree game experienceif you want a riskfree game i know of a different game you should be playing
so what is it the only thing you said is the mechanics for dealing with this are there so what exactly are they and to curb your next reply no i am not too inept to see it im not a nub im not stupid im not a carebear im not an idiot in any way shape or form so now that we have your insults to me out of the way how about you post exactly what these steps are and they are mechaincs in place to deal with it is just a reiteration of what you said without adding anything new and saying you are stupid is not even an argument so i wont accept that either in fact here is a short format of how it should be represented just to make sure problem new players leave because they get grief deced solution x whatever that solution may be also let me say that leaving a corp is not viable solution thats a problem with the game mechanics not a solution     i dont know that charging just 1mil per corp members is enough i think there should be some kind of formula maybe something like number of aggressor corp x number of victim corp  3 so say a 10 man corp attacking another 10 man corp would cost 33mil and again even that amount isnt even that large if a corp is ready to start a war deceleration then they should have more than enough to cover that i would even be in favor of dividing the number by 2 instead of three but im trying to be fair pedit let me add that nobody is saying that highsec should be risk free what we are arguing here is that the risk is too high because the loss on the victim is disproportionate to the loss of the aggressor compare spending 2mil a week to having a whole corp collapsing and having new members quiting the game and there are several several cases so i would suggest you hatebears keep your nullsec opinions to yourselves
i think you got this figured backwards you want the isk free wardec experience you can currently circumvent highsec concord intervention and keep a corp decced for an entire year for the measely cost of running 1 single mission sic thats absurd yes i know you want griefingoneasystreet but if people had just a few honest bones in them left theyd admit how ludicrously low the cost of wardeccing is
funny but you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about between being grief deced until you loose all your members and your corp collapses suicide gankers who have no risk since they get reimbursed the ship cost in insurance the constant deflation and cost of minerals going steadily down and now ccp trying to screw with us from incursions such as open wh and sending in the sansha in nonincursion systems and of course the csm being controlled by you nullsecers i would say that highsec is much more risky than your blueblob safe napsec spaceif you want to dominate people and impose your control on them then i suggest you try soviet russia  germany or the middleeast because you were obviously born in the wrong time andor place
the problem here is people griefing new players by creating corps which are unable to organise and defend themselvestherefore my counterproposal is that creating a corp should require corp management 5 and cost 100m isk
well either way i definitely support this i can see this helping a pantload of people sure a few greifers and easystreeters might get annoyed by it but if they wanted no challenge what so ever they can go play wow
ty for the support i have yet to see a actual counter argument besides the usual toll bs i welcome a well thought out counterperspective besides go play wow idiocy seems to be prevalent in these counter arguments actually noone has addressed the issue i assume yall know its bs i am supporting my own topic because of the lack of a counterargument
how exactly does wardeccing noobs exploit killboardswhy is it such a huge issue that it needs to affect a widespread practice1 how do you imagine this will increase pvp in low and null sec people that want to be in those areas already are furthermore 00 alliances still get wardecced to pick off highsec stragglers the only people truly immune to player initiated wardecs are pirate corporations who can be shot by anyone regardless of concord sanctions or those in npc corps including fw corps ramping up the price of war does nothing but sink more isk for the agressors it will not make them move to lownull since their targets are in highsec if you respond no well they should you are missing the point that they want to kill those that think they have a right to immunity whether you think this is fair or not is irrelevant anyone that doesnt want to be on the receiving end of a wardec can drop corp and be as safe as they were before war was declared you forefeit the right to be in a corporation and develop a name cant fight for it dont deserve it2 are noobs incapable of avoiding wardecs3 eve does not need to be more inviting to new players as it is at present noobs can remain in npc corps until they are ready to enter a corporation if they keep their mouths shut and dont stick out its unlikely they will get wardecced anyway if you do get wardecced and go out and have all your  blown up by some  that you have utterly no chance against then its your own fault for flying all your  while knowingly being in a state of war again if you cant handle a war you can drop to an npc corp therefore your entire reason for this proposal is nullified4 who gives a crap about killboards they are external to the game how exactly is their exploitation damaging to the game people like lukka who get to number 1 in battleclinic through cheap game mechanics are known for what they are and it has zero bearing on the actual gamei have addressed your points in full since you cant understand that players have all the tools they need to circumvent any issues you have raisedfeel free to refute any of these and please try to do a better job than claim i am trolling anyone with an ounce of intelligence can see that i am not
i find it eminently amusing that wannabe pirates like you dare talk about risk aversion when your own set of balls is so small that you cry foul when your successful act of bravery  deccing noob highsec corps is being threatened by a nerf if youre such a big badass then hightail your sorry ass to lowsec pronto and fight people who can actually fight back you pansy
i already do pew pew in low sec i can barely enter highsec thanks for showing your incompetence to everyonefurthermore i am not crying foul i am pointing out how naive and poorly set out this proposal is the whole thing needs to be rethought if the intention is purely to help nurture noobs into the game because at present is it a huge change to wardecs across the board when the entire issue can be easily avoided by player action
ty for an actual response you are twisting my words but we ill take what i can get i will answer this in the same format you provided me with answers 1 i assumed this was obvious the players that sit in high sec blowing up noobsminersetc will not have such an attractive easy way to gain kills and isk by griefing easy targets this is not about a player trying to be high and mighty in high sec this is about making players like lukka have a harder time justifying keeping wardec on certain newb corps up for months and months until they destroy corp make people quit thus hurting retention and eve in a whole it will allow wardecs to happen still but it makes it less attractive this is an obvious exploit to say it isnt is complete bull 2 not the point of the thread3 in any business model retention of your customers is of the highest importance unless you are interested in killing this game and by other posts i can see you arent too happy with this game then go ahead grief new players examples have been given in previous posts in this thread and links have been provided in eve forums detailing wardec happenings and the effect it has on new players4 if you dont care about killboards then fine but some do no matter what happens when you kill a player it is logged on your account maybe you are out of touch with what a new players experience is like but i can assure you you had a much easier time then the new players today again thank you for an actual response
really
ffs this has nothing to do with nurturing nubs reread if you have to it is a fix for an obvious exploityou still havent addressed the issue you just are tiptoeing around it and changing it for your benefit i know this game ive played it beforeand btw i go out on roams almost daily i am not a bear i pvp if you keep up the insults im gonna have to ask you where your bridge is
the current fleet command structure allows for a maximum bonusd if thats a word fleet of 256 pilots with larger operations taking place regularly consisting of a number of fleets on each sidei think ccp should add 2 further levels to the fleet command structure a battle group commander able to command a group of 5 fleets at level 5 and a marshal able to command 5 groups taking the maximum numbers to 1281 and 6405 respectively with marshal to be coded but disabled pending lag reductions and fleet size increases to make it possible for 6k aside battles we can dream for these new levels fleet bonus range could be increased with group commander able to bonus within 5 jumps at l5 maybe with a long range command linkas well as simplifying fleet organization and potentially overview settings it could be used as a tool for ccp to automatically reinforce nodes particularly if coupled with a formal scout setting maybe with dedicated bonus to encourage use as if someone is forming a 1000 battlegroup somethings going to go down
yes because enabling blobs more is a good thing
fact is a fleet cammander is just that the cammander of the fleet if you need more then one fleet any sensible player would already have a devoted chat channel for the fcs and whoever is in charge of the overall attack if you absolutely have to have things implemented ingame just so you can organize more then one fleet at once you need to not cammand fleets anymorealso like the guy above said last thing we need is more blobbing all your proposal would accomplish is meaning that people who have the numbers to blob would not only outnumber their enemy but would have insane buffs because of the links you suggested making blobbing an even more op and easy button strategyalso really if your gonna give a bonus to a fleet you gotta be in the battle so you can be primaried and eliminated no bonusing from 5 jumps out because that would give one side a distinct advantage with incredibly reduced risk of losing their support and before you say its just one guy one ship buffing 5 fleets or whatever number your proposing would make a huge difference in the outcome of any battlemultiple edits for ridiculous typing errors
its quite annoying that this does not contain really pressing issuesfor example the imbalance between armor and shield supercapitalsalso i think its rather stupid that i as a player can not downvote some of those entries
do you have any comment that is even remotely contributing
i think youre on the right track but i dislike your idea because a control facility would require a lot of powergrid just by itself on lowmaintenance planets a typical setup will likely include a lot of extraction set to low extraction speed and just a few processing facilities since they run at a set speed so the drawback to your method is that it hurts lowspeed piive got a couple ideas though1 allow selection of multiple facilities hold down the ctrl key and click multiple facilities of the same type to select them and any action you make will be done to all of the selected facilities2 have a generate routes automatically button in plants that when clicked will cause the plants material requirements to be automatically routed from the nearest connected storage facility launch pad or command centerfor tier 2 and 3 materials if that storage unit is already connected to any processors which are generating the needed materials they will be routed from the processor to that storage unit after routing those the processors will also have their necessary materials routed to them from the nearest storage unit finally it will attempt to link tier 1 materials like sofor tier 1 materials if the storage unit is connected to any extractors which are extracting the needed resource it will be routed from that extractor to the storage uniteditso assuming your whole planet is making materials that all contribute to the same output you just select all tier 3 facilities set their production type select all tier 2 facilities set their production type select all tier 1 facilities set their production type make sure the extractors are running then click generate routes assuming your planetary setup is logical and efficient the routes should be generated just the way you want them to be
obviously there will be some rebalancing to made so that it doesnt hurt any kind of pi the point of it is to reduce click fest without hurting any kind of pi i presented a proposal here the exact details are ccps job they have the final say of it anyway if they even consider it
eve misses currently the functionality to visualise damage on itemsthere are afaik two kinds of damage for items 1 hp damage caused from overheating 2 and damage of tech ii or faction crystals caused by using themyou can visualise 1 by docking in station and using the repair feature 2 is quite tricky since you will have to undock ungroup your weapons and switch crystals until you know how much every crystal is damaged this also requires somehow to manually sort the crystals in cargo1 is kind of ok but 2 is quite a pain usability wise so please add a damage indicator like a small  value in the corner of the icon health bar  whatever fits best to the icon i dont think there is a need to differentiate between both damage types so both could use the same ui elementsi also dont think this would have a measurable impact on the server since firstly stacked items are not damaged and could be simply left out for the db request and secondly the amount of damage doesnt change while being in the cargohangar
answer to your questionwhen moving all probes in closer towards or away from the signature instead of moving each probe itself press and hold the alt key left click and hold mouse button on the arrow point of one probe when you move that probe in closer towards or away from the signature all the other probes will also move
the log has very limited options available to it and i propose adding several features and options a log can be an incredibly valuable tool especially in pvp situationsfor instance what if you wanted a log that only displayed when your fleet party members were being neuted and you wanted to use your support ship to help transfer capacitor in response1 add the ability to have multiple logs open each with their own settings2 expanding on 1 saveable setting presets3 ability to log other fleet members combat information4 when receiving or dispensing damage show damage type emp thermal explosive or kinetic5 expand display choices for each category currently provided and allow each of these details to be individually toggleable such as please note that i can not guarantee that the proposed examples pertain to their current master message category this is an educated guess and would obviously be easily reorganized accordingly by the game developersshow info messagesserver messagesshow warning messages cannot perform action warning other warningsshow error messages ui error module error client errorshow combat messages this is where it gets really important received damage  player from target received damage  player from npc received damage  player from police received damage  player from drones received damage  player from sentry received damage  player from friendly fire received damage  target from player received damage  target from player drones received damage  target from fleet member received damage  target from fleet members drone received damage  target from sentry received damage  target from police received damage  target from npc received damage  fleet member from target received damage  fleet member from targets drone received damage  fleet member from sentry received damage  fleet member from police received damage  fleet member from npc received damage  fleet member from friendly fire received damage  fleet members drone from friendly fire status effectweb scram ect  player from who status effect  target from who particularly fleet members status effect  fleet member from who miss  player to target miss  target to player anyways you get the ideashow notify messages similar to info messages joined channel gate messages station messages ship messages ie ship stopping ship warping ectshow question messages honestly i have little idea what a question message is relative to the i would also like to add there is a message type labeled generic i am not sure what this falls under but there should definitely be an option for it since messages like undocking fall in this category6 allow formatting the log as it stands right now you have default font size default columnstimetypemessage and default column arrangement allow columns to be addedremoved and rearranged as well as add a font size choice to the settings tab7 if support for multiple logs allow each log window to either be tabbed in the main one or undocked separately in a new window8 relocation of the settings tab for cleaner window perhaps a separate window that is accessible via right clicking the title much like the owner settings for the chat windows9 perhaps allow toggle settings for each of the settings in point five to allow or disallow ui center screen notifications10 allow custom colorization based on message type andor by playerfleet membertargetdronenpc ectsupport and suggestions appreciatedvortex steel
the ingame log is quite limitedhowever logs for just about everything are turned into text files in your my documents
for analyzing data after an event yes these can be quite helpful however it does nothing for during combat scenarios also these logs particularly the game logs with combat information only record the data your ingame log is set to display and only if that log is openwhat if you wanted a log that only displayed when your fleet party members were being neuted and you wanted to use your support ship to help transfer capacitor in responseor if you wanted to know if your target stopped all offensive mods not just on you but your entire fleet as a early detection for someone planning on dockingjust a few examples of the limitless real time applications the argument could be made that all of this information can be exchanged over voice channels but as many know large fleets can result in allot of voice chatter especially in group vs group battlesthank you for your response
sry please delete
still working out the bugs in your forum spammer bot
i think its high time players are allowed to wardec npc corps of course youll have to deal with those pesky npc corp members hostile stations whatever so the guy in the npc corp can sit safely near his npc corpmates but he cant do a lot of carebearing without leaving them behindi support your objective but not your methodsthis is what your post looks like to meqq more carebear
that would be the single most disruptive change in the game even if you buffed station and gate guns to the point of being useful you would still have to allow for players to join any npc corp not just the starting 3 per race noob stations would still be blood baths

incidentally ebay has a similar bot order bumper already you enter your bid and you enter the maximum price at which you would be willing to buy if your bid gets beaten it will bump it to the top until it reaches your cap i believe this makes for efficient markets and trading less of a clickfest and more of a thinking persons gameinteresting point point put forward was thisi am curious to know why you think this will happen i suppose if you didnt cap your bot so that it just blindly kept on bumping until you crossed the spread but then that would be the operators decision maybe you just want to get out if the market moves its a legitimate strategybesides on a parallel thread smaller spreads  more volume which is actually signs of an efficient market which benefits everyone especially market takers
how about a bot but programmed by ccp like the ebay bots where you pick a max price but the bot only increments as far as it has to and only 1 isk moreay theres a buy at 30 and you say you would bid up to 35 but the program recognizes that 3001 would win the next buy this might have to be combined with an enforced buy order cancellation time like you can run the price up but you cant cancel your buy until tomorrow needs some work on the margin order scam though i think this would eliminate fine granularity and allow make for more rapid spread changes and make the game more exciting
thats exactly the proposal yes you can also choose to have your order manually watched if you like the order bot is not mandatory prosopens up the trading profession for differentiation smart traders can then make money too not just the good at updating every 5 min traders adds depth the trading profession reward good trading strategy not just click fest mechanics allow for more long term horizon trading otherwise known as strategic trading due to eve mechanics all eve traders now are forced to be day traders  intraday edits to orders  even if they dont want to be i may only have monthly views on the movement of tritanium i should not have to micromanage my large orders if you couple with this the ability to delegate your corp orders to a corp mate to manage then you can setup a bonafide trading corp head trader makes the decisions and strategy junior traders manage them and for the really low pri orders the automatch bot can cons would allow traders to move their orders when not in the local region this may cause a flood of unwanted server traffic and activity also imbalance the current decentralize regional markets and lesson the value of the contract markets  though setting up bad bot order that you cannot modify can lose you money just as fast mitigationbot only works or can only be modified when you are in day trading range of the station would allow for some 1 unit orders to be used to auto manipulate the market mitigationonly allow orders over a certain size to be autowatchable small orders must be manually watched or charge a fee for use of the autowatch bot per order this is not unlike real life brokerage commission charges
im not sure but it sounds like youre asking for the attackers to get aggression to ninja looters all the rest appears to be excess garble that serves only to throw the reader off of your real pointi have to say i strongly disagree you dont get aggression to the ninja looters because theyre looting something that isnt yours but that didnt stop you from attacking what the wreck was a moment ago now did it so maybe you can just attack the ninja looters even though you dont have aggression just food for thoughtalso id like to congratulate you on almost reaching two pages of replies and still not having a single support thumb
i would like to congratulate you on ice harvesting to lvl 4 now stfu when i come to the ice harvesting thread and comment then i will care what you think
wow you do know tractor beams cannot pull cans that arent yours right thanks for the post
makes sense you live in 00 this issue doesnt effect you at all
confirming darius iii never spends any time in the forge ganking and stealing loot before the vultures take it
i think the key here is to have a pvp ship and a pve ship and to not get caught with your pvpants down when taking a pve
of course im arguing semantics now thats why i said technically you know why because the arguments you made make absolutely no sense what so ever if you know anything about running on a platform or politics in general then youd be well aware that any representative should fully comprehend an issue before making a comment on it saying something like taking a hulk to a c1 wh to day trip obviously shows the lack of awareness of the whole wh issue which is the point im making and new to what the english language i think i know a lot more about it than you do i also obviously know more about politics and this game than you do too you know this is the problem with you null secers all you do is whine complain and insult people in the face of a valid argument instead of actually coming up with an original opinion i know how hard that must be for you
you know maybe just maybe if you had come up with a valid argument that didnt include lots of sarcasm and lack of understanding of the issue then i might have considered giving some effort to coming up with a counterargument but as it stands now you really arent worth the effort thanks for trying come again
why am i not surprised
judging by the last lot of minutes i expect them to be released about septoct time dont forget they have to be written sanitised checked rechecked and approved before any information is doled out to the proletariat so dont hold your breath
dont forget after all that they need to be reapproved redrafted recensored   i mean resanitized rechecked and then repreapproved before they are approved for the reproapproval and propreapproval     and thats without delays p
last i heard they were in ccps hands awaiting some censoring and that was over a week or two ago
i understand its a long ass post split up up over 2 characters and 3 installments so you may not have read it in its entirety but this is not a post about losing a ship it is a post about why one player in what would seem to be eves core target demographic someone who is a midlate twenties male is highly computer savvy has lots of time to play is a hardcore science fiction fan thoroughly enjoys pvp even at a big disadvantage   has been left with such a bad taste in his mouth from the game that he hasnt panned out as a revenue source for ccp notice that its in the council of stellar management section and i brought up some rather concrete issues the worst ship loss i ever had was    too many to distinguish maybe one of my destroyers or tier 3 battleships in pve
and whos posted list of suggestions are basically asking for him to be given an enormous advantage over multiple foes superior ship foes basically everyone not to mention thoroughly entrenching older characters as superior to newbiesmight i suggest the real problem is he wants to be a hero in an mmo and that the main reason people arent heroes normally is because everyone else refuses to follow the script
older players will still have more cap more hp higher resistance to damages more isk theyll hit harder more often more accurately at longer range using more advanced better honed techniques and strategies etc where did i ask for an advantage and what advantage did i ask fori wanted to be a hero so i played a video game that advertised that i could if i played it is that illogical and everyone does not refuse to follow the script people who dont want others to be greater than themselves who would rather there be no heroes refuse to follow the script are you one of those people
you know who are the heroes that one newbie in the fleet who can barely fly a frigate but gets a point on an enemy capital ship so the rest of the fleet can kill it
what do you expect ccp is an icelandic company and you must have seen what their banks managed to do to the economy of iceland
yeah probably ill stick it over there as well
since ccp games sees fit to join the legion that are spammers i would like to propose an addition to the ingame mail options to opt in on unwanted npc spam mails
