now this is a ship i can get behind especially any time i move to a different section in space also helps to clear out a hanger for pirating xd1
you really should evemail all the csm with this thread   make sure they get it so its presented to ccp
you wouldnt need to target the attacker only the friendly you intend to protectfor an aegis destroyer to protect a friendly it must activate a specialized module on that friendly when an attacker fires the position of attacker defender and friendly along with the skills and characteristics of the module determine the percentage of damage reduced given the role of the ship it would be expected that this ship is primaried by smart fcs the expectation is that you have more than one and that they form very small defensive units protecting each other protecting logis and friendlies they are the first line of defense but they are expected to go down in a fight thats why they should be cheapthe range considerations need not be dictated by the capability of real world ciws some lore crafting could alleviate that requirement theres also the question of ammunition use itd probably be more useful to have a module that offers damage reduction for all incoming fire in which case ammunition would be impractical some manner of cap using force field magic on the other hand would likely work better i think i mentioned this in another post though i did have a fairly long post eaten by the forum so it may never have made it hereoverall effect of the module would have a maximum effectiveness percentage based on skills racial destroyer skill for role bonus  skill at using the defensive modules i also imagine that for each successful reduction each additional reduction gets smaller for example the first module reduces the damage 25 1000hp to 750hp the next module reduces the damage another 25 of whats left 750hp to 562hp and so on 422 316 237hp ideally skill and position determine which reduction applies first in the case where one pilot has 32 reductions and another has 25 etc it probably should have some tweaking for how it stacks or scales but i dont think it should be possible to make friendlies impervious to firei think i probably need some help squaring away the numbers and implementation details if it comes to that but thats really ccps job if they think the idea is worth implementingi dont think we players ought to dictate the math we should simply generate the idea and the request a new role for an inexpensive ship that yields richer tactics i think active defense makes sense and id also like to see destroyers take a part in fielding that new abilityplease support the idea if you like it the implementation will take care of itself or cause the idea to be vetoed by ccp devs which is also a valid result

it doesnt really answer my question but i appreciate the numbers id like to see some examples of total warp time starting from beginning align time to landing time it does seem reasonable that less mass would be able to accel faster in warp as it does any other time

while they look at this perhaps they can look at the freighter max warp speed the details on the freighter and jump freighter show max warp speed of 075aus but actual displayed max au on tq and sis is 070ausi know 05aus is not a lot of difference but for a freighter in an over 180au that time can add up

i think it is obvious that lowsec is highly under utilized and serves as merely a buffer between high and null sec i know cpp mentioned that they had some plans for lowsec i simply wish to put in my idea into the hatwhat if we made the empires islands instead of one big continuous space in essence a few lowsec jumps between each of the empires this would give people much more reason to enter lowsec it would allow for more non suicide pirates and create a better market for merc corps who could be hired out as escortsjust an idea

there is a next system show on your waypoints thingie in the ui you know the thing with the coloured squared in a rowjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
what im getting at if the way points over lap you may have 2 or 3 yellow jumpgates all im proposing is differnt colors depending on what way point 1 2 3 ect or some way to tell them apart and yes i know abought the uper left hand corner next system thing  im purly talking a overview change not the route box
i would say remaps arent used at all for the first 30 days of a charcters life that would be my vote and up till 10m sp you can renmap for a plex after that you should know what you are doing and plan acordingly to the standard remap timer

ok im going to flame you why cause this is not wow you want npc to deliver you goods like drop  into a mail box and waiting an hour like wow umm no whythis game evolves around players doing the work in the game this means either you go do it yourself or pay another player to go do it for youlogistics is a huge time consuming job in eve its not easy and a pain in the ass half the time pirates are always looking for a quick buck haulers are their targets doing it via npc takes reduces the risk in this game and would cause alot of people to loose their way of eve life so not only no but hell noif you are to lazy to go 8 damn jumps to pick up ammo then eve is not the place for you go play a fluffy easy game like wow or guild warsfly safe i hope someone in a battle badger finds you and pops you for suggesting this
or at least specific forums yes
this was proposed many years ago  interbus was going to be that role however ccp went with courier contracts which are god awefull waist of game manchanics and no one uses hardly for one they are expencive based on what is being moved or what the people value there atuff at  and 2 they affer little in the way of a reward  what i would like to see is a npc transport corp with actualy freiters or indys and security missions courier missions  where you have to eather run escort for the corp or haul assets for them which are actualy peoples assets  so say i went to a station and asked them to move 10km3 for x amount of isk the npc corp makes a mission to some one that requests a mission carry this package the item 10km3 to the destnation upon completion of said mission they get x percent of the isk costing to transport the item and a certan loyality point for the in question corp  the lp rewards should be pretaining to indys custon indys modded cargo expanders ect this would do 2 things 1 make it player driven with npc faciliting the prosses and 2 increse the reward and give players a reson to do this contracts lv1 missions should be under 100m3 cargo lv2 missions should be under 5000m3 cargo lv3 missions should be under 10000m3 cargo lv4 missions should be under 30000m3 cargo or ships requireing a carier or posabilty freiter missions if player has this shiplv5 all freiter missions please feel free to coment however i relise my gramer is not good so 
i believe that this would be a way to guarantee easy botable shipping missions for players if you can guarantee a cargo delivery being available from place a to place b you can have it always running with minimal risk and bot complexity lowsec shipping mission offer a decent amount of lp for really easy missions using bestowers or other high volume low cost ships there is a place in heimatar ingunn where you can find bot couriers being run at all times of the day though i havent been back there in two years a small group of people racked up over a hundred kills haulers pods and frigates in about a week now if you could automatically make those all level 3 or 4 you can make a very good isk to lp ration or standings grind for corpsyou make the isk back by doing missions that are not ones you create in hisec
kinda what i was getting at is replace courier contracts with actual agent missions
and how do you steal them
this is another issue that i think should be moved to the front on this idea for a trade expansion thanks
i agree and i see absolutely no way this can be exploited thats sarcasm this is a terrible ideaif i could change my avatars expression hed be expressing seething hatred right nowa lot of the people who play this game play it because they can be miscreants stealing is encouraged piracy is legitimate and larceny is the driving force behind pretty much everything we do stop trying to change that you make enough isk already
i endorse this product andor servicei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
as long as there are no faction drakes or canes this might work
yeah i purposefully left out the tier2 battle cruisers cause eve would explode if a faction drake was released plus im pretty sure all of the existing pirate bc models use the tier 1 bc when they use any at all

agreed how about aegis destroyers also see sig
there are plenty of countertactics to cloaked ships a standing fleet a small fleet of ships with swarms of dronesbut honestly if theyre not at the computer they are no threat to you stop being a little  if youre afraid of a permacloaked ship you should find some other game to spend your time onif you want to find a solution to a permacloaked ship jump up and down so your s will drop grab a fleet and go  their  upi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

can you expand a bit more on how this works
seriously i mean bother to read what everyone already has offered stop the evemail spam
i meant how does one go about finding a perma cloaky ship currently
if you dont have the people to be online to protect from cloakies then you dont have enough people to deal with a regular threatif you are being attaked by 20 people when you only have 15 a cloaky is pretty much irrelevant you simply dont have the manpower to hold that systemsov is held by the group with the power to hold itit seems to me you cant really justify a change to cloak mechanics as your argument doesnt seem to address that but more of a wider manpower issue
you really dont get it do youi suggest you consider the mouse trap and then apply it to eve mechanicstacticsif you cant figure out that much let alone refuse to read what people have said in many topicsyou have no business making proposals about this subject whatsoever stop the evemail spam
maybe you can detail how a cloaky ship provides an unique threat to a system maybe highlight how much more of a threat it is than say a regular roaming gang or non cloaked scout
oo i must have really struck a nerve i see a lot of defensive posturing but no answer to my question i see a bait and trap that maymaynot work but it doesnt force anyones hand ive read a lot of threads maybe youve seen my posts somewhere else i havent seen any answers other then i swear it works fine how does one find a perma cloaky im not making a judgement  here but i am asking since you have presented it as an option saying figure it out yourself is avoiding the questions why bother replying if you dont have an answer worth sharing
hmm its guerrilla warfare or terrorism depending on which side you are on roaming gangs are the forces that maraud from the hills and wear uniforms and afk or perma cloakys are the people that blend in with the civilians hiding weapons in the basements of houses you dont know when they are going to strike you dont know where but you know they are out there and want to i dont want to break the cloak mechanic i do want to break the system camping mechanic how im not sure i just disagree with people that say its fine you can beat it by doing  um  actually just figure it out for yourself
when a ship cloaks it should be removed from local problem solvedi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
its quite simple when cloaked the cloaker is removed from local and possibly has local removed from their ui to balanceyou get a more realistic active cloaked vessel because the other system users dont know he is thereyou completely remove the akf cloaker because the system residents are not aware that he is there and as he is afk he is no threat at allhowever as this would mean that the residents of the system would have to activly check for probes or be prepared for a cloaked attack similar to wh space i cant see them supporting this becaue its too much work for thembecause what these threads really boil down to is the null carebears want to rat and mine without any cloak threat at all the afk whine is just an excusejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move

so far the grades of security status mean nothing you either have 5 concord or 4 nothing additionally since 10  8 systems have the same security level as 75 this makes operations such as burn jita not only possible but predictable my solution is simple 1008 concord shows up faster and pods criminals0705 concord delay increases the closer you get to low sec04 03 concord will send token ships with mission rat stats these are kill able and escalations are limited to a number of waves equal to security status of the system a minor deterrent that is as easily dealt with as a standard belt rat however jamming and scrambling may allow the victim time to escape but a well organized gate camp would be able to easily keep these at bay basically make the variations in security status actually matter rather than concord no concordbefore people start bashing me for wanting concord in low sec the increased delaytime will make suicide ganking much easier in 05 boarder systems and any alpha ganking build will be able to pop a concord rat in low sec with minimal damage the purpose of lowsec concord is primarily electronic warfare rather than heavy fire supportadditionally an idea i had earlier would be to add crooked cops in lowsec that a corporation can pay off to disable concord spawns when their members engage in piracy
interesting posti am inclined to support the notion that concord response time should be marginally quicker when a high security status character is attacked and i am inclined to support a smooth change in response times in varying system security statuses rather than having it change suddenly between 87 54 etc i dont support the concord npcs in lowsec yet because i think it requires a great deal of debating its a big change and shouldnt be supported lightly ill keep an eye on this threadin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
1supported clean and well thought out system to make concord a police force not an uber dps monster that cant move one system over to 04 space
you have to remember that concord in lowsec will not be very dangerous in terms of dps the low sec concord will be mostly specced for jamming and ewar to break warp scrambles and other tackling modules the thing is that lowsec is less safe than null sec and it is supposed to be the other way around if you make it past the gate camps in lowsec and actually make it to nul sec your basically home free unless you happen to hit an active system and one of the reasons null sec is safer than low sec is because you can actually ue preemptive tactics without fear of sec loss speaking if preemptive tactis lets also add jamming rights if you lock a players ship that player has 5 minuts in which they can jam you with no penalty the only reason suicide ganking in high sec works is because the players targeted cant take preemptive measures without being penalized by the very system designed to protect themto be honest nerfing concord overall in hignsec would improve security allowing more vigilante action and hunting of the outlawed playersit has gotten to the point where in some of my previous corporations mining operations we hired pirates in cloaked destroyers to hid in the belt and if any player targeted a barge for any reason the miner called on vent and one of the destroyers would gank the ship regardless of whether or not the intent was malicious

i agree popup adverts are the worst type of advertising out there but i dont think that is possible in space they would be billboards or on the screen in your captains quarters so if you dont want to see ads turn off captains quarters andor piv your camra angle so you dont see it so other thoughts of how to advertise in game besides billboards logos on ships and captains quarters big screen
well i had considered a mod that created a floating hologram above your ship the hologram could just show the alliance logo holograms in the same way that the territorial claims unit does hopefully soon we will have walking in stations corporate office quarters ive seen the signs and so other corps or players could pay to have posters up in other corporations officesps i am updating the original post to include some current pros and cons thanks everyone for your input keep it coming

yeah i understand what you mean its a good idea its been proposed before and the new waypoint ui comes close to helping but changing the colours or even only highlighting the next jump gate on your overview in yellow would avoid come confusion when travelingjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move

its the opposite hisec carebears are the ones who are quite safe from dying they might be the worst pvpers but if they stay away from smartbombingworthy targets they are very very safei am pretty bad pvper but even the best in our alliance know that there are daily risks of losing your pod at 00being good pvper does not make you invulnerable to getting alphaed and stuck in a bubbletherefore learning implants actually reward carebears
attribute implants buffing learning speeds are ok there is no problem with thatpros they reward the player who wants to progress faster the player who makes an investment to achieve a target quicker through deciding to play the game longer than expected lp system is a moneysink its where isk leaves the economy and this not arguable  it is goodconsthey can be a tad bit excessive in their buffs theres so much sandbox  in eve that its kind of redonkulous to have another layer of buffers being implants and boosters boosters are especially fing excessive too much is going on  reduce the madnessafter all if this is not resolved how can ccp truly balance ships as they sayproposal change attribute implants to be attributeonly change attribute implants named sets to give an additional boost in specific attributes instead of buffs like increased damage etc remove hardwiring implants but keep boosters and change them as contraband for upcoming smuggler professionals new immortalgrade clones implant ideal for null sec pvpers and militiasublegal illegal in concord  empire zones unless militiadenies use of attribute implantswhat would all these bring controlled devastation of loss losing few boosters isnt as bad as losing hardwires conservation of finances individual boosters cost less than hardwiring increase value of boosters no hardwiring implants  illegal in secure space increase production of boosters demand increase tactical advantage of boosters no hardwiring implants boosters encourage null sec and low sec economy contraband dawn of the smuggler profession which is coming highsec contraband for  balanced gameplay yet still effected by wealth  economy less stat madness
the lp store is pretty much dead already due to lots of lp from incursions and the agent quality changes the implants are a very large part of what is left of it if you take out that substantial amount of the store without replacing it then the few items left will be swampted and the lp stores will almost certainly be worthlessthat is a big impact on the game now why not allow pods to warp out of bubbles and then you dont have this problem anymore i mean shooting bubbled pods is not really that challenging is it you want to destroy a major part of the game the lp store that requires thought and research so you can continue to shoot fish in a barrel that is about as clear an example of dumbing the game down that i can find make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i use courier contracts all the time because im really lazy but they dont stay up on the market for very long something about them getting picked up and done in about a day or so which probably has to do with the fact that i pay rather generously about 5 to 10 of the collateral keep the amounts small enough sub30k m3 amounts for normal industrial ship capacity and keep the collateral below 100million so poorer players which are quite numerous can pick up the contractsnow if i have a big job i ask corpies when their next freighter run is or i ask an organization like red frog freight to do it for me and their rates are reasonable mostly

this is interestingmany of us remember the ship as a here you go kids giveaway and the circumstances around it and therefor obviously dismiss it as a ship of any use we pretty much ignore it its taintedhowever most new players do not know this history and it is on the marketi was just cleaning out my hangar the other day and decided to keep it packaged and out of the way and remarked my self how useless it was in relation to its purposethere is nothing it can do that a well fitted industrial or transport blockade runner cannot do 20 times bettereven as a hisec ship why would you have two ships when one can to the same thing and a whole lot morefix the primaeorremove itright now it is just a stale reminder of some serious ship designrole issues
you could say the same about every single one of the free gift ships weve been given

i think i left out the concord clause in number 5 it is on the notebook paper i designed these on either you left it out or i forgot it this is more to prevent ceo from robbing themselves for shareholder money number 7 is to take place of concord in null security space that was supposed to be mention in number 5 i am trying to boost the idea of public corporations not prevent actual theft this will prevent all loop holes in the corporation value calculator concord is the police and corporation should be allowed to enforce it policies a lot more firmly to its members in its own spacei will add in the concord clause thanks for pointing out my typo
here is the corrected 55 if a ship is stolen out of the corporate fleet specified earlier as in leaving the corporation with it in you hanger insurance should pay the payout to the corporation a stolen ship is no different as a destroyed ship a stolen ships should go through some process of being shot by concord and deemed not able to be sold in high security space or in systems that are owned by that corporation and its alliance concord should have an arrival delay to give some chance of making it to low security space or out of the original owners sovereignty just not enough to use it for what is is meant to be used for like mining and combat that is what low security space is for outlaws alliance should have the option to respect each other stolen shipsthis will make stealing more challenging and fun not impossible my bad how can it be more if it never was it will make it actually fun for once stolen items are supposed to have a lot of heat on it making it harder during the get away lmao
so i join a corp contract a dread to the corp they put it in the hangar i take it out and drop the corp and the corp gets an insurance payout then i rejoin give the dread back and do it all againthe idea is  you cant have insurance payouts unless you have a wreck

hey i have an excellent idea of permasolving the afkcloakers problem after a set period of time the cloaked person disappears from local
he i have a better idea  we still have the obsolete deep space probes  reform them to ghost hunting probes tha locks on the invisable shield of a cloacked ship  i miss the 600 au safespots  wel the trill to find them and blow the ships or highjack the ships that where undetectable  mm trow a special ship in the mix just crammed up with electronic warefare and ill be happy to go into my 9 year of eveplay offcourse still waiting on the roid filled systems and comet mining thet ccp prommised years ago
great then you can throw out a single probe and see how many cloaky ships are in the system its like dscan but with cloak detection
yeah give them more power
the problem with reading things like this on the internet is that you cannot set them on fire

gimme mah names backi like to look at whos body i have sitting in my freezer
god damnit i typically only collected the corpses of poeple i personally killed and now youre removing the personal connection between that corpse and myself thats just not right
i am guessing each corpse would need to be a unique item and there would be one item generated per toon for each player this results in a massive amount of database clutter still collecting corpses is fun so i would say sacrificing some performance to bring back a well loved game mechanic would be worth it
good points i feel that by just allowing people to choose either antipirate or antifaction missions or the current mix of the two as at present it will greatly increase the tag availability and thereby make using the lp a more pleasant occurance i also might not totally object if ccp raised the tag requirements of the stores slightly to compensate for the slightly increased supply as right now my main gripe with the system is that simply too few antifaction missions are on offer and they are also generally slanted against the wrong enemy of the faction
actually i support the ops original idea about selecting between political and law enforcement missions i am actually shot on sight by gallente navy through no fault of my own with the stiff standing penalties from declining agent missions i have had to suffer some unwanted standings loss due to those goddamn political missions personally i dont see why i am getting standing loss for missions like that after all the hostile forces are in your space violating your factions laws so if any standing would go down it would be the diplomatic relations between the two sides not the pilot who blew up some navy rats in the grand scheme of things noone ever blames the soldiers for a international incident in a perfect world only militia activity and random acts of violence would trigger criminal status but this is eve so i will settle for having a choice between political and law enforcement missions
this idea comes up sometimes and at one time it was like that but consider the current regional population balance consider the habits of the highsec carebear why do you think that they play the way they do if you rip away that play do you think theyll adapt by playing a lowsec game or adapt by taking away 50 of the income of ccp to go play the newest wowcloneremember a 9 drop in subscriptions last summer forced a 20 layoff of staff including some very bright minds that could have helped develop eve over the last year but through faction warfare ccp is trying to inject more life into lowsec but does someone whose primary enjoyment is lowsec pvp really want fw datacores
for the reasons so elequantly stated by the above chap i do not support this ideain the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

how about thiswhenever you declare a war you have to put up some sort of pos module in empire space as long as this pos module is up the war is on but as soon as it explodes or gets taken down the war is oversmall corps can still wardeck massive alliances but theyd be one pos bash away from losing the wari honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
this would make each and every war a war of attrition understanding that fighting a mobile force that melts into the surrounding area is frustrating its a strategy thats as old as the hills both in eve and in real life and is basically the only way for a smaller force to bring pressure on a bigger forcedo you really want even highsec to become strictly blob warfarebelligerent undesirables selling griefer immunity
the one factor i cant budge on when it comes to these arguments is the fact isk is easily earned and gatheredand yet i see all the major grefing corps throwing a fit over costhell the last mercs i spoke to for grins and giggles where chargeing a bill a pop for what i was curious aboutcourse that was way back in the day but even thenhow is this such a big problemnow keep in mind im all in favor of your viewpoints and stances floppieso im not saying this is outragously stupid like hte other half dozen idiot ideas i see every bloody dayso this is a sincere inquryis it really that bad stop the evemail spam
its not about the cost at all the distribution of the cost is part of a larger problem which leads to an environment where small noobish corps are brutally punished for not being in the know while the big alliances are virtually invulnerableim all for raising the cost of a wardec it should be substantial enough that griefers arent content to spend x to sit at a station for a week waiting until their wartarget finally undocks in a t1 cruiser 50100 million would be a good starting point
oklets say for the moment im a dense brickgive me an example of distrubution of costbreak it downbecause everyone else is implying what it is when they dont just state it stop the evemail spam
i think the current figures being tossed around is 50m base plus 500k per member so it costs 60m to wardec a 20member corp 300m to wardec a 500member corp and 5 billion to wardec a 10000member allianceconversely that 10000member alliance can wardec the 20member corp for60 million iskdo you see where the disparity is the proposed system completely favors large organizations while making smaller ones even more vulnerable than they are today nearly all of the increased cost of wardecs is going into protecting alliances at the expense of small corps thats what i mean by the distribution of wardec costs
ok i get thatand i have no real problems with the logic behind your statementbut economicaly speakingits too easy to make a quick billion these daysthats where im coming from most wardecs are station games and only last a week or so as it is stop the evemail spam
i agree that cash is very available though i cant say that i consider a billion to be easy money there are some people out there who could permadec goonswarm forever and there are some for whom a billion isk still seems like an outrageous sum of moneyand yes wardecs do devolve into station game stupidity all too often id love to see that fixed
i think youre not looking at both sides of the coinimagine a flat 100m fee for a wardec then you could use that money to wardec a noobish 10 man corp and get ten targets for that one fee or you could wardec a 1000 man corp and get 1000 targets for that fee imo all targetted players are equally inconvenienced by the wardec so if youre a griefer you get to grief more people for less money when it is cheaper to declare war on large alliances you might claim that larger alliances can rally more people and hence defend themselves easier but thats only true when defending a pos structure or big op
so you are saying that the are considering a linear cost formula along the line of wardec cost  50m  05m  members why not something more nonlinear with decreasing additional cost per next member lets say eg to pick a more or less random number wardec cost  50m  05m  members squared 09that would give about 55m for 20 members 195m for 500 members 2040m for 10000 members so the increase isnt that steep of course you can play around with the number unsure about the english term for such a root expression  the lower the less impact an additional member has and with one being the linear case of gizznitts exampleedit something like this even makes sense from an economic utility perspective if i go from five targets i can shot at to six i get way more fun out of this one mr6 guy as if i can already shot half the galaxy and in that case am presented with one more targetedit times 2 thinking about it for a bit im of the opinion that their should be another part in the formula that adjusts the costs also based on the number of members in the corporation declaring the war the more members you got that more costly it should be it just sounds wrong if 20 guys wanting to declare war on a company of eg another 20 guys should have to pay the same as 2000 guys for the twenty guys its maybe a though decision with regard to their resources for the 2000 guys its  to quote some bankers facing billions in losses  peanuts so you would have something likewardec cost  fixed amount  a  members aggressor squared something smaller 1  b  members defendent squared something smaller 1
thats just a long winded way of saying that youll dock up whenever more than one hostile comes into localor that youll get a 1 man alt corp to wardeck random incursion runners who wont get reps in fleet because the logi is skittish about getting aggression to whoever wardecked themyou wanna go around in a 1 man cop wardecking as many people as you can then fine but there has to be a win  lose state for both sides of a warevery wardeck now is basically a battle of attrition can the defenders stay out of highsec longer than the attackers can keep paying the billsi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
that would be one of the things that keeps me on the fenceright now pretty much anyone no matter how big or how small can war dec anyonethe change now requires you to be serious about itand not  aroundwhich most war decs are just stupid ing around for lols stop the evemail spam
is there an already open version of this 
bump
minmatar ships are put together with ducktape their designs are supposed to look primitive personally i like the aged distressed look
why not make it limited regional logistics items can be delivered by npc curriors for a fee fee is based on volume and jumps you would need a skill to use this service limit of 5 jumps away from place of purchase one jump added per skill level from 1  5 for example everyone knows if you are anywhere even remotely near a market hub the bordering systems have no economy and no stock you could make the service prohibitively expensive so that players will really only use it in emergencies like for example see fedex and upss overnight rates 
there is really no reason that plexes should cost more than the normal 1495 a month if anything the plex should be a bit less expensive to encourage its use
why not just use a more reasonable limit like 5k
that doesnt make any sense at all the people that would need it would be using the same amount skill or not the people that wouldnt need it wouldnt use the extra space skill or not theyre not declaring the station containers as an array of size 1000 its a dynamically expanding database with an upper limit
as some of you may know ccp decided to remove noncorp fleet members ability to access the corp hangar to drop ore into this will extremely negatively impact mining much more so than hulkageddon ever could goons can blow ships up but they cant change game code therefore i propose an addition of a 50k m3 divided fleet hanger similar to the corp hangar only accessible while in an actual fleet this would satisfy both ccps desire to make corp stuff corp stuff and the desire for players to allow noncorp members to use their holds
nothat would add 50m3 to its total cargo capacity i agree that not having access to the corp hangar whilst in fleet is an added hassle but the orca doesnt need a buffyou could give everyone access to the ore hangar and let fleet members put things into there that wouldnt be a buff but it would mean fleet members could add into the orca again despite this fixing both problems i have some kind of intuitive dislike of that ideaalternatively just use a tractor beam and pull fleet members cans to you and tell the orca pilot not to be so damn lazy and go afk lessin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
the problem with this is that it leaves the mining operation open to any canflipper who wanders into the area and reduces one ganglink from the ship that could boost the op and it keeps the mining ships close to the orca for fun times with smartbombs when you can dump the ore straight into the bay
just add a white list option where the orca pilot can select a player and add them to the allowed list wether or not they are in the corp or even in the fleet
i think i may buy the remaining existing primaes to get them the hell off the market permanently they will have a use  minerals for my battleship collection
get a crane p
notice the 5 the ship would be deemed unable to be sold i hope that would include reentering back it into the corporate fleet
this does give me an idea the theft should be able to pay the insurance to concord back and get the ability to sell it back to the corporation and not anyone else but that corporation this would allow the theft to hold it for ransom to that corporation
orthey could fix the broken ships already in the game before adding new ones to the thoughtless jumble heap of a ship roster we have

yes please names on corpses are very important to my corpse collection this change really sucks and i want it reversed if that was the reason why didnt they remove names on ships cans and all the other random crap that can have a name this was an intentional nerf to murder and i do not approvepersonally i pose them around a table and have tea parties i also sometimes like to cuddle with them in my pod it gets very lonely in space and i need something to hug

added previous suggestion to my proposal stop the evemail spam
cspa working as intended it can be set up to a million isk and after a while the attritition of spending a million isk to spam several hundred or several thousand people eats away at someones wallet for every hundred thats a hundred million for every thousand thats a billiondo the simple mathematics and the setup of a complete cspa overhaul would be an overwhelming pain in the  that would take time away from fis and wis contentfurthermore them spamming to push their product is an isk sink albeit a small one it is still an isk sinki am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
yesand as i was pointing outmake the isk go to your wallet since your the one putting up with the  altogether instead of some magic black hole stop the evemail spam
that would defeat the purpose of it being an isk sinki am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
while i agree with most of your points what you think would happen would cause a lot of the nullsec corpsalliances to become rather upset and rail on unfair tactics and gameplaywardec changes have been wanted for awhile and now that they are coming out a general sstorm is taking place isnt this what people wanted
not anyone i know almost everyone sees something wrong with the proposed changes this thread was dedicated to a discussion of what would constitute good changes id suggest looking through that and browsing cp wt and gd forums for more current discussions to get an idea of what people want
i agree with the op that the wardec price change just encourages people to wardec small corps and makes huge ones almost immune its ridiculousi certainly didnt want most of the changes all i wanted was for people not to be able to get rid of wardecs whenever they want
helloi would like to propose a mwd sig radius penalty reduction to electronic attack ships similar to the one given to assult ships recently i feel it would help the durability of electronic attack ships but not make them overpowered and hopfully make them more usable which is always a good thing im sorry if i am repeating anybodythank you for your time 
okay okay i know rehashing old story but the nex lacks items that people actually want i think a list of  that people want would actually be a good thing for ccp to see suggestions ive seen hats corp logos on ships custom color schemes on ships dogtags for military characters either by school or fw dress uniforms by faction medal plaques for cq decorum for cqand while were at it why not run a contest or two to have players create items that could be sold at the nex sure theyre vanity items but there are people that will still pay for them by either buying plex from ccp or buying plex in game to purchase them think of the potential isk sink not to mention then more items would be made available on the market to help stabilize the economy just a bit morei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

where is the profit margin for resellers if plex cost less than monthly subscriptionwhy shouldnt you pay more for plex since they give you the benefit of being able to trade 30 days for someone elses iskso right off the bat the are two reasons why plex should cost more than a monthly subscription
not supportingbecause plex can be exchagned for hard isk currency that is a variable ammountif it was only for just subscription timeit would be a good thingbut not with the market as it isso thats an absolute no stop the evemailUFFFDspam
just reiterating on what the previous 2 saidthe purpiose of the plex is that ti can be used for more then just agme time it can eb sold for isk or converted to aurum if your into thatalso for epople who need that extra bit fo isk it costs them more in a sense punishing them for being impatientso no plex needs to stay at 20
btw the limitation is limited as if i get lets say 10 giant secure container with in each 1000 items and i repackage all them i will get 10000 items in hangari have already some station to which i dont have access with more than 2000 items because i cant remote stack items which bring me to another little suggested featrure since long
introgiven that the current csm is reviewing the white paper that governs its functions now is an excellent moment to review the csm election processone major idea is that each vote receives a fair share of representation 44296 votes were cast in candidates that were elected in the last election and 14813 in candidates that were notthe later did not receive their fair share and even if this doesnt mean that they are not represented now they still account for more than the first and second place together if some or all these votes were not wasted then the election result could have been somewhat different maybe not so much of whom was elected but who would be the top seventwo improvements regarding this were mentioned in the last decembers meeting minutes namely the nomination process and implementing the stv system but id like to propose an alternative that is simpler accomplishes roughtly the same result and is significantly better on a few aspectstwo turns for csm electionthe idea is to split the election process in two turns the first one is to prune the candidate list thus replacing the nomination phase and to gauge the support of each candidate the second is to allow the voters to make an informed decision of whom can best represent them that still have a good chance of being elected thus reducing the percentage of wasted votesthe whole process would go like this candidacy application period opens publication of the list of approved candidates first turn begins list of candidates who made to the second turn is published along with the full results second turn begins results are announced the elected members take office the top n candidates are selected for the next turn on step 3 since there are 14 seats in total i recomment n  25 but any number between 21 and 28 chosen a priori could do the trickedit as stated below some people would feel more comfortable if there is an abstain option in each turnwhat i dont like about the changes proposed on decembers minutes there is no commitment in the likebased nomination two candidates received more likes than votes 112 and 59 more likes than votes and it is very likely that many players didnt vote for the candidate they supported or in fact gave likes for more than one people that want to make an utilitarian vote have no accurate way of knowing which candidate can represent them well that still have a reasonable chance of being elected again the likebased system doesnt accomplish this very well the 2nd most liked candidate ended up being the 11th most voted one while the 24th most liked managed to climb to the 14th place the stv implicitly assumes that each voter has perfect information about every candidade this could not be further from the truth in an environment where 83 of the people dont even vote even among the ones that do vote it is unlikely that most know well more than a handful of the candidates the stv makes the action of casting the vote a lot more complicated it is up to each voter to decide how much time to spend learning about the candidates be it 30 seconds or 30 days once one is chosen however casting the vote should be the most simple action possible as to not be a factor influencing the result for someone that spends 30 days choosing a candidade spending 5 minutes to cast a vote may be only a small annoyance for someone that spends 30 seconds 5 minutes to cast a vote is unacceptable and may aswell turn some voters off and yes these too are valid votes optional extension make the second turn optionalthe main drawback of splitting the election in two turns is of course that people need to vote twice although thats not much worse than having to nominate your candidate and then vote too laterone way to deal with this is to make the second turn optional for all the players that voted for any candidate selected for the second turn in this case if any of these players decide to vote again then it is the final vote that counts otherwise the vote from the first turn just carries overoptional extension each candidate chooses a number of substitutesthis is more geared to the second turn and is sort of a reverse stv it is each candidate and not each voter that chooses a number of substitutes to whom hisher votes will pass on in case of not being electedthe direct advantages are even less wasted votes more visibility of each candidate aligment since they will need to announce who they believe are other likeminded candidates since they are immersed in the process they are in a better position to evaluate who else to choose in its most simple form each candidate needs to choose exactly one othe candidate due to pigdeonhole principle each of them needs to choose n14 substitutes to garantee that not a single vote is wasted an intermediate solution for instance allowing each of them to choose three to five substitutes has an extra benefit of providing support without enforcing it for players to form political parties if so they wishsand over awesome
why
the main reason is to reduce the percentage of wasted votesthe other reason is to eliminate the likebased nomination phase or more accurately to promote it to a firstpass electionsand over awesome
and why do you want to do thatwhy should internet spaceship elections be more democratic than rl ones
im not sure the two turn thing i likeif a voters candidate didnt make the list there is the i didnt vote for them so if things go to hell in a hand basket its not my faulti like my write in votes when voting and dont want to think i have to vote for someone i dont necessarily want to vote for
you make it sound too good im not certain about the rl comparison because in most cases only one candidate is elected whilst here we elect 14 people for every termat any rate this is the direction that ccp already stated that they want to take with the councili posted this thread because i think there are easier ways to accomplish the same thingi didnt understand the first part can you clarify it or provide a link with more information about not being forced to vote for someone you dont like i dont see a problem with an abstain option in both turnssand over awesome
your idea actually makes sense and would work far better than anything we have right now for this reason alonemost people will not like it i however like it

i agree the war dec system has been abused far too much in recent yearstoo many corps and alliance easily able to doge them by joining or leaving an alliance or character avoiding them by joining or leaving a corpeve university being a primary example for some others being the 1 man corp who war decs a bunch of guys from the same corp mining in a belt and wont let the guy salvage so he sits nearby and waits till he sees them all log on and positions his guys in the system on an off grid from the belt and has them all apply to his corp and accepts them all and they warp in and kill the guysusage of the system in this manner is what needs to be stoppedi have many ideas on how this type of thing can be stopped but it is not the main issue atmthe main issue is how ccp is going to lose alot of money in this change ccp has always been a bottom line kind of business when it comes to eveccp ask yourself these very important questionswhen a new player joins eve and finally decides to join a corporation is he going to still be able to join a small group of friends to play the game he wants to playor is he going to have to spend a whole lot of money on gtcs to hire mercs who are probably working in conjunction with the griefers to extort the money who may even betray his corpor is he and his friends corp going to have to goto 00 space and join an alliance that will grind him and his friends until they no longer have a use for himhow long do you think it will be before this fresh new player finds out he cannot play the kind of game he wants to play and stops paying for his subnow onto the meat and potatoes of this proposed changeit has already been said multiple times that this new system favors the strong and ignores the weakthe community of eve is not really paying close attention to this war dec system proposal because if they were i would be replying on the 300th page or so of this thread alreadyso people stand up and take notice of what ccp proposesto allow the largest entities in this game to freely move about with no fear or risk in empire and ruin yousome say the the great mutton head engineered this while he was in the csmto be able to freely move the necc war goods and his cartels tech to and from empire with no riskthe largest entities in this game will also take the markets away from youhow simple really when a large alliance is able to move massive amounts of goods they chose into a system such as jita you will not be able to undercut them from the sheer volume they will be able to drop on the marketsso when you see the train of freighters coming into jita from goon razor and other tech farmers you wont be able to war dec them because it will cost you and your handful of guys 4 bil to war dec them to keep them from harming your bottom linefor people to sit here and reply to this thread with the idea that it should cost them more because we offer them more targets is absolutely idiotic a war dec regardless of cost means nothing to them but what means everything to them is they are part of such a large alliance that the avg corp cant harm them in empire and they can move freely without any dangeri am a nullsec player and i will say this to the empire dwellers dont let this change happen because if you do you will regret it more than any change ccp has ever madelarge alliances have already shown they can control jita by force what happens when they can do it legallyif i were a major nullsec alliance leader i would war dec the largest industrial empire people and put a 20 man camp on the undock of jita 44 and crush your bottom line and make the rest of eve buy my product instead o

to be fair no one makes you buy next stuff with cash you can buy plex ingame and use it for arum or buy it off the market after the initial price goes down for straight isk that being said i would prefer a significant drop in arum price for next store items they still havent gotten to a level of quality that the price would imply lrp wise in comparison to the rest of the clothes already available in the character creator in game there are a good number of items that are listed but not available theyve been there for a while id like for them to be released at reasonable prices but yes there are a good many items that would still need to be designed and released ccps track record implies dont hold your breath several years is a long time not to breathe

plex ingame should cost more in isk according to supply and demand in marketi have not paid cash for anyone of my accounts in over 3 yearsrl has inflation and so does this game so deal with itbesides the only type of people who compare the price of plex to rl money are usally buying their isk illegally and then complain because they are not getting their monies worth
i agree all payment methods should cost the same
1ccp you should also allow us to have more than 100 fittings in our fitting managerthis info could be saved client side as it was before with no additional strain on the servercan not understand why you moved it server side when it just takes up more r
why cant items be stored in both ccps memory and on the local hard driveonly actually position changes use the ccp databasethe client computer sends a request to move item xxx to yyyif that item doesnt exist nothing happens besides perhaps a gm being notified of suspicious activity
ok i remember reading about ccp was planning some thing in eve some kind of side storeys or evens what ever about the hidden races in eve the jovens and the talocans but that was about 2 years ago i was hoping if ccp is done with t3 showing no sine of new ships eg battle cruisers freights would it not be a good if at some point for ccp to start introducing these to hidden races slowly in to game buy that i mean as part of the 9th year celebration with a on going project for the next 5 years plus tank you for reading and fly safe
why why would eve need new races what benefit would it add to the game
i propose they be a race of tall green amazonian women with three breasts
why what would be the point the only thing i want is an apotheosis because i missed that anniversary handout and it looks cool
heck the 4 current races have no real differences in game playso why add more

mission rewardlow quality minerals to high risk  high rewards that design has been totally undermined by new ships modules and rigs over the years the gap between rich vet and poor new player is a problem issuesplayers like myself who were going to buy plex have chosen not to due directly to hulkageddon i was going to buy plex to get an orca more plex to have a hulkready toon moved to a new account but now its a bad risk i know others who were going to buy plex to pay for bpos but they cant mine the minerals now to use the bpos so no plex needed ccp has apparently directly responded to hulkageddon by offering minign crystal packages to miners and cruisers to players which ships are now horribly inflated in price when the mission payouts for new players are not adjusted can a miner through hard work and industry make thier on mining ship no they cannot the moon goo debacle is making some corpsallainces super rich and has destroyed the basic concept of eve that you can get there if you work hard enough t2 moon goo market has in effect failed which ccp has now tacitly acknowledged by adding t3 ships which take different things to make proposalsa double the hold space on all exhumers it is a joke that some combat ships have more hold space than ore shipsb fix insurance payouts on exhumers a 10 million cost policy should not pay 30 million when the replacement ship is 300 million moon minerals are minerals too c fix the dpsdefence impalance destoyers were added then repeatedly upgraded with mods and later rigs and faction ammo etc etc etc 4 destroyers will always kill a solo hulk in any level of security even though they can be made for less cost than the hulks mining turrets and crystals d fix social guiild wargriefing add a new type of corp a craft guild that cannot initiate wars be war decced or own any pos  soverignty structures it shouldbe able to be upgreaded to a full corp for a cost based on a multiplier of its number of members social gameplay increases player retention what we have at the moment are billionaire alts in new player corps who fly ships so large they are effectively immune to griefing and greifers making people taking the step from solo to team player simply quit the game e introduce moon mining to 07 and lower planets with minivariant pos not as big not as efficient not exclusive per moon but with concord protection supply and demand has effectively failed many players there is no way for social  casual players to copy  do me research  refine  mine moon goos yet the t1 ships are now effectively obsolete for the game content mining incursions missions are all geared to the higher level shipsmodulesf introduce advanced drones for miners in particular a dampner drone that when depolyed hides the site and ship from a system scan even if it is tagged this clever device uses concord towers to achieve its aim so simply wont work where concord are not as common eg 08  10 systems onlyg consequences dust 514 marines should be given an instation environment and when a player is scammed they should be able to report the scammer to the proper authorities ie a gm as concords rep the scammer should get a security hit be allowed to have a bounty placed on them and then dust marines should be allowed to go into stations and hunt them down and kill them or not if the scammer has hired mercs to defend  would i hire marines to go kill certain people sure i would they deserve it mainly for costing ccp real income due to customer lossh consequences 2 an alt should also be allowed to be killed if dust marines go in after their scammerwanted toon if you are running a billion isk a day sacmmer every toon on your account should be a target if you get dusted dont like it pay for anohter account at least ccp will get more revenue for funding the gms who clean up the mess from scammersi clarity a player locking someone in highsec should not on the overview appear the same as an npc but a huge player word over their ship icon inside the yellow blinkyj podding wanted players in highsec should immediately pay out the reward such a player should have wanted over thier pod icon why because they currently fly their pods in have an alt drop off destroyers gank hulks then have a blue alt simply bank all the goodies in short concord is nice but a joke engagement times have reduced so much with the new ships that concord intervention times are not an effective protection for new players but have become simply another way by which greifers can prey on new players to the detriment of the game
oh and for those who didnt guess when i say new ship i reveal my age destoyers are new fangled ships to me and before the curious ask no i was not the miner who got tricked
i agree i agree that this is a problem ccps new wardec changes are about to shake things up a bit might make things interesting but its not going to make life any easier for cassualnew players your fix idea is terrible thoughi agree on the general theme of the proposal new players are picked on much too easily but most of your fix ideas are terrible and you really need to know more about how eve works before you start proposing changes like these hopefully the new crime watch system ccp has proposed will sort alot of those problems outin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
is the tldr of thisplease turn eve into hello kitty online because im scaredor is that just what it seems likein short no
its not griefers vs ccp its griefers vs people who dont like to acknowledge that there are other people in the game the miners should learn that eve isnt a safe and cuddly place and watch out for griefers sitting there in a crowd of expensive and untanked ships is just asking for it and i say that as someone who spent the first part of my career mining a that doesnt even make any senseb you clearly dont understand how the insurance mechanic works or why its that wayc you cant fix the stupid miners refusing to tank their hulks or pay attention to the space around them which is the real issue its not hard to put 2 and 2 together if you see a couple negative sec thrashers show up in the beltd way too exploitable either form a chat channel to hang out and have your social experience in or man up and get a corp with associated benefitsdangerse t1 ships are still pretty amazing when used right and look at the fanfest vids and such theyre working on balancing moon mats alreadyf no safety in game where nothing is safe for you its way too exploitable and totally against all of what eve isg lol scamming is completely in keeping with the games rules and is in fact encouraged if anything if it looks to good to be true and you click it anyways its your fault for not reading the fine printh alts are completely disassociated with mains so youd never know who they are anywaysi you can already see that its a player you just have to open your eyesj you can already see who has a bounty or not just learn to set up your overviewand if youre going to continue to whine about not being safe in eve a game where safety is something you fight for not something thats given to you then maybe eve isnt the game for you the door is that way we wont hate you if you leave
 you clearly dont actually know how people have been killing hulks by the time a thrasher appears in your belt you are already dead even with a t2 defensive fit ecm drones out and aligned to station stop blaming miners for poor game balance as if it was the miners fault ccp upped small ship dps massively but didnt improve mining ship defencessafety is something you fight for  no saftey comes from having 6 accounts years of training to fly ships that are effectively invulnerable in high sec and the billions of isk to never pay a real  for itcase in point burn jita event plenty of little transports went down a nyx comes out  does it go down case in point orca can it mine solo no its a ship for mulitiboxer players basically case in point leadership warfare mods where is the ship with these typically parked inside a pos bubble with an alt in itthe door is that way attitude is crap this game has double the numbers it had 5 years ago but guess what it has nothing next to most games will eve be here in another 5 years i certainly hope so will it have its playerbase still well thats much harder to judge given the greifing and already a threat to try and have me banned ingame for speaking up i am really not so sure make no mistake  ccp has been pushing really hard to get more players if the community is dead set on burning the new players out of the game then guess what  it really will be ccp vs players and they have a reset button would they reset sisi no but would they make a new server where all the new players go and many medium age players shift to now that is not so unlikely  which would be a defacto reset bottom line  think about what is happening in the game and what it does to players comming back  joinign the game ccp does and as things stand my view is ccp is going to need to hard code in changes to better protect new players and the turorials still suck sorry not as much as they used to but  yeah they really need work still
they have craft guilds set blue join private channel while the tax is 10 you cant be decced or get decced and you are still able to chunk a pos upalso use dem killrights dont warn the griefer or threaten to pod them with your rights just go and blow their  up the only thing needed is pod kill rights if the griefer pods the victim
quit trying to remove all risk from eve onlineit is high security space not absolute security spacehulks are industrial ships and thus not designed to hold up to ships that are designed for combat operations everything working as intendedi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i can sympathise with the view that the hulk is too weak and too easy to gank but the reason why there is so much contempt for miners is for the kind of suggestions that the op makes most people suggest that what is needed is a base tank that has higher resists or a higher shield buffer but this still wouldnt mean that it was suicidegank proof and therefore still keeps to the you are at risk everywhere theme of eve what you are suggesting isim losing please remove riskweve heard this before  gtfo
op  understand your frustration but there is no way the csm or ccp will even begin to entertain all you proposei do believe the real issue is that low and null sec is so broke and stagnant that hisec griefing is about the most fun they can havefix some of the major issues with low and null including those preventing nullwars and i think a lot will smooth outoh i do agree about the insurance payouts for t2 ships  that one is universal for all players
local chats current intel function diminishes strategic gameplay stealth and scouting this proposal aims to fix that while still giving tools to sov holders and those in npc null who make the effort to align with npcs it also encourages the use of smaller ship classes bellow that of bcs for use as raiders and scouts by giving them a greater potential to move about unnoticedlocal chat intel changesnew delayed mode automatically applies to high and low secplayers will now appear in local after a set time of entering the system based on ship classfrigates shuttles pods 5 minutes delaydestroyers 3 minutes delaycruisers transports mining barges 1 minute 30 secondsbattlecruisers industrials exhumers 30 secondsbattleships 15 secondscapital ships or player docked in a station instant cloaks will end the timer and cannot be picked up by local intel if not already registered or unless the player broadcasts in the chat once registered on a systems local intel only logging out or leaving the system will remove you cloaking after this time will not remove you from localnote none of this applies to wormwhole space which remains the same null seclocal chat intel is no longer automatically part of null sec the default state being the same as wormhole spaceoutposts in sov null provide the new delayed mode local intel in the system they occupy much like docking rights who has access to this intel in controlled by those that own the outpoststations in npc null will provide the new delayed mode local intel in the system they occupy to those players or corps that have 80 or higher standing to the npc corp holding the stationa new mod for titans and perhaps other cap ships that will allow them to provide the new delayed mode local intel for the system they are in for all corp and alliance members active mod that will not work in pos shields or while the ship is cloaked also will not function in wh spacea new deployable the scanner array when deployed will provide the new delayed local intel in the system in which it is deployed to the corp and alliance that owns it cannot be deployed in or near a pos will not function in wh space has a large volume that no subcap combat ship can carry one is relatively expensive to produce and relatively easy to destroy also shows up on overviewnote this proposal is the local chat portion of a larger proposal in features and ideas on improving intel in eve which includes additional ideas including cloaking improvements and means to detect cloaked ships which can be found here
first i would like to say i dont support this ive lived everywhere except wh in my times and local works just fine attacking people in their own space is easy enough as it is and this isnt coming from the person being attacked by the waysecondly this has been proposed a million and seven times if you want to bring it up again search for it and post your support in that thread instead of posting another one also by the way the fact its been braught up so often and shot down so often says something about how little support it gets each timemy 2 cents or pence ratherin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
i too have lived in null and know that because of local its near effortless to avoid being attacked when youre not traveling via gatesand for those who are part of large alliances even the gates arent that dangerous as others will generally warn in intel channels if they see anyone on local in their system so you know a hostile is nearby long before they even reach the same system as youas to the game breaking nature of local chat being being brought up many times before this is true but i never saw you saying the same in the gazzilion afk cloak whine threads that pollute these forums why is that besides my particular solution in this proposal is new
noim seeing more than enough ads out of eve alreadyas long as im not searching for a new corp ingame for some reason i dont want to see anything about it
sure there is really no way to now except for dropping jetcans around gates that have been named with recruiting blurbs
but it sounds stupid why would any interstellar empire allow its trade routes to be broken with areas of rampant lawlessness and piracy no
the empires do hate each otherthough would that mean they would have lawless borders not sure
no hes asking in one idea to have spam be an isk handchangerno different than the market minus taxesand cspa charge has no effect on spam received i have gotten 4 mass mails in 2 years and my charge is zeroas to this suggestion meh it doesnt bother me but i can understand the annoyance
more tools for corp mining like this would be good definitely
you do know that this is an exploita character doing this must undergo a sessionchangegatejump dockundock ejectreboard a ship etcbefore attacking their new wartarget otherwise its petitionable and possibly bannable iirci misremember the exact source but i think there was a devblog or a gmpost about it somewhere
idiotic goon proposal and immediate pileon of goon supportersso typical so obviousno support and i could only hope the csm can see it too
the fact that you dont support this means that its clearly a valid proposalbye now its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
learning implants much like learning skills feel compulsory to new players losing them can be prohibitively expensive depending on what level they arehardwirings will still provide a nice risk vs reward opportunity to players without feeling absolutely 100 necessary
1 learning implants just encourage people to stay docked up or carebear in hisec while giving none of the rewards if you pvp or do you think shaving those 20 seconds off training time while on a pvp roam before losing your pod was totally worth it
nowhy implants lets remove sp already so everything will be nice and fairan ability to fly different sizes of ships determine by paid month of a characterits a players problem if he is using something that he cant afford to losehaving 2 improveds inserted while pvping its not such a big dealand if it is to you 3 is not that different from 5 to whine about thisbut im also not pleased that t2 implants forces to lower the attributes but this proposal is not a solution neither a 5 t2 implants which will be a carebear implants
oh great nobody even cares
its okay if you dont like this idea but why do you start to insult me i think its now pretty clear whos an idiot nice arguments thoughedit oh look his post got deleted
or have an sp requirment to post outside of new players section
10
supportedthose slots should have been removed a same time when their simultaneous training was stoppedi have some useful alts of that kind but itll be right thing to have this handled no garbage charsas for sp reimbushment  only if those characters was created on this account not transfered to if itll not possible to track no sp reimbushment something else  i didnt really care what itll be
no
thisand atleast someone who doesnt flame like a russian oveni got also 2 useful alts on my account but to be honest it annoys me a lot to have them if i dont use them i cant minmax my business ccp messed this up and they also admit thati can understand that many people need their alts but if you sit in 00 and want to trade in jita move your ass there and dont just log into your 3mil sp scam alt having 3 chars on one account cuts the size of the eve universe beeing able to permascout systems with npc corp alts diminishes the real reason to do it by yourself1 account 1 identity 1 skillqueue
no supportbasically because i believe your initial premise is incorrectyou state eve is a pvp gameyou are wrong eve is a sandbox gameyour proposal is taking away the sandbox from players to force them to play the way you wantthis would be as bad as making hisec perfectly safe
that is literally the idea goes with being a nation of exslaves coming up with whatever sort of design worksexcept for shuttles no why would that ever be a considerationnothing is stopping the caldari and minmatar pilots from training amarr and gallente command skillsface it the minmatar are a nation of barely escaped exslaves who cobbled together a navy to fend off being thrown back into chains by largest of the empires they arent really that big into aesthetics the caldari are a corporate meritocracy of what is efficient and what works and what maximizes the corporate profit margin not being pretty
ok ill supportnot that i really want this but i think that were be allowed to do remap for a plex sooner or later i prefer soonerbut its should be multiple plexesand maybe price of such remap will increase each time the player uses this feature
courier contracts are already implemented
why the blithering hell would we ever want or do that the direction this game is going is more player driven economics not less
this would take a bit away from the whole playerdriven thingin addition to ruining moving profession it would totally eliminate having to go to a player established market hub or establishing them because you could just be anywhere and get items ferried to youno eve has a good deal of realism in some ways every item is distriuctable and it has a physical location you dont like where it is you got to move it
those rich people already can just buy plexes and get better ships and equipment  they will fly a better ships use better implants will lose it and buy it again theyre can also have more accounts and computers than an ordinary pilotitll be nothing new about that so whats your problem
but its a very good thingless shitposters  a much more pleasant gameplay  more subscribers  proffit
that is actually the stupidest thing ive read today your saying that if ccp add nex items 5 of players will quit why would they if people dont want anythng to do with aurum and the nex store and i certainly dont then they just wont it wont make them quite eve you idiot
on the test server with the all in one invertory upgrade the stacking system is working as the old onethats one of the reason i wrote this idea new invertory would be better with new divide stack ui
touche in which case you obviously know more about the subject than ialthough i do think its a good idea i dont think its should take any priority over other changes because i wouldnt have any use for itin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
yep not everyone involved with thisbut if you need do lots of logistics with more characters feed dozens of poses or planets ohh its need more clicks than star on the sky with this simple ui improvement that would be solved and the universum would be a better place 
still accepting input and suggestionsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
the technical knowledge of the op is pretty amazing because macrominers just log into eve and the game just starts mining by itself wtf do you even know what a macro is it replicates mouse and keyboard movements and more or less plays the game for you also afk cloaking is a viable balance against local and oh  a red in system ill warp to station if you wanna play evesafe mode move the fack back to empire tia
the ccp changed this rules in 2005 was disconnected those pilots which didnt use his mouse or keyboard within 30 minutesbut the macroboters and afk cloakers always crying for ccp like a bunch of pu this is why they changed this nice functioni guess if someone not playing dont waste the server resources from others who play the game1
no to the lot of ittech 1 is not obsolete use the tier 3 mining barge in place of hulk if you feel in danger also the tech 1 destroyers seem to be workingand if you want fancy stuff go to lownullsec not everything is in the newbie safezone deal with italso moon materials are generally worthless and not worth mining unless it is tech the fuel you put into a pos is not free and each month could be in the hundreds of millions if not a billion you are free to buy up ones in market and react them yourself and do tech 2 manufacturing from what i hear most people do it in empire safety and access to market hubs trumps everything elsealso in addition to properly tanking your ship i would get a good buffer tank as big as possible less likely they could alpha you in a few moments before concord comesas to larger cargo holds maybe not too much because that would take away from industrial ships though who specialize in cargo hauling if a ship uses more space for mining lasers less exists for storage space is finite in a ship that is not too largealso a lack of understanding aggression mechanics stealing players need to seriously learn the game how did they get into a hulk and not learn anythingas to punishing scamming that would be up to players but being  or sapping tards is not a punishable offense by concord and shouldnt ever get rid of the legal system just to benefit people who are bad at math business or all around dum dums whats next ordering hits over one isk wars also how do you fall for scams it is absurdly hypocritical to suggest people should be podded over scamming and on the other hand demanding other player murdering should stop in space kill the people i want but not me yea no i say anyone who does any kind of highsec murder gets sec status revoked and face concord retribution you can try to do anything but concord will not sanction it and may punish you if you do something badover all lot of bad ideas
they will when it hits thier quarterly and annual income figures and someone asks why are we failing to grow  maintain subs as intendedas for hulks being gankproof in highsec so what if they were freighers are orcas are mostly this game has no design consistency any more so conceptually either hulks can be upped to effectively immune to ganking by ships not costing 300 mil equivalence or the currently immune high sec billionaire trade alts have to be made not effectively immune  and that is not going to happen is it why is it ok for one gameplay style trader to be effectively immune to harm in space but not miner oh and just so you remember  ccp did make it safer for traders in highsec by adding warp to 0km to stargates when you used to jump to 15km out every time they were much more at risk of pvp guess what people didnt like the pace of travel so ccp carebeared up on that and made it quicker  and made traders much safer too so dont tell me ccp will never change things like this  they have in the past and many here simply choose to forget how much ccp changes things bring back cruise missles for my bomber in considering that it is important to remember that the base design is that for miners you should go to places with better asteroids to get more isk for your time but at the same time increasing risk that is part of eves design  and i agree lownull sec are broken atm and need much love i am totally fine with all t2 ships having thier insurance changed to cover the moon minerals too someone buying a plex to buy a shiny fighter ship that goes puff and has a payout that cant allow them to get back into the game will be every bit as likely to quit as a pilot who bought a plex to buy a hulk that goes down in hulkageddon to ultrabored former lowsexnullsec pvpers and that is what this is about  ccp added plex that means what happens to carebears matters a lot now much more than previously where everyone just paid their sub and whether ccp retained new players or not they had money come in every month pvp pilots should not be so bored they have nothing better to do than spend hours trying to get people to take a can and mining 1 gas cloud so that people give up on poorly designed missions which incidentally should be mine x units with a check of you personally mined x30 of it and the mission resource has 3x of the relevant crap mission resource  basic coding currnety set up to promote greifing and encourage people to quit the game  not designed for pvp as a solo mining ship can never stop anyone taking 1 unit with their t2t3faction fit shipsave a carebear today improve ccps bottom line and give them enough dev money to fix the damn game and to be able to make a video that shows gameplay as it actually is for new players not as ccp wishes it to be but never was
outside empire you have no concord you have roaming fleets of reds that use more then a few catalysts to kill you without fear of any god like concord retribution and they do collect insurance same reds can also hotdrop covert ships and or do a regular hotdroprisk vs reward is pretty balanced step into lowsec and you will knowand yes i did it once to get fancy ores ship blown up concord never came
this is not happening in remote places it happens where new players are you can get a hulk inside a few days if you buy plex and buy a character off the character bazaar and more plex for the ship guess what ccp wants that kind of player to join this game  and give ccp us remember ccp is running a business and they want people to buy and use plex so deal with it the underying business dynamics have changed the game is likely to change as well to support the new business model that means supporting people who believe what ccp say and advertise guess what gankers greifers and outdated mechanics are not in the glossy picutres or videos sure eve was always intended to be a full space game not just a space ship game eventually i would expect to see capital ship boarding actions where you can disable a large ship it goes reinforced invulnerable and immoblie in eve space and the attackers can send dust marines in to try to capture it with the defenders also allowed to get thier own teams in to defend if you think my ideas are crap then offer better ideas because go play wow is not going to cut it when ccp wants more subs for this game guess what all those dust players are about to be lured here  and ccp wants them to play eve and stay too so get over it and come up with better ideas  because if you dont ccp gets to listen to just mine and others like me
no thats the point wormhole space and lowsec are safer atm than highsec for hulk pilots and gives higher rewards all you need is an alt on the door in and a pos to warp to if anyone trips system which has your orca hiding inside it invulnerable for the bonuees tell me i am wrong
you can do this in highsec too
you know i treat highsec pretty much the same as lowsec and null when im flying around i cloak i use fast aligning ships cov ops and generally dont stay in one place for long its pretty risky even if you dont have a super pricy ship and fit there really isnt any reason not to blow people up aside from the isk cost of doing it if you dont care about that then it doesnt matter unless security is a problem and that is the real issue and deterrent in a short time with inferno that will no longer be a problem then well see how safe highsec truly iszubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
hi therei would like to say i too understand your frustration but i cant support your thread because you clearly dont understand the way eve works and what eve isid like to say the people who are saying buffer tank your hulk tank your hulk better are idiots and have obviously never been suicide ganked in a hulk even with the best possible buffer or active tank with max skills except officer fit that is you will never survive a suicide gank against 3 well fit destroyersi also agree that this situation is a problem for new players and potentially stunts ccps and eve onlines growth as a companyinstead i would sugest that suicide ganking should be mentioned in the mining tutorial missions or something of the sort i think players expectations of highsec are that it should be safe at least when you start playing eve i dont think we need to change the fact that it isnt safe we need to change new players expectations so that they are more in line with the reality i also agree that tech 2 ship insurance payouts are terrible and need looking at otherwise though the rest of your post is rediculousif you let this thread die like you should and start a new proposal to give new players a more realistic impression of their relative safety in high sec i will support itpsit is against the eula or whatever the hell its called to pick on players in newb entry systems you can get them banned for that
this is what i was going to say almost verbatim
in agreement with t2 insurance payouts needing to be looked at besides that though you are really coming across as eve isnt safe enough so please make it safer i agree that miners are getting the shaft in some aspects but you went over the top
tldr stop ing about hulkageddon and grow a pairwelcome to eve onlineop is clearly a noob who doesnt know what or how to survive in high sec without getting ganked because hes too busy being afk while chewing on rocksps actually the above quoted piece is very well written and well saidjust stating the obvious  stop the evemail spam

a name one you claim combat ships have a larger cargohold than exumers so go ahead and name a combat ship that has a larger cargohold than 8k go ahead ill wait titans dont countb agreed insurance payouts for exumers is ridiculously terriblec first of all hulks cant use mining turrets exumers dont have turret slots second destroyers have only recently received ccp loving theyve barely changed since the day they were introduced into the game third a destroyers intended purpose is high dps  low durability theyre not meant to tank only to dish out dpsd um what there should never be wardec immunity never any pvp immunity do you even play the same game as the rest of us seems like you donte you really should pay attention this is partially what ccp is doing f lol no just no again there should never be pvp immunity and you cant go off hiding asteroid belts in highsec theyre publicly available for a reason to be available to the publicg gms dont deal with scams again what game are you playing because it sure isnt eve online absolutely terrible ideah this ties in with the previous terrible idea terrible is terrible is terrible compounding on a terrible idea doesnt make it any betteri lol what players dont look like npcs never have never will and currently dont once again what game are you playingj seriously i want to know what game youre playing youre obviously not playing eve online learn this next sentence and learn it well because you obviously dont have a clue concord does not protect people nor is intended to protect people concord only punishesi will concede that the ganking in highsec has gotten out of hand last night my alt got ganked in a tanked industrial ship for two million isk worth of pi goods im not mad about it but it does illustrate a growing problem in eve and thats the lack of consequences for ganking in highsecsummary of eves last four expansions
i like this idea maybe id tweak it abit personally but still1
what would you tweak and why el geo
then your opinionargument is heavily biasedyou have no right to make a judgement call on such a thingaside from your dislike of the ideayou should spend a little time in whs before you make your final opinion on that matter stop the evemail spam
intruiging twist xorvnot sure if it would fly well in high sec 15min delay on pods as it could hurt war decs in high sec for hunting targets but then againwhy not just make it delayed local all together im not really asking thatbut im asking for more background on your line of thinking stop the evemail spam
tweak with sliding scales depending on sec status of the system and standings playercorpalliancemilitiafaction aswell as ship mass to make it more dynamic a word which id like to see applied to many things in eve and yeah maybe lower the times in highsec so its a bit quicker ofc i expect it would all add to server load
the goal is to make active intel gathering more important i dont think it would negatively impact wardecs in empire either side in a wardec could benefit from this change either in pursuit or evasion but both would now require player effort why not no local intel altogether its partly a bit of compromise but it also falls into the secondary objective i had with this particular proposal which was to give a strategic advantage in using smaller classes of ships ccp has already began looking into this with finding roles for frigates but i think theyre missing the mark just be playing with fitting stats this proposal gives a real strategic reason to use a gang of all frigs and destroyers or a gang of cruisers these ships become the skirmishers raiders and scouts they should be while bcs and up remain the ships with the real firepower and capacity to stay in a slugging match just a few clarifications its 5 minutes not 15 minutes delay for pods in the proposal also the default state for nullsec is the same for wh space except theres multiple means of creating the new delayed local in null systems whereas there isnt for wh spacethe times are just rough numbers they could change however the goal is to make it so frigates and destroyers are able to enter a system have a fight in that system and leave without ever showing up on local and for cruisers to be able to pass through systems without showing up on local if they dont linger and ofc for bcs and up not to have this advantageas to making based on ship mass as you suggested or ship signature which i thought about i rejected because signature would hurt passive shield tanks and be overly favorable to t3s with certain set ups and mass would hurt armor tanks in any respect neither mass or signature give the clear results i wanted to see the way ship class doesi would not be against making standings to npcs effect hs ls and npc null more than my proposal suggested but it would make the proposal a lot more complicated than it already is and i dont think its the most critical element so its left out
why notit will shut up the afk c loakers whiners and make them bleed not cry for local to come back 1 stop the evemail spam
no you dont you see renamed cans peoples bios spam mail local spammers and people putting bounties on themselves to show up on the bounty board if you give people a way to officially advertise it can be limited and regulated so that the annoyance you convey can be kept to an all time low if anything you should be supporting this thread to get rid of all the damn spamin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
head up there is already 3rd party constructs that have achieved this  razor alliance may actually have something for this for their useso this could be a job for 3rd party developers
yea i knowthe idea is to make it available to everyone if a 3rd part app can be made it cant be that difficult for ccp to implementin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
seriously why are high grade clones so damn expensive yeah i get the isk sink bit but the 30mill it costs me on my clone is 30mill i would probably use to buy implants that would get destroyed anyway also what it does is prevent me from being able to move around in the galaxy without paying 30mill or 60 if i want to get back and that is if the clone your podding is without implants also i tend to avoid going on frigate type gangs since getting podded is so much more likelytbh just slice the prices to 110you could argue that if i have this much sp i should be able to afford a 30mill clone well i tend to enjoy pvp and not hoard isk so no im not that rich yeah i can afford it but its just plain annoying and its just another incentive for me not to go out and die and just sit in station and spin my ship the game has way to many of these
train up alts to do interesting things too there is no reason for you to be flying ahacs with your titan 5 character
actually my character has no cap skills whatsoever but it can fly more or less anything subcap in the game my question is why should i need to train alts to do something interesting if i dont wanna pay 3040mill  ship  implants what im saying is that using clones as isk sink is  and restricts the use of high sp characters
it doesnt restrict the use of that character it just makes you more adverse to using that character when situations are not in favor of survival but that doesnt mean you cannot use it people train up alts to do things like fly recons not because its mandatory but because it makes sense you do not have to you do not have to upgrade your cloneyou do not have to stop flying riftersyou do not have to stop flying ahacsyou do not have to stop flying dessysyou do not have to stop flying anythingjust be aware that the burden of having large numbers of skill points and fittings options and ship classes available to you is that its going to cost more for you to be regenerated
i know it doesnt restrict me per se but it is a 3040 mill extra loss if you die and that tends to make me want to not go out in something small my question is why should it be like this is there a point as to why i need to be billed 40mill more if i want to fly a dictor in a gang rather than being a sniper other than isk sink i dont really see the point in these high prices other than being  annoyingcan anyone give me another viable reason as to why these prices need to be this high i know its not a big issue for most players but its an easy thing to fix and i dont see it being a problem in any way
because the assumption is they figure you know how to make that kind of money very quickly considering the amount of time you put innot supportingedit spelling noob here  stop the evemail spam
define very quickly 40mill is not very much but die two or three times in a day and it adds up my point is i wanna be able to to die or risk dying without using my isk on something not playerbased i have no problem with ship or module prices because that is isk into the eve economy eve has enough isk sinks also i asked for a viable reason other than isk sink and your answer was more or less isk sinkalso why would you not support something that has seemingly no bad impact other than one less small isk sink
so you go driving more often because you enjoy itso much so that you end up refueling 6 to 7 times a monthand you demand to lower gas pricesfigure it out yetdont get me wrongi like the idea myselfim getting up there in sps myselfbut im not jaded or blind to recognzie the value of those sps either stop the evemail spam
by that logic there should be a meter on your client and you should be paying for the time you play if gas was unlimited prices would be low as  and they would want us to use more so they could earn more witch is part of what im trying to get at more ppl on the battlefield  more fun if what youre trying to say is what is on the last line i have this to sayprobably close to 90 of my skills are useless in say an interdictor it would take more or less 6months to train a new alt to a fully fledged dictor pilot with close to my skills in that perticular ship he can pod around the galaxy for give or take a million isk when i have trained my alt i trained him for versatility so i could do whatever i wanted with him as for what the situation demanded i never wanted to get in a situation where i needed a spesific shiptype to do something usefull and would be months away from being able to do it should i be punished for having invested all my skilling towards this goal point is yes my 120mill sp char would be alot more versatile when it comes to filling a fleet position but the skill level itself does not differ much from that of a 6month to a year spec trained alt
theres a gm post by karridor buried in his thread regarding the lifting of dec shield rule its buried several pages deep in a threadnaught
ive been reading this thread over and over and ive been thinking about the implications of the proposed changes i have to say i am still very excited about what is to come people are worried that the little guys are going to get picked on and i believe that is probably true but you have to remember that eve adapts and its important to try and think ahead to how people will adapt to the proposed changes before declaring them brokenthere are already no obligation alliances where you can simply join to get a common chat channel and some company in highsec these are going to get very common so the little guy can be protected a simple solution and it will become the thing to do for new corps it will force interaction which i dont think is necessarily a bad thingas for it becoming difficult for the aggressors because of people being able to infinitely bring in support well i think it should be difficult and risky for the aggressors besides there is always room for guerrilla warfare you dont need to outnumber your opponent to be a problem having said all the above i am in favor of a price system that takes into account aggressors and defenders sizes and skill points in comparison to each other and scales so that the price per person goes down in the extremely high levels such as in the big sov alliancesin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
well if noone against it then its a good thing right
no one is responding because its a meh idea at best and just a waste of dev time we were hoping that if we ignored the thread itd just go away we really dont need a ship spinning bot and there are many things that devs should be working on instead that are far more important
yeah its not the most important thing but its also a matter of a few minutes if not seconds to a single programmerthere is a lot of ui fixes which are meh if you take one of them and describe it in a separate topic
no for the same reasons as posted aboveedit off topic part removed ccp phantom
please stay away from this thread if you cant bring any arguments thank you
i currently use all six character slots on my two accounts all characters can harvest pi goods and the pay is nicesummary of eves last four expansions
i have resisted posting in this topic because i hoped it would just go awayit is a terrible idea for reasons i hope have already been statedplease let this topic die it is taking up perfectly good space on the first page of the assembly hallin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
there is alot of arguing going on about hisec should be safe ganking should be stopped etc ganking should not be stopped hisec should not be safe but safer than everywhere else which it currently is and no dont start saying about how nullsec is safer because that is a ridiculous argument nothing in nullsec or wormholes is safe here is an approach that allows ganking to remain allows people to randomly kill if they want to but allows revenge to be meted out by players doesnt disable concord and is in line with eve backstory and immersion concord should not be absolute punishment it should be possible to avoid concord but very very difficult so here is a fairly easy mechanic when you attack a person in hisec that would normally spawn a hisec response two things would happen a concord is triggered but with a slower response time and b the criminal warp engine is shut down note microwarpdrive ability should remain functional until their ship is destroyed obviously pods need to be able to warp away shutting down the ships warp drive can be done through the neocom network monitored by concord this is within game immersion this means that the aggressor can not warp off obviously allowing justice to be meted out by players if they are faster than concord delay concord by 20 to 30 seconds maybe 10 seconds per sec level so a response of 10 seconds in 10 20 in 09 and so on allowing the aggressor some time to a be killed by locals and b get away from the area as fast as he can by mwd or ab if he can but it wont be that far of course probably being chased by local people then of course after that delay concord turn up and slaughter the aggressor it would probably mean that the timer for jumping through gates and docking would need to be increased because of course from immersion the stargate operators and station managers wont allow them access it would be even more immersive if the concord respose was by ships af the same class as the aggressor so frigates get 3 concord frigates chasing them very very fast and still huge damage up to battleships faster than our bss and of course horrific damage another small perk could be that if players manage to kill the aggressor before concord arrive they get a sec status increase possibly a small reward from concord based on the sec status of the ganker i dont think gankers can really complain about these changes as they were going to lose their ships anyway and it should make the gankee a little happier to see them get killed by players not npcs it would open up the possibility of self styled security forces career paths too this would even make theconcept of defending gasp yes defending mining ops viable all you need is fast locking high dps ships such as the tier 3 bcs with sensor boosters if anything comes within gank range you lock them up if they aggress your miners you blast the crap out of them you may well even kill them before their target is destroyed i think this is balanced and involves more player input it also allows people to defend their vulnerable ships creating more reasons to play in groups still allows ganking allows a window of revenge for players encourages more teamwork and is still immersive with no reason for insta death rays coming from nowhere
what problem are you trying to solveyour suggestion tips the balance very heavily in favour of the aggressor following your design would mean that gankers would pretty much have carte blanche in hisec and concord may as well not exist at all the ganker joins with friends and they take turns to blow each other up for sec standing bonuses meaning they also get insurance payouts because it wasnt concord that killed them UFFFDsorry this idea doesnt even stand up to the briefest of casual exploit discoveryapart from giving yourself more time to gank hulks what were you hoping to achieve with this change dear nullbearps i especially love the part where you imply that nullsec is as dangerous as wspace
why does it favour the aggressor it allows people to actually attack gankers concord will still kill them anyway but there will be time for players to attack them too and also add some fun for people to be able to chase them around a littlehow would gankers gain sec from each other the mechanic would only give a sec increase if the ganker had initiated an attack thereby they receive a sec loss for doing it anyway it would be pointless and so what if they get insurance for doing this meaningless little thing once get sa sec decrease and loses a ship he gets insurance which doesnt pay for his entire ship the person who shoots him gains a very small sec increase which could have been achieved by killing say a cruiser rat in lowsec i did say small sec increase so no one would gain anything of value by doing thatthe idea here is to give players a chance to do something about the gankers not just to have concord do the job this generates lossmailskillmails etc opens up a career path too concord are still going to kill gankers who dont get killed by players you still wont get awayinsurances would basically have to be voided if you initiate an attack that results in a cocord respose not just if concord are on the mail too thoughyes gankers would get slightly longer if players dont do anything in respose but players themselves should actually respond faster than concord do which means that some ships would be saved rather than just avenged i know people can do this anyway but hopefully this would encourage people to defendpolice themselvesps wormhole space is nullsec and they are equally dangerous in their own ways just becasue you dont have local in wh space doesnt make it more dangerous just differently dangerous and this wasnt the subject i am talking about so stop trying to sound releveant
bad idea  you will crush noobs before they get out to the harsh world of pvpone must crawl be fore they can runmost of the accounts for eve are in empire one must make null sec and low sec more customizablei play eve not to pvp but to care bear in a pvp invironment i am now trying lowsec for a change a while in null seci enjoy with the proper prep work i can go and mine in relative safety i change my locations randomly often not in my territoryon occation i get duped because a pvper out foxed me i do get upset a little but always dont fly what you cant afford to loosei have lost a rorqual even though it was fit with warp stabs neuts cloak and micro warp drive jumped into a system that had a frigate from a neut came in  i logged off waited 3 hours logged in  1 frigate there in system warping to my warp out location local spiked 2 other figates 1 opened up a cyno and summoned a dreadnaugh which did me in quickly neuted 2 frigats 3rd had warp disrupters and the nuets also had done their work but went down before the nuets finished their work that was a great fighton my mining ops i try to have a intaloc arty bs or bc to inta pop those frigate attempting to take out a hulk or covetor or cyno in a hot drop
i agree everywhere but starting systems should be 00 newbies get 30 days of not being attackable to learn the game skill up and find a corp i was living in a 02 within days of starting the game with no such protection its not hardfixed
realy i see the trial account bussiness become boooming when you cant be attackedwhat you want is tried in many mmos and tragicly failed over and over againa 30 day pilot is no match what so ever for a experienced piloteves player base is a little older than most mmos people with jobs and families which can only play a few hours of those 30 daysmost of al eve is a sandbox even in highsec having rules doesnt make it less sandboxmost of all stop telling people they should play your game in the sandbox
bring in the borg caldari cube personaly i like lots of the caldari and minmatar designsokay the moa is but ugly but the merlin hookbill kestrel caracal drake ferox tengu scorpion rokh bager and rhea are nice looking ships if you ask me
lets notand yes the bombers designs will be changed the new models where shows on fan fest and also they will add the new skin to all ships in time makes them look nices but the samebut a definetly no to redesign all minnie  cal ships its like saying lets redo all the ships in the gameplus i wanna fly a huge space turd some day aka revenant
after having some ideas and having spread in them on several forums already i thought lets post them here so people can give their feedback on the ideassome backgroundas a high sec marketeer  interregional trader i handle a lot in courier contracts the amount of courier contracts i have out each day surpasses the capacity of my corpmates time so i use the public market to get them done while i have made friends in courier contract networking channel and some other couriers around to get the work done i would still prefer some improvements within the system setting up 10 to 20 courier contracts a day gets you annoyed at the little things within the courier contract wizard those little things i list here nowideas make it possible to drop a station destination from search info and locations within the courier contract destination field within the wizzard make the  of open slots of contracts visible within the complete contract wizzard when adding containers within the contract wizard make it possible to shift click the yes  no button on adding nonempty containers make it possible to double click the discription formfield of a courier countract just like in browsers to select a before used discription thxi hope you all find this some good ideas ofcourse feedback is welcome  schrUFFFDdingers missile i dig it  makari aeron
still comes down as a pay2win mechanic and everytime something is close to that i say no
as marketeer i strongly oppose against this idea my whole playstyle is possible due to the risks within the transport system of eve if that is automated its just loss of a part of the sandbox schrUFFFDdingers missile i dig it  makari aeron
this is an excellent idea indeed makes it a tad tedius but also makes it not completely easyalso there is one other thing ppl havnt thought of having a new ship like this would help mineral prices yes that means making them higher by the fact that a lot of mins would be needed to make these ships and as someone who mines for his pvp funds and moves ships arround for said pvp i fully support this idea1 for me
i can only assume it has something to do with the carebears drowning out all good ideas with their incessant screaming whining and crying that they should be absolutely safe from gankers in high sec and hulkageddonshort of that i would assume its because we havent raised enough support for the ideai am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
to the front page this is the most pressing issue in pvp in my opinion
friendly bump
 this is what it is all about in the next year or two ccp is about to have a game that is potentially 100x or more valuable to them than eve if darkness takes off as ccp hope it will then where do you think their design effort will goif i believe the trolls ingame and above then eve is perfect and nothing needs to change are you really happy with everything as it is you would be ok with eve going to maintenance only patches every year with major content additions being decided against due to costreward being in favour of applying the resources to ccps new games i know ccp wants eve to grow thrive and stay viable indefinitely but the commercial reality is if you keep kicking new players in the guts and they keep leaving sooner or later eve will become minimum input to maintain only in terms of ccps business you dont like my ideas no problem thats your view but dont say i have no idea how to play etc etc etc  you have no idea what i know or do not know and attacking me wont fix the underlying issues of lowsec nullsec players being so damn bored they grief newbies because they have nothing better to doand all you trolls please remember this thread come back in three years and either laugh at how wrong i was or swear loudly at your lack of foresight because ccp is devoting its primary effort to darkness and hasnt done all those things you always wished for in eve i really hope ccp can pull the subscriptions to do both to their full potential however ccps player numbers are not nearly as good as they ought to be for such a wellknown stong game particularly given the immense advertising effort ccp deploysyou dont like my ideas  come up with better ones and go to another game is not a good option because when darkness launches i expect a significant portion of eves current playerbase will do precisely that and guess what null sec etc will be even more boring  and about three months later ccp would be reviewing resource allocations and could well put eve into reinforced mode indefinitely
you asked for itshield tanked maelstrom has more cargo capacity than a tanked procurer 1000 capacity for a mining ship really you want to say thats good design from ccpstrip miners are mining lasers go look on the market under turrets  bays if you dont believe mebasic issue is that there are people who are genuinely immune to pvp in this game go talk to barbie in amarr one of the richest most wanted scumbags ever who apparently makes a billion or so a day without ever undocking go watch the freighters ambling past in their day newbie corps 9 years on from launch good luck taking one of those out with warp to 0 mechanics and gazillion armour pointsfrigates could not kill miners nearly as easily as destroyers they were quickly celebrated as a griefer ship when introduced oddly enough i cannot recall ever seeing a t1 destroyer in nullsec lowsec or wormhole space they are too squishy for real pvp and if you want mass dps get the latest bc the one with the battleship guns yes thats nicely balanced  friggin candy to distract from more fundamental issuesyou seem to wonder what game i am playing  maybe the real issue is you dont want to look more closely at what is going on around you go play other games and you will see just how different npcplayers look in most of the games out there although your last comment does show that you are at least not blind to the issuesbottom line in this area of the fourms we can talk about ccp and eve the business my suggestions are not because i personally want to see eve totally turned into something else  if i wanted something else there is plenty to choose from thats the real issue in the game market games rise fall and die dont kno about you but i want this one to stick around another 9 years and beyond but to achieve that it needs to keep healthy revenue streams to justify its postion as ccps 1 game and guess what if you greif newbies you really do run the risk that eve will become 2 with all the long term resource implications that carries
thank you for pointing out just how much ccp is willing to change eve to retain players the power is in your hands i have set out what i see as an issue you dont like my suggestions thats perfectly fine but unless you come up with better options guess what ccp is going to do reread above
appears in your beltwhat youre telling me here is that youre too lazy to watch local or use dscan in order to ensure your own safety i hope you arent looking for sympathy in this thread because you dont deserve any
i hardly think a 19 day old player is qualified enough to propose such dramatic changes to the game the op has clearly shown such a massive lack of understanding of what eve is about and what eve needsonce again a post here in the assembly hall has reconfirmed that perhaps we should have a 6month age restriction on posting threads herejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
so far the op has managed to soundly refute every argument posed against their idea while i dont completely agree 100 with the idea i can say that most of it is sound there is a problem with a 300m mining ship and how weak its defenses are insurance does suck but thats how it goes with tech 2 ships if that is going to change for the hulk it will need to change for all tech 2 ships i dont see that happening i can fly a hulk on several of my accounts and i have mined before but honestly have never experienced being ganked in high sec it was always in null and i was running dscan constantlya major pain in the ass that needs to be corrected the game stops being fun when you have to spam click a single button to perform one mind numbing process just to stay safe sorrythats a mechanic that needs correction periodoverall i agree with the op i am not going to nitpick the parts i dont agree with in the op as they are minor in the grand scheme
my sweet lupiahyoure missing the point whine tanking to function must produce noticeable disruptions in ccps bottom line ccp knows they need paying customers they have over 300000 now if youre going to wrestle ccp into changes via whine tanking you and yours need to terminate your accounts  en mass  to generate sufficient ripple among that 300000 for them to take notice lacking sufficient ripple whine tanking will prove ineffectual ccp needs customers but they donUFFFDt need any one specific customer and they donUFFFDt need you ccp sells eve as a harsh and brutal universe the approach has treated them well so far until you prove to them via mass account terminations that eve should be less harsh and brutal in your little corner of the universe your whine tanking will prove ineffectualperhaps i misunderstand your intent however perhaps youUFFFDre not engaged in follow through whine tanking perhaps you have no intent to follow through perhaps you merely wish to whine very well youUFFFDve found the place for it whine away one caveat however as youUFFFDre discovering the eve forums are every bit as harsh and brutal as the ingame universewelcome to eve lady lupiahweUFFFDll see if you have the mettle for itluvdirenecessity

if you want a tanky miner use a rokh lower yield and smaller hold but heythats realistically what youd have to give up in order to have a tougher ship exhumers are fragile because theyre just a gloried dump truck they are built to maximize yield not survive combat you have a choice to sacrifice one benefit for the other please stop asking for both and claiming its balanceas for a craft guild just the use of the word guild tells me all i need to know about where you draw ideas and preconceptions if you want to have a little corp of you and your buddies you run the risk of becoming a war target if you want to avoid war you suck it up and take the 10 tax and just use a private chat channeli dont really understand why you want to change the overview i can tell the difference between players and npcs at a glance and know who is and is not safe to shoot if you cant be bothered to learn how to tell the difference without eve saying hey theres a player on grid with you now then im inclined to agree that this game may not be for youeve allows us to do almost anything we want but in return it requires vigilance youre asking for change after change to allow you to be less attentive and more lazy quite frankly that flies in the face of what eve was built on
some specific pointswhich combat ships ive never seen one that could carry 8k m3yes lets remove one of the few remaining drivers for conflict in nullsecits a cloaking device but without the downside of cloaking devices now you can cloak and do all those other things you wanted to dolets just stop there on this premise prove you were scammed come on show me definitive proof that someone scammed you now do so in a way that the system could automatically adjust security standings based on that proof otherwise gms will be consumed with playing detective and marking scammers driving players to use alts for scamsas for the threat of being shot instation i can avoid that right now dont dockplayers dont look like npcs on the overview im not sure youre using that right

what is your fit i am looking at a procurer in eft with a damage control and reinforced bulkhead it still has 1000 m3 of cargo space without any cargo expanders a maelstrom can only hold 550 m3 worth of stuff and the battleship with the highest cargospace is the megathron with 675 m3also bear in mind that you are comparing a battleship with something that is more or less cruiser sizedwhile they may be under the turrets  bays market section strip miners are not technically turrets otherwise they would not be able to fit on mining barges or exhumers because neither ship has any turret slotsstation traders may not risk themselves physically but they do open themselves up to the risk of having their wallets nuked by someone smarter andor with more capital than they havefortunately for most station traders not many people have the patience or mind to economically outmaneuver themin a way its no different from people who have learned various combat tactics and aggro mechanics to keep their ship safe while applying maximum damage to their target its just a different formits possible to kill such ships with the right planningjust because you havent seen ships being used or you dislike certain aspects about them doesnt mean they arent being usedwe use a lot of destroyers in fwnowa double the hold space on all exhumerssee the first quote aboveb fix insurance payouts on exhumerst2 insurance is supposed to suck if you were more or less fully reimbursed for the loss of a t2 ship what reason would you have to fly a t1 ship ever again you pay for that 10 to 20 edge over other playersc fix the dpsdefence impalancewhat imbalance four destroyers can kill my pilgrim a 150mil isk cloaky recon ship without too much of an issue they can also kill a 180 mil isk zealotand the ships i mentioned are combat ships really why should a noncombat ship be able to better defend itself against certain attackers than a combat shipd fix social guiild wargriefingfight back and generally be more trouble than youre worth get your corp into 4 cheapo gankfit destroyers and gun for the squishiest most expensive thing on field most war decs end when you consistently ruin the aggressor corps isk efficiency alternatively jump corp and set up a locked channel to stay in touch with everyone now your enemies have to suicide gank you if they want to kill you problem solvede introduce moon mining to 07 and lower planetsccp is looking into removing tech moons entirely and reinventing belt miningf introduce advanced drones for minerscloaking module and no you cant have something that conceals you and allows you to continue doing what you were doing you have to give up something of equal value to what you are gainingg consequences killing scammersif it sounds too good to be true it probably isscamming has been with eve since the beginning i was scammed when i was a nubbin my peers were scammed its a rite of passage and in a twisted way prepares you for stuff you will encounter later in the game which is arguably worseh consequences 2 an alt should also be allowed to be killed if dust marines go innow you are trying to institute metapenalties for allowable ingame actions this is a bad precedent no matter how you look at iti clarity a player locking someone in highsec should not on the overview appear the same as an npcas others have said a player does not look anything remotely close to an npc even on the overview or in space or in any way shape or formnpcs are crosses white or red players are squares with may other colors differentiating themj podding wanted players in highsec should immediately pay out the rewardif someone has a 50 security status or lower you can pod them anytime you wish provided you can catch themconcord is nice but a joke engagement times have reduced so much with the new ships that concord intervention times are not an effective protection for new playersrepeat after me concord does not protect it punishes it is a means to increase the cost of illegal engagement in highsec the fact that some people do it anyways means that they have simply accepted the costsnewbies are generally protected because they have nothing of value to gankand for the record concord has been buffed many many times it honestly cant get much more powerful than it is now without removing suicide ganking as a mechanic altogether however removing it as a mechanic means that people who live in npc corps effectively become immune to almost all forms of combat
actually if you carefully read the details this proposal it doesnt remove afk cloaking as an option although i doubt many would bother as there simply is no need to do it the first place
oh there isyou wont show up on ds if your cloakedbut thats a minor detail in the grand scehme of thingseven if you dont know im thereim still going to cloak up stop the evemail spam
the only real afk cloakers are the ratters who dont want to be found
it wouldnt if anything just the opposite they would have law enforcement and military crawling all over the borders staring and each other and be obsessively investigating each crime as a potential act of espionagefor gods sake the only equivalent to the most extreme level of border tension i can think of is the korean demilitarized zone which is probably one of the most monitored areas on the planetand even if the empires hate each other they arent going to allow their trade routes to be ruined north koreas breaking from this logic by being a hermit kingdom doesnt count because north korea is ruled by a dynasty of insane megalomaniacs who demonstrably do not care if their entire nation starves to death
if you can call it a war at all it would be a cold war that is why millitias are shooting eachother and not the navieseven in de cold war between us and russia they where trading with eachother not liking it but they where still tradingif they realy where at war it would be smugglinggetting more people in to lowsec should not be giving the current populations more gates to camp but giving non dwellers something that will draw them to low by them selfs which in return gives the current population more gates to campso instead of trying to make it harder for highsec people to do what they are doing now give them good low sec prospects fun and stuff to do and they will come and take your attempts to shoot them for granted
i also 1 the contract idea would make things far simpler and would make it easier for beginner miners they could see a contract up and try to fill parts of it as they could and get payed for it
many pilots start their careers eve by grinding missions during their first few months first 12 months for some of us unfortunately missions become repetitive very quickly due largely to their static nature and the limited pool of missions available i believe this can lead to many people opting to move onto other games before they get a glimpse of the player driven content that makes the eve universe so uniquei propose that we can keep the current set of missions interesting by making mission spawns dynamic instead of static please keep in mind i am not a programmer and this is merely my take on how my proposal could be achieved first introduce the following values that are invisible to playersUFFFDtotal mission bountyUFFFD this value is static and sets how much maximum the mission will yield in bountiesUFFFDminimum bounty per stageUFFFD this value ensures that every stage in a mission contains at least some ratsUFFFDmaximum wave count per stageUFFFD this value ensures that you do not warp into a mission to fight 1000 waves of one frigate each UFFFDmaximum unitrat count per stageUFFFDthis value ensures that you do not have fight 1000 frigates worth 5k eachspawns per room can then be UFFFDrandomlyUFFFD generated using current bounty values on mission rats to be greater than or equal to the UFFFDminimum bounty per stageUFFFD value while not exceeding the maximum wave or unit values as an example a mission with 1 room gone berserk and a total bounty of 10 million that we run twice throughtotal mission bounty10millionminimum bounty per stage10millionmaximum wave count per stage3maximum unit count per stage30the first time you do the mission you could have 2 waves of 10 ships eachwave1  4xbs at 125million each wave2  4xbs at 1 mill each 4xbc at 5million each 4xcruisers at 25million each the total value of the spawn is 10millionthe second time you do the mission you could have 1 wave of 28 ships wave1  8xbs at 750k each 4xbc at 500k each 6xcruisers at 250k each 10xfrigs at 50k eachtotal value of the spawn is 10millionin conclusion varying the content of a mission in this style would remove the repetitive feel of missions and provide a more interesting experience for new and old players alikecomments welcome
i agree with this we all grind missions at one point and pilots still do today either too make some isk or fix their sec status an increase too bounties too missions would be nice and more randomly generated rooms would be cool and give newbies a challenge and make some pilots go back to missions instead of incursionsi also agree that it gets repetitive after a certain point with incursion  everything up pilots tell newbies  missions get into a bc and go fly vgs when they have little chance of even getting into one and even when they do their most likely too be contested by an nightmare fleet or something increasing mission bounties will make vgs look like lvl 3s or somethinglittle rant i know  1
a little variety in the typical carebear grind would be niceand yesi confessi do missions too due to minimal time constraintsbut it would be nice to have a change of pacedifferent wavesdifferent shipsetcmaybe a scaling affect for the type of ship in the mission and other things like sps stop the evemailUFFFDspam
thank you for your commentsit would be awesome if the difficulty of a spawn set in a mission could be adjusted based off that it would provide insane scalability too missions want to fly your faction cruiser but dont want to go level 4ing in it well no issue go level 3ing in it and the mission will scale to be harder based off your ship choice a system like that would provide a since of progression that i personally feel eve is sometimes lacking as you fly better ships the missions within the same level become harder and pay betterunfortunately a system like that would properly require heaps of work  alternatively the spawn frequency of elite frigs crusiers and high paying battleships could be weighted based of the mission level ie the higher the mission level the more likely these ships are to spawni donUFFFDt remember much about level 3 missions but i do remember how awesome it was back in the day shoot up a battleship in my bc seriously i thought i was leetsauce a weighted system like the alternative i just suggested could also be configured to allow low paying battleships to spawn in level 3 missions every so often
we all know about wip but i dont believe that it should disappear for good a response from ccp about the subject would be nice rather than not give any details about the topic indefinitely however i do propose some options that may help strike a win for a rebirth of wip the social aspect such an environment will bring will actually form bonds regardless what people think however it needs to be done correct in a timely manner and smartly just a few ideas1 station environments for every station is a little much and very few people would be in the station but lets say we have a focal point that every one goes to based on the region or even the faction that they are currently in instead of being in a lonely empty spaceport there will be a single focal point this is done in swtor star wars the old republic but making accessible by all station locations within a region or faction however it will not allow people to travel between stations almost as if there body is tied to whatever station they first came from this would even allow corps to gather for information sessions even2 station environments cosmetics will be based on the faction the region or station is apart of keeping design minimums to only 4 but allowing expansion of stations to be a little more intricate in design3 marketing shops should not happen however have npc shops which can give you access to things such as loyalty points and things of such manner that will not deter people but having to run everywhere to do things as far as you go is a preference but can be expanded upon as needed4 social areas this would play a big role in meeting new people and building new bonds such areas like we have seen in older ccp videos would be a bar where there can be minigames and such maybe even some gambling and this would allow people to talk another social area could be war rooms as was one of the earliest mentions when ccp was looking into this these would be social gathering areas easily accessible from starting location as to not have time dwelled on getting to the location but will allow people to see each other corp mates and maybe talk about things5 voip a proper voip localized voip with the options to mute or not even be apart of to prevent harassments6 a benefit of the reduction in locations is server load cost to maintain such areas would be drastically reducedccp ambulation is not as far fetched as you may have worked it out to be computers are improving as well and even so eve demands more now anyways but these things are possible people didnt want to dispel the idea of ambulation they just wanted it to be properly introduced and not have time wasted so poorly im not saying this should be done right away but it needs to be looked into in the near future i have supported eve for many years and i feel its missing a large social aspect this would compliment eve well and definitely would keep playing and being more active longer than ive seenfinal thought ccp should not toss out the idea of ambulation however should be thought out again and implemented in a way to bring along a nice social aspect to eveim hoping more people will weigh in on this topic and help feed some more useful information that can bring back wip but please be reasonable and keep it within the ideas and concepts that have helped build eve to what it has become today
i agree on the theme of the post i was annoyed when everyone else kicked up against wis i still wanted it to go aheadhowever it seems as though you havnt been doing your reaserch it has been implied through various dev interviews etc that the first part of wis to be introduced will be corp offices which pretty much fixes all the issues you braught up in that post server load too many people too spread out mini games corp gatherings etc etc etc voip has already been implied by ccp admittedly some time ago now i would like them to put more into it because i like wis and that we agree on everything else though you have really just created a post full of obsolete speculationinferno is going to fix alot of stuff that has really needed changing for some time after that once theyve fixed bounties and poses i think more wis is in orderin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
op are you talking about work in progress or walking in stations parduemont hmm as far as i know the first part of wis they are looking at now is exploring derelict ships in dangerous enviromentsanyway yes revive wis
well i havent been able to keep up with all the dev blogs on the subject and im sure a missed quite a few of them i tried hunting down some research before posting my thoughts and i do realize voip would be implemented sorry for the speculation but i feel like information is missing about the entire subject and its future use
yes it always annoyed me that so many were hysterical about ambulation it is a fascinating concept and a good addon to eve admittedly there were some legitimate concerns about the whole thing but a ridiculous amount of the fan backlash was simply morons screaming and chest thumping to make sure everyone was aware they thought they had big hardcore pvper epeens
i belive there should be an option to revoke shares from excorporation members who have been kicked out of the corp or for those that voluntarily leave the corp shares should be automatically deposited back into the corp walletat the very least give us a vote option that would allow all corp members to vote on whether or not corp shares could be revoked in general or on a player by player basis if such a vote is proposed and majority rules to revoke the shares then the shares get revoked back to the corp wallet to be redistributed to worthy players or resold to increase corp capitalor when issuing shares to a member of the corp allow the selection of a few options at the time of issue such as able to be revoked and revoked upon quitting the corporation or some sort of forced buyback optionsif a member buys a number of shares at x isk per share then the corporation should be able to buy back those shares at the same price without the members consent when or if that member leaves or gets kicked out being kicked out should include a penalty to the buyback option though if i kick someone out of the corp for being unsavory the last thing i want to do is buy back my own corp shares but fair is fair im not into scammingplease support this proposal profit sharing is a guaranteed way to develop a loyal active reliable memberbase but what ceo wants to sell shares to players knowing if they quit they can still get paid corp funds what player wants to be active and loyal knowing once they get shares theyre set for life with all the scammers in eve today us honest players need a bit of insurance to maintain a moral character ccp needs to furnish such insurance in the form of usable tools and options for controlling capitolplease support this proposal
the entire point of shares being implemented was for corporations to actually have activities shareholders and operate something like a publicly traded companies the ability to revoke shares from leaving member would render it pointless might as well remove shares and just implement a payrollbut shares are completely useless at present ill give you that ive never even heard of any ceo actually distributing shares
hey folkswhile doing plexes in null i thought it might be nice to have an option for missiles that you could set how many missiles you want to fire lets say you know that rat x needs 10 missiles to explode and you have 10 such rats in plexso you set it to 10 and then there is no waste or you can check your other toon that is mining and so forth there would be lets say 5 possible presets for different rats in anomaly plex what have you and presets for how many repetitionsif you click on module by default it would fire non stop but if you lets say left click select the preset then it would fire specified amount of missilessugestions and comments welcometake carens
funny thing isthere is a way to do this either load 10 rounds into the launcher or turn off the launcher after it fires 10 rounds cool huh
you do know that reloading takes 10 sec right this wouldnt have any delayturning off is what am doing we all are but this mechanic would make things easier at least sometimes
micromanagement isnt always a good thingthe ui and controls are cluttered and confusing enough without adding more options stuffed into every corner
so you want more scripts in an already cluttered interface lets leave the system the way it is and maybe force you to pay attention
this tbqh stop the evemail spam
it would be nice no one has an opinion on this it would make electronic attack ships useable imo
and would it hurt you to do the same amount with just 2 characters i think not
wait what do you mean how exactly would losing two thirds of his pi capacity not hurt
bolded the importaint bityou dont really think at all do youit is one thing to complain about alts and alt postingits an another to emoragefit and just say kill em all by asking ccp to yank it all togethernot very bright to be sure stop the evemail spam
maybe you should read the first post too
level v of command centre upgrades and interplanetary consolidation takes over two weeks how long exactly do you think level six should takei have three alts on this account with both at iv about a week per character how many planets would i lose with your proposal and requiring level twelve skills on top of that having my twelve planets over three characters allows me to use one system should i so desire having all the planets on one character is much more of a logistical headache that i just dont want there simply arent enough planets in most systems to support this regardless of type
firstly how long ago could you train all 3 at the same time i started mid 2006 and had to manage 9 accounts to train 9 toons so my argument against is  why should i see all that time money and effort be negated because of a noob who wants to fiddle with things for no real reason other than he doesnt like it transfer to another account yeh ok drop the sub to UFFFD333 and i might be pursuededmost stupid idea ive seen on the forums yet
there is no level 6 the skills get just trippled instead of getting 1 addtional planet per skilllevel you get 3 and instead of starting with 1 planet on level 0 you have also 3 you have the same amount of planets before but just on one character you enjoy logging between your 6 characters for pi i dont if you have trained you maincharacter on max skills you will have 18 planets now you have 655 in the end you would get your sp reimbursed 2 planets for free and everything on one character i think that should compensate your loss quite wellthats a point i forgot ccp should allow people to place more than one command centre on one planet so you could place 2 or 3 on one planet giving you the threefold powergrid and cpui know the idea will butthurt some veterans or bears with 15 chars on 5 accounts for their bearfactory but people like that are an exception
i know the idea will butthurt some veterans or bears with 15 chars on 5 accounts for their bearfactory but people like that are an exceptionyes it would i notice you have worked out how to safeguard you pi farming  thats all worked out i play each character as a character  not a altget rid of the ideas for pi and i might take you seriously that and get ccp to drop the sub fees
is it just me or is his idea getting worse as he continues to dig his own grave or is he just going off the walls scrambleing for what little credibility he has left stop the evemail spam
its no consequent gamedesign with or less pirdwhatever ccp proclaims one universe one sandbox so why do we need 3 charslots its just not consequent yes i said this twice now2 additional slots bring too much advantages and ruins a part of metafeeling in the game if you want that okay i do notalso i dont have a problem to discuss this topic i would like to hear opinions and reason when you bring some
if you dont want it dont use them noones forcing you to
well i need them because eve is too big a universe to explore with just one char in that respect even 3 might not be enoughone can be a pirate another a fanatic sansha supporter and another a peaceful industrialisti will not support any idea that forces me to pay an extra 12 euros to keep a character i love alive i care less about the characters skills than their historiesi will only support it if subscription fees are reduced to 13 and offer a free character transfer in fact then i will welcome it because it allows me to train all my chars simultaniously and prevents one character from being judged by anothers actionsand preferably they will have created the master accounts first
this to be hoensti have multiple accounts because i want to train multiple charshowevereventaully i will need that 2nd alttoon for various reasons whilst living out in 00 spacejust because someone has an alt doesnt make them an evil  and your game is going to breakforcing people to pay more for something as simple as a dumb cyno toon would make them call out the lynch mob on you stop the evemail spam
mehi agree with the op to a point but i dont think that the 2nd and 3rd slots should be removed i dont even use mine but i dont see how removing them will really accomplish anything
tbh i like the idea to drop the subcosts too but i guess ccp will never do this just like my propsal
in a game that is all about choices and consequences playing with a lot of different characters is a bad thingbut ccp will never remove existing characterslots the outrage would be bigger then incarnage too many carebears that want to do everything and play this game like a singleplayer grindoperation write down all the things check out the list at
i actually agree this argument and yes the outrage would be unbelievable but ccp set the precedent for this sort of gameplay by giving us the chance to run more than one account and 3 slots the other point is that unless you are limited not just to one client open at a time but also only one account active or not then not much would change people would find a way round it
i support the ops ideawould it not bring real risk back to eve
why in the name of sweet jesus would we respond to something like that some sort of suicidal heroism realistically concord like the modern police would hate this kind of vigilantism
so basically what you are saying is you dont in fact want the chance to do somethgin about it you want ccp to make it so you are nice and safe and concord will explode the naughty man for youok basically all i see here is that all the rest of the forums are correct the hisec community that arnt also nullsec players because lets face it our alts make up probbaly a good half of hisec actually dont want empowerment they want ccp to wrap them up nice and warm and have a risk free environmenti apologise for thinking you were slightly better than that good luck in eve
i find it hard to believe someone in fa would make such posts stop the evemailUFFFDspam

taking troll thread seriously because i dunno im bored i guess this is stupid no it isnt eve is not a pvp game it is a dowhateveryouwant game and ccp has been marketing that and intending that all along youd have to literally be blind and unable to see the big shiny banners blaring that to the world at
that sounds like a terrible idea why would we ever want to implement something that stupid no not fixed you are just throwing a tantrum that not everyone is playing the way that makes things the most fun for you personally eve is still a sandbox game in high sec you are just angry that in this futuristic world police still exist and enforce laws and will blow your ship up if you attack someone right in front of them
this proposal would solve allot more problems if the title read hello i fail at thinking ideas through and id like to biomass myself
this is completely stupid you would destroying everything that people like pve would be gone fw would be gone with its rise in popularity mining would be worthless and those do continue too do it would be forced to pay for protectionconstantly hide or keep moving around not only that you would be destroying the whole eve fiction base or story base eve is not all about pvp your just closed minded about the game you want too pvp go too low or null sec getting rid of the empires would be stupid and knocking down so many things yes this sounds like a carebear but i dont mind helping them every now and then
i stopped reading right there since you are clearly wrong my sig attests to that period
best comment for me for this year so far
as an example there was a patch to the client today may 8th that i cant seem to find information on but in general is the csm being informed or consulted with on the changes with or direction of eve im a little worried that were seeing a change back to the old way of running things that came to a head during the incarna period i see devs talking about some subjects in the forums and thats good i realize that they all must be busy rolling out inferno with a reduced staff i realize that some forum posters will repost the same subject no matter the answer but not all of us but to shut down communication to make the csm inconsequential and thus remove one channel of player voice that balances out the voice of the forums a bit this would probably be a sad direction to see resumed
adds more duck tape too hurricane problem
yes please i dabble in courier contracts sometimes and it can be painful
i think you hit the nail on the head with that one jack
unfortunately the worthless carebears that want isk just for the sake of having isk because there is no real purpose to them having it as theyll never need to replace pvp ships are the ones ing things up for the rest of usi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i know bettter idea than you keep local chat and give afk tag on local
i completely agree with the op drake your argument is now utterly invalid rather than just idioticto whoever linked kills of freighters for the burn jita month  nice one its meaningless data as it has no context just like a hulk getting killed because i was using it as an afk bait in a wh to lure people in to thier doom is also just as utterly irrelevant to this discussion i wonder what  of those players ganked unsubscribed because a bored nullsec alliance ruined their gameplay without any real risk lets face it unless you lose systems there is not real risk for many top level corps or thier pilots given jump clonesand as for whine tanking needing to hit ccps bottom line  have you noticed that plex is suddenly on sale part of the comments above are that social players are the ones who are most likely to buy plex to acieve things they want ingame if you stop casual players being able to use hulks  mine safely in highsec then you depress demand for plex from that highly volitile customer group and that hits ccps pocket i personally would love to see plex usesales data particularly analysed by account age i dont think we ever will but ccp will and yes thats going to impact their business bottom line
 but an iteron v can have 20000 cargo without blinking and has a ton of slots to play with the dump truck has more mid slots and generic high slots varying hulks highlowmid slots would be an option as would introducing a t3 exhumer with cusomisable configs as for mael fit it has superb low slots so fill it up with cargo expanders tank on the mid and high slots are mix of gas miners  cruise missles  turrets whatever floats your boat speaking of which why can exhumers not mine gas where is the mining ship that canthe comment was made above that concord do not protect they punish but there is no punishment when an alt scoops everything and the crystalsturrets in a hulk are often worth more than the ship used to kill it perhaps concord should shoot thieves on sight toobut those are not really the issues here its about player retention in the face of a sharp upswing in bored players suicide ganking eve has always had an implicit arms race between prey ships and hunter ships the hunters ships have had all the love for a few years it seems and yes changing insurance for all t2 ships should happen it likely hasnt because ccp wants people to buy plex to get the isk to replace thier ships rather than just using insurace payouts if that is the case then naughty naughty on ccp them fixing t2 insurance will be a clear message that isnt what they are up to on that

lady fluteyour comment unravels itself before our very eyes the presumption seems to be that young andor casual hulk bound miners buy a lot of plex you then call that very presumption into question by pointing out your lack of usesales datai know not who buys or uses plex i do know that from ccps point of view itUFFFDs a zero sum equation since every plex purchased is destined to be redeemed for a monthUFFFDs game time meaning that month of game time wonUFFFDt be purchased directly from ccp by the eventual redeemer in this sense plex purchased now means less money later when the plex is redeemed ccp is pulling future income into the present but this is nothing new they do much the same thing selling comparatively discounted 6 month and 1 year subscriptionscaveat UFFFD plex can also be redeemed for aurum but whenUFFFDs the last time you visited the nex storeperhaps that isnUFFFDt the thrust of your comment perhaps the thrust of your comment is ccp should cater more to a UFFFDhighly volatile customer groupUFFFD are you daft woman what gaming company in its right mind is going to cater to highly volatile customers over dedicated long term players highly volatile customers are here today and gone tomorrow dedicated customers are here today and here tomorrowUFFFDbut what about the noobsUFFFD is a common refrain eve isnUFFFDt for everybody a lot of noobs wash out iUFFFDm comfortable with that to date ccp has been as wellhugs and kissesdirenecessity
i have to say i usually agree with drake but in this instance i think hes kind of missing the pointto clarify again i do not support any of the changes in the op but i do support the causei propose the oper close this thread and reopen a new proposal with a looser theme if you can let ccp know that something needs changing they will often come up with the best design for change or sometimes the players can plex also costs more than game time i think perhaps you didnt think about that
the weekend of burn jita had the highest playercount id seen on in quite a whileyesterday a random tuesday during hulkageddon i saw the online count peak a little under 53000and yet  your claim is all these things need to stop to save the gameno not at all it needs to change to be a game you want to playplenty of others want to play it as it isalso the senior producer of eve has said these events are fcking brilliant  so youre out of touch and sol
i subscribed another account to do it sa forums has at least 1520 people subscribing off the back of burn jita and wanting in on hulkageddon two of my friends have resubbed in the last 5 weekswant an anecdotal evidence face off
alsoyou want to insure t2 ships ie fundamentally change the entire landscape of the game because of one ship the hulkso rather than say the miner leaving the belt when danger is on the way you want to rebalance the entire sodding game so he doesnt need to take a very basic precautioni dont know what else to say monumentally stupid
ive been petitioning ccp to add some form of directional scan module to ships for a while such that players can use it to see what is in space and possibly headed their waythis would be great as the miner could see the ships before they land and be in warp before they even load gridbut they keep telling me its already in the gameimpossible i say surely if this were in the game people would be using it and not asking for massive upheavals in the game
every time hulkageddon rolls around the same old arguments hit the forums its one of the more boring aspects of a tired and tedious event sometimes even spouted by the same characters that supposedly quit eve because of a previous hulkageddonstrange as it may seem ccp hasnt been hit by a drop in plex sales or prices people still sign up to play the game and existing players dont quit the game in droves as the doomsayer predict miners inability to keep an eye on current events use dscan or find something else to do while the event is on vs the gankers need to pop ships that are too specialised to be a challenge to take down make this whole thing more than a bit passe at least the tech and hulk producers get a bit of a laugh watching all you little hisec mining and ganking hamsters running in your wheels for their profit
worthy point plexed accounts earn ccp about 25 more than directly purchased accounts plex can also be destroyed in game and happens with stunning regularity at camped hisec choke points
an itty 5 is also a pinata if its carrying anything of value theyre one of the ships ive seen destroyed most by trade route gank campssure you can do this with the mael apoc rokh abaddonany battleship with a lot of turret slots can be converted into a miner of course your yield wont match that of a hulk nor will your cargo capacity whats that you would be giving up yield to get more tank gee that sounds like something i saidgood question from a lore perspective i would assume its because ore has not interest in the gas business other than that i have no idea rather than trying to force an end to suicide ganking you should be pushing for more content to distract them and better education for new players who are more likely to be gank victims
i still think the inherent issue is with cynos i mean picture this situationi sneak into a highly populated fully upgraded ratting system just after dt in a falcon with a cyno fitted i log my character off in a deep safe for a few days just in case anyone noticed me getting in there or is suspicious when they log in and system is loaded but emptya few days later i log on cloak up quickly warp about and titan bridge the first person i see once weve ganked a ratter i warp off to deep safe and log off once my aggression is clear then i do the same thing again the next time im bored the only defence would be a 24 hour guard that can react to any attack of unknown size and composition within a minute or twowhilst i do hate the current state of afk cloaking and local intel i dont think the solution is going to be simple and i think it is intertwined with a much needed look at cyno mechanicscenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
i actually agree about the cynos ive suggested elsewhere that warp scrams and distributors have the added effect of blocking a ships ability to light a cyno beaconi also agree there are a lot of interconnected issues i linked in the op a thread in features and ideas that addressed more of these connected issues however the truth is the more complex a proposal the less attention it will get so it comes down to breaking them up into their respective parts and the first step in my view is dealing with local chats very negative impact on gameplay
i keep reading this over thinking that maybe im missing somethingbut i still dont like iti said id never lived in wh space i faught there fairly often besides thinking my view doesnt really count in some way because i live out of the space your proposing to change is a bit daft its like telling someone your going to change their hospital to work the way it does in zimbabwe and then telling them their objections are moot because they never worked in zimbabwealso my concerns in my original post were never really accounted for it is still already too easy to get people in their own space this is just going to make it easier i dont really understand why this has been proposed sure its a nifty idea and would be fun for a while but it doesnt really fix any problems it just creates new onesin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
any change to local needs to be coupled with power projection changes read cynos and cloaking changescurrently one of the reasons cloaking isnt completely unbalanced is because you still know someone is there
ive avoided suicide gank in highsec a few times with local info its already difficult enough to avoid suicide ganking i would rather it didnt get more difficultso no
lol you cant avoid a suicide gank by looking at local
yea you can and i have twice an insurgance of i shouldnt be in highsec reds is kind of a give away if your paying attention especially if a frig flew into you belt and cloaked up near you shortly before
if they are red in local it means they have a gcc meaning they have already ganked someone and cant do another until the gcc is over becuase of concord
i think hes refering to the sec flagscall it a hunchbut yeaheven the surge in population would be a bit of a telltale indicator stop the evemail spam
thank you

bad idea such as saving cloaky fags
updated op to include this as a pro
this does bring up a new problem with the system as it has been used when created by players getting payed has relied on trust if you create a contract that calculates peoples contribution to a project you would expect the mechanism for their getting payed to be inbuilt in the contract but doing that could end up being a huge programing problem ill have a think about whether there is any really simple ways of doing that hopefully now that ccp have their new system for estimating modship costs this will be more feasible in the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
ah another whine topic that can be summarized by waaaaaaaaaaaaa i do not want to make a choice i want it my wayseriously you choose to do things your way so accept your consequences and more people on the battle field analogy being more fun absurd since you ignore that the same would apply for the opposition too
took me a while to get back to thisyou completely missed my point by an entire country never mind the milethe point is not a matter of cost or you having to pay less or more for the privilagethe point is common sense in how you spend that iskyour blaming your frequency of expenses over your deaths in game over the fact the game is punnishing you with costyou know what it should be like thatperiod if you want to go blow yourself up recklessly for lols and grins then you damn well better make eachandeveryone counteve online is a game that requires tactical thinkingcommon senseplanningyou wana go recklessly forth and put your expensive brains in an high risk environment then you damn well better get used to the fact its gonna cost youive been told repeatedlydo not fly what you cant afford to losethat includes your clonenow as ive said before if youve been paying attention and actaully reading while flapping your gums in your little whine festim in favor of adjusting the costs personallybut im not going to support this because overall this is a balance mechanic that is needed to keep you super sp pilots in checkone would think your experince and practice would make you a better pilotnot a reckless oneyou can flame awaydont caredont give a but i will make sure you get my message loud and clear stop the evemail spam

the shares arent entirely useless like you said they can still be used to have activities shareholders and operate something like publicly traded companies but there has to be some sort of protection against scammers thats why i mentioned a vote option for everyone to agree on the revocation from an exmember by name otherwise people can join corps just to take part in the share distribution and then quit and reap the benefits remotely without any repercussionsmy whole plan for corporate profitsharing is derailed by the lack of control over shares too much control is a bad idea as well because of ceos with less than moral character perhaps selling the shares and then revoking them another reason why a vote might possibly be the best optionperhaps make two types of shares shares that remain within the corporation belonging only to its members and shares used for extracorporate activities like you mentionedi guess this issue might be too complicated for ccp to touch but if that is the case shares should be removed altogetherthe current state of social acceptance in the eve universe prevents trust and a lack of trust is what makes the shares useless

my ships not autospinning means the client consumes ever so slightly fewer system resources so no thanks
then just turn it off it a spinning will so dramaticly hit your ancient pc goddamit
or we could just not implement this silly pointless feature and associated options menue settings to begin with i really dont think it is even worth the few minutes you seem to think it would take ccp to put into place there is no discernable benefit i can see other than it pleasing your obscure sense of aesthetics pointless features shouldnt get even minutes of developer time and implementation just because you need a a reason for their existence andor b strong popular support for such a feature and by that i mean more than one person
but this has more meh per bit than the others
well i for one do miss the feature and cant understand why they ever removed it all the negative comments are from pp who are afraid of losing their rank for the most spins pthe csm xi election are now open until march 25th 2016 consider niko lorenzio for csm xi
for gods sake ccp base more of this game on reality and not only game mechanics i propose that moon mining be opened to high security space and than more than 1 station be allowed to be anchored at each moon moon mining is way too elitest right now and needs to be deregulatedby restricting it to low security space you gave the outlaws an advantage as if they really deserve it they have their moons now give us ours and stop herding us to our deaths power to the people

i too would like to remove the biggest conflict driver in the gameyou highsec idiots really need to actually live in nullsec before you scream and demand it be changed to benefit you personally
this
this is not at all about not paying attention its more like micro management as katrina said before some of us just like to do that but i guess am the only one in the whole eve universe
if you leftclick on the active launcher it will deactivate it do this after ten missiles have been launchedhope this helps
yes most of us are actually paying some attention when our ship is in combat and paying attention to ammo
i use the ancient art of counting works every time
just switch to lasers best weapon in the game the csm xi election are now open until march 25th 2016 consider niko lorenzio for csm xi
lets just call the wasted ammo an isk sink and move on with our day shall we
how does it work
something like this i believe it appears to be an unreliable concept however
and that is exactly why we need what i have proposed i rest my case
a bit of an overkill suggestion for something that would require just some simple changes to the way you run your plexessplit your launchers set autorepeat off and f1f to your hearts content if you are that concerned about wasting some missiles
it would be a good start
the new microjump drive may change since it was announced in or before march 2012this device is awesome but kind of does the same as warping and so theyre likely to change ithow can they change the new mjdhave it incorporated as a recalibrationextension into specific specialized ships and so where all ships have a warp drive capability the specialized types have an inbuilt tactical warpwhat would mjd change into thena device for smugglers and scouts in the futuremjd would allow jumping into adjacent solarsystem randon locationthough can be fishnetted by a cynosural field fixed location magnetized  trappedafterburn awesome module capacitor warp drive every ship as it inbuilt tactical warp specific specialized ships inbuilt jump drive capital ships have this inbuilt fuelled microjump drive condensed variation allowing for jump without a cyno present module charges jump bridge fleet portal module fuelled changed microwarp drive changed to tactical warp and not a module
and we would want that why

yes that is much easier and completely minimizes my personal riskpretty much from my perspective im having a difficult time finding a downside to thata value judgment grow up kid im not a pvper and i like the idea of mechanics that minimize my risk in the gameplay in high sec if i want something different i can leave high sec this doesnt make me better or worse than anyone it just makes me someone who plays differently than you and has different priorities youll discover as you get older that you cant generalize people so stupidly
yup 
remove local think about the server resources that could be saved
no add to afk tag to local or kick afk players from game that could be save server resources
interisting afk tag ideaalso removing local means more player created channels with more dynamic populations not a server load saving device
i would like to see some data supporting your claim
no that solves nothing an afk tag would just be removed with a simple little macro and disconnecting people would  boosters scouts miners traders freighter pilots and anyone involved in nullsec fights over royally for absolutely no reason
this is why i play eve moar tears i love it ccp loooooovvveeeddd the attention burn jita ad hulkageddon got i doubt youll see writeups on mmorpg news websites about a universe wide mining op or mission op so what if your friends or you put off buying plexes for isk there are loads of pvpers who buy plexes to fund their terrible habit if everyone stops buying plex prices are just going to go up and people will start buying again human beings are greedy you want to be safe go play another mmorpg or something there are many out there where you dont have to fight to change something that is incredibly unbalanced towards nullseccers sure there are loads more of people in highsec but have you asked yourself how many of them have a character in lowsec or null
i am one of the biggest carebears but i dont condone ideas that turn eve into a kiddy game however my idea to combat hulkageddon would be simply 1no concord protection to players with negative security status period2no security loss for killing a player with negative security status3suicide ganking removes players concord protection for 24 hoursthese changes do not make eve carebear friendly but rather encourage vigilante pvp and allow more pew pew in highsec if ccp doesnt protect the miners properly than they should not protect gankers in high sec let us kill them fair and square if there is a small frigate following our barges let them feel the wrath of our drones if there is a destroyer bearing down on a badger shoot it the problem isnt the grefiers it is concord not letting people preemptively defend themselves additionally electronic warfare in self defense should not lock you out of a station only firing weapons should do thatalso hulkbuffer tankjamming and scrambling equiptment cloaked friends  fun fun fun
ships do have roles you know you dont see a combat ship being able to outmine a mining barge right because of that you wont see a mining ships out dpsing a combat ship you want to mine afk be prepared to lose your ship otherwise align to a safe spot or something when mining and prepare to hit warp whenever someone comes in carebearing in nullsec isnt meant to be as profitable as low or null
this was a module i thought of a while ago and it looks good on paper however the issue i ran into was how to balance it so here is my idea this module is a low power fitting that is similar in nature to the expanded cargo hold i will leave the fitting requirements to ccp to calculate but i would suggest electronic warfare vsignal suppression isignal dispersion ithis module will install active sensor jamming equipment in your cargo hold preventing players and npc customs officials from scanning your cargo the drawback will be a reduction in total cargo space as well as armor additionally because of the active signal jamming coming from the cargo hold the ship will suffer penalties to targeting as if it were being sensor dampened the main benefit of this is that pirates and potential suicide gankers wont be able to calculate the exact value of your cargothe main drawback of this is that now pirates and suicide gankers know you have something to hide additionally this unit will draw agro from customs officials to any player with a 00 or lower security ratingso in the long run it may make enemies a bit more wary before popping your ship in highsec but on the other hand it may make you a more attractive target if your flying a cheaper ship that is easy to destroy

bumble sends his regards and thanks for all of the support thus far keep the comments coming
bit late to the fray with this but why do you say that what would you replace them with
there is a simple way to alleviate that players are not forced to accept the contract they could just see what the vaule of the ore they are mining is and decide for themselves whether they wish to accept the current priceie make the contract show what the unit price is set at for each ore then its far less coding p
the costs for clones are ridiculously high when they can get to be the same cost as a ship or greater including bcsdoes seem a bit odd regardless of fairness or aversion to loss it seems kind of weirdmore of a loss should be the ship itself
my point exactly good to see that everyone on these forums are able to readas to the whining acusations im not whining i am claiming that this mechaninc serves no purpose other than being annoying and sinking isk it also gives people more reason to use more alts that imo is a bad thing as i said earlier in a small ship my 120million sp clone is no better than a 6month spec trained alt so why should i have to pay 3040million isk for my clone just because i wanna be an interdictorinterceptor pilot in fleet something that in many situations almost guarantee you to die at least in the dictor or is people of the opinion that fleet dictor pilots should be alts that have cheap clonesits not that im going buhu change this or i will stop playing the game its more like hey ccp i feel that this mechaninc serves very little purpose and is pretty annoying please change this so i can have more fun in the game without impacting the general economyi am still waiting to hear a viable argument as to why this is a good or balanced mechanic and should stay as it is
really because im waiting for the opposite you havent provided a good enough reason yet
easy to understand you problem this is just an unlogic isk sink from ccpthey want to more peoples for pvp but the clone prices too high and so many players dont want to risk themthey want to lure more pilots to 00 but risk of expensive clones not help for thismy opinionin the 00 station the ship repairing is free create same type for clone facilities there toonot at high or low sec just in 00
not supporteddying should have negative reprocussions if your worried about how much isk you lose then be more careful in pvp people often call me over cautious in pvp but i prefer it that way if i get only 15 kills in a week but lose no ships i get a much greater sence of achievement out of that if your more gunho about pvp then you pay for it and thats the way it should bejust be more cautious problem solvedin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
how about you learn to read but ill list them as well as provide a couple more game has enough isk sinks limits my ability to pod myself to different locations when im in an unimplanted clone because im not a rich player even though i have alot of skillpoints for the same reason makes me more likely to fly ships that have a better survivability rate than say dictors and ceptors assfrigs and other stuff that are likely to die in bubbles these clones are litteraly more expensive than alot of shiptypes in the game there is more or less no drawbacks to changing this other than mabye the ability to move huge amount of players from one side of space to another but then again these people would all need to be in unimplanted clones for not to loose much and you can still do this pretty cheap in low sp alts i feel the mechanic is punishing people that focus training on one character instead of using alot of alts for different purposes see my post above about my skill distrubution the survivability of a clone is extremely low when popped in a bubble and the pricetag punishment is unreasonable imoso i ask again is there any reason as to why these prices should stay as they are other than eve should be hard because im all for that i like that eve is punishing and hard but i dont feel like i get my moneys worth for 30million when all i get is to keep my skillpoints if i die then again 30mill clones could get a built in interdictor nullifier d that would make it worth 30mill that was sarcasm in case anybody didnt get that
dying will still have dire consequences even if they remove this perticular nonsense pricetag i totaly agree with you on what you are saying i just dont feel that the clone per se has any reason to be this expensive you already loose your ship fittings and your implants if you get podded im talking about the isk cost of skill clonesif you feel this is ok mabye we should just raise the prices on lower clones so people are more carefull since after a certain amount of sp there is no longer a corealtion between the amount of sp you have and the amount of isk you can makeedit also i wouldnt get any more gung ho about pvp since as i said i loose both ship and fittings implants all it would do is make me able to fly dictors in fleets without having to pay 30million extra each time i die
let us know how that works out for you since your refusing to read stop the evemail spam
ehm i answered your so called argument and if you didnt get what i was saying the 30mill is not gonna make me any more reckless im still gonna loose my implantsplayer generated and shipfittingsplayer generated im just not gonna put 30mill into a pointless sink and i will have more flexibility when it comes to what i can fly and where i fly if i dont have implants without having to put those 30 mill into the sink ie dictor in fleet battles if people get more reckless on the account of those 30mill they are just plain dumbso yeah i read your argumentclaim i just dont evaluate it as viable since it is illogical from my point of view it could be that i am wrong though i cant predict how players behave people might start using suicide rookie ships to have more or less no loss in 00 battles it possible eve is full of dumb people apparently
we call that selective reading loss or sheer dumb ignorancego reread my posts again and maybe youll see the very small point you continue to ignore stop the evemail spam
i reread all your posts drake draconis and i still dont se any point you make that i havent already adresseddo i need to explain this again if this is the reason why then they should definitley fix it as ive said several times i dont mind payikng for player built stuff but i hate isk sinks is your reasoning that since a high sp char knows how to make isk fast they should be taxed every time they loose a clone clones have no real value other than keeping skillpoints witch is more or less what i pay my monthly fee to get and they want me to pay isk to keep them if i dont want to stay in empire and mine veldsparyour drivinggas analogy is so meaningless im not even going to adress itok it may be that since im not native english i have a problem getting what you mean here but if im reading this right my answer is why should it be a privilage for me to keep my skillpoints if i get podded why do i need to pay 30  million isk to not loose 23 months of training as far as i can see you claim that high sp  lots of isk and that is simply an assumption that i think is wrong and if its right those that have alot of isk dont care for the 30 mill and people like me that dont have alot of isk suffer the penaltieswhat when did i do this i never said i liked dieing recklessly my efficiency is 985 on the killboard i do however hate using 30mill on the god damn sp clone the times i die and yeas i would like to be able to podjump more when im in unimplanted clonesi am i am paying for the ships and all of the fittings and i do it with a smile because i know a happy player somewhere is gonna log in and see i bought new stuff from him i do not however like paying 30mill to ccp to be able to keep my skillpoints witch i  paid hard cash forive also adressed this if you didnt read it ill repeat it my so called super sp clone has about 10 effective sp in a dictor so why exactly does it need to be kept in check shouldnt i at least be rewared with the versatlity of fleetpositions i am able to fly when i have put that much training towards that goal without having to pay 30mill if i get podded in a bubbledid i miss anything if so feel free to be more clear about exactly what you argumen is
 no it doesnt hence the inflation were seeingthis is working as intended we have jump clones and the delay they involve for a reasonthats your problem not a problem with game mechanics so whatyou dont think its a drawback to allow me to instantly move across the galaxy several times a day you dont understand power projection do youthats how you feel i feel that you are wrong if you have that many skillpoints you can make that much isk very quickly thats called a consequence eve has those stop trying to remove them
1 valid point though im not certain lack of sinks is the reason im willing to accept your argument remember they just had a mass kick of botters and removed the drone materials thats a huge impact on mineral prices hence the price bump in ship costs so its not certain that its a lack of isk sinks best isk sink is ships destroyed and we all want more of that2 jump clones protect implants pod jumping dont so some limitation would still be in place im also not asking for removal of the isk price of clones merly reduce at least the high price ones aggreed that my original suggestion of 110 might be a bit much3 yes its my problem and its caused by this game mechanic witch i want to change4 its silly that you clone that only protect you skillpoints cost more than the ship i was flying when i died but yeah thats only my subjective oppinion as everything about the game is5 well yeah mabye it would you can still do this with pretty cheap clones on low sp alts anyway and there is no problem for an alliance to have a certified alt that can fly a full fledged drake or something and have clones around the galaxy for a million or three a pod they do however not do this probably because people like to use implants and those are not protected when podding6 there is very little isksp ratio when you get above a certain point in sp if you have a little bit of focus in training that cloneprice would probably amount to about 48mill say if you rat it would probably take you about an hour to pay for your clone and yeah i feel that is a bit over the edge7 i know and as stated above that is what i love about the game though tbh my limit is at my skillpoints since there is no other way of getting them back then to pay and skill for months the shipfittingimplants is enough its enough hastle to get the isk back from those lossesill agree mabye 110th is a bit over the edge 13 might be enough to cut the prices or even just making the highest clones cheaper the ladder is a bit steep imo
1 ships destroyed isnt an isk sink its a faucet it removes minerals from the game sure but the isk you spent on the ship goes off to another player and you get given insurance money from nowhere for it isk sinks pull isk out of circulation entirely2 i dont know about you but i tend to run with only 3s out in 00 they dont cost much to replace youd stop people with slave sets and things from jumping sure but not anyone else i do it a fair amount though ill admit my clones are only 7mil a pop at the moment3 its your perception thats the problem not the game mechanic if my clones only cost as much as a rifter id be exploding all over the show4 see above clone costs and ship costs are not and should not be tied together5 i see people do it fairly frequently ive done it myself a lot too it happens already why make it easier6 fair point but if it takes you an hour of ratting to make enough to buy an 8 mil clone something is wrong 7 its your call the pricetag or your sp
it takes very little time for me to make 30mil iskwtf is your problem again opedit and no dont ask me howbecause if you have to askthen you have literally no business being here asking for such stupid requests your likely going to get laughed out on your ass stop the evemail spam

1 great idea
for to have shares to be really useful you need safe market for it that means ccp needs to create normal stock market same as real life ones are it can be region based for example only corps with hqs in region can be traded there the same way as market is shares then can be put there as any other stuff from that point on it makes sense to create company try to sell its shares to obtain money for corporate stuff pos bpos etc and make profit and pay dividends and trade shares as any other stuff i e buy sell buyback with company money there must be know how many shares corp has and how many are public and for sure corporate button with option shares areare not tradable it opens really big possibilities of scamming for example as possibilities of more nice behavior like helping newbies with some hope getting your money back and much moremaybe separate market is not needed so much maybe there is the way how to put stock to normal market when stock takes form of physical paper
i see now that there is no one standing up for the miners and industrialist are any of the csms truly minersindustrialist or is ccp truly just want everyone to pvp we have several avenues we can take in this game combat pirate traders miners industrialist etc however it seems now there is a push for everyone to become pvpers whether or not you want to be onei enjoy the peace of mining and making things to put on the market that in itself is fun for me and im sure there are many like me in the eve universe that wish not to pvp but play the market and build an industrial empire to provide for others it is a challenge and different than what i do in rl mining and building stuff is something that doesnt require my full attention at all times like pvp requiresthat is the best part of the game the complexity and different avenues you can take however once again ccp seems to want everyone to be pvpersexamplesexhumers are like paper kites and burn up in the matter of seconds by small ships with bb guns you think ore in their wisdom and experience in building ships would have made exhumers stronger knowing that space is a dangerous place even in high sechigh sec is the new low sec disposable ships that pvpers wouldnt use in low sec are being used in high sec to destroy high isk ships really that makes no sense but of course they get penalized for it yea right sure let concord destroy their ship then how about a 25 mil fine for any ship destroyed and 50 mil fine for any pod destroyed that sounds better then loose dogs running the streets when crimes are committed in high sec criminals should be penalized with a heavier hand and now after getting standings for good rd agents you have to become a pvp pilot in a faction war you want no part of  to get decent number of datacores for research that makes no sense their pvpers give them more ships weapons and ammo so they can go back out there and do more pvp because that is what they want give them datacores makes no sense how about leaving the datacore stuff alone dont fix what isnt broke i really dont understand ccps position on thischarging fees for pi and now datacores ok 10000 fee is not real bad but pi fees are not worth itand how about fixing pi hot spots of ore on planets are like weather patterns it quickly disappears in a matter of a day should be a slower process like weeksetchow about addressing the miners and industrialist concerns for once
there are multiple threads about hulk hp in fid right now go read thosepi is working as intended if you dont like the fees build your own poco in lownull if you dont like highsec hotspots dying off do your pi in lownull market pvp is still pvpim assuming by 25m you actually mean isk not dollars this is a terrible idea and wont stop anyone since people will just put their money on an alt when they go gankingin short come out of your highsec bubble and stop trying to get the game changed to suit you personally
i agree with the sentiment but not with any of your ideas or proposed changes please think about your ideas more thouroughly before posting
dont forget the incredible turn around when ccp made the it so that you couldnt warp away after ganking someone in highsec that is an incredible plus point to you already how about the insurance buff removing insurance payout when you get concorded is that not enough why not suggest an invulnerability mod or a shield extender that gives you over 9000 shield hit points youre not meant to be making so much isk in highsec without any risk take incursion for an example it is relatively safe but if someone fucks up thats a shiny ship gone you dont want to pvp fair enough but it is like in real life you pay attention to what youre doing you just dont walk around thinking of something that would get you hurt
im an industiralist and even im insulted by your driveling crying whining stupiditygo away and stop embarassing us you have no understanding how this game works and you obviously do not belong herepost with your main coward stop the evemailUFFFDspam

scouts is afk  or just the afk cloakers is afk who dont do it anything until 30 minutes dont play we know many players why want to remove local because they are just horrible cloaking fags and want an iwin button no way
talk to a wormhole guy about how long it takes them to scout out a hostile systemand what about boosters miners traders freighter pilots and anyone involved in nullsec fights i see you picked up one one of the six example groups of people your change would affect there are several others as well and flat out ignored the rest
and talk 00 guys about how can secure 147 systems same time without local when a cloakers cant catcheable because he got huge advantages from cloak and not scaneablewhat abot you talking what involved in null sec fight  the afk players is involved from fight  i think who is afk wont be fightingand other thing why can terrorizing an afk cloaker without play a players who want to play everyone is know this is the problem with afk cloakers not the afk cloakingremove local just more huge advantages to cloaker fags

words of troll
did you know under heavy tidi you can spend over 30 minutes in warp across a very large systemnot afk but not doing anything eitherdid you know its not uncommon for one dude to run 34 scouts in various systems making sure they remain clear and lighting a cyno eventually they dont touch that client til its needed either and that can take longer than 30 minutesdid you know that such a limitation is very easily circumvented by a macro that pushes the space bar once every 5 minutes or even thisedit and because of the distributed processing nature of the eve server game wide server load isnt something you need ever be concerned about only system wide
30 minutes a long warp with tidi maybe i playing with other game like you i warped many times in 10 tidi but the longest one never was 810 minutes longdid you know easy to create a macrofilter which is check the client which is push space every 5 minutes  do you heard abot ccp rules which is not enable afk macros  do you heard about banhammer  risk with macro and you will be banneddo you know cyno time is 10 minute and not 30  do you know u dont need to wait 30 minutes on station for cyno and you can log off 
way to not understand my point it will not help stop macros because a macro already beats it by definitionthe cynoscouts dont sit there with a cyno open in a system that is not being attacked yet just watching while cloaked usually with multiple windows he just tabs through while running a main in a fleetthis means that people who are breaking the rules will be immune to an afk time out stopping them and people who are legitimately playing the game using sit and wait strategies or just stuck in a very long operationever put up a pos will be hurtedit snip we both seem to be trying to point out that an afk timer would be useless and that removing local does help anything either however all you are doing to try and accomplish this is flailing around attacking everything you see please try to understand the posts you attack so you dont inadvertently undermine your own positionedit insult removedisd eshtir
no one sit on local at least 30 without any movement if playing moving mouse check pilot infos chat on corp or other chat etc so im an idiot what you could to say thats was your best argument insult others when someone have other theoryall right i think lets see what would be say zagdul for this troll answer time to move your stuffz from fa stations

carebears can mine in nullsec  btw how many carebears does it take to change a hulks headlights5one to scout the beltone to gank his alt and preload concord in the areaone to change the light bulbone to cry when the hulk he just repaired gets gankedand one to file the petition and rant on the forums about the incident
the battleship i referred to costs 120 million isk and gets a decent chunk of that back if lost a hulk costs 300 million isk and gets less than what it costs to buy a cruiser back if lostcomparing size is irrelevant you need to look at value bottom line most of the mining ships are complete crap but ccp has not fixed them they made more and more shiny  battleshipgunsoncruisers type ships which is very much in keeping with the world of warcraft design philosophy that when you cant think of anything genuine to add to the game just add new armour and weapons with higher numbers and call it contentthats the point dumb ass removing suicide ganking in highsec is what is next bored vets kicking newbies around hurts ccps bottom line guess what they want all the dust kiddies to come play and stay the time to think about how to protect those players with appropriate balance is right now because where things stand i can see concord appearing but not firing instantly when a blue player is locked rather than after a blue player is fired on or a simple popup you cannot attack that target dont like my ideas give up better ones because the simplest is to make nonconsentual pvp in 10 to 08 systems simply not possible thats not what i am advocating for but as correctly posted by shah it is the natural endpoint of the repeated changes to concord which have failed to achieve thier purpose
dear idiotthe nex store is for carebearsgriefing makes carebears leave you cant grief pvpers who live in battlehardened alliances they just call it pvp and return the favour with interestccp wants plex to be used on clothing because you are right plex is essentially morgaging future income if plex builds up in the game and it seems to be piling up on the market then at some point ccp may have to run the game with no actual us income unless they can keep pulling in new players who buy plex for real moneyplex is wonderful until you have to pay staff salaries and advertising costs then you need real money and if they do not retain their new player base who pay with a credit card then all the vets with stacks of plex are not going to help them one little bit
what is there to fix a mining barge mines that is what it is designed to do its not a combat ship it is not designed to kill or defend itself effectively the same argument can be made in reverse a thorax is a combat ship it is designed to kill other ships it is not designed to mine or haul stuff effectivelyand cost is not a reliable measurement of power just because something costs a lot of isk it doesnt necessarily mean it is better example 1 there are quite a few officergrade mods that cost billions of isk yet are no better statwise than some deadspacextype mods that are worth a couple hundred millionexample 2 i am flying around in my sniper tornado worth about 100 mil i get tackled by a velator worth well almost nothing you get it for free at stations you have no ships in i will die against this noobship because my rather large teir 3 battlecruiser is not designed to kill it at close range example 3 a fullyfit ratting carrier is worth about 15 to 16 billion isk it is very possible for 15 stealth bombers each worth 2025 mil isk apiece to gank said carrier in about a minuteif i understand you correctly example 1 is broken because something is expensive for no reason and example 2 and 3 should not happen because the more expensive ship was taken down by ships worth mere pennies to it honestly i find these as some of the greatest perks of the game cost and size are not reliable metrics of power and ability and yet eve has been more or less growing consistently for the last 9 years with these mechanics in place slowly but consistentlyalso how do you define newbies because to me hulk pilots are not newbies it takes 2 to 3 months to get into one and by that time you should be well versed in quite a few of the mechanics that govern eve you are aware that the dust players you are opposing during a match can shoot at you using a giant cannon of death and destruction right the same thing we can do to them balance so how are you supposed to engage a neutral in a npc corp that is supporting your enemys war effort against your corp and what purpose is that protect you are aware that since it was buffed and buffed again 3 or 4 years ago concord hasnt really changed at all and there have been no hints or gestures from ccp that concord is going to be buffed again at least not anytime soonbased on this circumstantial evidence its a fair guess that ccp is more or less happy with concord as they are now sure they need some tweaks every so often as there will always be a loophole that no one thought of before but nonconsensual pvp has always been one of the cornerstones of eves ethos and remains to this day one of the things that prevents true safety in eve which is a good thingplus the tools that people can use to try and kill you are also at your disposal and can be used to avoid getting killedeve is an eternal game of cat and mouse andor spy vs spy it is the reason many of us came here it is the reason many of us stay and i hope is stays this way for a long time to come otherwise eve wont be special
hi its come to my attention that you have no idea what youre talking aboutplex can only be created through the expenditure of real money every plex on the market is cash in the bank for ccp
you dont think do you there are people who play this game for fun people who unsub because of the buffs ccp gives to highseccers ccp makes a certain area pvpfree its probably going to kill a few accounts as well sand box game thats just like real life you dont see a gunfree zone you can bring a gun into a shopping mall and start shooting at people you just get blown up by police or something after same thing in eve
qft
 thisalso i do have some changes to help your cause first suiciding gankers recieve higher sec status hits and when theyre sec status is low enough that they can be shot at in highsec or during their gcc their pod should be destroyable by other players without penalty simple solution aso for people can flipping just make the popup that comes up telling you that they will be able to shoot at you if you take stuff from that can clearerin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

would removing the overview improve eve at all is too much information displayed into it is the overview relied on too muchmaybe it would make battles more interesting and pilots would have to use their brains a little more rather than listening to a commander barking orders that they shoot pilots whose name begins with a or z ships icons and names would still appear on the hud along with things like warp disruption bubbles etcit would make visual confirmation more of a feature in eve battlesi think what tactics would be used without an overview plus it would increase the space on screen without any visual overview combat would be more measured i think and careful might make eve a better place even for players who like shooting npcs or mining rocks
no it would not it would make doing even the most simple of things much more of a headache and it wouldnt make anything better at all if you want to try out playing without the overview try minimizing it for a week and see if the game is better without it also called targets will always be around thats just how a coordinated effort works but if all the fcs youve flown with simply call targets by names youre either a flying with giant singleship fleets against similar singleship fleets who are just duking it out b just flying a simple dps ship who is along for the ride and doesnt want anything more complicated c flying with a bad fc d two or more of the above
try locking on to a frigate or a drone orbiting you at top speed like thator playing with your brackets off or getting any kind of visual confirmation of anything when there are a thousand ships on the field
im glad someone other than me has thought of such an idea i always did wonder why there are even warp speed rigs if they didnt do a useful damn thing
i think theres a real disconnect between some of our experiences because when i lived in sov null space so long as i watched local and stayed in my own alliances space there really was no risk of hostiles getting me as brand new player living out there i didnt watch local and intel chanels and got killed but the mistake wasnt repeated i just dont think the occasional newbie the really dumb and the afk getting killed constitutes it being easy to get people in their own spaceeven with my system suggested youre unlikely to get jumped unknowingly by anything larger than a cruiser while staying in your alliance controlled space and thats with no one watching gates the goal isnt to deny players any form of intel its to make them have to actively pursue that intel
add to thatyou folks who are paranoid of thistalk to the whs dwellers because they well tell you up front that its a 2 way streetthey have just as much risk as you do stop the evemail spam
this thread is awesome
rats like to chill out in belts right now and thats cool and all it is sometimes fun to shoot rats who are waiting to get shot i get that but maybe if we make them more interesting itll be more fun for the gamewere talking null sec here no security why would a bunch of ruthless pirates just sit around chilling when they could be wrecking people all im asking for is some changes to make pirates act a bit more interesting1 small roaming pirate gangs they travel from system to system checking out belts and when they find something they tackle and kill it defense fleets can form up to destroy them and itll also kill bots who doesnt love it when a bot dies2 mining ops pirates need to mine too i guess have them have mining ops complete with defense fleets after a certain amount of mining done they all warp off it gives roaming gangs something to kill when they cant find any players and can probably be lucrative youve already got hauler spawns  maybe there should be a reason those haulers are chilling out in a belt3 let rats in the belts warp to fights that are happening in their system theyre pirates pirates love blowing things up right4 give most frigate and cruiser rats the ability to tackle this is something that some rats already have but not all it is another thing thatll kill bots and itll also give roaming gangs the player kind chances to kill players who arent catching on to the tackling thing such as botsplease ccp think of the npcs they deserve to have fun too the worst that happens is a ton of bots die the best that happens is pve in 00 becomes more entertaining and bots die

excellent idea waste time with stupid suggestions for stuff that noone but you wantnot supported

ahahahahahah what is this stupidity gb2 hisecnot supported
310would support again
a decent idea has its flaws and its definitely not the first thing i would want changed with the game but i wouldnt actually mind if this happenedat all
personally would make all rats tank and fight like sleepers
this is a good idea  i think they should also sneak in to salvage during fights
 you easily make 30 mil  in a good l4 run i dont really see how clones are that expensive
its not about making the 3040mill its about i want to use those 3040 mill on player produced items such as ships and better mods
and when you go to 00 home defense battles many times and you lost your pod 10 times within 3 days i think you should be crying like a little girl because of the very expensive clones
the easiest way to avoid this is once you are certain your ship is gone choose an escape location once your ship is destroyed warp to that location as quickly as possible before your capsule and yourself is horribly murdered
consider setting up a separate server just like singularity but without markets and without iski honestly dont need that level of complexity in a video game i just want to fly ships and pvp against other players tournament style like unreal wolfenstein etc i hate grinding missions  trading salvaging and all the other useless activities just so i can pvpi could care less about isk and all the other useless game mechanics for eve online like titans pos mining salvaging carriers etc etcmake a casual version of eve online with a gladiatorial feel nothing but combat 247make a payable subscription based lite edition of eve online for the casual gamer remove the bloat trim the fat and make eve fun on this server there is no isk you can fly any ship you want fit any module you wish no titans no carriers no bullcrap just t1 t2 t3 and faction ships people could try combinations play with fittings sandbox style and not be bogged down by isk management which honestly i have no time for anywayi would happily buy plex and play on a server just like singularity as a casual gamer when my subscription ends or i quit all my ships and ammo and loot etc are returned on this server there is no ownership of goods only a ranking system for top gun like playersmake a pure pvp server just tournament style fights with stats and a ranking system corps would still exist but activities like mining salvaging exploration etc etc etc would not be on this serverthe subscription and skill system would work the same way as tq except skill books would be free well paid for with a subscription fee
there are plenty of games that offer a quick pvp fix that require little or no thoughthowever if you want to play eve online as youve described may i suggest the sisi server on the test server you can fly any ship that youre able to fly in game all modules are 100 isk all ships are 100 isk and theres nearly always a fightthe very essence of eve online is in its complexity and its skill point fairness if you want to fly a titan you have to put in the timelets just say you were indeed willing to purchase a titan for good old hard cash would you be willing to pay 5000 just for fun and just as willing to lose it if you goofed and jumped your carrier into the wrong system and oops lost 3000 would it bother youeve has consequences and thats what makes it a good pvp worldfor the record a number of pvp alliances offer free frigates and the like to membersfinally ccp knows that if they set up a tourney ladder for pvp folks that didnt require any work the whole system would collapse into empty space it functions as it does because the 1015 of the population who pvp drive the economysimon
a just go to sisib dont crosspostc get over itif you cant handle the depth of eve then maybe its not the game for you but the market is an integral part of eve and is what makes pvp mean something i also laughed at you trying to suggest that you limit the ships that would be used and still call it a sandbox you should learn that pvp isnt about combat that you think is fair its about trying to win however you can
sotake one of eves main selling points the single shard world and smash it into tiny pieces to suit you personally
allow me to direct you to hello kitty online for your playing pleasuresee you laterhave a nice lifewe expect you to be turning over your stuffbecause eve online is not the game for youso long farewell buh bye o7 stop the evemail spam
welcome to not eve get out foo
there are rules for sisi as well so you can get the 1v1 10v10 fights that you maymaynot want because everythign costs 100 isk all you need is one or two missions on tq to afford anything you want on sisi just make sure you do it before they mirror the servers even then blow up a battleship or two and the insurance payout is enough to fit a hundred shipslog in to tq long enough to train skills and go back to sisi seems liek the perfect place for you and you get to beta test everything for ccp too
the torp raven battleship is at least marginally effective its not used much but missile flight time isnt a major problemthe cruise missile battleship is a waste of minerals currentlywouldnt it be interesting if battleship cruise missiles were instead effectively a guided bomb launcher once a ship was targeted and the guided bomb was released it would burn toward the target llike it currently does until impact where it would explode as an area of effect like a bomb currently does obviously the damage would have to updated due to effective range and the sheer number of missilesin battle currently the bomb is the only splash damage weapon a guided bomb from range would have the effect of long range artillery currently used in the military it would also provide a real role for fof and defender missiles which arent currently usedcrazy i know but it would make for a very pretty screen shotand of the honor harrington fans how about a multistage cruise missiles
so  you want to make cruise missiles unusable in highsec because you just know that the instant that they implemented this someone would take a probing frigate and go and fly over next to the rats youre trying to kill in any mission
cruise missilespeople still use those stop the evemail spam
for pvp suggestion guided cruise missile based bomb ammo type only usable in null secfor pve cruise missiles work fine i believeas ships and ammunition are being rebalanced the caldari missile boats effectively have only one range short in pvp this is particularily true in the battleship class at maximum range of 250km it takes almost a minute for the missile to arriveyes railguns provide the instant damage if so equippedguided cruise missile bombs  these would provide a long wait for a fair amount of splash damage and would be useful in fleets for a host of reasonsstealth bombers are useful and interesting but rather than a suprise ninja attack in this case youd have a battleship providing bombardment from range the battleship so equipped would be pretty vulnerable to small tackle but if implemented correctly would be pretty useful in softening up fleets small ships would simply outrun the missiles which have a fixed burn time
cruise missile by definition is a long ranged missilesomething no one really uses for the simple fact that most engaegments are inyourface and mid to close rangethats why they dont get much if at all action in nullsecwhile your idea is greatall your really pushing for in reallity is a battleship grade space bomblikely wont happenspash damge wise you should look to smart bombs for thatgranted its close range butwell you cant get around the commonality of tactics these daysill admit i do like the conceptbut its just not feasible due to sheer human habbit stop the evemail spam
large alpha fleets use maelstromsbrawling fleets use abaddonsgallente  a little love recently the addition of the t3 flyweight battlecruisers has lead to more sniping fleets but with battleship size gunsand yep a long range bomb platform that isnt stealthy would be fun countering it would also be fun
truebut like i saidyour talking about an item typically used for engagements at 150 to 200km there aboutsmost engagements are within 100k or lower at bestour own alpha fits are pretty mid ranged are they notnot saying its a bad ideajust hard to kick the habbit  stop the evemail spam
seems like youd see a lot more micro fleet warping then you already do within the battlefield change of positions 100150 km position changes which would make such a weapon noninstant damage missile weapons fairly useless
perhapsthere are instances where we know a fleet is going to be fighting from a fairly fixed position defending a sbu pos ihub station these remain the viable perches for stealth bomber fleets similarily they could be useful targets at a distance for a ranged area of effect battleship group it would simply be a different platform at longer rangea good stealth bomber fc working with covops can get a fleet into position on an aligned alpha fleet as well this can be challenging because the bombs have fixed performance and once shot move in a simple manner and detonatea good interceptor pilot and we need more of those can get to a position alongside and out of range warp the guided missile bomb ships to a position target and launch some salvos and then reposition i presume the battleship would have to stay on grid to provided targeting guidance for the missiles time on target this would be a different mechanic than a stealth bomber whos trying to get off grid and recloak note that if a fleet changed direction the target bomb would follow their movment until they ran out of gas time or range they would explode on contact rather than at a random point in space a guided bomb would be a targeted bomb with an area of effect you could warp off and avoid the bomb you could fire counter battery fire defender missiles you could outrun them and you could out tank themregarding ships entering a pos currently missiles launched on a targeted ship will enter the pos along with the ship this could be very fun or it could be restricted i can hear the fc now do not enter the pos ships enters the pos what the hell as the bombs detonate alright so one more fun idea out there on the table
not being a cruise missile user myself or much of any missiles for that matter do cruise missiles continue to track you if you warp within the same grid i would have though not so the consistent changing of position when you have an obvious fleet of such cruise bomb battleships out there seems like the same pattern that you tend to get with stealthbomber groups jsut with less chance of a shot landing its only because of how missiles work with flight time that i cant really see them being viable at long ranges
precisely cruise missiles are generally useless for fleets in pvp i believe an area of effect detonation would make them greatly more useful for pvp the reasons stated
missiles do not and will not track if the ship goes to warpno different than any other weaponexception to that is a splash damage area effectif you happen to be on grid prior to going to warpyou will get hit by a space bomb or smart bomb blast this i can atest to personaly so its a question of timingcruise missiles are slowand while great for very long range hitsjust arent rational in most combat areans stop the evemail spam
id personally like to see something like warp bombs that act like probes except when they reach the area you send them as soon as they drop out of warp they explode like normal bombs p real space artilleryi could imagine stealth bombers heavy bombers and maybe a battleship sized vessel with multiple bomb high slots being used they could in fact be tech 2 bombs
although i may need to have a more careful think through of the consequences of such a change i have to say i really like this idea in the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

if you let sheep multiply without wolves to manage the population then you damage the ecosystem
perhaps you could consider using less exclamation marks and less capitalized words and perhaps a little more coherency i cant understand what you are saying but i think its a rant about highsec ganking
if you have too many wolves and not enough sheep you get non stop complaints to ccp begging to force what little sheep are left into lownullsec and bring the easy dinner to them waves of threads demanding the removal of level 4s from high sec removal of incursions from highsec removal of concord from highsec removal of all production from highsec remake all highsec into lownullsec and so on and so forthi have to side with the op a little there is a substantial playerbase that want nothing to do with game politics and soverenity and pvp they just want to log in for an hour shoot some rocks refine some ore make a little money and log off sure theyre missing a lot of the game but for them this is enough internet spaceship they want i do agree with the op on one point and that is the survivability of exumers when a cheap 1mil ship can swing by and murder a 300 mil ship with little to no consequences or loss thats a problem its like taking a pos car an intentionally going around smashing into ultra expensive luxury cars and receiving no penalty for it except the loss of your pos and a slap on the wrist by policeexumers need a buff in hp and their insurance payouts need to better reflect the true cost of the ship in todays marketsummary of eves last four expansions

forget factories everything takes too many clicks the entire interfacing system is inconvenient more commands should be mappable to shortcut keys why not add macros into the game as a feature ccp can control how complex they are and you save clicks p i wonder if i can sue ccp when i need carpel tunnel surgery
great ideas here 
why thank youits refreshing to see more than the mindless sheep who continually spout offits called a carrier hurdurget an orcaconsidering both of those ships specialize for one thing or another when this vessel in and of itself would be highly specialized for the job that it does i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
exactlythe orca was designed as an industrial command ship not a hauler the ship bay is meant for indy ships and mining barges sick of ppl saying just use it also as we all know carriers are lownull sec onlywe really do need a dedicated ship haulerit would bring in something new that required mins allways good and something new to ganknuff said

no  wow i really congratulations you just won a wooden horse on the racetrack o7also youll have to tell me who your dealer is for interdiction nullified pods id gladly pay 30mill for one of those
it is impressive the number of retards on herebut if it is worth anything mushroom i am behind youto those saying that destroying ships is not an isk sink then you clearly never heard of mod drop rate or understand the fact that insurance does not pay for 100 of the ship aaaaand you still have to pay to get the insurance
wrong what really drives eve are new accounts who are unable to afford plex yet with isk only they pay for eve online development not the 10 15 who have the means and know how to play for free by trading their time for plex a nullsec player can make enough isk in a month to pay for a whole year of plex think any goon in the higher ranks pays for eve online no eve needs a constant influx of new throw away player accounts who actually pay the monthly price the game is designed to play against casual players they are not welcome in eve because eventually they too would stop paying thanks to better skills and understanding of the game mechanics so its important to keep a low percentage of players who play for free and are rewarded for their virtual bullying by the game developer its a corrupt system but hey thats eve
hint every plex bought with isk was paid for with money by someone ccp get the money either way
this is another thread i was avoiding posting in because i want it to go awayim not going to talk about how stupid this idea is instead i am going to rantevery time i see a proposal like this up i die a little bit inside there are too many threads like this ie rediculous up at the moment and all they are doing is pushing the attention away from plausible sensible and achievable ideas that deserve more discussion people like you are making the assembly hall more useless than it already isplease please please think about the reaction you will get when you post a thread think about how likely you are to get support and if you think youl get no support then dont post also understand the area you are posting about most people flat out dont do some research and above all if you know hardly anything about ccp and eve online dont post at all the assembly hall is for proposing changes if you dont understand the game then you cant understand the implications of what you propose and therefore your proposal is mootthink before you post every one of these stupid ideas knocks a good idea off the front page im fed up of people doing this use your damn brain i think there should be more rules to post proposals in the assembly hall or a better and more thorough guide to posting which is inbuilt ino the website as mandatory before postingin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
the caldari merlin needs at least one more missile slot for a total of 3 and another low slot while youre at it i am tired of flying caldari ships and finding out that half of the turret slots are not for missiles wtf i am caldari i shoot missiles give me more missile slots and dont change the merlin into a hybrid gun boat really its not a gallente ship stay true to the missiles
please explain the naga rokh harpy raptor moa eagle ferox and vulture if caldari are all missiles all the time
thats the problem im talking about
what problem are you talking about
there is no problemyou want to only fly missile ships stick with the purely missile ships
caldari should be the drone race tbh it fits the lore so stop complaning
judging by the op caldari are the stupid race more than the missile race
used correctly the merlin is an incredible pvp frigate its doesnt need any changes i would say its on par with the rifter it doesnt need buffingin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
caldari have a missile frigate its called a kestrel the merlin is great with turretsim really not seeing a problem here
ah this is an idea i like to see
supportedcruise missiles are pretty much useless as they are
i appreciate your consideration of the idealets consider what an fc could do with cruise missile battleships using the guided missile bomba theyd have to get into position or be in position and stay on position until the bomb landed thats 3060 secb the fc would have to determine how best to target focus call a target or spread targets at random as an area of effect weapon that detonates on reaching the targeted ship this is a consideration largely dependent on the damage and damage radiusc alpha ccp would control the damage and the radius and both should be smaller than an unguided bomb released by a stealth bomber at short range consider the difference in effect between 20 guided missile bombs arriving time on target at 100 of damage in a 5km radius vs 10 of damage in a 15km radius as compared to the current bombd how does the use of speed signature and mwd affect the damage splashthe unique difference of the guided missile bomb area of effect missile makes a class of item and ship viable because of the many ways it could be used currently the pvp long range missile battleship is dead lets breathe some life in the right direction it also provides for the possibility of an active defense that isnt seen anywhere else in eve damps defender missiles and long range ecm get another life small frigate classes like the kestrel become fleet defence
i had a bit more of a think through of the idea speaking as someone who flew only caldari and used only missiles for almost the whole of my first year of playing eve i really like itccp is always talking about giving ships niches and specific roles this would do it for the cruise missile platforms plus making sure that the ships have to stay on grid for the cruise missiles to be guided makes them vulnerable rather than just op also you couldnt use them too recklessly without putting your own fleet in danger from splash damage i just think it adds something new and interesting and i cant see any really down sidesupportedin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
i like thisnow if they made defender missiles not need a turret slot but take cap you could use them in drake fleets to mitigate they would never fully stop damage from these fleets but would compromise the cap stability of the ship if left on risk v rewardmight want to give the new cruises some imperfect tracking mechanic so that they cant home in onto small moving ships too easily or theyd hard counter light tackle itd be cool because this would make af fleets a viable potential counter to these things not to mention the brawler battleships well undoubtedly see once micro jump drives are implemented

definitely supported
hybrid weapons have a lot of ammo options but i find most of them to be worthless i use antimatter void and null for pvp i took a look at the dps difference of the ammo types and found that the damage tails off quite significantly for the longerranged ammo types causing them to do worthless dps for a ship in its size class on the other hand there is null ammo which does decent damage at range for a blaster so if youre a rookie player then until you get tech 2 guns youre basically stuck with antimatter for blasters until you can use void and null since the other ammo types are awful thats quite a big difference in the player experience of blaster use from t1 to t2 i suggest that there should be more consistency in how the damage scales between ammo typescomparemegathron dps with rack of neutron blaster cannons my skills with two magnetic field stabilizersvoid915 dpsnavy antimatter 820 dps 89 of voidantimatter 713 dps 77 of voidnull 653 dps navy iron 341 dps 52 of nulliron 297 dps 45 of nullmegathron with rack of 425mm railguns my skills with two magnetic field stabilizersjavelin 564 dpsnavy antimatter 556 98 of javelinantimatter 483 85 of javelinspike 322 dpsnavy iron 231 dps 71 of spikeiron 201 dps 62 of spikeas you can see the damage of iron tapers off quite a bit more than antimatter compared to the t2 ammoi think the damage scaling should be changed so that if antimatter is doing around 85 the damage of void then iron should do around 85 the damage of null and the rest of the ammo types between antimatter and iron should be based on that scale this would give newer players something analogous to null ammo for blasters and also increase the viability of faction ammoyn
i get what youre saying because this is exactly what holds me from taking rikshaving funpvping butevery proposal like this is asking to make the game less complicated more casual and this is not goodmaking games simple is what ruins them eve is huge and as complicated as it gets in gaming world and its why i absolutely love itcant really vote yes or no on this matter just wanted to add my 2 cents
i had personally always thought that there is a relatively simple fix for these kind of problems gcc if incurred in highsec should last longer and under gcc anywhere your pod should be vulnerable to podding without concord intervention i also believe that people with very low security statuses when they can be attacked in highsec should have their pods vulnerable as welllets face it with the new system ccp proposed where you cant go below 5 sec status without killing pods in lowsec or suicide ganking even normal lowsec pirates wouldnt have to worry about this change only the suicide gankers etc would have to worry about it it would make their choice to suicide gank or kill a pod much more meaningful in the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

i like it 1
1 2 no this happens a lot the titan sits ina pos the fleet sits outside it and waits for a bridge for hours sometimes the titan pilot might keep an eye on the client but the rest of the fleet wont be2 3 then what is it about the op talks about auto disconnects were discussing autop disconnects not the topic is about something else3 5 why should they log off if they dont want to whats the point in logging off when youre just going to log back in within an hour anyway 4 6 probably true but fights in tidi arent exactly quick5 7 how exactly is what i happen to be doing in notepad cheating if i have eve minimised ccp cannot control what i do outside of eve nor should they be able to it is not cheating if it does not have anything whatsoever to do with eve
no one wants the ops two cents so please keep the change and while on that please stop letting your mind wander its far too little to be out on its owndelayed local like in whs or just removed cloaked ships from localsolves the problemi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
no way no problems solved you solution just give more overpowered advantages for cloaking fagsand other thing the main problem it is afk players terrorizing pilots who playsthis is a crap rule someone just log in and went to work or sleeping etc when he is not at the computer but sitting in cloak but the other pilot dont know he is active or not so an afk player disturb and terrorize a player which want to playno problem when a player go to enemy territory and playing but everyone know this is not truth the story is not about this
an afk player cannot disturb or terrorize anyone they are afk they are not there you cannot blame your own cowardice on other people
you lying again the other players dont know cloakers afk or not thats why the afk cloakers can terrorizing playerswho dont play go and log off dont waste server resources or ccp give them afk tag and he wont terrorizing other pilots who wants to play because the other players will be see he is active or not and he cant terrorizing active players with afkcloaking anymoreplay and terrorizing or they are afk  ccp give them afk tag or remove riskfree afkcloakingand finaly you can do better insulting because your cowardice words just hit like a girl
no youre projecting an afk player literally cannot affect you in any way shape or form
at first i thought you were going with something completely different then i read on and became confused with the section i put in boldif the cargo bays have signal supression and signla dispersion then how are they generating additional aggro from customs officialsif you kept your idea to these cargo bays being designed to maks their contents and therefore allowing them to be ideal for smuggling youd have my thumbs upid jump right into the black market hauling contraband from one empire to the next and back again
i expected objections but i really didnt expect a rejection of the proposal based on the argument that local provides protection for suicide ganking its somewhat unrelated but i think all mining of any real value should occur outside of high sec anyway perhaps keeping grav sites but those need to be scanned down and as anyone whos spent time in whs will tell you probes show up on dscanmore to the topic of the proposal your comments did get me thinking on some finer points not addressed in my op particularly how those registered on local would display on those just entering the system the way it reads would imply that once on a systems local you would show up instantly to those entering the system and im not sure if that would be the best option if it was based not on the system but the individual pilots it would mean those entering a system would not only have a delay on their own ships showing in local but also the ships of those already in the system so if youre mining you wont show up on a newly arrived pilots local for a minute and half thus in some circumstances youd be getting warning of their presence before they knew of yours if they were in bcs and didnt scout you out first for example just brainstorming here thoughts would this allay your objections davon

maybe op should bother to understand and learn that caldari are both railguns and missiles instead of being a noob idiot who thinks he knows all dat stop the evemail spam
patience the merlin will become a hybride ship only sad to see the multi platfrom go though and when the tier system is dropped the way is open to adjust the kestrell to a ship that has simular power cpu cap and fittingsproblem solved
rail boats such as the ferox and rokh are pathetically weak and yet rails still have higher fitting requirements than blasters making them unusable without extreme skills and in most situations rails are useless anyways i propose rail boats receive a boost in damage while rail guns receive a lowering in tracking speeds if caldari are supposed to use rails and missiles it would help to make rail boats actually worth usingtrade rail boat resistance bonuses for damage bonuses and maybe increase natural resistances by a small amountedit can this be moved to ships and modules
large railguns actually do decent dps a naga provides great dps out to the 80100km range its medium railguns that need a look at they lack a role at present due to their low alpha mediocre range and lacklustre dps you can go to the bother of fitting 250mm railguns with difficulty on a cruiser but they dont do any significant damage compared to their fitting requirements i believe they need another damage buff in this orderdual 150mm railguns 5 damage buff200mm railgun 10 damage buff250mm railgun 15 damage buffin combination with better damage scaling for ammo types as i discuss here
today i was preparing a caracal in sisi for checking the new impressive launchers when i realized about something youve all probably encountered beforeright now when we use turrets we can rightclick on them when fitted and loaded for checking their modified stats in real time i mean their standard stats modified according to ship skills implants modules rigs and even ammo however thats not that easy to see when using missiles since most of the relevant attributes flight time maximun speed damage explosion radius and velocity are inside the ammo info not inside the launcher info so when i rightclick on my loaded launcher i only get the launchers info so i cant see how my missiles are affected by ship skills etc which is as important as knowing at which distance shoot themmy proposal is to be able to check that info in an easy way for example1 when rightclicking a launcher and hovering above show info a small list would appear where you select launcher info or ammo info2 when rightclicking a launcher and select show info you get a single list where the attributes tab would be separated at half heigh showing both launcher and ammo info in the same windowwhat are your thoughts about this
i reject the whole notion that eve has end game content what does that mean in an mmo that has no endeves strength as a game is based on the fact that our characters never stop evolving never stop honing their skills and never have a limit on what direction our characters can go inend game is for those other mmos that are theme park linear and quite honestly too boring to play for more than six to eight monthsas for the op and faction warfare i think it is about time that the wars begin to wind down it has been nine years now at least break up the secondary alliances minima tar can remain at war with amarr but drop the standings hit vs caldari same goes for the other factions as well
after talking with saracena it would appear to be both rplp
lp on the market  best not what little lore eve has left would be lost if it was to be done dont want people such as my self who are 10 with a couple of empire suddenly turning up in their naval loyalty stores to buy stuff  rp on the market  automatically generated aka free stuff being sold off  ugh best notrefurbish sp  err no we go over this every damn time something changes ecm nanos neuts rats scs etc and the choice to exploit a certain aspect of eve was yours and yours alone what you should be asking for is for ccp to look at other ways in which the now less useful skillset can be made worthwhile  such astimesink rd mission there have been rumours of insert pirate faction doing their own research in the xyz constellation help me get what documents they have to facilitate my research and you can keep whatever else you find probe constellation in question until site is found requires hacking salvaging and combat to complete with possibility of datacores galore drops as well as an assortment of invention materials basically a targeted exploration task
the regional limit idea is a good one i think and assigning a number of public shares versus private corp only shares is also a good idea if that is what you were trying to say but i dont think corporate shares belong on the regular market but there could be a separate market for stock trading complete with its own stats like purchase history and graphswith the public shares the current system is good enough to enable such trading but for the internal private corp shares there needs to be an automatic buyback system for when members leave the corp or are kicked out and the price of shares would depend on the corporations monthly income or expenses the number shares owned and the number of shareholders etc and when a member leaves or gets kicked their shares would automatically be bought from them at the value of the shares at that timei think that sounds fair and having a certain algorithm that determines share value without input from the corp ceo would be a way of limiting the ceos ability to manipulate hisher corps shareholdersall of this is possible in time but the real question is does ccp believe its important enough to spend the time and resources implementing a new system
imagine indeed
anyone think this is a bad idea anyone have any refinementsalso a word about command shipscommand ships can already boost armor or shields for an entire fleet but there is a maximum total of 3 that can have this effect at once on ships they are boosters for they also require very high skill levels and are very expensive ships to fly an aegis destroyer on the other hand would be something requiring comparatively low skills and be comparatively cheap they would be something a young player could get into losing one would be an expected outcome of a fleet fight they could be a new start on the path to logistics cruisers and command ships
afk cloaker just in your dream cannot affect to active palyers their act is riskfree because they are unscanneable and uncatchable and others dont know they are afk or notnice trying but your answer is untrue again if someone go to afk and he do not terrorizing other pilots dont care him he should be receive afk tag or not and wont be trying to cheat against afk tag with macros
you lying again the other players dont know cloakers afk or not thats why the afk cloakers can terrorizing playerswho dont play go and log off dont waste server resources or ccp give them afk tag and he wont terrorizing other pilots who wants to play because the other players will be see he is active or not and he cant terrorizing active players with afkcloaking anymoreplay and terrorizing or they are afk  ccp give them afk tag or remove riskfree afkcloakingand finaly you can do better insulting because your cowardice words just hit like a girlquotehaha afk tagsarcasm great idea thatll really work sarcasmif this was in place i would give it less than a week before you were back on the forums whining because someone with an afk tag suddenly attacked you while you were carebearing in 00 afk tag will make no difference cloakers will setup at a nice spot wait for a tag to appear then wait for the zerosec bears to come creeping out of their stations to mine or rat only solution is delayed local or remove cloakers from local real cloakingjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move

you know id say the bigger coward is the one crying all over the forums about how a player who is not even at their keyboard is ruining things for themshow me a killmail any killmail from anyone anywhere in eve who was killed by an afk player
you know id say the bigger idiot the one who talking idiot things over the forum without experience like youshe didnt talk about afk killers thats your ridiculous dream she talked about afk players who terrorizing others without playyou are a moron if you dont understand thattell to me do you know who cloaking and waiting you at anomaly in cloak or just went to afk  no you dont knowif you are alone in system with a cloaker you will go farming  if you have brain you wont go so an afk cloaker can disturb and terrorize active players who want to play
let me get this straight you are saying that someone who is not at the computer will stop you from playingso once again remove cloakers from localif they are afk then they are no threat you dont see them and they cant do anything because afk you can go out into zero sec and carebear your hearts outif they are at their computers then you should be taking precautions anyway its lowzero sec space ffswhat this always boils down to is the zero sec bears dont want cloaks at all in their systems so they come up with ways to nerf the cloak using afk as an excusejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
so once again a cloaker alt hiding below this post 
do these threads never end each time these kill afkers threads open they are kept alive by two or three people each time and shot down continuously by everyone else that posts if your not getting support you shouldnt keep posting the idea up its a waste of peoples time and a waste of good space on the first page of the assembly hall ccp are never going to want to place artificial restrictions on what you can and can not do like this because its unrealistic to think in the event that internet spaceships were real and existed etc etc etc that a person wouldnt do what afk cloakies do now ingame its a perfectly valid form of warfareand lets not delude ourselves here this has nothing to do with macrominers because ccp would have no way to tell if they were afk because their accounts are still doing stuffin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

while i really want a change to local i find your proposal unbalancedi believe there needs to be a balance between predator and prey your proposal overwhelmingly unbalanced towards predators a anyone living in a system is immediately known to the new members to system while the new member remains invisible for several minutes with gate cloak an inty has 60s of complete invlunerability to find their target which is an enormous amount of time while you can limit the information in nullsec you cannot limit the information in lowsec with the timers you provided any scan frigate can come into system launch probes cloak up scan down a target bring in tackle and punt them onto the unsuspecting player there is no warning outside of spamming dscan and frankly spamming dscan is tedious and unpleasant and should not be pushed on more people b your proposal boosts cloaks into god mode why would anyone ever use an inty anymore a stealth bomber can come into system cloak up and remain invisible to the prey until they decloak and tackle their opponent im sorrybut get real  while you can claim your proposed predatorprey balance is similar to whs whs typically has much better rewards and much lower accessiblity than standard nullsec space those two factors are huge and i think plays a big role in whats reasonable on the riskreward paradigm imo you need two big changes to bring this into balance 1 cloaked ships are not immune from your delayed local 2 rather than wh default the default should show a list of pilots in local but with an anonymous identity under each identity until a appear on your overview ie on grid with you b appear via your intel system  for extra kicks and giggles you should allow fleet members to automatically share their intel list with everyone in fleet edit this was my idea what to do with local replace local with an intel tool

so i read this quote in another thread over at eve general discussion and it got me thinkingwell said titan bridges jump bridges jump freighters carriers rorquals cloaky haulers warp to 0km interdiction nullifiers etc etc it all serves to do one thing  making eve a smaller game not to mention the fact that nullsec is becoming so crowded with outposts and stations it is starting to look more and more like highsec my suggestions to fix thismake player built stations and outposts destructibleand i dont mean incapacitated i mean completely destructible as in a big explosion and all that is left is a salvagers wet dream the list of benefits of such a change is pretty long it would make nullsec wars more meaningful it would increase conflict in nullsec as alliances would seek to destroy each others stations it would reduce the current station clutter and make nullsec more dangerous again it would mean less hoarding of assets in one station and therefore more travel between empire and nullsec it would make for some epic explosions and even more epic drama it would also open the way for some cool new features such as manned turrets on stations that can only be operated from a captains quarters like room where you look out on the battlefield and shoot at ships in space defensive and offensive station upgrades a station selfdestruct button that would be the epic culmination of a spys career etc increase risk and fuel cost of titan bridging  jump bridges i know the poor titan pilots have been nerfed one time after another im not out to get them with this i swear but as it is now it is way too cheap and convenient and with titans it can be done from safety inside a pos i dont know what the exact number would be but an increase in the titans fuel bay and a simultaneous increase in the amount of fuel required for each ship to jump would help nullsec alliances spend some of all that cashwith regards to risk i think the titan jumpbridge should only work outside the pos shields no more sneaky bridging of freighters and small gangs the titan is a fleet ship and with this change it would require a proper fleet to support it when it is bridgingadditionally the pos anchored jumpbridges need to have their hp massively reduced ccp introduced modules such as the cynojammer jumpbridge and cynogenerator as a feature to encourage smaller pvp operations but then gave them so much hp you still need a large fleet to take them down reducing the amount of hp would benefit smallscale pvp in nullsec and would make it more dangerous for nullsec alliances to rely on their jumpbridgesstargate upgrades  no more warp to zerothis one is real simple in the old days of eve you could only warp to within 15 km of any object in space warp to 0 simply didnt exist it was a way to avoid bumping into things and it made travel in low and nullsec far more dangerous i propose that not all stargates should be equal some should accept warp to 0 others warp to 5 10 and 15wont everyone immediately start making bookmarks then yes but not nearly as many as before now that we have corp bookmarks theres no need for every individual in a corporation to have instawarp bookmarks it would also open the way for a stargate upgrade feature for nullsec systems alliances could upgrade their stargates so their own pilots can warp to 0 while enemy pilots would still have to warp to 5 10 or 15its time to make the sandbox big again
make player built stations and outposts destructibleagreed however only on the condition that the following are met  stations gain some kind of automated defence like station guns it needs to be very very difficult and very very time consuming to destroy them  at the moment nullsec alliances rely quite heavily on minerals mods ships etc being shipped in from empire nullsec needs to be more independent before changes like this are made increase risk and fuel cost of titan bridging  jump bridges agreed in its entiretystargate upgrades  no more warp to zeroive never had to live in eve without warp to 0 my initial thought is to not support this idea although i need to think through the implications more thoroughlyin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

you didnt actually read what i posted did yougoons might be using isk but the people they are buying the plex from are other players for a plex to exist in game someone somewhere must have paid the money for it it doesnt matter if someone pays with money or isk ccp get the cash either way
actually doesnt a single plex cost slightly more than a single month of gametime if you pay for the gametime irl so people buying plex are actually giving ccp a bit more cash than theyd receive per month otherwise

how about adding arena stations with simulators in them this would allow players to build holographic ships with the same specifications and modules as real ships but with the restriction that these can only be flown inside the virtual arena this would open up quick cheap pvp to those players who are interested without any effect on the actual game arena matches would have entrance fees to cover use of the simulators additionally a portion of each participants entry fee will go to the winner of the match as a prize you could also have betting windows where players can place bets on who will win the matches but by taking the concept and placing it into special arena stations this will add the feature into the game without effecting the game for normal playersalso a benefit of these arenas would be the 0 risk of being pked no implant loss

not everyone wants hello kitty onlinego find a different game stop the evemail spam
actually my definition of hello kitty online would be high sec populated by mining corporations a pvp arena is not a bad idea but there is no need for a entirely separate server additionally if an arena is added you do not have to use it and how will an arena keep you from going to nul sec the reason pvp players like the op want a pure pvp area is because lets face it null sec politics is the biggest game of hello kitty out there mostly consisting of aliance executives jacking each other off with bribes there very little actual conflicts aside from gate camps which are really no fun for anyone and when there are large scale wars they usually consist of balls of ships crashing into each other with the biggest ball winning so to be honest there is really no true pvp in eve aside from small scale low sec piracy it is all politics and gatecamps i know i was in null sec for a short time
ok you still dont get it its amazing what good is isk if no one is buying or paying for subscriptions do you get that concept its very simple without cash isk is worthless without new players paying for the game there is no plex you do understand how money works right virtual items have no value outside of eve online do you grasp this simple concepti can buy food clothing etc with money  but isk in the real world is worthless you cant trade isk for money therefore what good is isk when you are completely dependent on people with money to play your game does this simple concept compute for yougoons bring no value to eve other then taking money from those who actually pay to play they are essentially the virtual bullies in eve online that take your lunch money
what you fail to understand is no one gives a  about what you think because you are a minorityyou think the sky is fallingand everyone around obviously disagreesi pay for my accounts with cashsome pay with iskhow does that factor into your thinking againif you dont like this gamethen quitstop breaking it for everyone elsego carebear somewhere elseps oh and isk is monopoly moneyit has no value other than ingamestop making it gain value and coming across as an isk seller stop the evemail spam
um  you still dont get it lol the cash still goes into the game even when people pay via plex because someone paid ccp cash for the plex if people dont pay for accounts via plex ccp makes less and people who want to turn cash into isk end up turning to rmtingplex is the single best payment method for any video game ive ever seen it both adds paying accounts to the game because the money still goes to ccp for the account regardless of the name on the credit card and it helps curb rmting by giving people a way to buy isk while still helping the game and the economy its freaking brilliantoh and the goons do add a lot to the game they keep the rest of us on our toes which is a very good thing for eve it turns out that an utopian society where everything is peaceful and no one is mean is really really boring
i beg your pardon but clearly you dont pvp if you think that there is no thought involved when fitting ships or engaging in combatthere are hundreds if not thousands of variables that determine a fight millions of combinations are possible and tq simply does not allow for a variety of trial and error this is why tools like eve hq and eve fitting tool were invented to simulate ship fittings etc people use those tools all the time so your argument that a pure pvp style version of eve would somehow limit the game or make it easy is not only narrow minded but just plain wrongthe complexity of modules fitting skills plugins boosters etc gives an almost infinite amount of possibilites plus add pilot skill on top of that and you suddenly have a dynamic arena style pvp game that is less about grinding and missions and more about player vs player interactions add a scoreboard and weekly tournaments and im hooked i would even introduce new game styles like capture the flag team deathmatch team deathstar takedown etc etc
right this is why eve online only has 25000 people logged in at one time and carebear games like wow crush eves numbers in terms of a four quadrant audience here is a newsflash  more people are carebears and the minority are hardcore your argument is not only weak its arrogant i would be willing to bet money that if eve had an arena style gladiatorial version more people would log into that server
comparing wow to eve is like comparing kindergarten to high school stop the evemail spam
yeah a sharded level capped game with instances totally optional pvp and players who have their hands held by the devs is exactly the same as evemore people might log in but less people would actually pvp so the game would suffer less fights means less ships die which means less ships are bought and sold which means less money for industrialists and less demand for mineralsi really really dont think you get eve
the rokh is fine shut your mouthlook if you want to be  on your own time thats fine but toying with one of the best platforms in the game because youre completely ignorant of how to use it is fine by mepl used to use abbadons now weve switched to rokhs almost exclusively for a huge number of reasons not the least of which is the 5 second reload times and multi ranged ammo that allow us to stay at peak dps no matter the range of the opponenti have a better suggestion for you perhaps you should learn about rails before crying about how they dont work
lol what what makes you think that that place is the right place for this
buff the boats otherwise gallente ships would still be preferable to caldari in terms of damage
i am not sure exactly how customs fees for planetary import export are calculated but i am certain that they need re balancing each unit exported or imported from a planet should be calculated based on the regional average of buy orders additionally the customs tax should allow one export and one import on a unit without exceeding 50 of the units total value currently when materials need to be imported the cost of the export plus the import usually totals much more than the materials or even the materials they produce are worth this should never happen period

thanks all for the positive feedbacki think what the developers would like to hear is if you had this tool available for your battleship how would you use and abuse the ships and tactics in nullsechow would you defend against area of effect damage coming into you with 45 sec of forewarningwould you be willing to take small ships into your fleet to protect you battleship assets obviously giving newer players an important role id thinki think the change would be entirely useful or at least the option for change as in charge or module but would this development be in any way gamebreaking
well the obvious defence against fits like these would be be to keep to close range ships spread points and scrams etc so that when the new cruise missiles platforms turned up they wouldnt be able to open fire without killing their own fleet in the heat of combatyou could even use fast disposable ships to burn towards enemy fleets so that the splash damage hit the enemy instead of your fleetin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
a cruse missile is a precision guided low collateral explosives delivery platform it has no area of effect a torpedo however is effectively an area of effect weapon in its native environment the water sub surfacewhat im getting at here is that your idea is not relay that great i would rather see them get a buff to explosion radius and speed with a nerf to flight time to compensate for the extra speedthis would make it so that a cruse missile was fast and able to hit its target sooner and harder
i support the notion that there should be an easy way to check skill updated info on missilesthis is just a clunky ui issue after all the should definitely get on the 1000 paper cuts projectit is issues like these that should be getting the attention in the assembly hall its a no brainer and wouldnt take ccp too long to change the ticks all the boxes for a good proposal its not a timeresource consuming change to make obviously no drawbacks its intheme with changes ccp are already makingin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
by endgame i mean to refer to how eves whole militia population can break the game with an idea of a totally iterated faction warfare inmind came about how that can be broken and so itd have to be fixed the endgame i refer to is an autofix of playerinfluenced extraordinary feats eg defeating the weakened enemy faction that cannot fight back anymorebig accomplishments in eve always happensorry for confusion
supportedand there is a some topics about wis whish can interest youcaptains quarters ideas suggestions and enhancementsdiscussion thread about wis
they also specialize in tracking disruptors that shorten the optimal range and reduce tracking speed of weapon turrets turrets their main enemy uses
i think the idea is a good one it is the kind of defense that is a natural outgrowth of warfare you want defense in depth if you cant keep the enemy from shooting at you ecm then you prevent them from hitting you this idea and if you cant do that  you mitigate the damage buffer tank and if that is not enough you repair logisticsthis idea is a good one for a niche that doesnt exist currentlyimplementation could be difficult i am not sure that the game is built to do complex geometry for every weapon firing that could get pretty messyperhaps a different way to implement it would be to make some pretty graphics that make it look like it is defending the sh1t out of someone but on the backend all it is doing is providing a boost to defense against some specific weaponsie when module anti laser thingy is active a buff of 25 less damage from laser based weapons is appliedif it needs to be positional then the simplest way would be to have it calculate a quick ratio of distance to friend vs distance to foe and apply that ratio to some flat damage modification percentthen it would work better the greater your ratioconversely if you made it an absolute ratio then you would have best results being equidistant from each the larger range is always the denominator so anything but equal results in a less than one ratiothis would also be murder on the server as every shooter has to be calculated for in order to mitigate damage the other problem with this simplified approach is that i fear it will not provide the positional maneuver we are looking for since the complexity required to check if the destroyer is intervening in the line of fire would be even harder to accomplish that means that the shield wall you envision would be difficult to make happen
wait im confused so youre not afraid of the afk cloaker youre afraid of the cloaky killeroh i get it now you allow someone who may or may not be afk to dictate your actions because that person may or may not be waiting for you to start ratting alone so they can kill you so what all this is about is someone that may or may not try to kill you at any given moment aka youre afraid to lose ships but refuse to work in groups because that would cut into your profit marginseriously the miners getting ganked in highsec right now have more guts than the 00 ratters and they arent even in combat ships or are allowed to defend themselves they usually die before they can the ironic thing is that most nullbears wont even risk a drake to an afk cloakerkiller because that is to big of a loss for themmmos come and go but eve remains garresh
so she is your other noob mindget alt who hiding behindoh you are expert but wtf this 
ok i was not going to bother replying to this thread as i was hoping it would die but seeing as it has been bumped back to the top i will address your post1 i dont understand how a killmail for a noncloaked battleship that i lost in a 04 sec system to a gang over 3 years ago makes me a cloaker alt2 this is my main i always post with it  unlike yourself its pretty obvious that you hun jakuza and tigers spirit are the same person i guess at least this way you have one person agreeing with yourself on the forum3 why are you opposed to afk cloaking call me a cloaker alt and idiot pilot yet you admit to being an afk cloakerfor the record i have never afk cloaked i just believe that nerfing cloaks is not the solution to afk cloakinganyway enjoy supporting and highfiving yourself on the forumsfly safejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move

bahahahahahaha oh wowyoure a  idiot then again as an utterly ignorant newbie i wouldnt expect you to understand the complexities of what an utter disaster such a move would be for the game economy but hey on the other hand sure remove all suicide ganking against mining shipsand move all asteroids to lowsecnow please allow me to direct you somewhere that will better fit your gaming needs
i agree that mining is one of the most important venues of income for new players and that griefing miners in general poses a problem for the introduction of new players to the gamethat said new players rarely fly hulks if you find a new player in a hulk its usually the alt of an older player if a new player spends a plex getting into a hulk asap then he is making a mistake you shouldnt get into a ship until you have the proper skills and experience to fly it wellat the core of all this is the dreadful mining mechanic in eve its been dull since 2003 and it mostly attracts players who play eve in the background while doing something else which is why its so easy to gank themfix the dull mining mechanic make it interesting fun and involved and the amount of highsec miner ganks will drop very fast hell if its cool enough you might even see some bored pvpers try their hand at it
why not instead of asking for new forms of protection from ccp you instead use the tools already in the game to protect your mining ops get some logistics ships repping your mining ship and theyll suddenly be harder to suicide gank in fact people wont even try to gank you if you have enough logi support as there are much easier targets in another system somewhere stop crying and learn how to solve your own problems its not that hard
there are a lot of people who play the game in npc corporations or small mining corporations they might not have pilots who can fly logistics ships and even if they do it doesnt help much against alphadamage suicide ganksas those of you who dont know or understand the concept alpha damage means you destroy the hulk with the first volley of shots meaning there will be no time to engage rep cycles
ok heres an option to protect the new playerssupershield v1expands defenses of trial qualified ships to be more in line with the defenses enjoyed by capitalsvery short term use only available to accounts under 2 weeks in agecant be traded nor can it be used on another account in other words its a complete account lockit would work down to 04 sec status but doesnt work any deeper then that this would give the new pilot a chance to get back to 05 space without the sudden and violent end of their ship due to a very simple to make mistake do feel free to shoot they will take damage just dont expect to kill itthis shield would burn out by the end of a normal trial period and would start warning the pilot that its about to expire and that they will become vulnerable to normal attack mechanics within 72 hoursthis would protect the new players looking to get a taste of what eve is about but would also leave them vulnerable to a well executed trap to catch themthis would effectively end the grief aimed towards the new players while letting them get used to how the actual mechanics workcall it the new player protection act

thank you for your comments and criticisms gizznittaside from a few key points you made which ill get to in a moment i do not believe your statement that the system is overwhelmingly unbalanced towards predators first the whole analogy of predators and prey i find sets up an image which is somewhat unhelpful when you say predators and prey we think of wolves and sheep and well unprotected the sheep are in fact hopelessly vulnerable to the wolves but my issue with that is why are we automatically attributing sheepish qualities to players and then in the name of balance some like yourself want ccp through mechanics to act as shepherds for these players fact of the matter is players dont have to be sheep or wolves they could be mountain goats pveers that are alert and take measures against wolves themselves they can be sheep dogs tamed wolvespredators and protect the sheep in return for the bounties of their labor in short if players choose to be sheep and forgo the protection of other players they should be vulnerable to predation that is balanceyou have a point about people in the system being immediately visible to new people entering the system is problematic i addressed that in an earlier post in this thread it could be done based on individual pilots rather than the system so those timers start individually for every pilot that enters the system both in terms of being seen and seeing those already in the system in other words all those timers in my original post would apply to everyone not just those entering the systemi dont follow why my proposal is ok for null but not low sec yes frigate scouts become a real factor but thats my goal i want active scouting to be a part of the game and i want more reasons to fly smaller ship classes as to dscan the woes of using dscan are way overblown imo but that said if you go to the link in the op it will take you to a larger post i made in features and ideas that covers broader issues of intel in eve including dscan there i suggested an improved dscan with some automated capabilities in any respect saying dscan shouldnt be pushed on people is as meaningful as me saying local intel shouldnt be pushed on peopleanyway take a look at the link and see if that removes your dscan concernsto say this system puts cloaks into god mode is ridiculous in fact although it would finally allow cloaks to do what theyre meant to do it boosts stealth gameplay in such a way that ships with cloaks are not even required under this system roaming gangs of frigates and destroyers could remain off local fairly easily and they dont need cloaks to do that if you want to remain undetected for a prolonged time in a system under the enemies noses or just have the extra edge in sneaking around and scouting thats when cloaks are useful covops ships are going to be the best at evasion and ambush as they should be i dont see what the point in having covops would be if it were otherwisei didnt claim it was similar to whs because it isnt there is always the new form of local intel in low and high sec and in null there are multiple ways in enabling the new form of local intel moreover the means of enabling local intel favors sovereignty holders as the local intel is not available to everyone only those that create it and those they choose to share it with so wh space remains 100 local intel free null does not 1 cloaked ships arent completely immune to the delayed local if they remain visible to a pilot long enough to register on their local chat they stay there until they either log out or leave the system regardless of being cloaked or not i dont think they should be shown anymore than that local intel as it is now has broken the core functionality of cloaks why would i want to reintroduce anything like that 2 this plays into the numbers game of lets make sure we have a bigger blob than they do further more all these suggestions diminish the need for actual active player scouts which is one of the main things im trying to improve
your intel system is problematic for nullsec and lowsec in null the hunters typically wont have access to the intel because they typically wont have good standings with those that they hunt this manifests as a major nullsec problem because it becomes very difficult for roaming gangs to find targets and big battles become majorly biased to those with intel in lowsec the residents typically have no control over who has standings with the npcs your notion that cloak ships are not immune is flat out wrong any iwanttostayhidden cloaker will just leave system and come back if they ever appear in local hence they are effectively permantly hidden from local this is god mode it is impossible for any player to defend against a cloaky gang they cant be scouted nobody knows theyre there they have infinite time to safely find a target they can instalock any target before it can react and even if you create a tool to scan down cloakers it wont do you any good becaue you dont know they are there this is completely overpowered and you have to be really really naive to believe otherwise there are very different game play styles for pve vs pvp this divergence makes it practical to separate players into the hunters vs the hunted the predator vs prey etc etc etc talking about sheep with teeth mountain goats or whatever wont change the fact that the typical player needs to switch ships and organize their response to an enemy attack or else they will be slaughtered against most competent roaming gangs im speaking from a position of experience there are a few noteable exceptions to this rule primarily incursions  sleepers but typically thats because the locals are already organized into a combat fleet your comment about mountain goats being alert is exactly whats wrong with your idea you cant be constantly alert to a threat you dont know is there showing the number of people in system has a huge impact on this game have you ever been to nullsec its sparsely populated you often travel 20 systems without a soul and then enter someones home system with 20 pilots now imagine you cant quickly determine if there is another pilot in system do you know how much extra time will be wasted looking for targets this is one of the major problems with your proposal in order to facility clashes its important for people to find each other this is why i highly recommend that every pilot in system appears on a local list but as an anonymous pilot then you dont know if the anonymous face is friend or foe until someone goes and gets intel on them then you have a vaible role for scouts they fly around and identify people as friend or foe then you have a role for cloakies they stay anonymous in local as nobody can get intel on them then you have the ability to find people to shoot because you can tell theres people in system then being alert has meaning because you can tell when there is a potential threat before youre in a dire situtation there is a huge amount of power in being an anonymous face you only need to limit the ability to identify other players not make it implausible
some of your points here dont make sense in regard to the actual proposal theres timers based on ship class to show up on local so even in they are hunters in enemy territory with a local intel system in place they can still navigate it without showing up by using small ship classes big ships will show up very quickly im usually accused of not giving enough to sov holders with my proposals this is a first where ive been told im giving too much in practice what this ought to mean is larger forces will likely deploy skirmishers primarily frigates and destroyers ahead of the main fleet and covops ahead of them skirmishing forces can take out an undefended scanner array if thats whats being used to create local ahead of the main force if its an outpost that generates local well thats a large investment and likely a home system for a large group of players their local advantage shouldnt be easy to remove there sorry but that part of your argument just doesnt make sense in context to this proposalyouve misunderstood how the proposal affects low sec i think there everyone gets access to the new form of local intel standings as a requirement were only mentioned for npc null sec these comments and your instance on describing cloaked ships that dont show in local as god mode makes me very skeptical if were remotely on the same page take a step away from eve for a second and consider other similar games and how they handle stealth and detection theres none that ive played that nullify the ability to be sneaky as much as eve does with local chat darkfall which has no invisibility of any kind is a night and day better than eve for supporting the ability to use stealth to evade and ambush other players covops ships are weak by comparison to their visible equivalents and they cant remain hidden to actually make an attack on someone further all your criticisms could be applied to gate camps on the jump in side equally well do you support changing thatall that said removing or radically changing the way local intel works is just the first necessary step if you look again in the link to the larger post see link in op encompassing broader issues there is ideas for cloak hunting and detection however that can only happen after local is changed ill also mention since many wont look at the link that the detection idea lends itself to cat and mouse gameplay and is specifically intended to be largely useless on gates if youre wondering why i didnt include it all in one proposal its because it would be overwhelming and most would simply ignore it plus some of the ideas just werent ready to be posted in the assemblyid get to your comments on predators and prey which as you might have guessed i disagree with but it will have to wait as rl callsanyway i welcome suggestions and changes to the proposal and positively seek them in the long buried thread in features and ideas where this originally comes from however only if theyre in keeping with the desire to empower stealth tactics read not just cloaks active scouting and a much increased fog of war
ive read this thread and your fis link multiple times and i dont see what youre trying to point me to i see some additonal suggestions there a lot of which i disagree with we both want local changed but i dont think we are in the same book let alone the same page below is an elaboration of the inequalities i foresee in your implementation for the roaming nullsec gang i fc a lot of these i can send a frigate into local and search for five minutes before appearing in local five minutes is enough time for an interceptor to systematically warp to every celestial and anomaly in system until they find whom they are looking for most good skirmishers can locate a target within 3060s upon entering system with your setup the locals have no warning they are being hunted unless a they spam dscan forever or b the frigate lands on grid with them this is further unbalanced with your covert cloakers that will never show up on dscan never show up in local and noone knows they are there until they decloak on top of their target why would you ever use an inty to snag a target when a sb can do the same thing and has no real drawbacks you basically reduce inties to nullsec gate camping and boost cloaks to very very potent tools more on cloaking later my gripe here is if im taking a small gang out to gank ratters your system makes it very hard on the ratters because they wont know im there until im locking them note nullsec ratting doesnt pay enough to support the losses this system will create to balance this the roaming gang is completely oblivious to how many are in a system to find targets they have to waste a lot of time scanning mostlyempty systems or they have to use slowtoupdate map statistics and 3rd party apps like dotlan just to find systems worth scanning down this is not a good balance because once dotlan updates the npc kills a hornet gang can beeline to the system avoiding local by traveling fast gank a ratter and easily gtfo before the locals can respond to their attack the locals have little hope of chasing them because the hornets can power through systems without ever showing up in local this is a really harsh change for the average joe nullbear and is hugely unbalanced to the roamers medium sized gangs 1030 man gangs when im taking a medium sized gang out your system makes it very hard to find an opponent because i cant assess a system by the number of pilots to get a good fight i need a systems with a reasonable number of pilots so they can form up a gang appropriate for us to engage note pilots are typically docked where scouts cannot dscan them  additionally its much harder for a scout to assess a medium sized roaming gang because their numbers are problematically obfuscated by your new local for large fleet battles the home field advantage ie in a system with a station means the locals will know how many enemies are in system while the enemies are much more oblivious can attackers scan down a system yes can they pragmatically get a good count of the locals not at all especially when those locals are docked in a station for exmaple with your system if i ever try to conquer vfk i cant tell if the goons have a 200 man or 2000 man gang in station and this is very important for making the decision on committing my forces ie this is hugely unbalanced to the defenders local is very simple and balanced in its current implementation letting everyone know who is in system this is not an entirely a bad thing its just too much information for too little work as you said stealth does not exist in eve except with hotdrops imo the information provided by local needs to be toned down not completely fubared knowing how many is a very good thing knowing who is in system is also important but such knowledge should be ascertained by scouts
please read and respond to this i dont play other games somuch so im oblivious to how cloaking works in other games we seem to primarily disagree on what should be cloaked i think cloaking should hide your identity while you think cloaking should hide your pressence currently local chat makes hiding either of these impossible youre trying to make cloaking hide your pressence which i consider overpowered the reason i consider this op is there is no counter to it mixing your delayed local with current game mechanics by the time i become aware of your pressence i typically have no time to react leaving me sol this system is inherently unbalanced towards the cloaker which essentially has infinite time to setup and prepare while their target has no time this is why i keep suggesting cloaking and your new local in general should not hide your pressence but only hide your identity this allows everyone to be on a much more equal footing because then we both have the same amount of time to react to the pressence of each other hence the intel system is starting off balanced to all parties it is from this point that we should create the game mechanics to identify each other be it ship scanners system scanners or what not its ok to give some advantages to ship types infrastructure teamwork etc as long as both the defenders and attackers have tools available such that neither side gains an overwhelming advantage i really dont understand how cloaking your presence is good for the game
thisenough for not supporting this crap idea
i really like this ideaif those little tvs in space had some actual relevant information rather than just bounties itd make the game feel more like a comunity environment 1 there is one thing i would like to bring up though even if these adverts make it into the game why would it stop people who already use cans to advertise it would definitely cut it down i know that but the most optimal way of advertising would be to use all forms of advertising wouldnt it
well its not something ive seen much debate about so i figured id make the topicinsurances for faction t2 t3 just isnt worth dealing with its better to insure to platinum but for the price in most cases of doing so could go to quick replacing during a large fightfor exampleid like to see some sort of average  off the market value put into the insurancessince getting concordokened is no longer a way to get the claim of it i cant see their being a reason to not change itt3 bing a major hit on 3 fronts subsystem sp hit insurances isk they dont come cheap and losing them can be a pain and the isk for its platinum is like 12 of actual marketed hardworked value
t2 t3 and faction ship insurance is supposed to be terrible if you got back most of their isk value after losing them why would you ever fly a nonfaction t1 shipand yeah t3s do deserve to hurt more than the others a ship that can cloak like a force recon put out haclike dps warp through bubbles and still have a subbattleship tank does not deserve harsher penalties at all
true but the amount you get back to get into the fight that you lost your ship in which if its a mission would mean youd have to ask for isk or cancel the mission or sell something you really wanted to keepnont1 ships need a lil more then whats is provided from their platinum 13mill insurance from a loss of a t3 lost in battle would only give enough to get a ship with poorest of fittings if u consider only having a low wallet att it wouldnt be enough to return to battle of mission and would only marginally be effective in a large scale pvp
its supposed to be that way the insurance price is calculated based on market mineral prices not the extra components that go into t2 and t3 ships and faction ships are expensive for entirely different reasonsalso for t1 ships insurance is supposed to cushion loss not remove it loss is supposed to hurt
perhaps but it should still be higher t1 included otherwise insuring anything but t1 is just utterly pointless
why i see no reason to give people free shipshistory lesson there was a time when there was such a thing as free ships insurance was set at a fixed payout which whenever mineral prices dropped low enough allowed people to buy t1 ships insure them and selfdestruct it got to a point where people were making a profit off of buying ships off the market and blowing them upthe devs eventually took action and nerfed the insurance system it to what it is now rates are adjusted on a monthly basisim pretty certain thats the point
then why not make the payout automaticly the defaultand remove the insurance purposesand of course fixed got abused this aint a thread for fixed its for market adjusted  based on the entirety of eves average percentage used as a stick to give better payout to nont1 ships to actually give insurance its purpose that it was implemented for
well faction ships are technically t1 again their prices are dependent on factors almost completely unrelated to mineralsfor t2 t3 ships i really dont know why they keep the insurance option open for them my guess is that its some legacy backend code that no one really wants to touchwhy losing a t2 or t3 ship should hurtyou mean as a game mechanic to allow more people to pvp in lowend ships without completely removing risk and screwing the market over yeah eve insurance  real insurance not by a long shot
op is dense and everything is working as intended regarding faction t2t3 insurance
no it really isnt
yes it isits called dont fly what you cant afford to lose stop the evemail spam
wow is that the only thing you have to say you think i dont know that the insurance is a broken function like cspa
make built stations and outposts destructiblealready in the works i believeincrease risk and fuel cost of titan bridging  jump bridges no problem with thatstargate upgrades  no more warp to zerono thanks why would i want to waste even more time travelling time im paying for than i do already i can do anywhere up to or over 30 jumps of an evening if the lowsec or hisec entry that allows me to access the wormspace i live in collapses and even in a fast ship thats a drag try it in a freighter or orca then let us not forget the 100 jump roams that i used to go on in 00 warp to 15 would im fairly sure drop numbers on such events
bringing back warptozero is not pragmatic in the past people created huge sets of bookmarks that essentially enabled them to warp to zero they will do so again and trying to remove bookmarks will cause many many issues especially given the dangers of traveling in nullsec warp bubbles
increasing titan bridge cost what is your goal to force people to use gate travel when flying freighters to make hotdrops something expensive enough that people dont do it casually i dont think either of these will be changed without a significant increase in titan bridge costs it already costs 2ish mil to bridge an obelisk do you really think youll limit their bridging by increasing it to 20m especially if its carrying 10b in moongoo even at 2m a bs people will easily jp large gangs of bss to a fight becuase it saves time and is a much safer mode of travel as for jump portals pos cynos cyno jammers etc anything located at a deathstar pos is not something a small roaming gang can typically take on those are pretty much sov level upgrades and as such require sovlevel ops to take on rather than make them easily destructable id double or quadruple their ehp and move them to the ihub
the increased cost would function as an isk sink for larger alliances i think it should cost a significant enough amount that you do not casually bridge people here and there just to save a few jumps especially with pos jump bridges they should be tactical tools to move fast in pvp situations not a cushion that allows nullsec residents to never have to face the risk of going near a stargate again the aim is to make bridging less of a convenience and more of a strategic tool i cant say here what the exact cost should be i agree that even if it costs 50m people would likely still bridge freighters but they wouldnt do it as casually as its done now thered have to be a real strategic need for that freighter to be moved in such a fashionalso the increased risk of only being able to bridge from outside the pos shields would put an end to these bare lowsec towers with bridging titans moving freighters people would as a minimum have to put up a proper pos and would likely need to put some support together before attempting logistical bridges finally it would give the jump freighter a boost for its role in eve currently its being ignored by the alliances that have titan logistic capability simply because its more cost efficient to move a regular freighter that can hold twice as much in the cargo hold the problem with that is that once jump bridges are no longer near a pos shield you will have much less use for them considering the risk of jumping into a system without knowing whats on the other end a reduction in hp would allow a relatively small fleet with range and logi support to successfully incapacitate the bridge even if theyre taking nonfocused turret fire the cynojammer can stay the way it is its the bridge and the generator that are making eve smaller 
the last thing we need is fewer isk sinks also get podded less

for the last few months i have been trying to get ccp to fix a simple bug that have been in eve for more than 4 yearsthe only reply ive gotten from a gm in post is have you bug reported iti hope that csm can get some this utterly incompetent people at ccp to do something that will actually benefit a somewhat large group of people namingly the t2 bpo owners the bug they introduce long ago is the rounding when building of blueprints where you need ram xxx in a examplei want to build the pvpers prefered ammunition the veldspar mining crystal ii and im gonna build 3000 of them now i need some ram  electronics wich i only need 45 of to build cause this blueprint only need 15 of the ram  electronics pr run and times that with 3000 makes it 45 but wait i cant put this build over but i have everything i need all the minerals all the all the ram  electronics ohh wait it says i need 3000 it is utterly  that this fukin but havent been fix yet and yes it been bugreported multiple times if ccp cant find a bug report with it it is because someone deleted itccpfails tmcsm go do your  go evil on ccp make them fix this fukin problem when you have to have over 10000 ram each month just to build something you only need a 10th of or 50th is really stupid and annoyingps the road to success is always under constructionwhen i die i want to go peacefully like my grandfather did in his sleep  not screaming like the passengers in his car time is a great teacher but unfortunately it kills all its pupils
is this one actually a bug you need a ram for every run they judt dont get destroyed in the process
read and let it swirl and then think dont just write stupid the bug is it rounds up the ram to 100 before it takes the correct amount of rams  you cannot put in the only need amount and press build it rounds all the numbers up to nears 1 and since rams are a procentage of 1 it always rounds it up to 1 even if you only need 15 of 1 you still need 1 to amount of runs you building so 3000 runs of veldspar crystall ii need 45 but you most have 3000 in hanger to click build this is not how its suppose to work and it didnt work like this until 4 years when they changed how rounding was done in production it is not rocket science
you misunderstood danika because you were too busy ragingthe ram requirements dont round up to 1 they require a ram for each run but dont use the entire thing up this might not be what youre hoping for but it is a perfectly valid way for it to be implemented how you have decided it should work and how the devs have decided that it will work are not required to overlap also confirming that calling people incompetent saying they fail and cursing at them is the best way to get them to do you a favor and change things to how you want them and if you think about it it is rocket science after all
seriously  have you ever build any item that require rams ill make it very simple for you about 4 years ago for the better part of my recollection ccp redid rounding in eve for production so it whould be rounded of better than before and cause it was some issues with the it before that if you where gonna build something like 3000 veldspar mining crystall ii you only needed 45 rams in your hanger due to it only use 15 of the ram it whould sorta say reuse the same ram unit intil it couldnt and it whould take rest of one ram and take what it need of the next ram  you follow after the new rounding was introduced it then required you had 3000 in same hanger to click build even after you only needed 45 it still only takes 45 rams in your hanger and 2955 is left you cannot click build if you only have the correct amount you get it yet  now if then wanted to put another veldspar mining crystall ii blueprint over again for yet another 3000 run i cant why cause i only got 2955 rams even though i only need fukin 45 rams but because i dont have that cantyou dont take 15 of 3000 rams and damage them induviduel it takes one ram and uses it until it is destroyed its a bug ccp havent fixed for 4 fukin years u sound like your intelligent enough to be working for ccp it aint rocket science you see the picture do you get the picture and no im not raging im laughing my ass off cause i find the stupidity hilarious and i dont mean you or the other guy i mean ccp
okay my 2nd and 3rd post was to that you do not understand that it is a bug but i did not respond to what your trying to say to me other than reexplaining my self so let me reply to the theori from 2nd post that it is the correct behavior that it need a ram for each runthe process is before clicking build you have to have all the correct amount of materials requiered this windows shows the rounded fight based on amount of runs and it is here i say its bugged it whould let you click bug unless you have the amount of ram correspondig to amount of runsokay here is your flaw in that theoriwhen build is pushed it takes the stack of rams you need and unpackage them from the main stack of rams with the true amount needed in this example of veldspar ii blueprint 45 rams of 3000 run build this is actually visible in your hanger when one click build you can see that it actually takes one rams and unpackage it and then next until it has enough rams unpackages that match the  of the amount times the amount of runs and thus leave the remaining stacked it does not cycle each rams and does not dmg each of the 3000 rams that was there from the begining so end result is you do not need 3000 rams you only need 45 thus window that calcutate the amount of materials needed shows that you need 3000 rams in order to be able to click build is incorrect hence its a bug this clearly shows that its rounding bug with rams that the window does not calculate the amount needed on the percentage it converts the rams procentage to decimal number by round115 when this happens no mather what this number will always be less than 1 thus you must have according the build window the amount of rams to equal the amount of runs cause this windows calculates that it uses 1 rams for each run although this is not the caseand my second support for that this is a bug before the rounding change you only needed the amount correct amount of rams and rams back then wasnt repackageable and if you had one rams with 50 left and 45 and was building a off equal number as 3001 i whould be to click build today if i have the same it will not click build cause will not calculate in the rams 45 100 rams with the 46 single rams with 50 dmg even though it has enough to build itso actual its kinda 2 bugs in one it doesnt calculate the amount of rams runs you have available and the build window incorrectly rounds the percentagei hope i have successfull convince you that this indeed is a bug 2

ive experienced your pain im just glad that the manufacturing script uses up partially used tools prior to using up a new tool if they can quickly fix the manufacturing processes so it can ascertain the number of tools you need this would be a welcome fix however i dont think its worth an extraordinary amount of time
learn from this man this is how you explain things out and talk about issuesbut i still need a bit more than thatis this an actual bug or not not asking op stop the evemail spam
pretend were manufacturing void l each run requires a ram ammunition tech tool and each run uses 65 of a tool if you try to install a 10run job you would need 65 tools to complete it and with the current system the job will only use 65 ram tools however before you can install the job the game does a doyouhavethematerialstodothisjob check in that check it counts all tools as whole entities meaning i need 10 tools to install the job even though the job will only use 65 of them this is typically a minor annoyance as tools are not expensive items typically  100k each they are not used enmassand 12 tools per run and in my experience are only used in t2 production since most t2 production is done from invented bpcs which have a small number of max runs 20 stockpiling 100 ram tech is no big deal 10m isk if you are mass producing items off a t2 bpo say 3000 220 vulcan autocannon iis then you would need 3000 weapon tools even though the job will only use 1080 of them for small items ammo crystals etc each run uses  20 of the tool and the discrpency between how many you need to install the job vs how many you actually use is larger again id like to point out that this is a minor issue if you can afford a t2 bpo and all the other materials to do a 3000 run job then its absolutely ridiculous that you cant afford a stockpile of 3000 tools to run the job and if you cant then perhaps you should only do 300 runs at a time rather than 3000
thats what i thoughti recall someone telling me about that partiuclar aspect of inventing when i was doing researchsounds like an mechanic that needs an overhaul but not literally a bugand i have to agreeanyone in that kind of work can afford the excess materialsnot supporting this as an issuemore like someting to add to 10000 papercuts stackbut even thenthis shouold be reported to ccpwaste of time herethanks grizz for making it clearero7 stop the evemail spam
the 10000 papercuts project is exactly where this proposal belongs its a minor issue that should be fixed if it can be dones so in a minor amount of time
you are an idiotseriously what part of a window that shows build amount required and wich isnt correct is not a bug let me put this in context lets say a module like a turret only takes 1500 pg but the ship have only 6500 pg and you only want to fit 4 and you have 6 highslots on the ship so you have to have 6x 1500pg cause there is 6 highslotso in order to to get all guns online you must use pg giving modules and implants even though you have all pg you need then after the guns are onlined you can the out pg modules and implants this is contextand the fact that i got 600b has no point in this debate and the fact that i feel strongly about it and have to constant explain it to idiots does not make me a emo rage actually wanting a fix to this problem is me careing about this fukin game and me wanting to play it and use my  without have to deal with stupid minor bug is it really too fukin much to ask when you afterall have played this fukin game for 9 years i think it is not
ive had a similar issue before when i produce imperial navy enams in a 5 run i require 5 rams to make it but the thing is each run takes 20 so it should only 1 full brand new ram to make a 5 run but i need to have 5 in my hangarimagine you are producing a whole bunch of stuff and you have bunch of used ram that have varying amounts of damage on itnow when you manufacturing they have to figure out how much each ram has before starting the manufacturing process i think this is part of ccps laziness they dont want to bother with coding whether you have a brand new ram or already used ram it one of the many annoyances of halfbaked stuff that ccp created eventually they will get around to it but they have mountains of unfinished stuff the have to take care of firstits a good thing incarna rage slapped them in the face now they are working to fix things instead of creating new and half baked content to attract subscribers working on existing content does not attract more subscribers than new content yeah great thinking ccp now you got a slap in your face with sub drop and crap for that way of thinking and treating eve like a cash cow
oh hesheit gets itjust dosent like itand whats it changed so everyone else can be forced to play hesheits version of the gameopwe can speak for ourselves thank you very muchgo play hello kitty onlineits much more suited to your style stop the evemail spam
ok how am i forcing anyone to do anything tq would remain intact nothing on tq would change the way it is now in fact the subscriptions now on tq would most likely not switch to a new server anywaythe people who dont play on tq however would have another option to fight in a very different way how exactly does this interfere with your game again you would have an alternate choice and choose whichever level of difficulty you please can you explain exactly how a separate server would ruin tq
huh did iqs just sharply start to drop off in here  what are you talking about in my proposal there are no industrialists the separate server would have no isk at all plus it has absolutely nothing at all to do with tq or how that shard worksare you all bots autoprogrammed with the same response please read the entire post before you start spewing crap about what a bad idea this is okin my version of eve online you would actually pvp more not less how can you be so blindly obtuse
answer this question for meprovided that you are not fighting for sov out in 00 space why would you ever risk your hard earned stuff in real pvp on tranquility when you can get your pvp chuckles on the casual serverthe way i see it you are basically discouraging pvp on tranquility because no one in their right mind would risk their isk when a risk free option is available and they would never come to tq because well why would you want to make pvp hurtstop seeing pvp so black and white every time you go to the market to buy or sell stuff you are pvping with other players by buying low and selling high every time you run a deadspace sleeper or incursion plex you are pvping with other players by getting there first every time you mine you are pvping because you mined the ore first the list goes onand yeah ship to ship combat supposed to hurt thats what makes it so awesome if you fear the loss of your ship due to cost then you will fight that much harder learn that much more and employ that many more tactics in order to win nothing else teaches a human more than fear and pain
actually you are wrong again why would you pay twice to play the same game tq and the pvp server would have a completely separate subscription plan if you play on tq you are not playing on pvp server its just that simple no resources are shared no isk on the pvp server completely different system from tqtq would offer something that the pvp would not capital fleet battles and all that stuff that the majority of the players cant use anyway so no big difference there why pay for features you cant use just get rid of emalso singularity or as you know it as sisi offers already cheap pvp yet people still pvp on tq just as much hmmmm so your argument fails againalso on tq you actually pvp less then you would on this alternate server simply because of isk management and cost of modules fear has nothing to do with it people are less likely to engage in combat on a server where the ships cost millions of isk i know i flew lowsec for months without a single fight i even left a ship by accident parked next to a gate for over an hour and when i came back i was still in my ship and not a pod point being the pvp on tq is far from ideal if you really believe that mining is a form of pvp you really need to get your head examined mining is so far removed from pvp its like watching grass growif you just saw this the way i see it i think you would change your mind you would actually get a better breed of pilots from the pvp server they would flock to tq after they had their training on the pvp server and really get good at pvp
hmmm youre right now why would i want to pvp on a server that punishes me for pvp when the other one is basically a 247 battle royalenot exactlysisi is perfect if you are looking for risk free arranged 1v1s however there are not that many people using it because it requires that you download another wholly separate client is subject to frequent updates mechanics changes and system wipes ie its unstable there are strict rules for when and how you can engage in pvp you cant just shoot at people willy nilly or assist someone randomly the gms and devs that roam around on sisi have no tolerance for bs its their server people dont like expending effort on any of the abovei dont know about you but whenever i did something stupid and died i remembered it because the loss hurt then i made mental notes to not repeat said stupidity until i figured why it was stupideven today with a whole lot of isk under my belt i still wince whenever my ship dies because i dislike taking loss so i take precautions to ensure my survival and bring the best tool to the jobedit interestingly i barely remember my last loss i had to actually look it up and i found that it was just a cheapo cruiser that i casually threw into an engagement i can buy a couple dozen more if i wished however i can clearly remember my first two or three deaths from 3 years ago because at that time they hurt and i learned from those deaths what not to do ex ships cant warp to you if you are less than 150km from them big hulking battlecruisers can die horrible deaths against ships many times smaller than them medium weapons have poor tracking against smaller ships even if you dont see any war targets dont run missions in the middle of a war dec etcas for your issue with finding combat in lowsec you have to go to places where people are lowsec isnt the death trap everyone makes it out to be especially in the backend systems those places are just infested with skittish industrialists i hear huola is rather nice this time of year i should also note that because of fear of loss not every multiyear veteran uses t2 or faction ships all the time it gets rather expensive if you make too many mistakes this keeps relatively younger players competitive in the grand scheme of things if this fear was removed then t2 and faction ships would be the baseline for being competitiveas twisted as it seems that was how it was designed have a chat with the devs over a beer or ten youll be shocked by many of the ideas and concepts they have and which ones have guided them over the yearsthe way i see it you are imagining an fps game in space a version of galatic counterstrike you basically dont want eve to be eve and you want devs to spent time effort and money creating something that will in the end take away from the comprehensive universe that they have created thus far and many of us more or less enjoy because it is the way it isis it ideal hardly but it is evolving to become bigger while trying to stay true to its founding principles conflict driven economy greed versus risk painful losses etc
ok i agree you with you on one point eve has many features thanks to a very broad range of development however and really i want you to think about this one for a bit before slamming my comment do you think all their ideas are good after all ccp is run by people who make mistakes and they correct those mistakes as well when people protest in jita etc etcas a casual player i am giving them direct feedback that eve is bloated with too many features some which are irrelevant if the game play was more like their trailers and less of a grind fest i guarantee people would flock to this game but as it stands now there are many many useless features like space barbie wis mining bpos so on and so onyes i said bpos are completely useless can you guess why think about that one and get back to me if you played eve for 3 years or more you know what i am talking about
there are some things that interest me and there are other things that bore me to tearsi like to pvp i really like to pvp however i cannot pvp as much as i would like because well stuff costs money and i despise running missions or spending time making isk see im lazy as a result ive had to find ways to get isk ive done things things im not proud of things id rather not mention dont release those pictures damn you however i dont see myself as enough of a special snowflake to think that the game should be changed to my specific whims there are people out there who actually suck in ship on ship combat however give someone good with markets some isk and they will wreak economic havoc some pilots can perform logistical feats that few can envision others are very good at crunching numbers and because some of these people suck at ship to ship combat they look at me with either contempt or adoration depending on which side of my guns they are on likewise i rely on my marketing logistical and number crunchers to give me the best equipment at the best prices at the best locations or even help me getdo it all myself ive learned a lotand this is what makes the game fun for me and others like me all those different professions and ways of engaging in conflict all in conflict with each otheragain perspective you may not like all of the features but those features may appeal to others who dont see things exactly the way you do with such features the game has broader appeal to many more people provided they are willing to accept the other features they may not like the same as youalso im a casual player and generally log in what 3 or 4 nights of the week at most and i pvp and i usually get kills seems like you are doing something wrongerrr not seeing why they are used to build ships which requires minerals which need to be mined by miners which are collected and used by industrialists shipped by haulers sold by traders bought by pvpers who then blow up everyone at odds with hisher supplier at hisher level and all the way down the chain
pay your monthly fee and just log into sisi if you are that risk averse
no this is eve online you are playing the wrong game
sounds like someones played too much world of tanks or league of legends
here you goenjoy your free ships and stop spamming up the forum with the ignorant bile coming out of your mouth
op one of the fundamental values within eve is your actions have consequences losing a ship hurts becuase you put time energy andor money into ascertaining that ship in your alternate shard you are essentially removing the consequences from losing a ship in a virtual arean you are essnetially removing teh consequences from losing a ship these losses are very important to eve online it provides some meaning and value to the dangerous activities you engage in if you dont want to deal with actual losses then eve probably isnt for you ps most nullsec residents dont pay for the game with isk they pay with a subscription just like the noob the difference is they have played the game long enough that they know how to make isk to replace their losses
hello thereive been thinking about new stuff we could enjoy to play with when i came up with this idea before starting let me clarify that im not trying to troll anyone or post stupid op ideas i write it here so we can discuss it and see if you like it if enough of us like the idea perhaps ccp gives us a new toy in the future feel free to comment but please write constructive poststhat said here we goright now the most unclean but funny war tactics we have are warp bubbles given by interdictors bombs by stealth bombers and in general cloaked ships waiting for preys well thats my point of view and as i also like to prepare traps i came up with a new unclean tactic mine fieldsthe mines themselves would be a cross between warp bubbles and bombs but less powerful than the latter they would be small objects deployed in the same way as bubbles right where the deploying ship is in that moment and would be stationary once deployed a short preparation timer would start lets say one minute when it finishes the mine is ready and active as bubbles and bombs they can be locked and shot at as bombs there would be one variety for each damage type perhaps there could even be ewar mines pretty much like some bombsthe idea is that mines would automatically explode when an enemy ship wartargets agressors to the deploying ship or the mines themselves etc enters their detection range that range would be equal to the explosion radius effects of the explosion could be the same as bombs instant damage in all directions but less powerful of course they can do friendly fire so ensure none of your friends are inside the area cloaked ships wouldnt activate them this allows scouts to do their work but they should be careful not to get too close to them unless they want their cloaking device to deactivate and show themselves to the minesonce a mine explodes any other mine affected by the explosion inside explosion radius would explode too creating a chain reaction as bombs mines would be very resistant to the kind of damage they do ensuring theyre not destroyed therefor not exploding by the previous mine this allows deployers to prepare dense fields where more than 1 bomb would be inside each mines range this also limits the variety of mines on a single field just like a bomber squadron should shoot the same type of bomb for ensuring all of them will explode if a mine is destroyed by enemy fire it wouldnt detonate or make other mines explode about the explosiondetection radius im not sure about it perhaps it should be smaller than a bombs for example between 5 and 10 kmperhaps there could be mine sizes small medium and large xlarge too each one with a radius a damage output and a volume inside cargoholds that would allow trappers to prepare custom fields for different ship sizes while limiting the number of mines they can carry because of volume where mine fields could be deployed well players shouldnt be able to deploy mines that would have an npc structure within their range such as stargates stations and sentry guns they wouldnt be allowed in highsec but i think we could allow them in lowsec in nullsec and whspace all the time how much time should they be there floating well perhaps they should consume fuel from the deploying ships like bubbles but in less quantities i think a drifting bomb would require less energy than an ewar device allowing them to stay longer which ships should be allowed to fit mine launchers i guess youve already though about interdictors id vote them too theyre designed to deploy stuff and their pilots would already be deploying experts so letting them launch mines would fit into their role unless ccp wants a new ship type how a mine field could be destroyed area of effect weapons would be very effective against them like big missile sizes and bombs about drones perhaps they could be used as kamikazes putting them inside mine range unless they make drones invisible to mines excepting fighters and bombers what would this addition make to the game it would provide a fresh new tactic for gankers and for alliances that want to keep their frontiers quiet without making the surroundings of gates an impassable area an attacking fleet could use some cloaked ships to go there get outside the field and shoot it or use heavily tanked ships to make it explode also i think many would like itwell that was it please feel free to comment fly safe
these used to exist but ccp removed them because players would deploy them in laginducing quantities or so im told  before my time
not supportingbother to do your research before you repeat ideasthanks stop the evemail spam
i did search for old topics but i couldnt find anything sad to see there were excuse me consider ir topic resurrection then
there were mines once upon a time they were removed before i came into the game the remaining mines and blueprints are collectibles if any still exist they were briefly purged from the game and im not sure if they were ever replacedin other words they were tried before and taken out dont expect to see them again

hey calm down as i said i didnt want to troll anyone my first contact with eve was in the times of apocrypha but i didnt get a full account until incarna so i never knew about preexisting mine fieldsif it has been like you said well then its sad but i hope ccp will eventually find a better way to introduce them if they want after all eve gameplay has improved greatly since then about the lag we now have the time dilation but if theres no way for now ok thenim just curious about why they didnt work apart from the lag issue you said
this isnt me being upsetthis is me being annoyedyou said you showed up when apoc was aroundthat means you knew there where older forum boardslikely didnt know they exsisted either most people dontbig mistake these days is people are affraid to talk to people in eve due to scamming or some suchbut you have nothing to lose in asking anywaywalking up to a pilot and asking them about mines isnt trollingits asking a questioni do it all the time when i have questions before i show up heresubjects like pvp and suchi go find a pvperone that has a reputation to bootthey give very useful information provided your polite and keeping it realim just sayingdo a little research and youll save yourself the trouble ps if i came across a little tersethats just me in generalnothing personalim just a grumpy goomba search mario bros goomba for context ps2 if you want to keep diggingim sure someone who was around those days will give you all the info you wantbut i dont have that handy at the moment stop the evemail spam
ccp in my opinion went too far with nerfing nosferatu as a result the module has greatly fallen out of use with faction heavy nos selling for only 9 million a piece nos are really only practical for frigates but very small use for any other classes of ships i heard that theres been talk at ccp about unnerfing nosferatu the inability to suck cap when target ship is below  of your ship is dumb removing this limitation will opened up a whole bunch of variety fits and tactics again this is also make active tanking more viable for pvp as well
came expecting a whine thread about how missions dont pay enough left disappointedgood idea 1
i think they would cover rather separate fields combat log would be more important for separate engagements while wardec will poll entire data for the war but the wardec scoreboard can benefit greatly from the statistical data obtained from the improved combat logfor example during or after the engagement the combat log does a background check and if the target was from warring corporation or alliance  sends additional data to the scoreboardthis addition can be retroactive too so ccp finishes wardec first then combat log comes after and adds additional info to the scoreboardanother benefit i could see  more information present for ar depending on how it is implemented perhaps preemptively selected before the large battle or interesting encounter that would allow saving additional data to separate file so pilots can access it later and effectivey reconstruct the engagements from that file alone using 3rd party tools this might cause additional strain for weaker computers dont think that it should be calculated on a server so optionality must be present
maybe next year those agents get some ccp love
i had some of the same concerns but my speculation was that these calculations may already be taking place transversal velocity is available in the overview turret effectiveness tends to be greater when you are firing straight ahead or straight behind which means angles are already being calculated for the target two angles to target and two angles to defender together with distances to each would be enough to calculate the lines in question but hamster stress is definitely a concerni do like your breakdown of strategies for handling damagedisruption prevent the shot ecm tracking disruptor target breaker hardening toughen the target plates  shield extenders hardeners  resistance amplifiers  invulnerability fields resistance  buffer boosts from command ships repair clean up the mess local armor rep  shield booster remote armor rep  shield transfer interception physically block part of the shotgapi think ill add this breakdown to the top post in fact thank you

everybody stop being useless by stop complaining about afk cloakers we do not care what you thinkthese are game mechanics and they work fine as intended
you know whats far worse than a cloaky camping your systemknowing that there are possible awoxers in your systemyou people make me ashamed to be a nullsec carebear for the love of god htfu and work in teams working with friends is more fun anyway it might cut into your profits but isnt the profit  basic precautions why we hate highsec miners so muchin conclusion people afraid of afk cloakers are far worse than highsec miners who refuse to fit a tank on their hulk just because you went where you knew it was dangerous but complain about it being dangerous anyway
and we dont care what do you thinkthe cloaking mechanics dont work fine its time to change with afk tag with cloak capfuel usage with unique seek and destroy type ship enough for riskfree afk cloaking
by we you mean two or three serial complainers rightin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
by we mean the real players who know the truth from cloaking and not you and few noob just as like you
you seem to be the only one who emorages at the site of an afk cloakerif anyone needs to be seriously ignored its your prattling you keep throwing all over hellat least the rest of us know how to rationally deal with the afk cloaker instead of emoraging ing like a pathetic 4 year old crying for mama because he doesnt know how to deal with an guy whose away from keyboard cloaked in a shipso your answer is always to change the game instead of coming up with tactics to take care of the problem directly with what you got stop the evemail spam
arent you referring to the guy who lost his shuttle full of plexs  stop the evemail spam
your incessant whining gave us incarna carebears you almost killed eve op fck off and die
rather than enabling solo play how about we did something about hisec ganking that encourages cooperation multiplayer like say aegis destroyers
i agree on this statement i read through your post and it seems it can essentially be broken down to you disliking active intel gathering dscan probes and scouting and from your post bellow it shows you dislike stealth gameplay well the goal of my proposal is to make active intel gathering important and stealth gameplay a viable option so obviously we dont wont remotely the same thing the whole point of cloaks is to conceal your presence however in some games darkfall for instance a sandbox pvp mmo concealed presence is the norm no cloaksinvisibility required if i hide behind a rock you wont know im there unless you happen to look behind that rock while im still hiding there yes local chat in eve because it has everyone automatically visible in the chat regardless of whether they want to use it to talk makes this impossible im trying to make cloaking hide the presence of the ship because that is the point of being cloaked a whole wide field of gameplay typically found in mmos is nullified otherwise in class based games this would be identified as the rogue archetype the ability to ambush and evade is the legitimate benefits given to a shipavatar that typically lacks in other respects such as tank or dps it is not overpoweredcloaks that just hide your identity i dont even see the point of that especially considering you could be flying something else with more firepower more tank more speed more group utilityi really dont understand why you think denying the ability of stealth ambush and evasion that has been good gameplay in many other mmos and is a reality of real world warfare would be good thing for evegizznitt youre no troll but im genuinely surprised of your ignorance of what the expectation of cloaking mechanics would typically be from veteran mmo players although youve come to this thread and made honest arguments which i appreciate youre clearly very anti stealth not just anti cloaks and as a consequence i dont put much stock in what you consider balanced its also highly unlikely well agree on changes to these areas of the game
you keep referring to darkfall 1 how easy is it to kill a veteran player how often do you find noncombat capable characters sure they might have to equip a sickle to gather herbs but does that mean they cant switch to a weapon if an enemy appears do they have to remove their armor to pve many ships in eve are untanked and lack any combat andor tanking ability many of eves activities require people to use noncombat vessels or vessels with blatant vulnerabilities my point is combat in eve is centered around ship types and not character levelclass as such ambushing is far more potent here than in other games because the ships you choose to ambush will be far less capable of defending themselves 2 cloaky vessels in eve are not combat neutered any vessel can cloak and those that are designed to cloak recons t3s stealth bombers are still potent most of those ships can easily destroy most pve vessels solo and when in a group are extremely powerful by the way from what i can read darkfall has hiding not cloaking note when i say cloaks hide your identity i mean cloaks hide your identity in system but still hide your presence on grid i want to make certain im understood since i really didnt explicitly spell that out with that in mind you can still ambush and evade the only difference is that a cautious player will take precautions when there is an unknown pilot in system sure this means that ambushers will miss out on the occasional kill but this is a small price to pay for knowing there are other pilots in system this is information both the attackers and defenders benefit from if youve ever put up a random small drag bubble camp 13 pilots you would realize that people warp gatetogate and do all sorts of other ambushable behavior even when known enemies are in system when your identity is unknown youll have plenty of targets you dont need to hide your presence thats just overkill and overpowered what wide field of gameplay are you trying to create do you not understand why knowing there are other pilots in system is very much to the benefit of this game finding people to fight is a huge deal and i donUFFFDt mean finding people to gank i mean finding people to fight if you cant find people to fight then this game becomes really boring really fast in all seriousness how does a 1020 man gang find a good fight if you canUFFFDt tell how many people are in system
the reason i keep using darkfall as an example is partly because like eve it is a sandbox mmo built around player conflict with a skill based system no classes but mostly because it has no invisibility mechanics yet still provides stealth gameplay a lot of people get caught up in the invisibility in the case of eve the cloaks but ultimately its not about that as such darkfall provides a great examplethis is a bit off topic but since you brought it up rarely did anyone in darkfall whos gathering resources do so in their best armor and weapons yes they would be armed but against well armed prepared opponents they had little chance other than to flee or hide your point here doesnt make sense ambushing is always potent although so too are counter ambushestraps and almost all players in eve even those claiming otherwise arent looking for a fight theyll likely lose so yeah a cloaked ship isnt going to willing attack a ship that it doesnt think it can beat what of it when youre roaming with your gang of 30 do you say ok half of you wait here this group only has 15 ships do gate campers challenge solo ships that jump into their camp to a duel with the same ship class and then let the pilot go on their way if they winget real gizznitt eve is not a sporting event pvp isnt a boxing match with opponents that are of the same weight class and experience fighting 1 vs 1 under strict rules and generally in the spirit of sportsmanship eve is more of a simulation of warfare albeit in a futuristic fantasy setting in warfare it isnt about fair fights resources to fuel the war are critical and are therefore a legitimate target armies attack the means of production often including the workers themselves those that lack the strength or means of direct confrontation resort to guerrilla warfare which can be boiled down to saying hitting the enemy where they are weak and evading them where they are strongstealth ambush evasion surprise fear traps do you get it yet semantics cloaking is a tool used to hide darkfall just doesnt require that tool to hide no this just screams at me that youre looking to play a totally different game than i am you want arena style pvp in an open world as opposed to instances where consensual pvp is easy to find i want a warfare simulation where i can play cat and mouse style pvp and pve it can be just as fun to be the mouse that gets the cheese and evades the cats and engage in guerrilla style warfare
imagine if you could cloak up in darkfall not just hide but actually cloak such that a player can not find you until you and your gang choose to be found do you really think that would be good for the game because thats what your suggesting for eve your suggestion doesnt lend itself to catnmouse style pvp in any form sure you hide  sneak until you find a target completely oblivious to your pressence and then you pounce but in your version the mouse has no way to know a cat is around because it cannot be seen it cannot be smelled it cannot be heard and guess what it cant even run because youll tackle it before it can react finally there is no chase because you can destroy your target and completely hide again before the locals can respond your suggestion is much closer to i want to be a kid with a magnifying glass vs an ant colony i want informed pvp i want both consensual and nonconsensual pvp i want scouts that can somewhat estimate enemy forces i want ambushes i want chases i want gang compositions that utilize tactics beyond decloak tackle target jam target f1f1f1f1 recloak you dont need to be invisible to ambush people in this game i ambush people all the time even with local as it is you send a portion of your 30man gang through to get the other 15man gang to engage and then you come through with the rest if they dont recon you they are in a lot of trouble if they do recon you they can avoid trouble or perhaps theyll suicide into you just for a fun fight or suicide for a juicy target or they will try to split up your forces and take you apart piecewise or theyll team up with another gang in the area to take you on ive personally fcd all of these scenarios and guess what i need to be able to recon an enemy force to make this happen the good pilot of a freighter or slow ship sends a scout through to give recon on the other side of a gate they bring the vulnerable ship through when there is no gate camp or when they feel they have an adequate escort in your scenario you cant actually get reliable recon on the other side you claim a goal is to make actively intel gatheriing important but youre removing the ability to get intel on cloakers youre removing the ability to get intel on docked pilots your making it implausable to get a realistic idea of ships in space and your making it very difficult to ascertain which direction an enemy is fleeing
seriously though ratting is too unintuitive and too repetitiveid like some more fun with my grind please
its a bit too far i thinkthe core idea is solid though  make rats more interesting i think rats that move between belts or systems are a cool idea i think that the sleeper ai needs to be applied to all rats even if they dont have the same offensivedefensive power as sleepers and sansha incursion ratsi would laugh at finding a serpentis mining op in fountain though if you added t2 ships for rats you expand the possibility of t2 salvage and change the price matrix for t2 rigs
ban riverini pleaseover and out
im splitting this up into a few parts to explain what why how as well as a counter if you dont like the wall of text skip to the bottom for a rough explanation tldr at the bottomwhatcurrently local in null sec is like every where else in kspace when someone enters system local updates to show them this is partly a social aspect in most areas of kspace but in null sec and low sec it is an intelligence aspectto explain this to some of you that have never been to null people rat in a system in relative safety when a hostile enters they all warp to safety pos station cloaked in a safe spot etc aside from removing part of the risk in null it does help bots they can immediately react to a hostile entering and safe up players do occasionally miss a hostile entering system ill be upfront and say while it would put a damper on botting this is not in my list of concernswhythe game mechanic of local as explained in the lore and a few devgm posts im too lazy to look up to link is that when people jump into a system the gate informs all players already in the system of this gates are neutral so they dont belong to any corporation or alliance they simply exist they share intel with everyoneto a point this makes sense but it would also make sense to be able to hack the gate and hide intel from your enemies when you own a systemthis has been requested numerous times but it seems no one can agree because it does favor the defending alliance if sharing the intel which is why i propose a counter later in the post if hiding intel from everyone people will argue it makes the risk too greathowmy suggestion is to add an ihub upgrade that will disable local for all except the alliance holder standings would not apply so blues flying through the space would lack local as well the upgrade should require a strategic index of 5when enabled it would be like wspace for all but the holding alliance names only displaying if someone talks and then staying indefinitely the holding alliance would see a delayed local not an instant local they can leave it alone and keep the instant local for all no changei chose to withhold the information from standings blues to discourage the upgrade from being installed in every system all the major alliances have blues that travel through their space if major routes get this upgrade they will be forced to travel nearly blind this should help encourage alliances to only install the upgrade in strategically important systemscounterin the ship tree rework where they are giving destroyers and battlecruisers their own racial skills a dev mentioned that racial destroyer only unlocks 1 ship where as all other racial skills unlock 3 or more makes it kind of a waste my suggestion is to add a new tier 2 destroyer of which the tech 1 is a standard upgraded destroyer and the tech 2 is a black ops gate hackerthe blops gate hacking destroyer can interface with an enemy gate and obtain the current local list the module used for this cycles automatically as long as it is running the local list is updated at the start of each cycle this information is shared with the entire fleet of the user the skill required reduces cycle time to give a more realtime listif the module is interrupted canceled or the ship is destroyed the local list simply stops updating for the fleetthis ship works for the alliance holding the system as well so they can hack their own gate and get real time localof course its just a destroyer so its fairly fragile youll need a few if you want to actually make use of them long term its a low end ship and another reason for a new player to take racial destroyer to 5seems to make ratting in null easieryes and no delayed local is enough time to find and destroy someone sure you wont get multiple targets but intel channels still exist when one dies the others will be informed anyway it discourages afk cloaky alts that people seem to be into using lately as it would be more worthwhile to keep their presence out of system until they want to kill someone i suspect all popular ratting systems will get this upgrade and thats the main reason for suggesting delayed local instead of real timetldr  conclusionremove local from null via an ihub upgrade needing strategic index 5 only people in the alliance can see a delayed local all others have no local including standings blues discourages upgrading all systems add a new ship destroyer class to counter it by targeting a gate and using a module sharing the local list with his fleet as long as the module remains activei was bored and it was just a thought not sure if its a good one but thought id share
living in null sec for a while i dunno about this seems like a double edge swordsometimes just me and my buds hanging out scanning sites mining or gate camping then all of the sudden local goes from 10 players to 60 in 5 seconds thats when we either safespot or jump or wait till they jumpi do like wormholes with no local i think if people actually used their directional scanner like they should they would prefer this option but i know some alliances that would cut you for even suggesting itpersonally im on the fence in the end doesnt matter ccp makes the decision and we it is gotta adapt
if people dont like local live in whs problem solved the amarr empire is known for its omnipresent religion UFFFD
keep in mind its elective the alliance decides where local is disableddelayed the default is no change everything is as it is now they install the upgrade to change it so if an alliance doesnt like it  dont use it just another tool in the sandbox
1 for effort and its not a mindless attempt to get the game changed in your favouri would love an ihub upgrade that disables all information on the world map page creating complete dead zones where no one knows what is going on apart from the people liv
id be for it but only if there is something either a special type of probe infra upgrade or deployable added that allows you to also either detect cloaked ships or someway of knowing that theyre in system without them having to talk of course not without a little work so a probe would be good for this alliances could have designated scanners to periodically scan the system for any pests
well the defending alliance still gets delayed local in the upgraded systems hostiles need only bring the new ship suggested or use probes to find out whos in system and like wspace theres always dscan
a common thought in these changing how local works threads is changing how dscan works also make it less annoying to use  any thoughts on that
1my point exactlyremoving local is not gonna stops bots by anymeansthey will do it using othermeans like gate fire effect or sound of gate fire and i am sure there are many other ways the only reason why they use local is cos its easier and not cos it
sounds like a pretty interesting idea i like how it gives the possibility for the introduction of another ship type using destroyer hulls 1 for offering something new
youd have to be at the gate then so youd just you know see them on your overviewit is possible to make things impossible if the data isnt there its not there you cant magically know if the server chooses not to send it then neither you nor bots will know about it perioddscan helps but oh wait bombers get a bomber or a few with points warp in cloaked find target uncloak target point there you go got him no counter other than having a scout inline between systems that dont have the upgrade that is countered by logging out and waiting log in after a while and grab a random target it becomes a lot easier to catch bots as well as normal rattersbut as i said that is not the intended function just a side effect as for local and wormholes and everything thats great if you wanna be fairly locked down to 1 system or want to be scanning all the time my idea is about adding another feature another tool for alliances to play with its not forcing anything on anyone the change is additive an alliance need only use it if they wish to and a counter was provided for those wishing that alliance harmthis suggestion adds more dynamic to eve and gets away from every system is the same null sec is null sec you should have more control over systems you own  within reason i personally think itd be cool to be able to use different tactics for different systems this idea emphasizes scouting even more than it is now it adds a new ship and role for people to aim for and it keeps the sandbox fresh with another set of tools to bend the universe to your will its possible someone will come up with some crazy way to use this idea that had nothing to do with any of my original intentions but thats what i love about eve
as a highly unproductive member of this eve society i approve of said idea i myself would love to see local removed in nullsec and this is a great way to go about it the defenders should have an advantage when defending or flying in their own space 1 i love this ideaedit for editing
wait let me get this straight a cfc publord wants to remove local how will you know when to warp out of the belt in your drake when we come riding into town
remove it in high sec and low sec as wellas it is now wartargets dock up when entering localalso when a couple of 10 pirates enter local the minerbots tend to dock up
woops i meant to include low in there as well however i seemed to have forgotten to mention it as for highsec its a whole different monster entirely it should be nerfed into the ground and be used as a noobs training ground let them have their localyou do bring up a fair point dealing with miner bots and dealing sweet justice though perhaps just leave it delayed in highsec due to concord influenced or some such
no highsec should remain highly secure that means the local naviesconcord monitor the gates even closer local stays
exactly this is a constant drag upon eve that ccp cant get small bugs fixed insted of catering to goons  test and new costumers
supportedafter sifting through all the useless flamewarring in this topic i think its worth saying that if this really isnt working as intended it needs to be fixed as such a small issue it deserves some attention because frankly it makes sence for small easy to fix changes to get some attention because theyre more likely to get changesalso all this flaming is daft and ridiculous started by a rude oper aggravating an easily aggravated troll drake who is further aggravated by the appearance of a troll who usually manages to disagree with everything without really making any sence tigerthat is allin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
lol this still like this  fail ccp anyway as this works currently 1 run finishes after another thus in my oppinion it should take x  of the first ram item then next run take x of the first item if it has enough etc if this is intended to work as it is right now why dont all the runs run simotaniously eg lets say your makeing 10 cakes and you need half kg of wheat per cake meaning you need 5 kgobviously you dont need 10 kg of wheat and open every single one of them and use half of each but thats how the rams work right nowwich is plain stupid 
ccp please fix this 
this thread just should dieit is painfull when i read op ahhhgr my brain stupidity is hurting me
ok i will try to explain in simple terms a bpo fresh off the market lets say for a battlecruiser costs what again a few hundred million big sink right from the start looking at eve central a drake bpo costs over 300 million now lets say you buy that bpo it is inefficient ok now what research the bpo that will also take time and iskby the time you are finished you could have bought a bpc for under 1 million built your drake army and still have millions of isk to spend on fittings and other goodsit makes no sense for a noob to purchase any bpo because the majority of veterans who have invested time and money into bpo research have made it very lucrative to use bpc and not bpo and still be able to manufacture as many ships as possible without ever owning a bpounless you plan on playing eve online for the next 23 years then a bpo may actually pay for itself and you can start making a profit
ok then ill do my research  thanks for the info i wrote the not trolling thing because of much people starts to be annoyed by stupid topics including me nothing else thanks again 
no problem o7welcome to eve online hell stop the evemail spam
ccp do not change my merlin to a hybrid boat add missiles not guns if the missiles are inadequate for pvp then upgrade them gallente are good with hybrid turrets do not contaminate caldari ships with that trash
its called a kestrel you moran
what trash you mean the stuff theyve had since the startbiomass yourself
quite the opposite have you heard of the changes being made to capacitor batteries they will now have a chance to mitigate nosferatu drain and reflect energy neutralizers back at the offending shipedit oh yeah nosferatus might be altered to give a continual energy drain but at a lower amount if the target ships capacitor is lower than yours
this nerf you speak ofits always been like that as far as i can tellyeah its changingbut thats not a nerf in my eyesand even thennoss are not that great in comparsion to a nuet anyway stop the evemail spam
the op is referring to an old nerf that happened back in the day both nos and neuts used to zap a portion of a target ships capacitor but the nos transferred that zapped cap into the host ship ccp deemed this as op and nerfed the nos to what it is now it only works when your capacitor level is below the targets
must have been before my time thenop might want to put a little context into his post before confusing the hell out of everyone else even thenid rather wait until new mods are out firstnot supporting stop the evemail spam
yeah old nos used to take cap from your target and give it to you at no cost to yourself nos was a neut that cost no cap to run and in fact gave you cap for running in the result was everyone had nos fitted and nobody ever used neuts this was selfevidently stupid silly op wants to return to itthe current system where neuts are offensive and nos is defensive is far better whether the mods are performing properly in those roles can be debated but the principles of operation of the two module classes are excellent
not its not nosferatu has only become useful for frigates but for every other class its useless
and eccm is never really useful on frigates but only on larger hulls  so what is your point we should strive for diversity in eve the fact that some modules are less valuable on some hulls is a good thing if nos were to become useful on say battleships then additional mechanics need be put in place to guarantee that they will only ever be of use against ships of same or bigger size 
id better take this nos off my proteus then your idea would make neuts useless why would you think that was a good idea
i wouldnt mind seeing a reversal of the nos nerf for ships with a bonus to them amarr and blood raider and leave them as is for all other ships types
with cap batteries being given an anti nos role i would love to see nos buffed back to 2004 but with more buff to cap batteries or just a change to nos so that it gives you 50 cap if you are lower than them
actually if anything they should be based on the sell orders because i doubt people who do pi for profit just dump their stuff on buy ordersbuy orders are for when you have some left over crap that you just want to dump somewhere and make a quick buck off ofalso as someone who lives in lowsec i think the concord pi taxes should go up especially for tier 0 and tier 1 products as far as risk vs reward goes i think doing pi in lowsec is a little underwhelmingi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
also imagine the tears if it got ganked and a large majority of the ships droppedi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
yes
yup exactly the grown up mature attitude developers want to be dealing with that will make them listen
i agree with t2 ships been insured better as a miner i think we need a ship to have a tank but can mine too like hulks but thats not going to work as it will be to easy to make isk and the market will be out of whack  so if we need to have more tank then we need a cost to yield and cargo space to balance things out
i though op pointed that with delaying of local there would come mechanics of finding cloaks  requiring effort 
in the other thread they mention a little about scanning down cloakers however cloaked pilots typically wont appear in local meaning you have no reason to scan for them additionally with his mechanics a cloaker can come into local any time logging in or by gates or whs and there is no indication of the new arrival for a scanning mechanic to really make sense dont you think you need some indication that you should scan
well if they jump through gates or wormholes you can spot them and even kill themi agree though logging in system could somehow be tweakednot really
yeah i hope ccp will do something with 00 soon the game really stagnates in there
im not sure what peoples obsession with going backwards is all you really seem to be suggesting is slow eve down to a crawl so that i can shoot more people at gate camps
instant force projection is a bit of a problem as i understand it im not against the ability to sling your ships across the region at a moments notice but i agree its too cheapeasy and needs to be made more challenging as it stands surprise has very little value in warfare when the enemy can respond in a matter of minutes assuming their pilots are onlinetaking away warptozero will just make nullsec less navigable and more tedious than it is today you wont be making eve bigger youll just be slowing down transit and making it easier for people to lose ships to mindless smasheverything gate camps
i was under the impression titans already couldnt use their jump bridges inside a pos shield as far as i know they just stick their head out of the shield to activate the module but theyre still vulnerable during that time as the ship is not considered inside the shieldperhaps make it impossible to activate the bridge module within a certain number of kilometers from a nearby pos shield if possible
titans can and typically do bridge people from inside the pos shields
this is preventable by just pulling people out of warp 15 km from the gate as if there was a bubble around the gate but not one that would prevent warpingoff from inside it
why not do the job properly by removing all jumpdrives titan bridges and jumpbridges and make all ships require fuel to drive their engines voila eve is bigger
to be honest now that there is only one jb allowed per system i find the jb network much less problematic this tied in with the fact a warp bubble can pull a ship 500 kms away from their warp destination ie out of pos gun range makes them vulnerable enough that im alright with their current use i wouldnt mind altering cyno generators such that they can be easily disabled by a small gang i think this would allow the disruption of logistics chains by guerilla entities feasible and could severely hinder force projection the problem is engaging anything on a deathstar pos is not easily accomplished by a small 10 gang perhaps if you increased the pos lock times by about 20 it would be much more reasonable in my experience while the lock times of a pos are slow they arent consistent and thats problematic titan bridging is pretty much the main use of a titan unless you have many of them forcing titans to bridge from outside of the pos shields is pretty much a nerf to smaller alliances which cannot truly protect a titan encouraging titans to be a largealliance tool only might sound good but then youre pretty much solidifying powerblocs and making it unncessarily harder on the smaller entities which are already disadvataged a much more balanced solution would be to change the hotdrop mechanics and i dont think cost is quite the right approach although its not a bad idea per se other hot drop alterations might include cyno spoolup timers  such that people have time to react and attack a cyno ship death to all ships en route if the destination cyno is destroyed before you load grid special bridging cynos  new modules needed for bridging which can only be fit to certain classes of ships reduced bridge range  reduce the range of bridging from 7 ly to 3 lys or some such nonsense really significantly reducing the range and creating a longer  time to load grid  period is all thats really needed
nah jbs are wellknown for allowing large alliances to project power over vast distances within 30 minutes so might as well do the job properly and remove them altogether same goes for titan bridges and jump drives way too easy to project power and haul goods its time we got ccp to make the universe feel big again
ccp supports griefing so much now if it removed local the game would see fewer industrialists than ever griefers get it all including pathetically tanked hulks as targets industrialists have practically nothin tldr keep local the amarr empire is known for its omnipresent religion UFFFD
not if theyre all as weak willed as you no they dont but i know that they arent all like you so thats a moot pointthis idea has some potential i can see some will oppose it even though they wouldnt have to put it to use and would have some counter to give themselves the ability to use local despite a sov holding alliance removing it in some systems would certainly make things interesting
i have a better ideawhat if only blues showed up fully in local and neutrals just showed up as an unknown unless they talkedso youd see a blank portrait with a question mark and an unknown instead of a name everybody wins
it also makes at least as much sense that youd be able to hack the gate and prevent your enemies from using it at all let alone for intelthe gate and local systems really seem to stand apart from sovereignty
local in player sov null sec is not realisticwhere concord or the npc nullsec owners are present it might make sense that they impose everybody to be publicly detectable a sov 00 should require a specific structure that requires sov to be levelled up enough to be anchoredthis way the developed systems would really earn an higher sec status higher sec as in by knowing all who enter and leave they are safer to live into undeveloped borderline systems would really be the nobodys lands this would foster new playstyles nomadic ninjas brigants smugglers and other juicy shady things that can prosper when things are kept quiet
heres how you do it1 open eve source code2 find section of code regarding local in whs3 select it hit crtlc4 find section of code regarding local in nullsec5 select it hit ctrlv6 7 celebrate making nullsec pvp interestinglocal turns 95 of pvp into blobbing station games and posing up stuck in here with me
this is why it is an addition and not a change it adds the option for an alliance to remove local where they choose again i point out that it is elective you can do nothing and leave it as it is live local or an alliance can install the ihub upgrade and remove local for their enemies and delay it for themselves as a byproduct of their hackas for blocking access to the gate entirely its a lot easier to block a signal the game lore can explain the gate hacking in many waystry this way for examplethe ihub upgrade transmits a pattern that creates interference and prevents ships from receiving the local list the upgrade then transmits the list on a different frequency only allied ships know aboutthe ship gate hacking is simply asking the gate for something it normally shares freely so its actually not hacking it this is a list normally given without asking for it the difference is once the ship has the list it transmits it to everyone fleeted in the solar systemblocking access to a gate via hacking would be much more difficult than blocking a simple signalto add it could be like cyno jamming and be a pos mod and therefore be destructible
nah as the search for an i win button continues they will soon be requesting to have the overview removed too
just make local truely delayed  not wh delayif your in system for more then 2 minutes you appear in local when u jump in you have 2 minutes to hunt for bots ratting players people in anoms before they know you are therewhen you jump in you also do not have local for 2 minutes so you might be in an empty system  dscan away works or there can be 100 reds in systemthe ihub upgrade thing can be in it also but for the purpose of alliance members are instantly on dscan maybe blues as well
in 2 minutes i can manually fly to every high value anomalie in system while scanning for complexes
sorry look below for my other post my comp had a fart
yes and no it is very easy to put an alt at 300km facing gate watch or listen for the jump effect and notify the bot to save upmost bots are in dead end system or systems with very little transit so it wont workthe things that drives me most to not liking this change is that its a half fast job at best and it does not fixes the problem and possibly breaks another part of eve have you taken into concideration how op its gonna be not to be able to see you cos there is no local not to be able to dscan you cos you got a cloak and not to be able to probe you cos you got a cloak it makes cloak way too powerfull now add to this black ops and its really really op specially if you are really good with them like be hi be o7 also the idea of upgrading the system to get local i belive is probably one of the worst have you forgotten what ccp did regarding system upgrades in the past well alliances spend billions in upgrades and then ccp decided to nerf it to death with no refunds people cried and did warn that a huge percentage of eve players will leave 00 space goons were among the advocate for the nerf and were deniying that people would leave 00 space now look at us i would estimate that at least 30 of eve left 00 space and it all happened in days people including goons now days are screaming that 00 is empty whats worst is people stopped logging in also as you can imagine i do not want to see this happen all over againalso i like local i like to smack talk in local to both allies and enemies i do not want this feature to be removed cos then how am i gonna talk to alies then
you upgrade the system to remove local not to add it the default is nothing changes it adds the option to remove local if you choose to not the other way around the counter was added so it could be made to not be op for the defender if whatever you are doing requires local get someone in a blops destroyer to target the gate and give you local you cover him and there you go the counter to the counter is just blow up the ship the counter to that is bring more shipsyes you can use a scout but this requires 2 accounts for something 1 used to be able to do more than likely bots will just move to less profitable systems that would not be upgraded i never said it would stop bots and this was not even on the intentions of it just a possible side effect the intention of it is to give alliances another tool to use how they see fitthe idea is alliances choose to remove local from a system not choose to add local to systems the goal behind it is they only remove local from important systems the more i think about it the more i think it should be like a cyno jammer requiring an upgrade and a pos module this lets it be destructible without dealing with reinforcement timers destroy the module and regain real time local for everyone
im not sure how this change would benefit pve players at all in nullsec seems more like a reconbombert3 gank improvement
change was not proposed to benefit anyone directly it helps both sidesif you enable it in your pve systems you most definitely will get more people killed at the same time enabling it in your pve systems discourages afk cloakers as they give away they are in system if they stay  they benefit a lot more staying out of system until they are ready to gank you could gank all day by just cloaking next door insteadyou can enable it in your staging system to deny your enemy a list of who is there to defend if your enemy doesnt know your numbers thats gonna suck for them if you are in a system that is wider than the dscan range you can keep a reinforcement fleet out of that range and your enemy will not know its there unless they are spying or hacking the gatetheres a lot of ways to use it like anything in eve im not intending it for any one thing i just want the tool to be there and let the playersalliances figure out what they want to do with it
okay while were at it we might as well removegatesjump drivesstatic beltsand require probing to do anything meaningful in nullsecbecause if you want wormhole style local why not move to a wormhole
i agree sorta im actually for removing static belts from every part of eve but thats another thread altogetheri dont think removing local from null entirely is a good idea which is why i didnt suggest that its a stupid idea and makes no sense i think that doing this would just make most people leave null andor make blobbing worse travel in blobs to stay safe
if you want to remove local put it behind another channelminimize it and disable flashing problem solved besides people bot with friendlies in local also a few months ago someone did it in our alliance he got caught blown up and his pod was still warping from belt to belt he got reported the end removing local does nothing for bots besides goons have said it before  if you spot a friendly boting dont report them dont shoot them we are not here to do ccp work for them from mouth of th horse himself the mittanii want to talk to both friendlies and enemies in local and this is a dumb no offence  way to fix stuffyou want to remove reinforce timers on pos stations etc emmm sorry mate but this is very bad for the game
you know removing local just means not automatically giving you the full local user list you still get the local window and can talk in it you just dont know who is there unless its your alliance that holds it or you are hacking the gate or they talk
we have no way of knowing who reported a botter fyiwe have that rule because we just dont want to deal with ratting drama because we have better things to do
i thought it was more policya guideline than a rule
so i am gonna be talking to myself or perhaps even talking to a ship that was left on a pos how fun is that why dont you move to a wh you got plenty of that boring nonsence there
the policy is dont petition bluesas we have no way of knowing who made a petition anybody who understands things and doesnt wear a tinfoil hat would realize why that rule exists
terribletrollgif
my point is if you are never gonna enforce no botting within your organization why would you support a change thats not gonna fix the issue specially when your own alliance refuses to take matters in their own hand its ridiculous
because changing game mechanics in some hamfisted attempt to fix botting is stupidbanning bots fixes botting
while i am for bans 2 times  permaban so now its ok to ban other people but not your people double standards anyone
we discourage botting and anybody who talks about botting encourages botting or anything of the sort gets banned from our servicesallowing people to reportshoot bots opens a can of worms of stupid ratting drama that we simply dont want to put up in a 4000 man alliance surrounded by a significantly larger coalition
i hate to say this cos i detest bots but did you ever stopped and thinked that the same thing that you just said above also applies to other alliances how can you even think that this is not ok with the rest but its ok with your alliance so how can you still call for baning and not enforce it in your own alliance stop the hypocracy again no offence
because the task of enforcing the eula comes with a paycheck not a monthly subscription and the people who find bots and mete out the appropriate punishments are actually equipped to do so
halfway through the original post my first thought was what a terrible  idea soon after that my second thought was oh the op is from test why am i not surprised
youre from school of applied knowledge lol
again the same thing can be said for your alliance we are going in circles you cant enforce something that your alliance is happy to do so you are exaclty like them the only difference is you want them banned and not yoursits double standards which ever way you look at it
wow its almost like you dont get the pointwe cant stop anybody from reporting bots but if they choose to beat their chests about it theyre gonehint we dont care if idiots get banned for botting goons or otherwise
clever retort chap but it doesnt change the fact that the ops idea is  terrible
excuse me but you just said your alliance did care a few posts ago cos otherwise the whole drama thing with 4000 people and your enemies next dooras i said you cant enforce something when you dont enforce it yourselves like we did and blew up the guy boting in our own alliance followed by a kick and report i guess you guys are not so keen about removing bots just other peoples bots all bots dead no exceptions
i must admit the ops suggestion is a balanced take on the question and deserves further scruntiny
no you selectively drew whatever conclusion best suits your argumentwhen i said allowing people to reportshoot bots opens a can of worms of stupid ratting drama that we simply dont want to put up in a 4000 man alliance surrounded by a significantly larger coalition i meant that we dont want to deal with situations where its one persons word versus anothersbelieve it or not not everybody that rats in 00 is botting
ofcource not i was not selective at all i read exactly what it says its not my fault you did not word it right but once again somebody in another alliance does not wants to deal with situations where its one persons word versus anothers as you just mentioned so again how can you still argue for ban for boting and not enforce it within your alliance
we dont pay to enforce ccps rulessimple as that
the rest of eve dont pay to enforce ccps rules either but they also understand wrong is wrong and right is rightthe rest of eve also dont pay to have your views imposed to them specially when it does not apply to your alliance simply cos you dont want to it is simple as that
you seem to think that bots need to be reported for ccp to do anything about them
you seem to think that removing local will get rid of bots news flash anything can be hacked anything all you need is but an interest to do so and a camera or an alt or direct memory adressing or any other method out thereyou simply will regretfully never get rid or botters and therefore removing local does not solve the issuethink about it how long did that pl hack existed before it got reported if it wasnt cos it got reporte by pl ccp would never know anythign can be hacked
i do live in a whthe reason i do so is local makes nullsec uselessit needs to be at the very least 510min delayed stuck in here with me
no it does notif somebody takes a ton of enjoyment from spamming dscan theyll just move to wormholesthe only people who care about local in nullsec are those who want to move 30 dudes around somebodys space absolutely undetected because they failed at the spaceholding game and went wulfpax
what kind of a ridiculous game would eve become without local 45000 players all clicking dscan every 2 seconds 2357 rofl a laughing stock of the mmo world the amarr empire is known for its omnipresent religion UFFFD
terrible no one will want to play it specially new players not to mention the uncesary traffic in every systemi would have to hot key dscangosh terrible ideaall this super computers we got at home these days and 99 of the time we would spend dscaning
good explanation also support this proposal and ccp needs to fix itccp is too busy nerfing and breaking various things in game for long time to bother with actually fixing something easyalso drake draconis is only troll ignore him
fix this  ccp also nerf tracking dreads
sooooo your beef is with older players then because thats not a problem with feature bloatit depends on what you intend to do if you find a general location where the local market is anemic and can gain a steady stream of cheap minerals you can turn a tidy little profit off an unresearched bpo ex solitude region as it is a patch of highsec surrounded by low and nullsec space residents of that place either have to make their own stuff or buy it at high pricesnow if you want to do things the hard way yes it takes time just like everything else in the game you dont become a good pvper without putting in time effort and isk do you
wow you really are a  idiot
ugh why respond to the troll
then why would anyone use neuts this whole thread is facepalm the op wants to make a class of modules nos more useful but is oblivious to the fact that his proposal would make another class neuts even less useful
anyone else have any suggestions lets keep this thing goingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
monthbump
i was about to open a new thread but the search engine came up with this one and its actual enoughwas it ever discussed by ccp do we know why on earth they turned precious corpses into worthless items i dont think that corpse names should be too stressing for the system seeing as ships get named and renamed by thousands every day without ccp doing anything about iti only discovered this yesterday after taking the body of a clumsy moron that never stops babbling in localonly to find out i cant link him his corpsealso my collection of corpses in jita is now worth zero some of them were acquired after good fights and there were anecdotes related to many of themall those moments will be lost like tears in rain ffs ccp
10
1now i just have a hangar full of nameless corpses this isnt the holocaust they must be remembered for who they were while i touch them for their familys sake
could you imagine what the famous guiding hand social club heist would have been without a named corpse to tell the taledid ccp realize that amazing playerdriven storytelling has been completely annihilated by this no more payinggetting money for hits with the named corpse as the proof kms arent the same as delivering the bodyno more corpse collecting to remember your epic battlesno more stories like that capsuleer space graveyardno more knowing you have the real ultimate proof of your enemys demise on your cargostation after a good dirty fightno more trading of named corpses there was a real market for this with famous capsuleers being worth more than commonersat the very least i would like to hear a convincing explanation from ccp i dont doubt its justified although ccp does fix what is not broken occasionally but so far i havent heard or read whythis just made eve a little bit less interesting and a little bit more bland
i dont think name changes will ever be appropriate for a game like eve trust is hardearned and your name is your reputation being a thief in eve isnt some arbitrary choice you make at the beginning of the game that dictates what skills you are given when you level up thief is a title that is placed upon you by the community because of your larcenous activities titles like this are irrevocably tied to your name if you could just change your name on a whim that entire dynamic goes out the window
just because other mmos do it does not mean that it would be good for eveas for your happy customer maths nobody is going to quit playing eve because they cant change their namejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
i would only support this if heavy restrictions were placed upon its usage such as changing the name of a character will permanently lock it to that account
i still like thisalso we can now have three word names this wasnt an option for many of us
i also agree with t2 insurance but only to a degreethe rest of the op really does seem to lean towards wanting the game to be more of a terraria where you cant be killed unless pvp is switched on
and yet without the kiddies this game wont grow have you seen what happens to new players one jump outside of the starter systems i have and was a victim of a notorious corp that gets its kicks off killing newbs unless youve got a solid background in pvp in other games its a very nasty surprise and has caused more then one very capable person i know irl to quit eve and never look back just about every mmo out there has a protection feature for the new player usually its aimed at the trials sometimes its a level restricted benefityou came back with how it separates the wheat from the chaff you dont address the real issue i had to deal with newb grief so you should too doesnt hold water with me its the majority of the reason why i babysit the new players my corp picks up from the starter systems that way the greifers dont get the easy kills they seem to be looking to get quite frankly it gets boring having to do thatim sorry that you think others just arriving should go through the hell we did id rather explain to them that their first two weeks in game had massive protection and that people can and will kill them just for kicks now that its expired at least then we can properly educate them in how to defend themselves against a potential newb killerthat said make a suggestion on how to bring something like the supershield in line with protecting the new player while not being able to be abused horriblydont know if you actually read what id posted or not but there were some very strict restrictions placed on that protection module ie it cant be used in lownull at all with the exception of 04 space as a precaution we want to keep the new players not drive them into oblivion
youre completely correct on this however lets at least give them the chance to make a full decision on their own not force the decision on them by letting them get killed all the time a ragequit seems to be the ultimate goal of most highend players go ahead try to get someone to do so just dont do to the people who are still just learning the dynamics of this gamepeople are taking this game way too seriously that theyre becoming shortsighted to the ultimate goal of keeping new blood in this game without the new players that some people take great pleasure in killing on sight this game will dieif you dont like the idea as ive laid it out please feel free to make suggestions to modifying it to bring it in line with the rest of the game without completely gutting it
im going to call it by its real name im a giant pussy and i need extra coddling act
wow a troll how cutewhere exactly did i state that it couldnt be modified
unlike eve darkfall has lots of terrain and structures that can be used to naturally conceal yourself in eve due to both local and the overview theres no point hiding behind an asteroid youll be seen regardless it doesnt even impede people from shooting at you so in this sense eve is a much more simplistic game and it requires invisibility for hiding to function at allyou said you read my post linked in the op so you know ive suggested a form of cloak hunting so yes i do think it would be good for eve in the context i have framed im not making a proposal here on cloak hunting until we can get past the first hurdle which is local chat what with gate camps and cyno bait ships stealth ambush and evasion should be a tool thats usable by the few against the many not just for the many to blob the few by making intel hard to get you make active intel gathering more important if it were easy you wouldnt need players as scouts making a real effort to get intel its true that with just this proposal and not the other ideas from the larger thread linked in the op covops ships would be very hard to scout out at all but once local is dealt with i support new cloak detection methods so long as they require effort are in the spirit of cat and mouse and are largely useless at gate camps no i didnt remove the ability to get intel on docked pilots theres always a means for showing them in the new local system albeit not always easily they show instantly in low and high sec and via either the scanner array or titan in hostile sov null and also by standings in npc null failing that you can get general estimates on numbers from map statsalso making active intel gathering more important is just one goal i also said i want to take away free flawless intel on a silver platter and boost stealthguerrilla warfare type gameplay
you understand that boosting stealthguerrilla warfare type gameplay will come at the expense of finding targets in the first place right you want more ratter kms but you wont get many because the ratters wont be there when its obvious that some bomber pilot that can fly around almost completely free of any risk of detection let alone interception can tackle you the moment he decloaks
do a lot of goonswarm ratters get killed by solo bombers already i would have thought the mighty cfc would be able to protect their own space from ships that blow up from someone sneezing at them
a bomber can get a point on you even if youre aligned  this is how you kill the idiots who think that ratting is fine with hostiles in local as long as theyre alignedalso stop trying to deflect  discuss the points ive made not your little grudge against goonswarm or whatever
a bomber can die to a flight of unbonused drones im not saying a bomber cannot kill a ratter i think it should be able to but its not like the ratters are defenseless against themas for targets there arent many anyway theres lots of things to fix in eve and another is risk vs reward balance nullsec without current local intel deserves to have much more reward than high sec with its concord protection however if people choose less reward for less risk so be itthat was no deflection it was a point related to your comments you have 1000s of allies as an alliance loads of isk and good organization and youre posting how solo bombers are going to force the most powerful alliance in eve from ratting in their own space with the removal of the current local chat do you not see the silliness of that and i have nothing against goons in eve i consider you as a group an asset to eves sandbox
local chat does not provide any sort of safety in and of itself it requires constant vigilance to work you have to keep your eye on intel channels local dscan if youre particularly paranoid unlike in hisec where you still have the chance of being bailed out by concord once youre caught youre deadyou can also observe a ratters habits  does he always warp to the station when hostiles show up in local does he warp to a pos does he rat aligned nothing stops you from getting a pull bubble on the station or the safe pos if hes too slippery well hes just prepared removing local when you have static celestials that you can warp to without probing and static routes through nullsec is beyond dumb
thats i somewhat true but i still miss a point why normal warfare and teamwork should sufferdue to local  for sake so people can solo rat in peacewhats more important in this game warfare and teamwork or solo ratting 
wtf  teamwork and delayed local is incoherent thingsthis topic nothing else just crying about how give an idiot idea to god mode for cloaking fags
whats the matter tell us how you really feel
last time i visited goons a small fleet of mine put a drag bubble up between a station and a jump bridge and caught lots of good targets warping between them we were outnumbered 20to1 in system and they eventually formed up to kill us at which point we scattered thats guerilla warfarei often put bubbles up on gates and camp it in a solo frigate or a small group where we often kill the scouts of bigger gangs and other people that land in the bubble when done in an overwhelming hostile region thats guerilla warfare ive done the afksb in a ratting system although i find this tactic boring and pathetic its a form of guerilla warfare ive used cloaky tacklers in agile gangs to catch and destroy straggling ships of larger gangs this is especially fun to do to bss returning from a sov op thats guerilla warfare none of these scenarios required us to be completely invisible to the enemy there are lots of tactics to take on bigger fleets too druka bss bombing runs with sbs cloaky dictors to split up enemies into bitsized meals flyby snipers etc i can provide you with many examples where agonys been signficantly outnumbered and outgunned and used tactics and surprise to take on superior numbers we dont need easymode ambush and evade not when we have a fairly balanced version of it now stealth does not equal invisibility anonymity can easily provide you with the ability to hide aka stealth have you ever tried to find waldo if a stranger comes into system they might be friend or foe if friendly strangers are the norm then unfriendly strangers can often sneak by why isnt this enough for you it really sounds like youre asking for easymode stealth where there is very little chance of being found stealth should be about avoiding detection not removing all ability to be detected additionally a good mechanic for stealth should require much more skill than putting a covert cloak on your ship first of all when your proposal unbalances cloaks you really need to include the extras that bring them back into balance secondly your extras do nothing to make hunting an aware cloaker in system even remotely viable have you ever tried probing down a ship that knows youre probing them its tedious as the ship warps whenever probes appear on scan usually for probing to work your target needs to be slow andor oblivious to the probes the only thing youll catch with your anticloak technology are afk cloakers overall this proposal has several huge problems which you seem to gloss over as intended design or unimportant reasons why this proposal will never happen a in your design there is no way a target in space can evade being caught by a covert gang the only defense they have is to prevent the cloakys coming into system unrealistic or hope the cloakers never come unrealistic ie covert cloakers  god modeb intel in sovnull becomes extremely onesided you give it to the owners of a system on a silver platter because they built an outpost which are easy to build and prevelant in todays eve economy their opponents have to frieghter in an easytodestroy scanner array or bridge in a titan lol by the way none of these things involve actively gaining intel c finding targets to shoot is exceedingly difficult in your design especially for a medium sized gang in order for pvp to happen you have to be able to find a target d you come across as exceedingly ignorant of current ingame tactics and your proposal wreaks of give me easymode ambushing easymode evasion and other obnoxious imbalances to ensure onesided pvp one sided mechanics typically ruin good gameplay not make it better
he just needs his medshell start having seizures here in a minute stop the evemail spam
its not like theres many people doing anything out in nullsec outside of fleets anyways so might as well just get it over with and remove local altogether so peoplell stop whining about how local is such a powerful intel tool
because most people believe having an intel tool local that provides us with too much information is far better than only having a blatantly inadequate intel tool dscan i understand that wh dwellers get by alright with only dscan but they also have much better rewards sleepers that switch targets and limited outsider traffic due to wh mechanics
due to recent changes with regards to the orca  rorquals corporate hangers i would propose a small change  make the right click open to access the orca  rorqual ore hold for all members of fleet this way the industrial command ships and capital industrial ship can be used by the fleet as intended mining barges redheaded step children to the exhumersplease for the love of god either add a module  gas cloud strip harvester designed for us with mining barges  exhumers or remove the turret fitting requirement for the gas cloud harvesters and give the procurer a 300 bonus to gas harvest yield so that it has a purpose much like the skiff with mercoxit as right now it has pretty much none as the training time difference between it and a retriever is your logoff f time for the night
ive often supported better insurance payouts for t2 ships but lately ive begun to see the opposite side of the coin flying t2 t3  faction ships should be risky in regard to insurance it comes down to the most basic rule of eve dont fly what you cant afford to replace i know it sounds harsh but eve is a harsh gamenot supporting
if you want free ships then maybe you should do a better job at managing your finances stop the evemail spam
i think you are confusing force projection with a feeling of its a small world the eve universe is actually a very very big place if you wander off the main trade routes and go exploring systems most of your suggestions seem geared towards slowing down the ability to project power and not to increase the perceived size of the universei completely agree that if it can be built it should be able to be destroyedi have actually advocated for cyno spool up in the past and i do still feel it is a very necessary tool to not make hot dropping a less immediate thing im also not particularly opposed to modifying the use of jump bridges  maybe adding a mass dependent spool up time on these as well increasing the cost of jumping ships via jump bridgetitan bridge will just be passed onto the consumer of all moon goo products as the price to fight for and hold the good moons just got more expensiveremoving warp to 0 will just make things slower and probably lead to more jb networks in null sec not less as the time to mobilize a force basically autopilot to the target system engage the target and return will be prohibitvly time consuming for the casual player most sov grinds already take hours of being on grid not counting the time it takes to actually form the fleet and transit i think it will just lead to a more stagnant null sec tbh which is what the op seems most concerned about
eve is a harsh game
its called consequencewhy didnt you stop training at some point if you knew you would fly small stuff all the time for example at a 5mil clone price you can easily do smallscale pvp with that amount of skillpoints
no because you picked on the arazu
im going to go ahead and say no on this but im not going to be and asshat and make fun of your idea for the simple reason that i like the fact that you at lease had an idea and werent afraid to post itnow the reasoning behind the no force reconnaissance cruisers already have the capability to fit a covert ops cloaking device and can warp cloaked thus precluding their need for a further means of covert surveillance you can move around pretty much undetected unless you happen to  up and warp to zero programming this would be an overwhelming pain in the  for ccp and as a result would probably get swept under a rug somewhere or forgotten about for a few years as other major issues that have come up are just now being addressed server strain that would be produced by hundreds of people using at a time would get ridiculous because you know that people would abuse them when they first came out especially if youre trying to share the view from the probe amongst several other players or hundreds of players in larger fleetsbut i at least give you credit for having an idea and putting it up on here for everyone to see dont get discouraged and keep them coming this is how the sandbox gets improved well that and if draconis would stop posting and actually play the game mr i dont want to be a pet but am suddenly one of cfcs pets hilariousi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i dont really see the point i just sit on grid and watch stuff ohwaitis that too much risk for you
i have to admit the probecam idea has meritjust that bit stop the evemail spam
90 of the arguments against my idea didnt even read the proposal just the titleim going to say this one more time then start ignoring everyone that obviously did not read itthe proposal is not to have the default be no localthe proposal leaves everything as it is now but adds an ihub upgrade that when installed makes the holding alliance have delayed local and everyone else have no local in the system which it is installedheres how i looked at itsome people think there should be no local in null sec some people think local in null sec is a must havei think eve is a sandbox and everyone wants different things so i came up with something in the middle whyremove local from null sec entirely and most people will leave null secadd an upgrade to add local back and almost every system will get itadd an upgrade that simply removes local and it will see little to no useadd an upgrade that removes local only for enemies straight up and every system will have iti tried to think of something in the middle instead of just being install this in every system its what systems would this be useful init has pros your enemies cant see local and cons your allies cannot see local either and your alliance gets delayed local it has a counter a ship which can hack the gate and give your fleet a live local list and it adds a new ship type to the game in a class that even ccp says really needs more ship types
so basically you want this ihub upgrade to take a system from being as it is now to a delayed local for the alliance which owns the system just to remove local from everyone elsegood luck with that itll be one of those upgrades which are never used because the delay scares them remove local and be done with it
i do not feel this is a good ideai personally wouldnt like that someone could shoot the upgrade and now i am left without localthere are far more things that need fixing like sov pos and faction warfare not to mention that this makes the attacker always have the upper hand this is specially true when your enemy is far more bigger than your alliance we have enough upgrades to worry about to add more
we dont need solutions to removing local removing local is the solutionremove it already damn it every whereno not delay remove umalice redeemeru  post if you are unsubing over the new inventory posted 20120523 0139
maybe make local an upgradeable asseta system thats held by sov wont have local channel at firstallow alliances to upgrade systems at a cost to implement an active transmitter relay networkor better yet make it a costly pos module like an entire pos to run the thingtherefor it will become a developable asset but will also be vulnerable to destructionpop the atrn module at an enemies pos covertcyno in a fleet later while local is downprofit
didnt read the proposal then every system would just be upgraded and thats boring

thisi get what the op is saying but i neither agree with the proposed change nor how he decided to attempt to get his point across
well i get now that my sarcasm doesnt always get understood but its also frustrating that a bug like this exist after so many years and i know that can be cut n dry sorta say but ya i can only say that i do have aspergers and add although thats not an excuse its a explaination but it doesnt change that some people choose to focus on verbal expression of my writing without actually thinking about the bug and my explaination on it they choose to make it about me cause of the way i delivered it when simple they could have choosen to ignore me and my post completely but instead choose to derial my post and point because of itmaybe im a idiot for thinking that people actually want a better game but the facts stands clearly the build window quote shows an incorrect amount of rams need for any blueprints that need rams at a x amount of runs and it is clearly to me that cause for this must lie in the way that window round up or down the build cost and since rams arent an integer but a percentage of 1 it must be converted to a number and for veldspar ii mining crystalls its 15 of 1 but thats 0015 of ram and that whould be rounded to 0 so none whould be used thus i must conclude that its being rounded up to 1 and then timed with with amount of runs this is very logical for me and the way i think and i have had alot annoyences over this cause i have several t2 blueprints and i have to build some of them in a correct order if i dont ill have to build less and less and this is because i build for cycle of days and i wont be able to do that when i dont have the incorrect amount of rams and its really alot of rams i need every month and its alot of extra build time we are talking well over 10000 rams and rams take more time and is really big congestion in my production cause of one single little big bugso yes i apologize my for undetected sarcasm and ask people to show support for getting ccp to spend UFFFD and hour to repair a simple math bug that prevents me for clicking build even though everything i have is correctthank you all and even you drake i truely did laugh from the start when i wrote the post and to this one cause i do realize not everybody can understand the thoughts of different think but highly intelligent person disclaimer  the last 2 paraphrase may or may not have included sarcasm

shamless bump
its not your merlinlooks like this thread has run its course due to op not providing reasonable opinions on the matter  going with the me me me i want format
the rokh can project dps out over 300km away if needed it isnt meant to be doing huge dps thats why it doesnt get the hybrid damage bonus honestly if you want the 25 damage bonus of the hyperion then fly the fking hyperion dont cry on the forums until ccp homogenizes their game a little more if ccp bent over every time someone bled on the forums there would just be 1 race and 1 weapon system
need more support for this venturei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i am for this change 110 bounty hunting is a jokeedit i would like to add that this is one of the best suggestions i have ever seen in this forum and have supported similar proposals in the past 1 for op
overall i like your idea of bounties and you get a 1 from mei do think its possible to make some kind of system that would allow corporations to respond to corp theft  scamming via bounty contracts one way would be that if you do not have current killrights you could only call a bounty contract on someone who is currently in or has recently been in your corporation  alliance and only through a corporate vote where the usual shareholders get a saythis would allow you to respond to corp theft with a bounty of course thered have to be a significant bribe to concord to facilitate the creation of kill rights which means its not something you do lightly maybe 25 of the bounty payout or something to that effect meaning that even if nobody takes out the target you lose 25 of the iskanother type of contract i would love to see is a hitman sort of contract where you can be hired to kill and pod a pilot it would be different from bounty contracts in that it pays out a set amount of isk upon the termination of the pod does not transfer any kill rights would incur sec loss if completed in highsec and is only assignable to an individual pilot in essence youd create a contract with a spaceship hitman to kill your target and if he does this he gets the isk you could specify a minimum isk value loss to your target for the payout to be triggered so he cant just convo the target and agree to kill his ibis and implant free clonethese hitman contracts could then cover all the criminal activities that arent corp theft or provide killrights obviously these contracts are illegal and so you can only set them up in lowsec and nullsec stations and once the target is killed there could be a probability that the author of the contract is discovered by concord and given a seclossalso such hitman contracts would only be visible to the author and the hitman the target should not be notified that someone has been hired to kill them
naw then his buddies kill the offender to keep the bounty money in the corpfleetetc so maybe they arent making isk hand over fist like now but they are able to quickly neutralize inconvenient bounties before going out on nightly rampage as long as bounty paid is close to value destroyedi think the idea of being able to limiting the bounty collectors to a list of certain approval corps or people is essential to preserving most of the punch for your bounty isk or failing that make most people feel better about the effort
imho bounty hunting branches off and modifies reactions to crimes for which concord would already approve some sort of actionlol  i can even theoretically see instant bounty hunting off stealing and gcc probably special system bulletin board and lots of player preset choices under a single ui button to post it in timely mannerbut vengeance for other crimes or simple competitive advantage that are too complex for concord to rubberstamp should be covered by mercenary contracts and maybe some sort of new wardec by corps against individuals wardeccing individual toons to expedite mercenary vengeance should be expensive 100m per week and grow rapidly more expensive after some initial period of time  say 3 weeks only corps should be able to do it maybe only certain merc corps with licenses purchase plus other requirements and good concord and faction area standings repeat wardecs within 6 months against the same individual by the same corp should be counted as a single cumulative wardec for fee purposes because opening new corps is easy the total nonoverlapping wardec time against a given individual should gathered from corps in the past 6 months employment histories of the declaring ceo or directors that said its the individual problem if they manage to offend multiple corps in rapid succession corp fleet and and alliance mates may want a flashing signal green alternating with normal status to quickly alert them that its an individual wardec matter however since you wouldnt see individual corpmate as gcc nor mercs aggression flagged to corp alliance fleet  things should work out automatically in a natural manner that is you can rr your friendly and enter the fight or be stupid and shoot someone not gcc or wardec flagged to you and see concord same as normalto keep things simple merc corps probably should be responsible for posting wardec fees against an individual  its a business expense  gamble on their part they can of course simply opt to gank in high sec or wait for victim to leave high sec the same if a corp decides to pursue vengeance themselvesof course all the same victoryfractional reward conditions and calculation can apply to actual merc vengeance contract as to concord backed bounty contractsnote individuals with beef against another individual should normally be able to get ceo to post wardec against an individual
yeah and nobody will be able to pay real money or whatever the price to use the service when the company fail to develop itits not about you not about eve its about the customers unhappy with their name for nine frakking years its about time we get to access this service without disrupting your lazy countermeasure against scum  villany and i do think the original poster suggested more than enough restrictions or perhaps you could debunk it

proposal cloaky reds in system how to make life harder for themafk cloaked ships need a timer when timer runs they get kicked simple as thatnow go complain your cloaky griefing ship should be able to sit shiva for 2 hours not moving and explain whyif cloaky griefer wants to play all he needs to do is find a target in a reasonable time and kill it how hard is thatoh wai cloaky griefer is afraid to die and hiding in a ship with no guns why support thatcheersbb
or you know you can set trapswe mine in peace with proper pvp support and cloakyfags in a system maybe you should come take some notes the next time i deploy my full mining support duders
as a total noob i had no idea you can locate an afk cloaked ship i have only been playing for 45 years you knowoh maybe you think the pvp guys should run fleets in system with your ratters and miners to support pve great ideabut why pay for sov if you cant control your own space against this afk cloaked grief without calling on a bunch of your friends to come sit shiva with you and boring a lot of players to search for or protect against griefersanyways thanks to csm for finally acknowledging and briefly talking about this today for the very first time at todays town meeting on everadio cloaky grieft has been a topic of concern among the player base for many many years i was interested also to hear most of the csm representatives appear to be satisfied with ccps explanation that the simple solution i mentioned above is too hard to implementcheers
sighill explain this for you since i would hate for a fellow member of my alliance to fail as badly as you are showingyou set traps you create situations to pull him in to attack yes you even get your pvp bros or alt to sit in the belt with you in a cloaky recon waiting for them to attackif all this fails you just find out where his corpalliance does their carebearing and return the favor by shutting down their systemsits not like fa has not dealt with this before and its not like we wont deal with it again dont whine on the forums just deal with it cloaky afk cant hurt you and when they come back from afk they can only find your miners with probes which you can see coming before they can get a lock and warpyou are riding dscan rightif you need help dealing with this go to the alliance forums and ask someone for help just stop shiptoasting about it in public
dawn you are making this sound like this game mechanic thing is an alliance issue its not we joined fa for the pvp and we are having a lot of fun fightingi used this account for a lot of industry in my first few years and im very much aware of this afk cloaky griefer issue from those past experiences im not doing pve in eve for a few months because i am actually favoring a couple of facebook games for pve more fun eve still kicks ass with pvp but not so much for pve due to issues like this oneanyways this is a game mechanics issue not an alliance issue at all
its not an issue tho they cant affect youbeyond making you switch systems unless you let them do sowork with your mates if they are in your way do some intel work and deal with it we get those guys often enough that their contracts to grief us usually dont get renewed and the few times the have been good enough to actually become a real problem we took the fight to them
well said bluebear8 dawn is an effing troll and probably never wore her industrial diapersprobably someone took a shortcut when coding the cloak module and now were paying the price smooth move ex lax
while i agree with your post that cloakies should not shut an industria op down the truth is they do that is why cloakies do what they do its a game play tactic of finding an alliances industrial systems and placing a cloaky in it to disrupt the industrial players you cant argue that pointkeep in mind the indi ops we are refering to are not the full 20 man fleets with pvp cover its the smaller miners taking advantage of some down time between fleet oppsbut thats just me
they do in fact shut down small unprepared opsbut only if the miners in question let their fear overwhelm their common sensemy corp maintains unlisted belt bookmarks across several good mining system in out of the way corners of our space just so that those very small 23 man ops have options if the pvpers cantwont help for whatever reason its a pvpers job to maintain thosepvpers tend to have better probing skillsyou have to be organized and support each other letting a cloaky shut you down is your failure tho not a failure of the mechanicedit oh and i maintain my pvp main in fairly close proximity to said miners so i can rapid response to help them in a pinch with carrier hotdrops or recon cruiser supportusually the latter carrier hotdrops are pretty much suicide so i have a fair grasp of both sides of the coin
my apologies dawn i thought all fa was pvpers had no idea you were the indy toon i didnt look at your history because i didnt think any indy player would like cloaky afk grieferssorry for the industrial diaper comment maybe you are wearing them after all  another troll detectedi still agree with bluebear that afk cloakers are not good for the game maybe you are having fun setting traps if its the first few times youve done traps you might just discover it is impossible to catch a truly afk dude tho i kinda doubt youll enjoy doing that for very long if the cloaker is truly afk thats why they call it a griefer i think hes not looking for a fun fight or an easy gank hes just looking to give some grief while hes off afk watching the cartoon channel or waiting to drop a cyno to invite his friends to the party on the 3rd day of being afk in system if some pve activity picks back up best way to get some action for ccp to fix this issue is to find out where the csm dudes are working their industrial accounts and go park an afk cloaky ship in system with their ratterminertrader hauler account 247 truly if its not a bug its a feature
fa is a pvp alliance but alot of us have indy alts dawn happens to be my indy alt who is posting while my main is sadly forum bannedyeah i totally fess up to being a troll but i have found the best troll is the truthconsidering eve was originally designed by a couple dudes pissed they were not allowed to grief in other mmos i am inclined to think most griefing tactics are a feature the game has moved past that and some actions are actually bannable as griefing but not manyonly confirmed one i have found is bumping a freighter for hours preventing its warp just for the lulz but in the end assume any grief potential is supposed to be there and is accepted by ccpi dont like cloakyfags but i accept their right to do their thing and see it as a legit tactic in a war against other large entities where you need to impair their ability to make isk the other thing about nerfing them is the fact that doing so is a direct buff to bots since a standard tactic to deal with them is to cloak in their botting system for a week or 2 til the bot whitelists youmeaning they will do their thing and ignore you being in system while allows you to kill them with impunityall in all they should stay even if it causes me a little inconvenience
quotedawn flarei dont like cloakyfags okay but next time say it like you really mean it
it is totally unaccetable that hulkageddon lasts a month and there are more than one hulkageddon pr yearevents like this must not be allowed to last more than a week pr year and there must not be more than one event that targets same targets  ingame professionit is dissatisfactory to pay but not being able to play maybe it is time to make hisec bigger  a lot bigger since it is here some 70 of the playerbase lives
at best all youd do is postpone the shock of losing a ship by a few weeks its a nonsolution in fact its an antisolution because itll give newbies the sense that they are indeed invincible in hisec whichll make the shock of getting ganked even worse

edit proposal is in 2nd post discussion is in this postyes this is another thread about mining while i will be including my propositions in the discussion as well as discussing other playerUFFFDs ideas i want you to know that this is more of a research than a proposition i simply want to summarize the facts whether eve related or real life and then elaborate on current design i think fits mostlet me start by figuring out the asteroid belt behavior in real life asteroid belts usually form not around the planets but around the star whether it is due to the destruction of the planet removal of the planet embryos or lack of accretion from nearby plants here is the solar asteroid belt from nasa as visible from the picture the asteroid belts are usually very scarce by our standards as such it is possible to UFFFDbeUFFFD inside the asteroid belt and not see a single asteroid in sight asteroids themselves have separate classes that are defined by their brightness albedo number derived from their composition which usually varies little as far as i remember there are also very few asteroids with a significant mass as such main problem in current world astronomy lies in ability to find them in eve we have vast abundance of asteroids that come with our own problems in gameplay main problems in current mining are boredom bots and fairly low reward ceiling many people also complain about safety compared to ratting as such proper direction of mining should be elaborate enough to filter bots at least to some extent  not more boring towards the real miners preferably even more interesting the actual reward ceiling should be handled separately from this discussion since it will fluctuate after mining rebalance and preemptive adjusting will be mootmany people proposed specific modifications to asteroids sweet spots calibrations that increase yield etc i personally have few problems about such solutions to this problem these solutions force players to concentrate on single asteroid itself while i think it is more viable to shift the concentration on how large the space can be  pilots are flying huge specialized ships that are capable of mining huge amounts of minerals i think it is petty to try to mine most lucrative chunk of a single asteroid much more reasonable to find a better asteroid many of such ideas are unfortunately extremely UFFFDbotfriendlyUFFFD while turning miner experience into something like UFFFDmass effect 2 miningUFFFD overconcentration on the asteroids might force miners to pay even less attention to their safety imagine trying to increase your yield while checking scanner for probes or local for enemiesas such most viable solution to the mining problem would be modification of the warp destinations of the belt similarly to the current gravimetric sitesanother reason why i included gravimetric sites is scanning botting programs usually work in binary patterns  UFFFDUFFFD in local 10 asteroid presence etc while having much harder time at pattern recognition that is the way captchaUFFFDs work i know that adding simple captcha to the mining will ruin it but scanning by itself is very viable alternative especially it will be hard to code for recognition of spherescirclesdots i know that bots would possibly emerge but for long time they would operate on random sampling while player is afk which would make them less effective than real playersmain problem with this approach lies in the longevity of the site if the scanned location will feed a single miner for significant amount of time bots would simply proliferate again as such i think most viable solution for this approach would be to add lifetime of the site and it should be short UFFFD preferably around 1 hourmany people would complain that it would be too cumbersome to mine and as such i think at this point it would be necessary to modify ore output so that amount mined in this approach would be equal or more to the amount mined using standard mining so players will spend some time scanning more actions from player but increased yield will cover the time UFFFDlostUFFFD not miningi would also like to mention shultz 2006 that this set up will result in better reward pattern formation since the players will be more subjected to contiguous cycle of work scanning and reward mining with ridiculous yield for few minutes thus theoretically resulting in higher dopamine output inside miners brains and happy eve miners  awesome new players should be fine with this setup since there are pretty decent tutorial missions about scanningand at the same time UFFFD most major factor specialization want even more output per player create a fleet with dedicated scanners haulers miners and boosters and roam the constellation with proper spawn system similar to the wh generation it would be much more viable to have roaming mining fleets that would yield a lot of resources but require constant movement from one system to the other i think this approach is the best fit for something so essential in evemakes eve feel biggerplanetary rings could then be utilised for ring mining some developers already mentioned
as such here is my actual proposal introduce large asteroid belts across entire systems that spawn scannable locations mentioned above but keep few static areas that produce fewer yields than current mining that way even if player does not have scanning ability yet he can mine with ease these asteroid fields should be large enough to provide additional problems to bots if interested i would elaborate while introducing the majesty of large universe to new and old miners alike the asteroid field should have a personal background effect that overlaps current background that way player within that belt would actually feel inside the belt and not just near 15 rocks but that can waitsomething like thisthe asteroid field could also house the agent missions since where would be best place for enemies to hide in controlled space than behind some asteroids
as michael jackson would saymake that change
i do and i dont you are right that my proposals have major force projection impacts but its neither small world or force projection that motivated my suggestions but rather that i think eve is getting too easy more and more tools are being introduced that allows for faster travel remote interaction with and management of assets and overall more safety for your internet spaceships as a result pvp is becoming this organized event that mostly happens when two sides have assembled fleets and meet on some field of battle or the occasional gank at a gate camp rather than a constant threat of living in outlaw spacei would like to see more dynamic and random pvp more conflict in eve in general and i think the way to achieve some of those could be restricting the tools of risk free travel id love to see people assembling fleets to actually escort their freighters in and out of nullsec rather than just a quick push of a button id like to see the main traffic pipes to nullsec hot spots being constantly contested by roaming gangs while the main alliances attempt to police themim not saying that warp to 0 or higher jump bridge costs are the only solutions these are merely some of my suggestions as you will note i didnt say that all gates should be warp to 15 but a more dynamic system i imagine in empire the gates would all be modern and well tended to so theyd mostly be warp to 0 while in lowsec and nullsec it would be up to the player alliances to make sure that they have warp to 0 capability when you get outside the main pipes that are upgraded by players stargates in less populated areas might have warp to 5 10 or 15the benefit of that would be that you would have more dangerous areas in space where dynamic pvp could evolve
supported rats are boringi also want to cloaky camp npcs so they cant mine 
hello guysi will be talking about making one of my favorite hq sites abit more interesting my plan is to get the station that you must blow up at the end have a small chance of droping faction loot at a price as many people go afk durning the site im gonna have a good reason why you should stay in gate for a small chance of a good rare faction drop there will be a grid wide smartbomb if the tower drops loot it will pulse every minute or so doing about 5 thou damage i think this can be a great idea and please feel free to post any more ideas in the commentsspread the word to make incursions the best thing in eve
please stop poasting
please dont make any more suggestions
now for everyone who is gonna start complaning please post what you want maybe just make it drop faction loot or more spaws or more payout or something
id like the tower to  my name in stars but we cant all have what we want
remove it from hisec and you will accomplish this goal
another incursionbear who feels jilted after the nerf nerf incurions harder i say or remove them completelyoh and stop postingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
why make it so complicatedi agree the present wardec costs are way to low but all this nonsense about costing more to wardec bigger corps or alliances is beyond stupidmy simple version of wardec mechanics would be 50 million for wardeccing a corp and 200 million for wardeccing an alliance no stacking of fees upto 3 wardecs running at a time war decced corpalliance gets to call in two allies for free any more they pay for a wardecany newly formed corp or alliance is immune to any wardecs for the first three months of its existanceany rr become wartargets for the duration of a war all wars last for 1 week per payment nobody can be recruited into a warring corp until hostilities endunder this arrangement say for example a small griefer corp between 35 members wardecs 3 carebear corps for 150 million im pretty sure there will be small merc corps willing to offer services on new merc contract system so said griefers have the potential of 6 merc corps hunting them down perhaps even taking the carebears under their wing and teaching them the basics of pvp to help hunt their griefer enemy small scale high sec pvp could blossom
yea i see the problems but i do not agree with force reconnaissance cruisers already have the capability to fit a covert ops cloaking device and can warp cloaked thus precluding their need for a further means of covert surveillancebecause thats same as covops frigs and t3 cruisers if fitted to do so so they do not have a unique cloaking capabilities usable in wh and most fleets but not even that sharing the view with fc and fleet would really make the experience unique and i would personally drop it mainly because programming this would be an overwhelming pain in the  for ccp and as a result would probably get swept under a rug somewhere or forgotten about for a few years as other major issues that have come up are just now being addressedbut i at least see that people like the cam idea which was actually the whole point of this idea to do something truly remote so i will see to think of something more useful using that tech and i dont care if it would take them 5 years to build it if people like it thank you all for comments but keep them coming they will all be read and replied to if they require it
yes i have what it says exactly also the comment above was more directed to the goon guy ideas rather than you as you clearly went missing for a while and the conversation continues with the other guythe above clearly say that you intend to remove local my point is simple and remains the same it is too easy for a much bigger alliance to move in reinforce or destroy the upgrade and move out i understand cos you are in test that this does not happen to you that much but imagine this on a small entitya small entity would never have a hope in hell now you got no local until 56 weeks down the line and thats provided that it doesnt get attacked meanwhile or destroyed again having soverently lvl 1 it should be more than enough to have local if anything but having a sov module for local is still pushing it and i think we got way to many modules atm and more may come when sov gets changed and i really do not want more modules there are simply too many and ocupy too much cargo space atmblues not been able to see local as you mentioned its even worst of an idea i think you are comptelly removing the standings mechanic and saying no cos you dont want to this is incredibly disabling cos it remove intel across a huge span of systems and puts the ball compeltelly on the invader side there is a reason and an advantage after all to be trenched in in your system and this removes thatpeople still get caugh and dont warp out when others enter the system so as far as i am concerned you lost cos you didnt watch local so this works as intended
its almost as if you believe having local would stop a much bigger alliance from moving in reinforcedestroy anythingsomethingeverything and move outthis is a fallacy
the intel is the key here now you got no local until another upgrade lvl 5 in 56 weeks down the line its totally ridiculous you should have a home advantage and intel across blues otherwise whats the use
what do you think youd be able to do with guys 400 reds are in our system what do we do with a few seconds more of warning
you are missing the point its not about the seconds its about intel seeing you saying where you are going picking up one or two straglers using intel all that good stuff which has made eve eve
good scouts would do this too
i could also say the same for you keep local and a good interceptor with dscan skills can trap anyonethe difference is you got to have home advantage a module for local removes that compltelly for over a month minimum if you are lucky
so if a good interceptor with good dscan skills can trap anyone then you dont need any other crutches vov
we see all the time frigates and other ships catching anything from a frigate to a freighter to a super capital this should be nothing new to you
yes and this isnt dependent on local
yes it is you dont hunt someone if he is not in local unless you happen to se himn log off in which case you hope he logged agressed
sounds like youre not blessed with interceptor pilots with good dscan skills vov
i dont se how you put that and the rest in context togetherif you think thats a hit under the belt then you are sadly mistaken
hey youre the one who seems to think you need local to catch stragglers off of a fleet vov
and you are the on that seems to think that you need to make sure noone can see you in local in order for you to catch someone and win the day  not to mention that you failed at the argument so now you lower yourself to scounduring the person behind the counter argument which in itself is a sign of weakness behind the personality
why would i need no local to catch anyone or scounduring whatever that means anyone because im pointing out the fact that what youre counterarguing with isnt dependent on local setup a proper scout network and youll see where who are going
we have good covert ops scouts thank you very much
what do you need local for then
cos i am a social guy and i want to smack talk to the enemy i also want to see all the blues in localyou can still catch anyone even when they see you in local so working as intended
if you want local to be a social arena then i guess we can make it a regional thing this way you can smacktalk him long after hes left your system and you can see the sea of blues youve surrounded yourself with winwin
no its not a win win its a win win for you maybe not for me there should be a home system advantage your idea removes that
so you have a good scout network which keeps track of enemy fleets so you can catch stragglers you can smacktalk them for as long as theyre in your region you can see all your blues to get that social bond thing going and this is still not enough
you can still catch anyone with local with the present system i like it just the way it is and i like it even more now with the improvemnts of the ui and compact mode i see my friends where they are rather than they are somewhere and i have home advantage i am happy and it works as intended
in other words even though you have a good scout network and good covops pilots you still need local to track enemy fleets who are going for your space
even thought you can catch anyone if they see you in local you still need to remove local for everyone including blueseven thought you got good interceptor pilots and scouts you still need have local removedeven thought you still get good fights you still need to have local removedeven thought you rarelly get out of a region without a kill you still need for local to be removedeven thought you got spies can tell you where is what you still need for someone not to see you in localeven thought everything is working as intended and nothing stops you from doing what you want to do you still need for local to be removed we are going in circles
whats this about catching anyone or not see you in local
shush you are getting in the way of me watching the romania renegades promo video
thats okay ill wait i mean i assume theres a point there somewhere
well the point is self explnetory you dont want to be seen in local as if this prevents you from getting killsi must continue this discussion later i got to get ready for squash will be back in 3 hours or sogl hf
i dont get it youre the one thats been talking about how not having local prevents you from getting kills i havent talked about the opposite you seem to be projecting something vov
ccp has stated they do not want local to be used as an intel gathering tool right now it iscurrently they are trying to figure out how to do that without pissing everyone offmy proposal lets the alliances decide where they do not want local to be an intel gathering tool its not a complete fix but its at least something more than we have now if ccp removed local entirely itd make a lot of people leave nullthis is really the only way ive seen that would keep things sane if ccp was ok with removing local in null it would have been done already so saying omg just remove local altogether is pointlessas i said before if you remove local from every system and add a mod to add it back alliances will just put the mod in every system you changed nothing and just added more boring stuff to do if you add a mod that removes local entirely it will see little to no use at most itll be used during actual war time at most my proposal would actually see some use granted not widespread but some use it gives the holding alliance an advantage by denying intel from its enemies it ends afk cloaking by giving the holding alliance delayed local afk cloaking is now counter productive in systems with the upgrade and it gives the attackers a chance to find targets before they have a chance to run to safetysaying omg this ruins my game because i cant talk to people is literally  you can still talk in local if its your system you see all your friends if its not your system then why the hell are you trying to talk to your friends in local and giving away your position talk in fleet you idiot if you want to taunt your enemy then go ahead do it you cant see them in local but you can on dscan they can see the local list so you can bet they still have it in its own window just like now
your lack of comprehension of something that was broken down to simpler terms and explained to you is nothing short of ing astounding but of course you were to busy emoraging to actually notice the fact that people were explaining things to you in a simplistic manner pull your head out of your  and actually read before you post again on second thought shove your head further up your  so that you can see  more clearly and just dont post anymoreand draconis the post from someone who doesnt even play eve is unnecessary unwanted and pointless we dont need a critique on everything from your point of view so do us all a favor and just unsub even your own alliance doesnt want you but then again you should be used to thati am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
and let all of these environments be graced with the bounce
i love this ccp do this
very good idea 1
this needs to happen 1
technically if you had both the contracts and the normal system for bounties it wouldnt really be a problem anyway im glad this topic has been revitalised it could really use as much attention as possiblein the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
ccp has already everything needed after inferno costs of the whole kill pod and ship in fact the fw lp payout mechanic already works analogous to my bounty proposal link belowcontracts could be added on top of that once core mechanics are fixed thats fine since contracts are controled by players so if a player makes a mistake and contracts the wrong guy it can be exploited however the bounty system itself should be unexploitable the same way as insurances are not exploitable more details in the link below
if the cloaker is afk why are you afraid of him most people continue doing whatever it is you do in 00 all day without letting an afk cloaker ruin it for them
man u r realy an idiot do you understand what is mean cloakers terrorizing players who dont know the cloaker ship is afk or not this is why crying the cloaker faqs if someone open a topic from afk tag or cap useage cloak modulesif you dont play go and log off and dont disturb those players who want to play
i support cloaking for long durations as a tactic of disrupting gameplayhowever to me it would seem that true afk cloaking is in effect unattended gameplay as there is intent with the action of afk cloaking and unattended gameplay breaks some rules i hopeso with that viewpoint in mind maybe we can agree that cloaking under some circumstances is being abused and if we can agree on this then we can agree that something needs to be done about it first we need a problem and maybe that problem can be unattended gameplaya solution can only follow once we agree on a problemfly safe o7
if someone is worried about an afk cloaker they should move back to hsafk cloakers cannot harm anyone they cannot do anything except maybe fly in a direction really slowlyif you are in a system and hiding from someone who may or may not be afk you are the only one responsible for your own cowardicealso the op mentions macrosan afk timer will have zero effect on macro bots bots can easily simulate realistic mouse and keystrokes otherwise they would be so easy to fins and ban
another cloaker expert alt with 1 kill and 18 losseswhere you flying  lets check what will be happening when i go there with a cloaker alt checking you cowardice when you cant go to make iskjust when i was in khanid low sec three lvl4 agents was there in the first day the local was 38 i just got some kills and two weeks later the local decreased to 12four weeks later the local decreased to 3 most of time i was there in afk sometimes i just dropped out some cheap scanner probes but i didnt scan and mission runners docked up instantly probes in space pthis is the real afk terror enemy players dont know the status of afk player they dont know ambush when starting not all pilots playing in same time sometimes easy to catch one or two peoples there who do a mistake sometimes they want to make a trap or something to kill cloakers but against smart pilots who has intel or using a spies thats useless thing and experienced afk cloaked player uncatchablebut the afk terror is working i used this tactic many times with successful everytime where i was in afk cloak activities on local drastically decreased after few daysso dont tell me afk cloakers does not have effect on active players
was in j132 most last month april you could come visit i dont care if you come and cloak in my systemof course i wouldnt know you were there nor would i carei also spend some time in low sec usually in domain since my home hangers are there though most of my time recently is in amarr listening to local and sometimes seeing if anyone will shoot at me when i loot their wreck been busy with school so havent had the time to go raid whsand the only kill i have is a corpie i cant remember why though but anyway i dont kill people much however i also dont hide like a child from someone who may or may not be at the computer or even at their house i just dont fly what i cant affordam not willing to loseoh and this is my main though not my first character didnt like the others
with all the chitchat surrounding this subject i decided to peruse old posts about the subject the main reason being to see if ccp had ever communicated their stance on this subject this is what i foundcsm december summit UFFFD meeting minutes are out  links to a devblogpdf document containing the minutes of the meeting linked in the devblogi draw your attention to the game balance section page 22 where it saysso it would appear that ccp are open to a counter of some sort to cloaked ships as the previous csm were not against the idea i hope the current csm panel can maintain some continuity in relation to this topichopefully this can lead to a more definitive answer to this whole cloaky business and ultimately a much clearer idea as to what ccps stance ishave a good one o7
guyswhy dont you stop pretending you made this game yourselvestaking out all stupid and bot miners you still have a big number of pilots that are just new or are simply enjoying other parts of the game and dont want to pvppvewho exactly are you to say that the game is only for pvpeers where did you read thatif some aspects of the game were stopped or even changed thanks to the intervention of the csm there is no reason to believe that if a portion of eve is requesting something to be modified that the csm will simply not consider it even if its about changes that help miners or industrialist to have a different gaming experienceyou simply are not in control so if one day ccp ends up with changes in this directionlive with itand please dont stop trying to kill bot miners they are the real distortion herenot newbies running missionsrolds
so tell me oh brilliant evelopediapoddie psychophant the answer to this1 eve used to be one world with no differential in what you could do where2 a selection of actions that are fine in most of eve are now bannable under the eula if done in new player starting systems guess what since i last played and now ccp has introduced safe zones into eve i didnt they did logically the next thing is for those to get bigger if the subscriptions targets are not metto those who attack the poster not the ideas you pitiful creatures use your brain god did give you one too i dont know you you dont know me you cant possibly know how much i know about this game this industry or simple business reality from the age of the toon oh and to the nice poster who said plex is money in the bank no its money that was in the bank ccp had to let some people go last year due to the financial downturn you can infer they have no huge pile of cash from past plex sitting about what they have is a debt to players on thier financials times have been hard they need new players to join pay and stay paying with real money ccp have already carebeared it up in various areas of the game over the past few years guess what the cold hard business reality is likely to push them to do next so give ccp better ideas to achieve the goal of increasing new player retention past the 3 month point or bite your fingers rather than typefor my part add highsec ganker 24 hour cooldown flag which makes them attackable by anyone and poddable by anyone and which pays bounties on them 50 to someone who kills thier ship where the ship must be value 20 of the bountry to be a qualifying kill and 50 to whoever kills thier pod ganking should also have higher security and npc faction hitsas drawn out by the discussion above the real issue is not that hulks are unsafe but that the concord mechanics mean that people with bounties on them are safe spaceship barbie with her huge bounty horrible security status can and does undock in her navy megathron complete with superb tank and concord protect her from all random attacks in a 10 system even though she is one of the highest bounty players most players will ever actually see in the same system gankers should not be safer than miners in highsec that is simply broken
touchegreat post
i really like that idea although i cant help but think it would be promptly abused horribly by vets vets do so many  lamentable  things like trying to get new players in newbie help channels to reroll as a friend invite account so that the vet gets a free plex and the newbie gets a shiny pittance and ccps aim of the invite a friend programe gets totally undermined as someone ccp has attracted to the game suddently gives them yet another 15 debt on the books all due to unscrupulous vets
sorry gizznitt for taking ages to reply rl and all thatas i often find with these long back and forth debatesdiscussions the real message gets lost in ever branching and diverging discussion so i returned to your first post to read again what you said now correct me if im wrong  but really you object to the idea of players preying on other players doing pve you came up with a great list of things you do in game but all but one involved attacking others that are looking for pvp or in the process of traveling the one that might be used to attack pveers afk cloaking you described as pathetic which shows you have a pretty strong emotional hostility to the activity you dont like players that target pveers your comments about different fits also suggests that you really think pvp and pve should be separated am i correcti believe that fundamentally eve has the points of vulnerability backwards atm at present youre pretty safe when pveing in null or you can forgo what risks there are in null and go to high sec and risk even less however travel is dangerous it should be that travel is safer weaker gate camp mechanics and that whenever you access resources pve youre more at risk pve should be thought of as fully part of the pvp dynamic it fuels the machines of war and those harvesting it should be vulnerable to machines of warso where does this fit in with the localcloaking issue i dont just think that cloaked ships should be less vulnerable flying about i think they all should be but especially smaller classes conflict and risk should come with interactions that can gain you something so when mining or shooting rats you should be vulnerable to an attacker and those attackers should they come should be vulnerable to traps and counter ambushes rats should change so that there isnt pve and pvp fits just ship fits not that its impossible now to pve in pvp fits its just less efficient now with all this in mind the covops ship while still the master of surprise is like all others vulnerable at the point of interaction because aside from travel and gathering intel they cant do anything cloaked and the price for those advantages is gimped stats compared to non covops ships yes ive been telling you stealth does not have to equal invisibility see my earlier dfo examples im glad you accept that now however in eve it does due particularly to local and overview mechanics im sorry but really gizznitt you know this is bs organized players which you would expect from those in null that arent renters are going to be able to figure out pretty quickly if one of the anonymous pilots in system are not one of them in fact im fairly certain some metagame method will be engineered to make it rather effortless for them to do so at this point were back to broken cloaks and not in a situation where cloak hunting can be introduced without being completely unbalanced friendly strangers seriously how much of null is controlled by nrds alliances have you noticed how many different aspects of the game we have touched on in our back and forth arguing if i included all the extras my proposal would be so damn long no one would even read it i linked the other thread and people are more than welcome as they have to bring up issues in relation to other aspects of the game and for us to discuss those but to include every possible thing changing local and all the surrounding arguments touch on in my op is completely unreasonable had you considered that in my proposal and accompanying ideas a covops ship is stripped of current local intel as well that in the cloak hunting idea the ship used to hunt cloaked ships is itself covops i would say in this system covops ships are more vulnerable than near unprobable booster ships are currently and of course whenif a covops ship actually uncloaks and engages a target its extremely vulnerable
i think the main problem is the amount of isk per hour harvestedi cant vouch for booster clouds but fullerene clouds are quite lucrative with such bonuses achieving 500 million per hour would be viable what is worse it is also makes it more safer singe the cloud is harvested much faster
im appealing to the csm to please get the word to ccp that the new inventory system in its current state on sisi is not functional for release please you of the csm could just check to make sure these concerns are a priority for inferno i dont expect my ideas to be put into the release i do however hope that ccp sees the broken nature with the current sisi inventory system 1if you could just take a moment to read through the first post of this thread in the test server feedback section ive tried hard to summarize the issues while weeding out the white noise of random complaints and put constructive ideas to solve the issues surrounding the new inventory system it has turned into a mini threadnaught but the unified opinion is that its just not finished and breaks too many things to release 2 please watch this video tippia made as well as checking out his blog on the subject he does a very good job of encapsulating all the issues with the inventory that show how plain broken it is 3 this is a response ccp has given us in concerns with the new inventoryccp rubberband seems to get it and wants to help where ccp goliath seems to take the 1000 jeans approach ccp goliath96111he totally missed the ball on this one the reoccurring theme wasnt that people didnt want change if anything people are for the change just not in its current state 116 117ccp rubberband129163dual pane idea click
wonder if goliath realizes that people only use windows still because of directx
youre not being paranoid enough what if the stupid huge window is actually intended to keep you from looting thus decrease material faucet
the only thing that isnt working right with insurance imo is you still get payed if you sdalso not sure about if you get killed by the faction police imo it should be removed there toobut for t23faction its fine its based on minerals not on market averages
based on minerals lol not it isnt thats why its broken
its true
estimated csmi understand that the majority of pilots will probably not care about the following topics im bringing to the tablei have been around since 2008 and havent seen improvements in some of the areas im interested in and which are the reasons i play eveyou may say that trading manufacturing and mining are just secondary aspects of this game but there is a significant number of players that enjoy it a lot and find pvppve a secondary source of entertainmentmarket mechanics have not changed much since the beginning of the game and there are a lot of things that are just not rightwar has always been the fuel of eve and im happy that it remains the same and csm has always helped to find creative ways to bring extra dynamism to the game with hulkaggedons and other annoying herbs but the market has always been protected and intervened by ccpi really think that all industrial corps are somehow on the same page it is not common sense in having higher yields by doing incursions or null sec ratting than manufacturing or tradingim sure that less intervention on prices through npc traders will also help prices go a little bit higher and improve manufacturing marginson a separate note when are we having some better mining equipmentcould we have a bigger ship than hulkeven if its more expensive and weaker versus gankersimagine a module that lets you attach a hulk to an orca with a reduced tanking overall to make it appealing to gankers as well goons im expecting you to support this or at least give better mining specs to ore mining lasers not just improved distancewell hope to have contributed with something different and not always the same stuff being discussedrolds
since ive spent some time around mining i could tell you right now bigger mining ships will not be a solution  with bots the mineral price will crash even lower than it was before drone region nerf resulting in about similar isk yield for top end miners while crippling new miners severelyabout other aspects i do not think the market and industry are as broken as some other aspects of eve and ccp is always trying to move more and more items to be manufactured by players and not npcs
i agree that is why i was suggesting to have weaker tanks for that sake or even not being able to move the shipotherwise the solution is taking out the hulk and leaving covs or retrieverswhich makes no senseif you crunch some numbers you will understand my pointi maxed out all my trading and industrial skills  standing improvements believe when i say that incursions and null sec ratting continues to have better yields that is simply ridiculoustake for example capital ships manufacturinghow is it that the best margin you can get there is never beyond 15the npc item spawn is for trading as if you had high sec rats being able to kill battlecruisers in 2 volleys as crazy as thatrolds
problem comes not from highsec  although now it is the major source of minerals with advent of bigger miners the 00 sec will regain quite a lot of botters too  there is is much easier to protect your ship no matter how weak your tank iseven if it wont severely crash the market price  it will substantially lower it as such problem with new player miners still persistscheck my submission for csm summit topic i know it is wordy but essentially i was trying to come up with idea of increasing yields in a different way while at same time reducing ability of bots to mine effectively  something that should increase mineral prices as well making new players more eager to mine than to mission
very good approach
what do you mean by this
csmim sure you are also concerned about ccp keeping sustainable and not having this beautiful game disappearthere are certain moves that could potentially undermine eve continuity and you know them by heart but i believe also that you have to spend some time thinking about how to make eve revenues go upiUFFFDve been part of some innovation forums in rl and im sure that you have a tough task reviewing all the posts in the assambly hall to materialize colorful and meaningful things for eve communitymy 5 centsagree with ccp that some of the enhancements requested by players will placed in polls and then request a small contribution from players real currency to fund the projectchanges or improvements  developers time  costslets not be naive and think that the big community of isk buying plex pilots will keep the ball rolling providing a player base to keep the game alive is just not enough that wont pay for the servers or the developerskeep it civilizedrolds
everyone should be paying game with real money and not isk paid plexthat helps to provide a big player base but might undermine eve sustainability in the long runkeep that in mindi personally decided to pay for 4 accountsusing my isk generation to help some new players step up and dont drop the gamecsm there is a quite big community doing this and be sure that this is not coming from pvpeers industrialistindustrialists also help the gamenot only pvpeers fueling markets with new ship purchaseshave you ever wondered who are the ones paying the accounts im sure ccp knows that profilerolds
you do know that plex must be bought by someone and it costs more than a regular sub amountso ccp makes more money if people buy plex just a bit
is this guy for real or is he high on space crack stop the evemail spam
agreed sov fees should be paid for in cash
i wonder where the money is going then  not for servers not for developers  whats left advertising insert some waste of screen space here
sorry its too much for any small scale mercgriefer actionpaying a wardec fee that is almost the cost of a small pos  it sounds wrong to meahahaha thats a  huge immunity to wardecstell me how gsf or any other big entity is supposed to recruitnofirst the real mercs are mostly the ones wardeccing people not defending people from a wardec it will dramatically increase their prices and mines reducing the numbers of contracts it has nothing to do with taking carebears under their wing and i really dont see the link between this and an increase in the wardec feesi highly doubt it
people will cancel subs for their scout alts ccp wont allow this
im posting the same things since 2008 nobody seems to careim developing an external app for this once i have it done il contact you to give you some help thereadd me as contact inside gamerolds
cant resist so here i go first world problemsseriously if that is the only problem you have in this game ccp is doing better than all other mmos combined caps for you to know i am serious
absolutely agreenevertheless i would like to have this tackledi am able to pay plex with isk although i dont do it because im trying to support ccp to keep it movingalthough small that is my contributionrolds
meanwhile xobilal has been starving to death for the last 6 months after freedom fighters broke in to his hut  murdered his entire family in front of him
odd
um using isk on plex and then subbing with it supports ccp just as much as buying a sub someone has to buy that plex with rl money
what a silly game we would be half of the mmos would laugh at us and the other half wont event want to try eve since we are gonna spent 99 of the time dscaning peoples are gonna rename eve to dscan ridiculous whats worst is this probably is gonna encourage another riot something i really dont want to see i want to see ccp still gathering more and more mommentum there are countless of issues far more important at the momment to be even speaking about thisoh  i forgot to dscan in the last 2 secondsand now i need to dscan again after i type this new lineedit i had to correct spelling so i had to dscan again
im sure he is drunkdude i understand your frustration but you are simply not going anywhere this way if this was they way the original petition was placed no wonder why they didnt fix it
there are a plethora of reasons this should be implemented so with that lets get some more support and exposure to csmdevs i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
you people do realise that this would copletly destroy all effort that has been done for fw right now
lol
then just jam something in the keyboard  afk cloakys can continue business as usual

i would also like to mention a post by ccp rubberband picking whats relevantso basically the way we want to use the ui is proper regardless of what the customer wants and it works for me if it doesnt work for you htfuthen lateras long as we stick to using it properly i assumethis is reminding me of incarnarage way too much but this time there is no checkbox to disable
new inventory releasing tomorrowfrom zagdulsent 20120521 1205to abdiel kavash dovinian elise randolph greene lee hans jagerblitzen issler dainze kelduum revaan meissa anunthiel seleene tippia trebor daehdoow two step uaxdeath it appears the new inventory system will be introduced tomorrow im appealing to the csm to please use your influence to make this a priority of iteration and draw ccps attention to a thread ive created in the test server feedback section of the forums there is a second thread in jita parkthere is a video which tippia has created and a blog which outlines the very visible and obvious flaws with the new system that will make players lives miserable i would like to state that i personally and the general feedback from the thread seems to be that people do want an inventory change however the ccp developers are fixated on the negative responses and focused on the people who are opposed to change there is constructive feedback and suggestions to improve on its forward development im predicting that this is going to cause a huge uproar similar to the whole greed is good and 1k pants debacle of last year i am requesting that if its a priority to any of you that you please post in support regardszagduldual pane idea click
im glad you braught this up i have been hugely excited about the new unified inventory watching the video was enlightening i have to say though the only problems i see were the refreshing on the windows the windows dissapearing on undock is also a problem i have to say though that the chap who made that video kind of missed the point of a unified inventory but nevermindso long as the window refresh is fixed i dont see any reason to delay the release from the video i see far more pros than cons for introducing the new system as a disclaimer though ive not been using sisi so i only see the problems people show on videosin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
agreed im all for a new systemthe problem is that its not ready and theres not much we can do about it now so id rather just try to make it a focus for ccp to look at the flaws that most of eve will find frustrating with it old functionality which worked shouldnt be pushed asideother issues include poss with multiple silos or corporate hangars which cannot be renamed all that is included in the test server feedback thread dual pane idea click
i can see how many even most eve players would have none or very few issues with the new inventory if all your itemmanipulating work consists of looting wrecks and dumping the loot in a station to later sell maybe occasionally fitting a ship or two then the new window is just fine and by that i mean no offensehowever for people who have to regularly manage corporation and alliance assets poses doing heavy duty logistics and so on the new system is basically unusable many csm representatives have a background in 00 or other major alliances i am sure they would understand if they tried to use the new ui and i believe that we spreadsheet masters have as much right to have a functional ui as anyone else
there will be a flurry of patches in the coming week to iron out bugs and flaws once the masses get hold of it i expect it will be working almost as intended by the weekendwell see how it fares from there
here is one very specific example how the new ui makes life hard for people maintaining a pos very common usage scenario transfer pos reaction products from silo a to silo bold interface open the pos management window rightclick silo a in the pos mgmt window select access storage silo a inventory opens rightclick silo b in the pos mgmt window access storage silo b opens in a new window transfer stuff from a to b by a single dragnew interface the ui index only shows ten items labeled silo there is no way to see which silo is which by merely looking at the index note some of you may notice the name item option it doesnt do anything the index also shows every single gun anchored at the pos as a separate entry which adds dozens of completely irrelevant entries to look through so you have to open the pos mgmt window again rightclick silo a click access storage silo a opens in the window rightclick silo b click access storage silo b opens in the window again whoops now you cant get back to silo a and there is no way to use the window to find out which one out of the ten available silos it is you can not shiftclick the access storage option to open silo b in a new window shiftclick only works from the index where you cant tell which silo is whichi have found only one possible workaround after you open silo a its entry in the index highlights you can shiftclick that to open a in a new window then you can open b through the pos management window to do the move
what i am afraid is that the way ccp intends the inventory window to work is simply unusable for the kind of largescale operations i am talking about i dont blame ccp for not seeing that its not their job to run an alliances logistics or poses their job is to develop a piece of software however what i am blaming them for is ignoring the feedback provided by people who do deal with this every day and who are now forced to use a single hammer to hammer in nails staples and screws
there are also issues with looting wrecks since window position and size is not maintained the old trick where youd open a ton of wrecks and theyd stack up allowing you to spam the lootall button no longer exists dual pane idea click
you do realzie that your discussing things on a test server rightthis doesnt necessarily mean or preclude what you see there is what will be on tranq when time comes stop the evemail spam
i believe that the issue is that the patch is rolling out in 24h and there have been no indications that it will be on tq in any form other than the patch especially since devs seem less than willing to actually listen to the feedback about usability issues hint youll get used to it isnt a good response to valid concerns being voicedi too hope that whatever shows up on tq works well and causes no issues however all indications are to the contrary and the dev communication has been less than satisfactory i think most people want to be optimistic about it but what he have seen to date has not been encouraging
i see you are not familiar withb the ccp test servernumbers might change but major issues like these never do they are always put on the test server before going liveor nothing is touched at all giving no warning whatsoever that there will be a change
i see you are unfamilar with historythey have put and removed features on the test server days before release stop the evemail spam
new inventory system works fine everyone needs to stop their bitching once i familiarized myself with the new system a grand five minutes total it has been working amazingly well i hope to see this on tq soon
just so you guys get the picture im not saying theres a problemor theres no problemim saying this is a test serverthat means its not concretedont assume everything on sisi will carry overeven thentypically no ones going to really raise a ruckus until its gone liveand sometimesyou just cant win any arguments with the devs until the larger audience picks upkeep in mindsisi is a beta test serverso take everything you see there with a bit of salt stop the evemail spam
you sir need to watch the videoi am quoting you as i will come back to this post in a week and ask you to please restate this claim with a straight faceyes the new inventory system is the right idea however its current state is not going to make people happy at all dual pane idea click
with a patch hours away and the response from the dev team im going to imagine that it is how it is since they havent had a chance to test any additional changes to modifications in the inventory code it would be a very bad idea hours before a major patch launch to add core code to a system that hasnt been tested see bootinidual pane idea click
um yes its based on mineral prices give or take a few weeks for adjustment thats why t23faction insurance is crap their mineral cost is low compared to other factors
not very bright are you stop the evemail spam
t2 requires in most cases their t1 counter part t3 requires materials are mostly in wormholes dropped or found via sleepers and their salvage and materials arent cheapfaction sometimes requires other sources of items t2 also in that reguardand when actually building them they use more minerals then their t1 counterparts therfore is still far out of their insurance valueso i say again how is it based on mineralt1 is a cushion on insurance but thats mostly crusier to some capitolshipsfactiont2t3 dont have a effecient use of insurance to do so so we go back to my point that it is broken the funciton should be removed set loses of t1 ship to default a platinum pay out instead of sinking further isk just to get a slightly higher amount back when your default of nont1 ships cant even pay a proper portion of its counterpart towards it actual platinum payout drake draconis apparently neither are you  atleast i know what im talking about
tbh i say get rid of insurance altogether
no you you obviously dont this post pretty much proves it
agreednot sure where hes getting his data eithertoo many assumptions but we kinda knew that from the start stop the evemail spam
my data comes from experiance as i can  do produce t1 t2 t3  faction ships rico thats what ive been trying to say man
industry does not orbit around your ego stop the evemail spam
i was just wondering if the op knew that ccp had assigned each and every item a base value which is not directly market related but does influence the market which in turn is one of the ways that ccp developed the loot drop system and insurance pay outs and the like however because minerals no longer and they once upon a time did have npc buy orders and other items are not seeded by npcs on to the market these base costs have become player driven the base values help decide how often they are available and to a certain extent how plentiful they are when you have a uneven distribution of materials you get huge market forces that drive up costs technium is an r32 moon it has a base cost of 64 isk per unit it is my reasoning although not confirmed that t2 and t3 insurance pay outs are based on these numbers and not player driven market numbers t2 which use a t1 ship in construction have that factored in as well the t1 ship being player mineral index prices
kusum could you possible further elaboratedraco my ego who keeps coming back to the topic with out any information
i dont provide informaiton that has already been providednor do i give information that smells of bitteremorage over losing tech 3 ships because he couldnt insure his expensive shiny toys cause he didnt know how to fly them stop the evemail spam
bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha11111oneoneelevenseriously youre not the one that should be talking about ships he lost because he didnt know how to fly them need i remind you of the incidence of you losing your mission ship pve fit by engaging a ninjasalvager pvp fit and crying about it for weeks or the fact you need a 20 man fleet to kill anything other than yourself or you being responsible for losing a freighter you were escorting note to everyone anything draconis says in reference to anything remotely associated with combat is irrelevanti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
uhyeahthanks for agreeing with my sentimentsi never complained about it here on the forumsso yeahnice job jack thumbs upand everyone throws a fit about losing expensive ships in private so im not sure wtf your going on about jackbut then your always going off on people without regard for personal sense of rationalityps who gives a flying  what we lose ingamethats not the point of discusison since your so eager to kick dirt up get over yourself jack stop the evemail spam
alright first off put the thumb that you always have firmly lodged up your  back up there before any more of your posting escapes secondly why do you pay for eve you dont play you pay to post on forums as always mr keyboard warrior thirdly its obvious that anything you have done is a massive fail see failcascade of shadow confederation and finally it is severely obvious that you lack the cajones to actually do anything yourself see failcascade of shadow cadre after drake removed 37 billion isk from the corp wallet to settle a vendetta against one person because he was too much of a chicken to do it himselfbut im sure youll enjoy paying your 1499 a month to continue to post on the forums not play eve and be one of goonswarm federations pets do us all a favor quit talking about things that you have no idea about how they work or how they should work i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
fixed that for youas for rationality how rational is it to not consult your corpmates about removing 37 billion isk that they worked to earn because everyone knows you never did a ing thing to help anyone from your corp wallet to settle a personal vendetta oh wait its not no wonder youre a peti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
im sorry what are you talking about this is a discussion about ship insurancenot about your petty stupid disagreements over something no one is going to give a crap aboutexcept youyesive lost shipslikely cried about itwho wouldnt the first couple of timesi learned its a waste of time and i donti sure as hell didnt whine about it like some emoraging idiot on the forumsi guess you have nothing better to dookwhatever floats your holed boat stop the evemail spam
ok so lets get this sorted out real quick1 the insurance system is currently broken as it doesnt even cover the cost of tech 1 ships any more due varies a bit by region but typically max insurance only covers about 70 of ship hull it used to cover the cost of the hull2 this thread is solid proof that draconis has a leaky  cause he cant stop shitposting really get some medicine for that
shah flutters has said it very clearly whats going onyou people can go on spouting your trash talk all you wantbut ignoring obvious isnt going to make you look anymore l33t as you think you are stop the evemail spam
i think insurance needs to serve a specific function which it currently serves well  new player cushion it is there to protect your most basic t1 assets usually because these are literally bottom of the food chainas such i think it would be viable to keep insurance only for newbie friendly shipst1 frigates destroyers cruisers battlecruisers and battleshipscut insurance for any t2 t3 as well as capitals concord should not pamper you if you can afford themthat way new players would have less painful losses while older and richer players would go for more bang at more risk
1 general readership insurance does need to be fixed it is a mechanic of the game that is currently broken ccp seems to be pretty good at handling that lately so i expect to see changes soon enough now that its getting some forum attention2 drake and jack please dont let your antics give ccp an excuse to lock this thread they may have renewed some of my faith but i dont want to risk it
shah has stated how it works as it is now but as more than one person has stated it is currently broken hopefully ccp will keep up this good idea streak going and fix this i am just fine with insurance covering the hull of ship alone that makes sense covering less than hull makes it not worth it and covering more than hull is just dumb so lets sit and watch the fire burn shall we
thanks to those whom understand that insurance is indeed brokenfor those that continue to come back and lack of explain how it is not let me point that unless you can break the process down on to how it aint just stopive already broken it down to how to understand loses to dummies degree of readingand draco stop you dont know enough to complain if t1 platinum payout cannot be included into a loss of t2faction ship then it is brokeninfact newbies tend to get into t3 hulls pretty early it only takes 4 months  best to fly and fit minimal t2 on themaniticist see x on top right most of browser hit that thank you csm  ccp please lock this thread if it continues to heatup and fall from topic thank you

no it was bought by someone but it must be used at a greater rate than it is bought or it simply becomes a debt around ccps neckthe op is correct plex does not pay the bills ccp gets money when plex enters the game due to someone buying it but that is not the only way you can get 10 free simply by working the friends invite system that is happening in the newbie help channel and while i am sure ccp are not happy about it there is little they can do every free plex they give away is yet more future revenue lost to themthe nex store was intended to help reduce the amount of plex in the game so too the character transfer payment with plex the bottom line is that it is new  returning players who buy plex to use on thier characters ships and skills veterans who are half decent can easily make the isk to buy plex ingame and use it should they choose to but hulkageddon and other antinewplayer anticarebearplaystyles have been driving new people away from the gamesimple case in point a friend finally got a covetor her husband helped set it all up they went out to mine together in a safe highsec system no warning indicators of gankers no nearby lowsec no war decs no problem right wrong she was suicide ganked the first night out i have not seen her mine with her husband ingame since do you think that couple who love scifi games and are fairly new to eve will stay if she cannot enjoy quietly mining with her husband here if she goes he will follow like many thousands of players before them like some of my other friends who cancelled out of eve to play tera  why he loved eve she didnt but he loved her far more than eve so together they chose a game they both enjoyedface facts boys and girls this game is only as strong as its carebears erm social orientated players they really do pay the bills and yes i did spend more on my clothing when i returned than on ships  did you
except that they merely provide 1 plex as an incentive to bring in more paying customers even if those new accounts use plex that increases demand meaning that those purchasing gtcs or plex from ccp have a larger market and are thus increasing future revenue so youre working on a false premise there
i dont think you understand how plex works mate go look it up then come back im not trolling
i am not really going to believe you anecdotal evidence is jus tthat in eve very few non exhumersbarges get ganked no one ganks mining frigates or cruisers and that is what she would haev been flying plex they are paid for as soon as they are created so ccp has the money early early money is invested  interest get a plex for buddy system that plex is only delivered when teh new guy pays for his account not before so the free plex does exist but only if ccp get a paying customer mayb ethey will stay maybe they wont some will  profitgankings do make people quit that is a fact but these people would have quit at some point anyway because that is what eve is risk averse people dont want to play a game like eve and eve needs to stay as it is because if it wasnt the harsh place it is other people would leave it is a niche game it always will be and as long as ccp are making enough money then it will be safe coming up to 10 years if it was going to fail i think it would have by now
yeah because that wouldnt be abused i suspect this would be a nightmare for coding and would be very hard to balance if i give reps to your wartarget and im suddenly in the war then i must be given the rights to shoot at you otherwise you would get the opportunity to shoot at me for potentially weeks while i would not have the ability to attack you until you chose to engageso according to your idea if i give reps to someone i can shoot all their war targets imagine the hilarity when a neutral gang lands on grid reps both sides of a battle and then proceeds to kill all of themmercenary corporations would no longer be able to recruitjust killing dec scraping will make it blossomallowing infinite allies only to the defenders could make it wither well see
1 if you are wardecd and you join an alliance the alliance must accept your war before you can join if you then leave that alliance remains a wartarget for the rest of the week if the war is renewed it is renewed against you and any alliance you may happen to be in when it is renewed not your former alliance2 if you are a corp in an alliance that is wardecd and you leave you are still a wartarget for the rest of the week if the war is renewed it is renewed against the target alliance only3 if you are a player in a corpalliance that is at war and you leave the corp to join a nonnpc corp the corp must accept your war before you can join if you then leave the corp remains a wartarget for the rest of the week4 if you are a player in a corpalliance that is at war and you leave the corp to join an npc corp you remain a war target for the rest of the week if the war is renewed it is renewed against your former corp not against you and not against your new corp5 if you are at war and you invite someone to your fleet that person must accept your war before joining once that person joins he or she is a wartarget until downtime this addresses fleet boosters6 you cannot invite someone to your fleet if that person is involved in a war you are not involved in join that persons fleet instead and agree to participate in his or her war7 no perperson costs if the target corpalliance has more members than you there is a base cost for all declarations plus a cost for corpsalliances considered more powerful to declare on lesser powerful corpsalliance the cost is related to the total sp costs of both parties mutualaccepted wardecs refund the full cost of the initial wardec if any mutual wars last until both sides agree to cancel if one side cancels but the other does not the other side begins paying wardec fees to continue the war8 there is a fee based on total sp for each person or entity that joins the war outside of the original wardec if you invite a nonwartarget to your fleet you must pay for that persons entrance into the war for the day if you join a corp that corp must pay to enter the war if your corp joins an alliance that alliance must pay to enter the war the only free ride is to join the npc corp and youre still a wartarget anyway you can still conduct business as usual during wartime but with an added cost9 leave the ally system in place but add a cost per 8neutral rr neutral rr is a little different in that it applies during wartime and due to various circumstances10a no neutral rr you pay wardec fees so that concord will let you wage war or you have been awarded kill rights exclusively a neutral entity has not paid those fees or received any rights so the neutral is not allowed to participate if you want to participate join one of the warring corps if it is wartime if you try to participate as a neutral you meet the business end of concord10b alternatively you are neutral rr and you help one side that other side of that particular battle then receives kill rights on you each person present they have 30 days or however kill rights last now to exact their vengeancethis provides penalties for both sides during wars if you try to evade the war youre going to carry it with you for a time this throws the hisec griefers a bone it also ensures that everyone who participates in some way with the parties at war becomes involved in the war at least for a time and participating in the war is not free beyond being the corpalliance who is wardecd initially because youre payingbribing concord and they have doughnut fees they need to coverthe costs also make it possible for each side to determine just how much they want to invest in the war a little at a time youll probably find that the total payouts for the war are much higher than if you charged a huge upfront cost its the way that true microtransaction systems workwhatever solution is chosen for neutral rr there must be a penalty for it and it must be more than oh you can shoot me for the next 15 minutes you can see how well that has worked out neutral rr must weigh the benefits of providing that service against the potential risks right now there are no risks personally im leaning toward 10b as it invites more fighting and sounds easier to implementthese are just rules for waging war in hisec concord polices hisec not players the empires rule hisec not nullsec alliances when in hisec you play by concord and empire rules regardless of who you are if it is too expensive or annoying or whatever for nullsec alliances to make a formal war declaration in hisec then dont do italso if you are a big fish you should expect a lot of little fish to try to nip at your fins its the cost of being a big fishthoughts what have i missed some of these things exist already but i wanted to present a complete package
this is convoluted and sounds difficult to managetrack a 24hour cooldown with penalties for leaving while at war like not being able to rejoin for an extended period is sufficient wars should follow the original target and if they join and drop an alliance that alliance should get the customary 24 hours of war theres not reason to extend it and make things more complicatedsimply being in a fleet with someone is not aggression that should justify war just give fleet boosters the same aggression transfer as logi problem solvedthis makes no senseinfinite allies as was suggested by the dev blog post should not be implemented its grossly imbalanced in favor of the defenderboth terrible ideas the current model of aggression during battle is fine except that logis escape too easily this is being fixed by transferring them true aggression preventing them from docking or jumping also you arent accounting for the use of neutral rr in situations like can flipping
in favor with everything what op said i will like to add one more thing  the cost to open the corp is ridiculous low correct me if im wrong but i think the price is around 152m so with new changes in war mechanics will not change most of the tactics of highsec corporation used to avoid the warwe all know most of the macrocheatbotwhatever corporations and many others have a ceo and all other members with no roles what that means  if you declare war now you will end up with 50 mil to pay for the war with a corporation what doesnt exist the same sec war is ready to start all what they have to do members leave the corp no roles no waiting ceo resign open new corp  profitall job done in less then a minuteccp seriously think they care for not be able to joinn back the same corp for 7 days no ofc they dont want and they dont care for the old corporation why should they the new one is so cheap there is no point to go back just make new one ofc on other side the guys who declare the war will remain with hitty taste in the mouth thanks to another fail solution from fail ccp factorylets be honest the price for the alliance is 1 bil so why not make the price for the corp 100 mil frankly 100 mil right now is not too much for the corporation and for anyone who will complain how new players will not be able to create corporations after 7 days in eve  yeah that is the point join some existing and after x amount of time if you want get out and make your own corporationat least the guys who will declare the war can have some sort of satisfaction  they pay 50 mil for the war and if other one run away they must pay 100 mil for the new one is not too much for people who run missions 247 but at least is not fing 2 mil
this one hit the spotit costs relatively real amount of isk to declare a war and laughable 2 mil to create a new corporation as long as this is the case the wardec mechanics will be broken
no matter what solution gets picked its convoluted and difficult to track youre exchanging one method to enforce wardec victim status for another id even go so far as to say that sticking with the original war deadlines is much simpler to understand and maybe easier to implement you are even invoking arbitrary restrictions that have little reason for existing except to satisfy some convoluted and difficulttotrack system there should be no restrictions to corp membership in no way should we tell someone they cant leave or join a corporation at any time whatsoever instead there should be actions and consequences they should be able to do so but they should not be able to escape their obligations by doing so whoever shelters the individualcorp also assumes those obligationsthe goal is to make people consider whether it is worth accepting the new member while the war is ongoing or to wait for the war to end at any given time either possibility may exist and if you read the whole post as one unified document youll notice that accepting the warring member into your corpalliance will come at a monetary cost you will pay to enter that war its not a free allythe first part i disagree with if you fleet up with someone you are specifically agreeing to work in coordination with that person or group if that group is at war youre implicitly contributing to that war and have chosen sides in a war with usa vs ussr if i ran fleet neutral maneuvers with ussr the usa would not take very kindly to it and would consider it an act of war and vice versai agree with the second part though we disagree on just what should get transferred this is in reference to the proposed group war transfer mechanics i should not be able to add someone to my fleet and thus force a war on everyone else without their consent nor should everyone be required to consent to a group member addition requiring the warring member to do the inviting changes the dynamic of the yes i agree consent to the war if that mechanic is not chosen for implementation this paragraph is meaninglesshonestly the way ccp described it shouldnt have even made it to a dev blog but its not the first time theyve had an idea that fell flat look back at what i wrote about costs in 8 and then read 9 about the allies you pay for each addition to the war much like you pay for mercs now it also implies the possibility for the aggressor to add allies as well again at a cost this benefits both sides equally draws more people into the war for the potential of destroyed assets and liquidates excess isk flooding the economythis is also a companion to the above points where people might want to involve others in the war with consent by corpalliance hopping instead of forcing some obnoxious employment history dance just let them involve others outright for a price each weekfirst it absolutely does include neutral rr in nonwartime situations if youll reread what i wrote the person you are neutralganking will gain killrights on you if i canflip bob in my pvp hac and have you as my neutral rr backup and bob decides to retaliate with his mining osprey the moment your neutral rr cycle begins bob gains killrights on you i didnt include before but you should have to agree to accept the consequences of your neutral rr actions you should be able to toggle this warningwe may disagree on this but neutral rr is a stain on hisec pvp my personal opinion is that it is the domain of cowards to employ this when many times they dont even need it because theyre attacking industrials or missionrunners anyway it removes the risk from pvpif you and i have declared war against one another we are fighting a concordsanctioned war any participating neutrals are interfering in what concord has approved there should be a cost and thus a formal entry into the war or there should be stiff penalties in order to remain neutral i disagree that the current model is fine but again like everything else neutral rr can and should be a possibility you can spring it on your targets at any time without warning much like suicide ganking if that mining osprey does manage to get that pvp hac into structure neutral rr should be able to save it but there should be a risk and there should be consequences
apologies for a second post but you can only quote five times in one post bahif the war follows the membercorpalliance no matter where they go for the duration of the original wardec then your botters or targets cant retreat to a new corp or even to npc corps those bots are out of commission for the duration of the wardec period unless they want to take a chance of dying at the end of the wardec period if the corp no longer exists the war cant be renewed
wouldnt this create a lot of database stress if applied to some large alliance in the process of disbanding happens all the time youll definitely have a lot corptoplayer aggressions to calculate
dont take me wrong i dont want grief tactics but at least some sort of ballance doesnt make sense to pay 50 mil for war and then have wasted all that money for nothing and in mean time the guys who were wdeced are laughing in the new corp they lost is only 2 mil the fact is war mechanics are broken even with new changes at the end i dont have any problem if the guys run away from the corp and open new one if that new one will cost 100 mil
bump cause i remember this taking off how long ago lol hopefully ccp sees that is refusing to go down
this idea was spawned in november of last year and was posted in features and ideas first and after the overwhelming feedback and support it received there i brought it to assembly hall in january of this year once again it was met with overwhelming support and feedback this idea came to me as an idea of something that would prove to be extremely useful to just about anyone on all fronts for actual logistical applications it would revolutionize the transport of warships across space highlownull and would create a new subcareer path for those interested in mass transitas a result of the massive response i have gotten to this idea i was given the suggestion of forwarding this to the csmi was met with a less than promising response at first however the member of the csm who i spoke with then said that they would look it over and upon looking it over said that this was indeed an interesting idea and that they would keep it handyi still havent gotten a chance to sketch what my vision of how the envoyclass vessels would look but thats due to real life constraints but given the chance ill get them done eventually and will post links to where the pictures are hosted as soon as i get them doneso thank you all for your support and no i am not giving up and not letting this idea go quietly into the night keep the posts coming and lets turn this thing into a threadnaught of epic proportionsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i am surprised i have yet to support this but yeahdo it do it nao
this  all that needs to be said has been said all the potential problems the a new bounty system like this could experience have been pretty much sorted all it needs now is some dev support
first of all if you use a scout andor bookmarks travling in nullsec is very safe im red to almost every nullsec alliance ingame and ive been to every region of the game often soloing in ab fit frigates sure you can construct really potent and viscous gatecamps but they are few and far between except for certain areas and easily avoidable if you know how to play in theory im ok with making gate camps a little less effective and making nullsec pve a little more risky however i dont think making gate camps completely ineffective nor making pve insanely risky is appropriate to give numbers currently i think you have a 2 chance of dying to a roaming gang while ratting with your proposal i think you have a 90 chance of dying to a roaming gang especially if you rat long enough for your system to register the npc kills this is a ridiculous swing of the scale 1 smaller vessels and cloaky vessels are already hard to catch and much much less vulnerable to enemies than bigger ships 2 when mining or shoting rats you are already vulnerable to an attacker typically the only viable defense is to avoid being attacked 3 changing rats is a nice idea but until that happens pve fits are different than pvp fits note i typically rat in pvp capable ships but i cant effectively engage a gang all it means i can sometimes take some of them down with me4 covert ships are not combat incompetent stealth bombers instalock targets and do good dps recons have very potent ewar bonuses that can shut down any opponent covert hotdrops cant be prevented and ships that warp while cloaked are extremely hard to catch as is so why do you need to significantly boost these ships by making them invulnerable to reconnasaince most of nullsec is in a huge bluefests with their neighboring alliances this means most of the traffic that comes through their system is friendly and with my local suggestion they would typically be anonymous hence they are friendly strangers many many nullsec residents have alts in alt corps that wont necessarily appear as a known local member if youre just hanging out in a system sure the more organized locals can do some math and realize the unknown is probably hostile but so what i dont see any good reason to make camping a system for killmails easier yes they are stripped of intel however youre proposal gives them infinite time to hunt a system for targets they can safely monitor stations or gates and take action when a target of opportunity presents itself the locals have no real defense except to do random scans of a system and why do you consider covert ops ships extremely vulnerable especially in your proposal i currently use stealth bombers and covert ops ships to tackle targets long enough for backup to arrive and rarely lose them i often solo jaguars wolfs and enyos in a helios with your proposal falcons and rapiers wont appear in local allowing a covert gang to not only instalock a target with a stealth bomber but they can then jam and immobilize most ships leaving very little risk to a covert gang
incorrect i target pveers all the time especially when soloing or small gang roaming i dont do it by endlessly lurking in their system until they get careless i do it by actually hunting them down i enter a system use the dscanner to quickly locate targets and i attempt to catch them something that requires at least a little skill i think making it mindlessly easy to hunt and gank pveers is not healthy for nullsec and thats exactly what your proposal enables as for pve vs pvp fits my opinion is irrelevant because pve and pvp fits are separate note id like more sleeperincursion types of nullsec pve because those pve gangs can easily be transformed into pvp gangs much of eves pve activities should take into account risk vs reward currently nullsec income for average joe is not very high especially when you consider the risks associated with it in comparison to whs incursions and highsec missioning yes nullsec ratting is fairly safe but its a little balanced with the rewards your suggestion destroys any safety a nullsec ratter has essentially turning nullsec pve into extremely high risk without touching the rewards i find that extremely problematic correct me if im wrong but it really sounds like you want to camp a system while being undetected so you can mindlessly gank vulnerable pilots i think nullsec hunting should involve roaming from system to system and actually hunting targets before they realize youre a threat while i consider camping a valid form of gameplay it requires so little skill as is that i really i do not think it should be made easier
i love all these ideas this would make mining more interesting and a bit more skilled as well as defeat most botting i would probably extend the length of the site time from 1 hour to 4 hours as i believe this is the most time a miner spends on a site with or without assistance eve residents 5 wh 8 lowsec 15 nullsec 72 highsec csm 7 1 highsec resident out of 14 csm demographics vs eve demographics nothing to worry about
well it wouldnt get rid of people advertising that way completely but if you give people a respectable looking alternative it will make the cans look more pathetic or desperate in comparison whos going to put an ad can next to a massive shiny billboard
alternatively these contracts could work by commissionyou could put up a contact that would be megathron by commission which would have a price on it you could set a percentage that the corp would keep when the item sold and then when people added the ore it could even show how much isk ore contributors will get out of the mega when it has sold that way the contact would have to be accepted by the person wanting the mega and ore would have to be added to it in another way the people looking to purchase the mega could even be able to see how close the mega is to being done when they decide whether they want to accept the contract this feels like its a difficult idea to convey in words over the forums if i had the time or the enthusiasm i should probably make example ui pictures to post up
cool variation of contracting another bonus of this could be that players working on commission do not require a ranking corporate member to set up a business contract because anyone would be capable of setting up a commission contract on behalf of their corporation this alone would regulate corporate business activity with added bonus of taxfreecontribution personal contracts what we have already business contracts issued by a qualifying corp member commission contracts issued by anyone within corp taxfree confliction taxfree commissions are subject to fidelity of a subsequent setup of a business contract which are not taxfree where theres an alreadyexisting commission contract in the likeness of the business contract you wish to create this commission contract may be adopted into a business contract at any time
lets get this up a bit so devs might respond on it
i dont really see the point but then ive never fallen for a scam or bought 20 battleships when i meant to buy 2 its actually rather hard to make mistakes like that if you are deliberate and dont play with a chemicallyaltered brain
we used to ask for personal hanger divisions like the corp hangers have we got unified inventory i wonder how they will make personal wallet tabs terrible
good pointdont touch the wallets
its not just the scamslets say you put market order for sell and server is laggy you think you inputted 1 million per item when in fact you did 10 million and you just hit enter and there we go instead of 10000 isk tax per item you are paying 100000 isk tax per item if you have 50 items thats like 5 million just there now lets say you wanted to sell for 10 million and you put in 100 million by mistake well you get the pointand yea there is warning that you are selling above or below some  of regional average but lets face it when you do trading you do that a lot and you just press enter 
and your solution is towhat put jut enough into an account to cover your order and then place the order youre talking about adding several steps to the process because you arent waiting a couple of seconds to be sure you got the right number in your order
your not gonna have much say in the matter and posting about it here since its not even live yet wont get you anywhere eitherand sorry to sayid rather see for myself before im sold im petitioning on live not sisiso we shall wait and see then  stop the evemail spam
if it was deployed into tq as it is right now i dont think too many people would have a serious issue with this ive managed to use it just fine and next week i will probably post here saying the same damn thing i think the issue youre having here is a personal issue that gamedevs cant fix sorry bud
its all speculation right now my prediction is rage dual pane idea click
do you run a pos
ive used the new ui and frankly with the exception of the terrible refresh rate i dont see anything wrong with iti run a corporation which means lots of windows i also do alot of salvaging watching the video i cant help but say hes doing it wrong because i had no problems whatsoever its called a unified inventory for a reasonalso drake is right about the whole its on the test server thing it wont be very long at all now until its released on tq if its still bad rant away im sure that even i will eventually find reasons to complain
what  every player got those problems maybe you need to open your eyesthis unified inventory system is a semideveloped inventory system in alpha statethe opened windows dissapear when someone docking out or up same thing happen when the pilot change solar systemsthe system dont remember the windows positions and size and need to open and set again and again every time difficult to handling in many situations in pvp for pos manager for capitalship pilotslooting etcbut you talking about you had no problems lol
this is ridicilousplayers have been asking for the ability to name pos mods forever and we still dont have itnow they introduce a inventory window that looks super neat works really fast but is not yet ready for releaseif you live at a pos youll see your inventory cluttered with all the guns all the smas hangars without the ability to sort or filter of any kind which is a waste of my screen space i dont want to see all my guns that i cant even access because theyre 40k awayand not even the search funtion is working properly  check this outi mean comeon this is ye olde ccpnot listening to players and just  their own gameand check out the damn video goliath
suphave you seen general discussion in the past 5 minutesdual pane idea click
tippias video is clear precise and illustrates places where functionality is lost or the new ui can be improved upon ccp rubberband is responding to that promising that while the old ui isnt coming back your concerns will be addressedhow is that a problem i realize the new inventory might not be perfect in this release but give it a few patches and some time to have actual tq feedback before signing off and reaching for the monument shooting lasers
people have a strange sense of entitlement these days ccp is one of the few gaming companies that will go into a dialogue with its player base but thousand of eve online players seem to think that means they can have their specific pet peeve addressed immediately with a personal apology from the company ceo you get to give them feedback if its constructive and well presented they will likely listen to you and improve in future iterations if you instead come off as an angry child youre likely to be dismissed as such
no they where given lots of good feedback as to why the new ui sucked and warned not to go live with the current system they ignored all the advise and reservations bought in a system which is less functional and less intuitive and now they get to listen to the complaintstal
yup that is horribe ccp didnt listen to playerbaselot of players tell to ccp at least 1 month ago what is the problem with their new inventory system some member created videos from mistakes but ccp answer was this ccp arrow wrotein the sessions the whole team observed the live feed and took notes on everything the participants did we dont do user tests because we dont believe you when you say there is a problem we want to address it correctly and by seeing it in action with our own eyes we can more easily find a solution to the problems you have foundso where is the csm when the playerbase need them why need moving to jita or amarr to shot monuments if the playerbase need attention just 1 year passed and ccp make same mistake again they want lose in every years 20k players and they want fixing their mistakes in every year to bring them back this is the smartest solution 
i must admit that i didnt check it out on sisi i should have done because what i see on tq is simply bad the people who came up with the concept for unified inventory obviously do not play evedraging stuff back and forth fromto that very minimalistic tree view is a pain delivering stuff to corp member hangars is almost impossible because only half of the hangars appear and the list isnt even sorted overall performance of anything related to corp hangars still sucks
i work in software engineering  if i gave a response to customer feedback like ccp goliath did to my clients id be out on my arseshort and sweet is  the inventory is sht
with the amount of negative feedback its a suprise they didnt hold of with releasing the new inventory management screen till it was actually usableccp dropped the ball big time here they should release it when its ready not when its barely out of alphabut it seems they wanted it out now regardless
here is a clear indication that its a fail featurethere is currently a flurry of mails in a corp on possible work around or possible tactics to avoid using it good god who is the business analyst  on the project do you not consult with the users ccp it also illustrates how out of touch some of your staff are with the customers needs seriously  w t f
admitedly i have yet to see this systembut considering the hemoraging blood coming from various threanaughtsfair enoughi concedethis does not bode wellusually test servers are indicators of testing in progressbut it seems i have a little to much faith in ccp  stop the evemail spam
insurance was never intended to cover t23faction shipsit is currently based on the mineral market value not sure if average over region or as a while it comes to about 70 of the t1 cost which is what ccp intended it covers only the mineral value not value of salvage not value of tags not value of lp not value of moon goo not value of industrialist markup only the mineral valuethis is how ccp fixed it to be and intended it to be therefore it cannot be brokenjust because it isnt how you want it doesnt make it brokenthere that simplified enough
simple yes broken yes your point also makes mine
no my point specifically refutes yoursit is as it is designed and intended therefore it is not broken you just dont like the way ccp wants it oh well deal with it
agreed stop the evemail spam
yeh that not my problem i fully understand
of course you understand yourselfyou wrote the bloody post derp derphow about the rest of us eh stop the evemail spam
proposing a new service section in eve marketplace board services for hire jump clone standing grind merc etc has little to do with selling goods they are currently buried in the overcrowded sell section of the forum rendering them unfindable sell board is filled with shortlived but spamtastic merchandisehawking threads seekers of services often had to resort to google which often gave ancient results of defunct corps whose owner have since died irlmercs for hire threads have since moved to cp where they hang out with the discussionwhine threads standing grind threads used to be in pve section but got moved to sell section by mods where they may die jump clone threads are out of luck from the beginningeve economy has a service sector now that wardec mechanics have be changed to favor more merc work it might be a good time for a minor addition to the forums to facilitate buying and selling of services
yes supportednull sec  low sec players are bored so spice things up  and if you dont like the ops suggestions offer better ones saying i dont like it with no because added gives the csm and ccp nothing to go on at all if you think the changes should not happen why not i think they ought to as they would add to the game the longer rats are left unattended the more mischief they should get up to  inculding building thier own pos complete with guns attacking soviergnty structures and claiming soverignty if noone defends
this would be a cool thing too add1 
this thread is a sting by ccp to identify bot herders flocking in to object to horrible idea
this idea came to me while avoiding writing an essay for uni and is intended to spice thing up a little and to provide a positive altrenative to the suicide ganker playstylearise sir ratany player account who has achieved 25 unique pvp kills in eve should unlock a speical 4th character slot which is a mechanical device not a true character slot visually it could be just an empire icon next to the usual 3picking the rat option the player should then be given a choice  which factions to fight for which should be changable once per two months once a sanshas or other pirate faction the player is randomly allocated a ship they quality for in space the ship should not be able to be docked but otherwise should operate normally if the player leaves the ship by dc or ejecting the npc pilot resumes command the player can then go do thier worst against other players as a supersmart ratas a player collects combat rat points on thier rat toon by blowing things up they should advance in what ships  contexts they qualify for starting atmining belt rat highsec mining belt rat any complex basic rat complex medium rat complex advanced rat complex commander rat incursion rat bmac incursion logistics ship all your rats belong to us rat admiral by invitation only jovian highsec incursion ratall your rats belong to usthe rat player can jump at will from rat ship to rat ship in the system effectively flying the whole rat squadron player is not removed from scene until the last rat is destroyed mechanically using the get in ship command with range  200 km rat admiralthe rat player can call other rat pilots to join their rat fleet setting requirements as preferred the random allocation then streams qualifying pilots to that encouter enabling a rat admiral to potentially have a complete incursion fleet under rat player control arise lady catany player who has achieved 5000000000 units of metals mined in eve should unlock a speical 4th character slot which is a mechanical device not a true character slot visually it could be just an empire icon next to the usual 3again unlocking a new character slot but for empire factions or concord if qualifying for both the player must choose cat or ratcats get to prowl their empire space or highsec for concord looking for wanted criminals may engage on locating anyone who is wanted and can fly to asteroid belts etc looking for thieves hard coded to not be able to do anything that would trigger a criminal flag your lawful crew politely refuses to open that can or fire on the gate guns also randomly allocated with the allocation preferrentially directing the cat player to any qualifying system where two or more rat players are cat admirals may issue or accept invites from players with good standing towards their played faction yes this would mean that potentially a rat player incursion would end up fighting a cat player fleet  normal players sounds like a recipie for carnage checks and balancesrandom allocation this is essential or the system would be abused duh the rat pilot needs to appear somewhere without any power to choose where but this is important  the idea is fun so the rat should be added into a location where a player currently is active its no fun if you are a rat in an asteroid belt in a system noone is miningto the victor the spoils a rat admiral incursion fleet should give higher rewards fighting players is after all significantly harder than fighting npcs with their predictable tactics the more rat players in the fleet the higher the reward should be personally i would have a random plex drop chance added in everyone in the fleet has a low  chance of a plex dropping in the station where thier medical clone is if they defeat a rat admiral fleet with 3 or more rat players in itboth rats and cats would be able to loot things normally  so a long lived cat or rat would potentially have very tasty loot anyway perhaps the wrecks of catrat ships should be automatically bluethe player pilot gets ejected if the ship does not fire before taking 50 of its defences if in range with the rat crew mutinying against their cowardly captain 10 rat points pilot may eject at will which after 20 seconds logs them out the ship instantly reverting to npc control and if in a strange place like a concord battleship at an asteroid belt will despawn according to the usual npc despawn rulesmaps the rat pilot should have no starmap waypoint or autopilot options they are where they are they should be given wh entrances  exitsthe intent of having high entry level criteria is that rats in particular are only flown by players who know what they are doing and have been in eve for a significant time while any system is open to abuse as hulkageddon shows it is not too bold to expect that someone who works long and hard to command an incursion rat fleet will use it for fun carnage and mayhem as intended not simply suicide it for isk and risk being banned from ever playing a rat againlet the flaming begin

lolclassicso yeah op is completely loony thats my subtle way of saying not supportingop should go post in the rp board stop the evemail spam
i qualify for both positions there as does my alt i can get free plex by killing my alts
no you cant get free plex by killing your alts under the proposal abovealthough you probably did get free plex already by inviting your alts as friends right you currently get free plex by killing your alt if your alt gets huge bounties on him and then you pod him and buy plex with the iskies that already happens now so dont tell me that this game can never have such a system as above because it could potentially be abused everything you add into a sandbox could potentially be abused that does not mean that it should not be added it simply means it needs appropriate limitations and rules around it to permit censure if it does get abused
so you wish to launder iskgot itnot supporting and im likely to report you for attempting to create an exploit stop the evemail spam
youre an idiot not for not supporting the op just in general you should post less
the only idiot here is the one who derails threadsfeel free to argue why its not what i seem to think it is and be a little helpful and lessstupidunless you can tell me theres a better way to define what it is hesheit is trying to propose eh stop the evemail spam
ive been reading up on the new mods and it looks like some of them can only found in game as bpcs i can understand ccp trying out a new way to introduce items and if this were tech 2 stuff itd be fine until the players had a chance to invent it but for tech 1 and as a copy only i feel like there needs to be a better way to add new modules into a game this seems like its going against the grain of the game and the current manufacturing system
in what way it seems like a good way to limit the supply to me seeding bpos means the market will be flooded by this time tomorrow
i love all these ideas here this would make mining more interesting and a bit more skilled as well as defeat most botting i would probably extend the length of the site time from 1 hour to 4 hours as i believe this is the most time a miner spends on a site with or without assistance i also like the idea of being more genuine eve residents 5 wh 8 lowsec 15 nullsec 72 highsec csm 7 1 highsec resident out of 14 csm demographics vs eve demographics nothing to worry about
oh hey look another carebear trying to threaten ccp with the hulkageddon is costing you money argument i can play that game too i have paid over a decades worth of subscription fees and i would cancel both of my accounts if ccp tries to stop hulkageddon again ie more nerfs to suicide gankinghonestly if you want farmville in space then go play something else we have something special here and just because it doesnt appeal to everyone doesnt mean it should be changed until it does for the sake of increasing sales ccp isnt this faceless corporation that sees nothing but the bottom line aka blizzard
pretty much this but then anything lady flute says these days if screaming bittercarebeartroll as it isyou want carebearing go play hello kitty online stop the evemail spam
really would like to know how plex is a debt around ccps neck if there is plex sitting in game ccp shouldnt care considering the cash used to put that plex in game is now in their pocketscan i get some of whatever your smoking please
i think hes talking about plex game time as liability  the service is already paid for and yet to be redeemed however someone also hasnt read the eula very closely ccp can discontinue their service in total or partially without warning for any reason its listed in the liabilities but it has a clause for pure profit edit i forgot to mention that the op is also wrong about how plex are introduced to the game and what sort of effect they have on ccp finances
thats not the only thing the op is wrong about stop the evemail spam
in other words its a debt that may not be repaid ccp can invalidate those plex youve stocked up one day when they feel like making you pay cash subscription instead isnt that nice
what is this debt previous post is a sarcastic quip so im overlookingthere is no debtplex dont come down from the heavens out of shiny unicorns rear ends out of thin airexception there of being as prizes or awards for getting buddies to join got one for my wife for examplewhat is this debt crap you speak of stop the evemail spam
would love to get a unicorn that crapped out plexes
yes however what people are forgetting to mention is that the people buying the plexs are still spending more money than one person would on a monthly subscription 3499 vs 30 or whatever it comes out to i wont even compare the numbers of the 3 6 and 12 month subscription plans plex are working as intended as long as ccp doesnt go and spend all the money from plex purchases at once i see that as some sort of project fund that the money is put into and if sht hits the fan they can just take it out of that fund or use the fund as intended makes sense to me
i know of one that craps out freaking rainbow laser beams that destroys buildings and thingsdont ask me how i found that outjust look up mr toots or something my bosses boss knew about itred faction armageddon would be the source of this nefarious creeature stop the evemail spam
i would love to see the assets merged into the new item hangar and then just be able to filter it to the current system region ect plus with this i wouldnt have to open up two windowsedit you could also possibly merge the wallet into this too although that might be stretching it a bit
how about if they fix the massive screw up that the unified inventory was first before trying to tack more stuff on to it they should fix what they already did first
sorry im not aware of any problems currently what is wrong with it
the main issue is that is breaks the old functionality of being able to have multiple inventory windows open to work with you can shiftclick to add in new windows but they vanish and everything resets after session changesit also seems to be loading much slower due to having to index everything for the file tree on the left and pos users are having issues because its literally showing every hanger silo array and gun in that list and none of them are able to be labeled the biggest issue i have is that ccp knew about the issues with it theres a 18 page thread in the test server forum where people have been providing well explained and reasoned feedback on the issues for over a month and ccp has just brushed it under the rug the same as they did the players warnings about incarna that thread is a good read if youre looking to understand the issues people have with the new inventory
just be lucky that only vgs got nerfed and hqs are still the samenot sure if they changed anything
no that is all
there is no griefing in eve unless specified by the devs declaring war on someone is not griefing its a legitimate pvp player interaction whoever came up with the term griefing needs to be shotoh well theres always dust 514 corp infilitration and killing and suicide ganking i suggest people turn to those methods in the future instead of using the war declaration system
when i say grief tactics i was referring to the post of meytalmaybe one of the solution can be to raise up the cost for the corp in alliance to 10 mil and introduce the cost of 500k for the corp per member so if someone left the corp during the war the money what corp pay for that member during the war will go to the attacker for example if someone leave the corp after 3 weeks that corp was in war the attacker will get 15 mil same go if the corporation left the allianceprices i put are only for example but i think good way to finally bring some sort of ballance in war mechanicsif anyone want to go for suicide ganking up to him to decide how will play eve if we have war mechanics why not use them in proper way

make defender missiles worth usingthread
i am not completely opposed to this however do have a suggestion aegis cruisers of modern navies utilize point defense weapons usually in the format of a 20millimetersuggestion gatling gun linked to radar and acoustical detection so with that i would say give these new ships point defense batteries that require you to target the aggressing missile boat and when missiles come in these batteries open up with an extremely lightweight ammunition in 4shots per point defense battery let the aegis detroyer fit 4 of them and give it a percentile chance to destroy the incoming missiles and you reduce incoming damage also make it so said batteries are purely defensive so that they cannot be utilized to engage other ships and youre goldeni am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

just noticed something as i was watching the realtime gamelogs in the client looking for funny stuff after patch053254 svcgameui notice i am now afk after being idle for 601 seconds053511 svcgameui notice i am no longer afk after being idle for 736 secondsgame already knows when you are afk and isnt telling us out of a conscious choice
do you see this notice on other players as well or just yourselfalso cloaking is fine
agreed
only noticed it myself and only in the client through ctrlaltshiftm how ever it indicates that the do track this and have a state for it that they are deliberately not sharingand yes cloaking is fine
isnt it a better idea to have maybe a destroyer or something class ship that is capable with training to seek out the general location of a cloaked pilot not necessarily exact but close enough to use something like flack charges to decloak once the subject is found so that your buddies can come in and kill the threat once it is uncloakedthis would bring a positive defense aspect to the game of 00 camped systems and also bring a new class of ship or utilize a under utilized ship class training and would make the afk cloaker have to pay attention to their afk cloaked toon making them have to move around once the saw that there was a threat to their afkness thus they would no longer be afk but active in systemthis could also have a positive effect on bringing mre fights as well as bringing care bearing toons to a level of home defense rather than just oh crap we have a cloaked red in system safe up and sit for the rest of the day
1 if you are worried about server load or system load then why arent you worried about ccps web servers having to serve your digital crap threads that dont even look like they are composed by someone competent enough to play eve let alone  about what is wrong with it2 ccp cant get rid of macros botters whatever you want to call it someone will always do it someone will always write another program or find some sort of exploit  but to think that somewhere in your little head lies the answer to a problem that has plagued eve online and ccp for years that is a bit  when you consider they probably have hundreds of people working on every part of the game including security and how to stop current macros and bots and be ready to spot new ways people are doing it what you thought they dont employ these kinds of people3 you arent going to get rid of bottersmacroshackerscheaters or whatever else you want to call them it isnt happening why there is always another proxy server there is always a new exploit every time you update your purdy lil game and there are always young and eager coders out there waiting to see what they can achieve with their skills and even worse those who will pay to get a working program to have that extra edge in game also you cant prove someone is botting in the first place if all this is nothing more than oh you did action a b c and d you must be a bot people have schedules and sometimes play at the same times every day some dont want anything to do with anyone else in the game and just want to be left alone and have their fun doing whatever and no they dont feel the need to speak to you in local private or mail and the same actions a bot or a macro would take if engaged by a player would probably be the same  a person would do ie warp off to a station and dock up to safety warp somewhere else or log off if you were a miner wouldnt you save your  too thought sosure you can do whatever ban people spy on their accounts track them look through all their stuff in the end you are probably going to alienate more users who are actually not using bots than actually reducing the bot population team that with all of these crap expansions that continually need patch after patch after patch and this could end up a pretty hollow community wow and eve wont be the only halfway decent mmos forever there will be others
and yet the proposal was setup to prevent that kind of abuse it may not have gone quite far enough imo but that isnt for me to determine the proposed shield would be part of any trial account regardless of source and would have the fixed 2 week time frame an account lock would make absolutely certain that it cant get used by an unscrupulous veteran the other restrictions can be adjusted as needed the need for something like this is there and the internet spaceships is serious business crowd wont admit it without the new blood that most of them feel completely free to abuse the rest of us lose an awesome gamepeople make suggestions on how to bring this in line with protecting the new player while not destroying anything you hold dear the account lock part is absolutely nonnegotiable the time limit does have some wiggle room but should not exceed the normal trial length as far as im concernedthings like the capital defenses can be brought more in line with other types of ships but should not be removed by delaying the first ship loss by a week or more you give that new player a chance to come to grips with how things actually do work based on mechanics the new alts usually wont even notice the module as they usually spend the first couple of months locked in a station with a whole bunch of skill bookssomething has to be done if you dont like the original suggestion please make suggestions dont just flame away because its different then how we started like it or not the people who are joining now are going to quit when they get killed over a stupid mistake that an experienced player wouldnt normally make this is a fact that all of us already know as the ragequit phenomenon either we protect them somehow or this game dies a slow and horrible death when someone else gets it right
oh where did i state that theyd be invulnerable where have i ever stated that this couldnt be modified are you going to post tripe and crap about how its just a bad thing or are you going to make an actual suggestion to make it better or at least workable from your point of viewuntil you make a constructive post of some kind versus this type of flamebait im going to classify you as a latent troll until proven otherwise and ignore anything further from you
im sorryeveryone was under the impression your idea was a troll in the first placemaybe you should try again yes stop the evemail spam
classify me as a troll all you want it doesnt negate the fact that newbies dont need special protection in fact what they need to do is to learn the mantra dont fly what you cant afford to lose and dont be dumb about making yourself into a too juicy target newbies shouldnt be supercoddled that just creates newbies which turn into even bigger whiners when they finally do get ganked eve is harsh and the quicker newbies learn that and adapt the better
wow people are so short sighted sometimeseveryone seems to think that a new player doesnt deserve some kind of protection from the asshats who deliberately target them make suggestions that are better rather then repeating that eve is a dark and cruel place there are more mmos that are geared towards pvpconflict that provide some kind of basic protection for the new player the pvp servers for runes of magic have a block on pvp against low level players for instanceill ask again why is doing something to protect the new player a bad thing back lash from the first loss is inevitable its going to happen regardless of when that loss happens a sense of invulnerability in highsec isnt that the case alreadyif no one else is willing to suggest something to modify this then its a dead issue too bad that the typical lack of reading comprehension is killing a possible discussion with short sighted ideas on how the player base should continue to abuse the new playerson that note im done with this topicpeople failing to see the potential in something simply because its not how they started playing congrats its attitudes like this that cost us other games that had a lot of potentialfinished
my quote still standsto a certain degree yes it is just look at how much some people whine the first time they get ganked thats because theyve thought themselves invincible in hisec a place where the developers themselves have said should be safer not safeits not a lack of reading comprehension its you being just like one of those parents who whine about how something or other has to be changed to protect the children because god forbid they might scrub their knee or break a nail while playing or somethingeve is a harsh place the sooner they learn this the sooner they can adapt their mentality and start playing more cautiously and the less theyll whine in the long run
rather than being given an utterly arbitrary invulnerability for their first however long of playing they need to learn asap what is possibly the 1 rule of evedont fly what you cant afford to loseits an absolutely foolproof way of making sure you never take a crippling loss

am i missing the forum thread started by our august csm members trying to address our concerns about the inventory rage stormapparently everyone on the csm loves the new inventory interface and wants it exactly how ccp implemented it but if people are expressing concerns about how it negatively affects their game play isnt it the job of the csm to facilitate our concerns to ccpdo we even need the csm i mean if we have to go directly to ccp with our concerns doesnt that simply mean we wasted our time electing several useless people who only want to fly for a free vacation to icelandthe best argument against democracy is a fiveminute conversation with the average goon  the mittani
when is the angry mob going to actually engage brain and start to realize the csm is nothing more than a mouth piecethey have no powerno influenceno swayccp can tell them to step off anytime they wantoh sure it might help if csm actaully bothered to participate theres a concept in day to day posts and assembly hallbut lets be honest hereyour expecations of what csm can and cant do are seriously out of this solar systemnever mind the world stop the evemail spam
they dont pretend to care unless it screws their alliance the new and improved inventory screws everyone equally so theyre okay with that
hell if theyd post in assembly hall once a week thatd be awesome and i think more ideas could be collated and run through the system to be processed for actually applying them to eve but as it seems you want to get a response from the csm send them an eve mail although chances are of the entire lot of them youll only get one responsei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
or they will spam the  out of youcsm majority of are more interested in their free trip to iceland and getting fame more so than actually helping us out not that they could do much in hte first placedamnit floppieyou dang will better run for next terms csm stop the evemail spam
the only ones that actually care about communicating with players didnt get elected so dont expect much
draconis wrong as usual i actually had some communications with the csm lately and of the entire lot got one reply and for the love of god get off of everyones i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
uhyeahsurejust keep right on goingeve mail means nothingprivate convos mean nothingwe need a public face on the csmand right now that public face is a crock stop the evemail spam
welp  its out there and a bunch of folk unhappy about itso csm  care to respondi seem to remember listening to you on everadio talking this up like it was really cool and usefulit is obvious that none of you have even looked at ityou all probably only log into eve once a month or so and even then only sit on comms to issue orders to your minions
the csm is pretty quiet i dont think they understand they are supposed to help the player base whats the point in having a csm if they arent going to help us maybe they are waiting for the mittani to tell them what to do seems like they really are nothing but goonie petsthe best argument against democracy is a fiveminute conversation with the average goon  the mittani
completely agree with the op the new inventory system is broken
a lot of pissed off people on this issueyou guys should point out to ccp that no one was complaining about the old system
you know there is an issue when jita scammers take time away from scamming to spam about the issue on a more serious note this system is unusable in its current iteration
i disagreeinventory and assets is definitely a priority and does need upgrading and change this current release was just not ready for a production copy of eve ccp needs to put more devs on it and get it iterated to hell it should function properly and more in line to what were used to while implementing new and forward thinking design dual pane idea click
with the new unified inventory i havnt needed more than one window open so alot of the problems described arnt problems at all for me and ive had no problem with windows refreshing again because i only need one window openi sympathise however with the people trying to use it in more complex ways having problems supported get the bugs fixed even though they dont really affect mei just hate every post you make his opinion was just as probably more valuable than yours he is obviously using the system the way it was intended to be used the guy in the video has opened up and set up loads of differant windows because he seems to think its more effective somehow which is retarted because all the things he was doing were just as easily done from one window if you only have one window open it doesnt close going through gates and there are no problems with it refreshingi appreciate that people should be able to use the inventory system any way they want but the fact that the unified inventory works in the vast majority of cases if you use it the way it was intended to be used shows that it was fine to be released now that it has been released we can talk about fixing the bugsyou are such a massive troll and i hate your posts all of them often i see you say something so stupid i just have to comment on itps topic still supported fix the bugsin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
not to be insulting but you seemed to miss the entire point of the video he wasnt trying to see one container ship corp hangar ect at a time he wanted an overview of the items in his possession with the current overview system this is as you saw in the video impossible so we go back to the point of this thread the update breaks some of the basic functionality of the inventory
majority of players pissed off about ccp fixing something that wasnt broken and ccp either trying to convince us that its great or ignoring us completely why does this sound familiar oh right were just back to the ccp of 2 years ago when player account numbers were dropping and they had to do a 180 and grovel to the player base to get them back no wonder this road looks familiar
this does feel a lot like cq again only this time its effects have reached us all the way in the whs
shift and clickok i got it now once i have opened and then minimized the inventory to a button on the left side menu then i can open containers in their own window by using shift and click i got it ok but how is this better when this whole process was previously completed with just 1 clickdont give me that just dont

go back to page 1 btw you do production often
the best is when a fitted t3 value is 2 billions but the platinum insurance payback 20 million for you p
so i read the whole thread but i still dont get what is broken about t1 insurances afaik the insurance is calculated by the avaerage mineral pricecan someone please dump this down for meas for faction t2 and t3 insurances thats a matter of opinion
t2 is produced with t1 ship hullsfaction uses the t1 hull as trade with the lp storet3 has subsystems that should be accounted for into the insurance of the hull its not cause it cant be flown with out themfew others seem to be understanding just fine corin  l0rd carlos nothing is broken with t1 insurance just insurance in generalbuy an omen of the market you pay for insurance you get platinum now you spent more isk to get around 70 of it back so you paid total of 12mill for an 8 mill ship to get only 70 of that 8 mill and if you instead of selling it later put it into t2 version of it that insurance becomes null  i do this often
you still havent explained why it is broken rather than working as intendedyou just keep spouting your own opinion mixed with facts that are meaningless
im sorry you dont understand what ive said on the breakdown of it but i remain correct that it is broken t2 should reflect the t1s insurance payout
im also against having to  around with upgrading your clone 1 to removing or at least reducing clone upgrade etc costs
i think we should reduce clone costs significantly but increase pod align times from instant warp to about 4s 25s with skills this will have signicant impacts on the game 1 outlaws trying to travel through hisec no have to worry about zealous interceptor pilots camping them into lowsec 2 losing your pod in lowsec pvp will become far more prevelant 3 the added risks to clones makes implants more risky to use

ugh been here before with these dumb moves via incarnas shown the door mindset i hate the new interface in station i use to love to use station containers to sort my gear  name it shield ore ect ect  open it and look at the pictures drag what i needed out of it then on to the ship now holy crap it is like an old fortran logic script give eve a kiss  keep it simple stupid  no way is this faster or easier  i am hoping maybe bugs will be worked out but i am afraid dust 514 changes will prevent it oh well eve was fun why it lasted
you changed your subject matter 3 times incarna inventory dust 514 and became unintelligiblemind speaking english please stop the evemailUFFFDspam
yes you are correct drake i stand corrected i rambled too much i am just so cheesed about the new interface when doing inventory i just want my old drag down station inventory system back again  items to staion containers labled ect ect i am so darn tired of eve fixing things that do not need to be fixed
oh inventory needed to be fixed when i consolidated all my crap to sell it off in jita i realized just how poor inventory management is in eve its just that the new inventory doesnt really make it any better if theyll work out the bugs and make some improvements itll get better
kinda figured thatbut you need to be consistent or your not gonna get very far but yeaheve is kinda turning into windows anymore stop the evemailUFFFDspam

dont support the idea mostly because its completely bonkers i like the idea that you can team up with a faction  guristas  serp  sansha etc but thats all i like having players roam around griefing with trollfaces on attacking unsuspecting newbies with terrible skills in missions already happens  giving players a way to do it without being concorded is just ludacrisif in your scenario youve got a newbie drake trying to take on three npc battleships his tank is slowly being whittled down he cant sustain it grieferplayerrat warps in warp jams him and newbie dies all pvp revolves around warp jamming or doing enough alpha damage so they pop before they can warp if player rats cant warp jam theres actually no reason to this idea because the player can and will escape so which is it that grieferplayerrats will have extreme high dps or jamming capabilitesgrieferplayerrat sits there in all his glory after annihilating a newbie looting his ship and leaving the guy with nothing grieferplayerrat doesnt get concorded because hes a rat also what about all the people who just want to rat in peace highsec mission runners with ships worth excess of tens of billions the people who want to just fight computer artificial intelligence instead of being suprised by some griefer whos come to destroy months of effort if i i recall you were complaining about hulkageddon and how it targetted people who just wanted to do their own thing kind of hypocrital to suggest thisthis completely goes against eves sandbox principle if people can meet whatever criteria to become a rat they should be allowed to do whatever the hell they want when theyre a rat which is exactly why we have hulkageddon because thats an example of people doing whatever the hell they wantthe bounty system is also as stated before a loophole to launder isk you want to know why bounties in eve dont work because people just pod themselves and claim their own bounty its free isk from everybody who adds to the bounty same thing can just happen in this you lost me at lady cat i really dont know how to interpret this other than some odd way of roleplaying but whatever rocks your boat is up to you this is a sandbox game after all what is 5 billion units of metal so the industrialistsminers of eve get to play for concordempire factions in what logical way do those two connect at allwhat is a thief or wanted person in my experience in highsec youve got a billion people whove stolen at one point in time or another but you cant kill them unless theyre flashing red so what exactly are you proposing here that these superminerswhosuddenlybecamepvpers can just waltz around jita killing everybody whos got a skull next to their name because they killed somebody sometime ages ago thats just stupidconcord is in the game as a gods judgement for when players really break the rules like trying to attack a station in highsec or killing other players for no reason at all i dont understand any reason or use for having players partake in that  as there is no use for themalso please dont call them cats this is actually not hello kitty onlinethen you talk about how rats vs cats can fight sounds like a broken flawed version of fleet warfareanyway thats why i think myself and everybody else in this game dont support this idea before posting topics in the assembly hall try to post them in features  ideas discussion board first dont give the csm more work to sort through threads that are not going to get the goahead
improvements to the mercenary marketplaceokay guys before you tart reading i just want to let you know that there might be some spelling errors or grammar mistakes but anyway do read thisthe merc marketplace in inferno was a good idea mercenary corps can make isk easy in empire by helping carebears who have been war decked or alliances that have been decked and want protection for logisticsbut i have a idea on how we can improve on this good idea and ccp are good at improving or adding to featuresbasically we help null sec and low sec mercanerys by doing two thingsin the nerocom there could be a separate market button for the mercenary market do people can contactlook for mercs easilythe next thing is adding contracts to this marketplace that describe the job that needs doing and it could have some of the following in itsytem links this could show the mercs what system they need to be in or systems depending if they need to be in more than one for a jobtitle title of the contract hey guys i need this pos killedissuer this part of the contract shows who issued the contract weather it be alliencecorpplayeralthough there could be a anonymous option if the employer does not wish to be known preferred ship typestype this section could say if the mercmerc corp needs to bring a certen type of ship there should also be a any optiontargettargets this section could have the linked name or names of the alliencecorpguygangconvoy ambushstructure that the mercanerysmerc needs to take out or harasstime of job this section could show what time the contract needs to happen at example camp this gate at 2100 eve time a logistics ship should be jumping in with escort at this time destroy it and take the cargo for me make sure to link the kill report there could also be a no specific time option there could also be a countdown untill the specific time as well as the words now for when the timer is donedate same as the time part but says what date the required job is needed to be done there could also be a countdown for the monthweekday until the job if it is on the day that the job is on then it could say today in this section there could also be a any and from  to  option in this part of the contractdescription of job this part of the explains what the mercenarysmerc must do as this a text box it could be anything from the employer asking for a gate camp or a hit for example lets say someone ordered a hit on a target it could read out like this hey guys im looking for a corp or lone contractor who could kill this guy his name is horrorgun linked name i keep ganking him and he sent me this eve mail i dont know who you are i dont know what you want if you are looking for ransom i can tell you i dont have money but what i do have are a very particular set of skills skills i have acquired over a very long career skills that make me a nightmare for people like you if you stop ganking me now thatll be the end of it i will not look for you i will not pursue you but if you dont i will look for you i will find you and i will kill youif possible i would like the target to be killed and forced to move to anouther system 100m isk will be your rewardtarget danger level this section has three tick boxes that show how dangerous this contract is safe  dangerous   suicidal x there could also be a option that says unknown if the employer does not know how hard the job will bekill mails apon completion this part only applies if the contract was a hit convoy ambush or structure kill or checked then this means that the mercenarymerc must link a ingame killmailkillmails to prove the job is done this option can be unchecked if the employer trusts the mercspayout this part shows what is the reward for the job it could be a ship item or iskthats the idea for the merc contracts but i have one more idea if it is going to be a real marketplace then a merc corp could have the option of advertising themselves on the market with information on what jobs they can dotldr make a real merc marketplace that works like contracts but also allows merc corps to advertise themselves
ccp tries to buff exploration but ends up nerfing everyone else well mostly just droneboats actually
they havnt nerfed anything they have just buffed them less than you likethis proposal is stupid its refreshing to see ccp seeding mods in other ways nextin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
im not against seeding mods in this manner just seeding t1 m1 mods if they were at least bpos id be happy
i think its a good idea at least until we can see if these positive resistance modules are not too op for armor hacs rejoice amarr and enjoy them while ye can as for the others the drone damage module is avail as bpo
still a bad ass idea and i support it 100
a ship specially designed for this role isnt the worst idea in the world but at the same time there are two ships that cover some of the basessupercarriers aka mothershipstitanstitan bridges can be used for quick redeployment and even be set up as a ferry system that people can use to move ships very quickly the titan has a 5 million m3 ship maintenance array super carrier has a 25 million m3 ship maintenance arrayat the same time there is a need for something that doesnt require that much resources for such logistics then again how tanked would this tug be and how viable would it be to actually use in hostile space
well the issue is with those ships is they can only be effectively utilized in low and nullsec that leaves high sec shorted but then again you being a member of one of the nullsec blocs i cant expect you to want anything to help high sec i am putting forth this idea as something that will directly help everyone in new eden and not favor any one group sure in low sec and null sec supercarriers and titans are effectivebut in high sec the orca is inadequate as it is an industrial command ship it is not meant to haul ships around and contracting involves having someone else accepting and then failing a contract only to trade the item to you a ship that could be utilized to actually haul these around rigged is ideali am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

in one of the posts in the thread somewhere i suggested something along the lines of a singularity projector when activated it would pull in some are all of the incoming shot be it hybrid weapons fire laser fire projectiles or missilesif targeting the aggressor were required and you activate a module on the aggressor how would you prevent an alpha from a blobin the tactics post i mention a change to fleet battles where these aegis destroyers are an initial shell that must be cracked before the main fleet may be effectively engaged taking phalanx ciws as an analogue the system automatically targets the incoming fire thats why i proposed that it be a module or it could certainly be a weapons system that you activate on a friendly while the module is active it would provide interception for all incoming fire of a certain type aimed at that friendly with effectiveness determined by position skill and equipment qualityi guess i should spell out what these modules are and how youd use them highslot modulescoherence disruptor prevents or shifts laser fire on a friendly target skills laser decoherence closein weapon upgradesprojectile shunt alters the course of a projectile fired at a friendly to turn it into a glancing blow or a miss skills projectile deflection closein weapon upgradesplasma decelerator cools a hybrid shot out of its plasma state while slowing it down reducing or eliminating the damage done to a friendly targetskills hybrid degeneration closein weapon upgradesphalanx cannonsfires micrometeorite fragments in the path of incoming missiles deflecting or prematurely detonating them as they home in on a friendlyskills phalanx coordination closein weapon upgradesmidslot modulesclosein weapons linkincreases the effectiveness of ciws defense on a given friendly by linking sensors with the friendlys threat computer skill closein weapon upgrades sensor linkingcombat tractor beamactively pulls a live target interceptoronly or possible new role for t1 frigate same range as a webifierskill propulsion jammingim a little ambivalent over whether these modules should actually use charges are not it could be awesome to see them firing their hearts out at incoming fire and exhausting their stores of ammunition requiring a reload the trick would be that you activate the module without it having to consume ammo until there is actual incoming fire id prefer that a destroyer be able to hold enough ammo to engage for at least 10 minutes before exhausting said ammo i thought it might just be easier to imagine these modules creating tiny subspace distortions or something like that and only using capthoughts
well of course it wouldnt actually utilize ammunition until there were incoming fire thus not blowing its wad prematurely so to speak furthermore id say that it would be a subammunition type such as the defender missile but would only take up a very small volume in the cargohold the weapon systems themselves able to hold a significant amount of said ammunition and having an obscene rate of fire such as the phalanx ciwscram system that would also be good for the market as it would create new bpos to be seeded throughout the market not just for the modules but the ammunition and would make for a nice mineralisk sink so in essence everyone winsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
there is not much of a point to these kinds of systems in a game like eve the reason for it being that if it were to be useful at all then it would have to have a considerable effect but being able to reduce greatly or negate the damage of 150 maelstrums firing in unison would break game logic nothing would die as both sides would field so many protection ships that nothing would ever get hit defender missiles already exist and youre forgetting one crucial thing how the game mechanics currently work everything except for missiles and drones deal instant damage and do not actually have a physical form or shape in the game from a design standpoint all you see are the effects there is never an actual round generated in space to be countered as doing this would create horrible amounts of lag and doing calculations to counter these items would only help increase the loadthis would also be devistating on the market as whilst new bpos give the manufacturings more things to produce the reduced damage taken and by default ships destroyed there would be fewer ships to replace and fewer people would need to buy ships the entierty of the eve market is dependant on a single thing occuring things being blown up adding more ways to prevent that from happening is shooting the market in the foot that and guess what effect this would have on caps 3
if you take a look at the post on tactics and countering toward the top of this page youll note that the intention was to make it so that it would be fruitless to go after the main targets first youd now have to break the defense yet these destroyers would be highly vulnerable to frigates sniping destroyers and drones in essence there should be a sharp increase in the number of ships and modules destroyedthe point is to change the combat mechanics to require some preliminary tactics before a battle reduces to a focusfire exercise it also means throwing lots of small lowskill ships into the fray making an even larger role for newer players for both attack and defense at the same time youd get gankbyalpha protection in hisec through cooperative play not resorting to solo hulk buffs for example and within concord rules
just fyi there are 3 people on the security team ccp sreegs stillman and someone else who i cant remember thats itthe company has around 500 total people working on everything eve dust and wod as well as community teams gms executives who come up with stupid ideas to try and make sure their jobs are safe etcand the rest of your post sounds like you are trying to justify botting you wouldnt be trying to justify botting would you
sorry zim shes right you are trolling and the real issue is that for some playstyles the mantra dont fly what you cant afford to lose translates to other players can prevent you from playing for weeks at a time they quit eve insteadthat is abysmal design and it has implicitly been recognised as well go see the dev blog on ship skill design and note the training times for exhumers to make good isk as a miner you need an exhumer and to train that you need to wait 2 months 47 days at that point you get your first exhumer which typically the player will not be able to afford to replace because the ships all come into range in a relativey short space the new players go for the most expensive ship they can get because they need the ore income stream especially if they hope to pay past 3 months with plexyou gank such players in their first exhumer typically covetor  hulk the chances are excellent that they will not renew thier sub at month 3 which we know is critical to new player retention so yes hulkageddon really can directly cost ccp revenue if ccp were brave they would plot exhumer training loss and player retention data and present it to the community i know annecdotally of people who have got their very first exhumer spending everything they have and lost it within hours of getting it and who stopped playing because of thatit is all well and good for the hardcore to say you need to learn to only fly what you can afford to lose but that is overlooking the issue that ccp have not which is that there simply is nothing else worth flying for this playstyle mining frigates being scrapped in the latest patch is a stark admission of that and it is expected meaningful subexhumer ships will be added soonif someone tries eve spends 2 months to get a ship takes it out and loses it to a bored suicide ganker nearly instantly then guess what they typically wont be able to replace the ship given the insurance issues and there being no suitable smaller ship option they will simply quit the game because all thier work proved the folly of eves advertising saying new players have a chance against veterans they dont no matter how well you tank a hulk or even orca or who you fly with veterans can and do suicide kill them in highsec unless the vets are stupid they will never fail to kill it and always wins is as flawed in game design terms as can never die the first is ingame currently the latter is the natural counter new player protection act with suitable balancesand if you keep saying you need to learn to fly something you can afford to lose  do the math and logic how much money per hour can you make with a 40 million isk battlecruiser or a 300 million isk battleship its more than a solo covetor or hulk with t1 strip miners that has to can mine which is where most newer players are at in month 2 of a mining career and if you lose your shiny combat ship unless you bizarrely sold off all your old ships you will have a hangar full of cruisers frigates and other ships to earn up a replacement if a 2 month old player loses their first exhumer guess what new players learnccp design effort is focused on veteran vocal combat players and the only thing you can fly that is worth flying you will not be able to afford to lose until you are a veteran so sorry your experience of eve has been 2 months of waiting to be able to really play then bored vets robbing you of your gameplay and that youre quitting we would love to fix the design flaws by making a credible subexhumer mining ship but to be honest weve been too busy making missle launcher graphics to make combat even prettier to appease the vocal combat players youre the quiet social players who pay for this game but we forgot about you oops hugs and kisses please please please tell a friend how wonderful eve is and get them to play too even though you think its  because you can spend months to get nowhere because you foolishly believed mining and industry was viable for new players like we told you in the tutorial when we set you up for getting obliterated with bad ship balance insurance that isnt enough to get you into a credible smaller version of the ship you lost to keep playing and nolose pvp kills for all but the most stupid vet teams i really am pleased that ccp has admitted they have a problem with mining ship design but thats not going to stop them bleeding subscriptions over this they need to step up thier game fast the quickest temporary fix ould be to make hulk basic insurance x higher payout so that a player losing a hulk can afford to buy and fit a covetor to keep mining but better balance between everincreasing cheap firepower for gankers and static wafer thin exhumers is silly maybe hotfix hulk and co ships hulls up 10000 points or more to make them something that actually requires some effort and thought to gank all you need atm is three destroyers and to not screw upbottom line stop pretending there is no problem here there is because the ship progression is screwed up and the playtyle is badly neglected the mining cruiser has a hold of 420 m3  which can hold nothing isk worth of ore where is the gas mining ship again get real if they wanted a real mining cruiser it would have an ore hold of 2000 m3 be able to fit 1 strip miner and add refine ore poorly subcap ships that are not exhumers converted battleship mining ship
you offering up goonswarm to help mentor new players oh wait they already do that they teach them how to greif other new players out of eve and how to pay for subs with plex rather than pay ccp actual us sorry its not happening miner playstyle players are the most inherently social because you sit in an asteroid beltfield for hours shifting ore from hold a to can b to hold c so they talk a lot while doing it the new interface sucks for that by the way well done ccp  you need an option to make a can a separate window still anyway those are the people who are most chatty in help and who are going to be happy to mentor the ones pvping and scanning the latest new player iteron at the highsec suicide gate camp do not have time to mentor or chat in help they have only seconds to decide if they are going to obliterate yet another new player for no reason other than they have an item that might be worth something but probably isnt any excuse to gank is a good excuse right so what if the newbie quits over it  thats what you all say go play wow oh wait  12 million people are playing that one and eve is on a hardcore recruitment drive because  it has failed to keep its new player base and achieve growth targetswake up step up and post suggestions eve already has invulnerability added in with the new player systems rules the new players start with huge skill pools compared to the old days and loads fo freebies from the tutorials guess what kiddies you can see the writing on the wall if we dont give eve good ideas about how to increase new player retention by addressing issues such as hulkageddon greifers driving new players away then eves devs are going to keep on coding in changes that carebear up the game i would not be at all surpirsed to see invulnerability from pvp added for new players or noganking rules added to 09 and 10 systems if we dont give eves devs qualtiy options for subtle systems they will be left with the unsubtle ones and guess what keeping 10 new players is worth more real money than losing 1 veterans ganker alt it a numbers game and if ccp wants eve to keep growing the new players will always have more

the gas mining ship feroxgas clouds do damage a lot of damage and you need to tank that damage espcially if youre running five t2 gas harvesters and your three buddies are doing the same sorry what was that you want an exhumer with strip gas harvesters and a rock hard tank to supply the market with cheap gas guess what there is no need for itgas is used in two things as far as i know t3 production and boosters t3 can only be properly done in wormhole wormholes get ladar sites so they can often stay self sustained drugs are illegal in highsec and can only be reliably made in null guess where the largest usage of boosters are null guess where the good gas clouds are null guess where you have to be for it to be a decent sort of income null new players have a chance against veterans but that is in a certain context no veteran has a chance in a hulk against 5 sucide gank destroyers nor does a new toon a new player on the other hand can fly a rifter with a point and microwarpdrive and keep that 80 million skillpoint maelstrom pilot locked down whilst the rest of the fleet blows his ship upalso giving a larger insurence payout would only make the economic situation worse its an isk faucet after all
no it doesnt people just think it does for reasons i cant really fathom want to mine during hulkageddon use a battleship or downgrade to a t1 barge or go somewhere really out of the way and watch local carefully or mine aligned and just warp out when the gankers come in or go do some missions for a while and mine the rocks that spawn in thosethe real issue is that people dont know how to avoid dangers and choose not to even try
no shes not right you may think that eve should be some cuddly huggy place its not its supposed to be a place which is safer than lowsec or nullsec but its not supposed to be safe just look for what ccp themselves have said look at their reaction to burn jita and tell me eve and hisec is supposed to be a huggy cuddly carebear place where everyone just loves eachother
official ccp responseccp response to crybears
simply set a standard time of max acceleration to some number 515 seconds and this number be from the slowest to the fastest if im not mistaken then thats what the entire issue is about10 seconds for a ship to reach 3 aus10 seconds for an interceptor to reach 135 ausetc
wow never thought about the implementation this would be a very radical change in system and even sector mobility i am actually curious about this now nice idea
gas cloud harvesting is supposed to be done by combat ships due to the hostile nature of the gas clouds themselves and their general location
fun fact gas clouds can be found in all secs even hs though extremely rare as can normal roids if barges can mine roids which are everywhere why cant they mine gas which is everywhere
it depends on if youre looking for gas sites or not if your not looking for them they seem to show up about every third system and i think that the reason that theres no strip gas miner is as already mentioned it would provide crazy iskh on certain gasses and let you be in and out of the site much quicker
it wouldnt hurt to have a dedicated gas mining ship at leastdrawbacks and what notbut i get the idea at least stop the evemail spam
id support dropping the turret slot requirement for gas miners theyre already limited to max 5 miners by skillalso making the procurer worth something isnt a bad idea
thank you although i presume ive made it too wordy since something controversial as mining have not sparked a discussion as usualive edited my first post to guide people to the second part for tldr section
ccp is already looking into making something similar to this but with the rock belts around planets look up some of the fanfest 2012 videos on youtube it looks promising
if i am not mistaken the planetary rings will be about moon goo and not exactly miningbesides i do think that now might be the last chance for discussions like these since if ccp is in initial phases of the development cycle all these things can be accommodated but if ccp is already well into the cycle then this topic might be useful for csm since they can compare threads like mine to the ccp design and perhaps achieve best solutionmoreover i do not think rock belts and ring mining will be realistic in term of harvesting large amounts of solid stuff space stuff is very spread out and most of the time there is simply nothing around you in stellar asteroid belts there is a decent amount of asteroids that would be big enough to be minedin planetary belts it is usually space dust or moons mostly because medium asteroids usually never survive accretion process to be plentiful around a planet ones that are around are usually captured flybys or shrapnel from large impacts either way rare even by space standardsyet ring mining would be more accommodating for gas harvesting or more realistically dust harvesting but to make it churn out minerals like hulks do atm one would need immense dust traps to capture sufficient amount of itthat is why i think stellar asteroid belts  bulk harvesting of large basic minerals that provide ship mass current mineralswhile ring harvesting  specialized low yieldhigh price dust that is used scarcely in building moon goo for example
you act like that is a new thing the whole thing is a crock as only the major power blocs are ever represented and those candidates who seek to represent the high or low sec crowds typically gets roflstomped in votes and then all 10058 of those get wasted when the public face of those meant to represent the players turns out to be a drunken prick who doesnt even play and promotes not only violation of eula but the various laws in place against cyberbullyingwith that i say abolish the csm and come up with a better representative system that doesnt include a free vacation to iceland and actually promotes more of an actual player driven system than a politically driven system that can be tainted by hundreds of alt accounts set in place in time so that they can vote only to vanish again after electionsmy vote is zero confidence in the csm i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
id agree with that for about 95 of itgive or takeand no its not newits just worse than it was beforei didnt even vote because no one was fit to be voted for in the first place not that it matters a damnabolishment of the csm accomplishes nothing because it can still be made to be a good thinglike i saidcsm needs to be more public here at the forumsto participate actively its not perfectbut its a good start stop the evemail spam
i am on a very slippery slope it all started when i found myself agreeing with mxzf on bad threads then i found myself agreeing with a goonand now most recently  with drake draconis i do not agree with the way they convey themselves but the core message is often the right one what exactly does csm do if it isnt moderate the forum talking to players and collecting ideas to present to ccp where were the csm responses in the ui threadsother then hans talking about fw of which i am not qualified to speak on i havent seen a csm tag on anything that is currently important  shoot or on things that arent there is a conspicuous absence of csm responses and yet i still get spam mail from them about voting i hear more from my city councilman then from the csm
i personally voted for roc wieler because i liked the majority of his ideas as well as the ideals that he representedheres the thing the only member of the csm i have heard  from or about is trebor daehdoow and that was in response to an eve mail i sent the entire csm he took the time to reply for which i can give him credit unlike the rest of the councili actually did hear from other members of the former csm but that was only around election time when they were scratching for votes i will always support the people with the ideas and ideals which align most with the things that will be in the best interests of new eden eve online and the players but honestly with the current csm i am less than ing thrilled because they havent said a damned thing to anyone about what the hell is going on or if anything is even being done and that is just wrongthey are supposed to be the voice of the players not those who say their piece do things to benefit their alliances and pass it off as for the good of all i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
in fairness the csm has little ability to influence which way things are going until you are in the room in person you can make all the pretty arguments on forums you want but nothing actually ended up happening until we were able to face to face say that somebodys idea was dumb also just cause they arent posting doesnt mean they arent reading and making up their own minds based on your input if you want a personalized response i recommend you mail a csm member directly its much much more effective
pretty much thisand trebor daehdoow is a ing jokehes a political shovinast sp who will stop at nothing to get an extra votehe only shows up and says a few things when it makes him look good in the spotlighti have seen little to nothing in the way of results as far as csm is concernedin any rate i dont expect csm to ever produce results in a direct sensewhat i do expect is for them to do their ing job in representing the community as a whole and actually show up and participate on a level that makes it seem like they are at least tryingnone of this eve mail bullcrapno private convos behind closed doorsactual public participation in assembly hall and feedback threads so the general population knows they existknows they can be approached and talked tothe only time i ever see them show up in frequency is voting timeand that frankly is an insult and makes me wonder how the hell they get anywhere in the first placeabolish csm nolight a fire under their asses and get them to do their ing job and make an effort at ithell yes stop the evemail spam

advocating my support of removing the new inventory system and restoring the working version insert veiled threatswishes of bodily harm upon those that created the unified inventory here
awesome this topic is not about removing the new inventory rather how it can be improvedccp will not be removing it so you can get that idea out of your head or unsub about itdual pane idea click
umm removing it is the best way to improve it much like a bullet in your gut its only going to give you an infection and poison you if you leave it in
fyi opinion does not equate to factsupport your point eith cold hard facts or just stopt2s payout covers the t1 hull that is necessary to build a t2 not the research the technical upgrades or the additional materials sure it sucks but it keeps the market goingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
as jack said your opinion isnt a factthe fact is that ccp has made it the way they currently intend it so by definition it is not broken
ive not seen anything convincing me otherwisethe fact is that ccp has made it the way they currantly intend it can you prove that
from evelopedia
so the t2 component the t1 hull is not being calculated into the t2 insurance someone tell me where this ship multiplier they speak of can be found
notice the value assigned index typically the more valuable the ship the lower the index and that the insurance is only meant to cover the percentage of coverage multiplied by said index so with that naturally more valuable ships will have lesser payouts way to link something that further damns your cause because you are trying to apply it out of context so that it applies to youi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i still dont see how it can be so usefull at the rates it gives by denying its not broken your aware that their is no point to ever really insure anything outside of t1and that capitolships as they are are getting the proper amounts even tho their process of production is the same as t2 t3  faction
christ youre still going on about that nont1 ships are supposed to have bad insurance rates ie youre not really supposed to insure them thats what keeps t1 ships viablecapitols should get insurance rates similar to t2 t3 and faction ships imo
ok so im sorry its taken me so long to get back to thisnow ccp has given every thing a base price isogen 128megacyte 8192mexallon 32morphite 32768noxcium 512pyerite 8tritanium 2zydrine 2048etc and as you can see these are not the market prices a long long time ago there were npc buy orders for minerals and a great many other things to stabilize the market some prices couldnt fall too far they were removed due to being an isk faucet ccp wanteed the minerals mined by players to actually do somethign in the game instead of disappearing into the void of npc land also with minerals disappearing into npc stations there was little reason to move vast quantities of the stuff and thus less travel by freighter or industrial and less risky behavior modules were also priced this way meta 14 and even 15 are priced out again though priced out in minearal value not any other factor but the prices were good for something they helped people namely ccp programers decide how much was to be dropped in wrecks and what the average prices of the market ought to look like when it strayed too far they were supposed to take new looks at the drop tables although i believe that the price was only gently used for the meta 04 drop tables of this i have no confirmation but looking at insurance payouts this makes a lot of sense t1 for a long time had standard payouts regardless of market prices and so insurance fraud was viable when the mienral prices got below the listed ccp price it became profitable to self distruct take a look at the t2 material prices the goo prices and the composites you will see a vastly under stated price for what it is in comparison to in game ie base price of crystalline carbonide is 10 isk were i to only find that kind of deal in game calculated out for a t2 ship the composite prices for a me0 manufacture run should total something just above the t2 insurance payout at platinum adding in of course the platinum insurance payout of a t1 hull
capitol construction is not the same as t2 or t3 they do not require moon goosalvage to be built because their insurance rates are dictated by market forces on the minerals they give proper insurance payouts the only t2 capitol the jf does not give proper cost  insurance pay outs it gives proper t2 insurance payouts which are a far cry from the market price of those materialsedit oh yes and about faction they too are calculated by mineral values nothing else if you look at the bpcs which are also seeded in the lp stores you can see what they need to be built and see about what the insurance is going to be difficulty in obtaining an object is a hard thing to quantify into an insurance payout in this game so ccp made that value 0 for their calculations
hmm i see kusum thanks for actually breaking things down but it is still brokeninsurance system should be removed in general and just make the default payouts platinum
why insurance is a choice that one is supposed to make they do not force you to buy it but often people do and if you cannot afford the full you can buy a lesser plan that will net you more then without i often go without insurance on my ships on occasion i have found my wallet empty more often i forget what does the removal of this insurance choice do for the game
it removes a isk sink for one
why is this good
why wouldnt it be
because isk sinks help control the amount of isk in teh eve economy with the faucets like missions and most notably incursions there needs to be some way to control that flow the rate of inflation there are many small isk sinks and a few big ones skill books are a sink clone costs are a sink market fees are a sink ways to remove isk from ingame circulation cspa charges are a sink ship purchases are not in fact moon mining to a degree has both sinks involved and spigots though technium is a faucet for the alliance holding it its not an isk generator int eh same way that say missions are thats a different lecture though however insurance is not a sink its actually a faucet when your ship explodes you are given isk by pend insurance company which is npc run that isk is not taken from players and the isk you paid for aht ship is nto taken back from the person who sold you that ship while you have lost an asset you have gained isk that was not currently in circulation before hand it is the same as if you had sold your ship and some of the fittings to a npc buyer not buying insurance means taht you are reducing the amount of isk introduced into the game mandating platinum insurance means you are always opening a larger faucet i support more choices in game if you forget or it is your particular mantra to do it a particular way that is fine but why force everyone else to also play that way it also trains people to keep up to date with what is going on in their game not always a bad thing not always good its still a choice
alright i submit kusum thanks at least your made an effort to making sense of things instead of trolling on
simple economics mate too much money in an economy creates inflation or in the case of how incursionbears were blitzing vanguard sites hyperinflation which is bad for everyone isk sinks are good as they provide stability and balance to the economy anyone who would disagree with this is foolish furthermore a ship being destroyed is simply an opportunity for an industrialist to put their skills to work and keep themselves gainfully employed if you make the decision not to insure your ship thats your problem if you make the decision to insure a t2 t3 or faction ship also your problembecause if you think about it in the following termstech 2 ships produced from t1 hulls research and advanced technology implemented in themtech 3 ships  produced from technology gleaned from sleepers research and advanced technology implemented in themnaval faction ships produced by naval factions to be acquired through loyalty points gained by working for said faction not really meant for the general populous consumptionpirate faction ships produced by pirate factions to be acquired through loyalty points gained by working for said faction not really meant for the general populous consumptionall of those above listed ships are not meant to be easily acquired or built and they for the most part are still built from basic materials which have set values and for t2 and t3 especially you cant put a price on research or development going into the production of said equipment only tangible goods modern day insurance companies will only insure tangible physical goods not research conceptual goods or intellectual propertiestherefore as everyone has been trying to tell youinsurance is clearly working as intended implemented and designed by ccp which is the final decision in anything that occurs within the eve universei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
so you belive it to be broken simply because you think that it should be higher then heres another thought for you lets just remove all the bpos from the game and eliminate production that way people only rat and do plexes for isk that they buy from ccp and eve thus creating a large isk faucet because the ships will have a set price insurences can then be applied in a proper manner sounds like a great ideasorry about this meaning that you can no longer produce thoughalso a game mechanic of eve is that every loss is supposed to be meaningful which is one of the reasons it actually is this screwed up and the payouts for t2 ships is horribleso yes it may be broken but if it were way too broken then ccp would have already fixed it they either dont think its a problem as it premotes emotion and investment in the game or they simply have other more important things to doif it were truely broken then theyd already know about it quite a few of the ccp staff do play this game after all in their spare time

isk sinks are methods of which isk is removed from the game by purchase of goods from npcs and payment of taxes to npcsyou can only have one jump bridge in any system at any given time periodto keep a jump bridge in one of the two systems working you pay 300 million a month want to disrupt their jump bridges camp their bridges and wait for their fueling ships to come then blow them up longer distances with less protection will result in increased costs for all things produced in low and null sec simply because they want to be compensated for any loses they might suffer or for the protection money they need to pay to get an escort these dynamic fights you speak of will become more frequent perhaps but you will mostly have fights of the following nature 1 vs 10 gatecamps1 vs 20 gatecampsetchow is this making better and more dynamic pvp if anything youll start seeing more blobs
hell yes i want more ganks on gates and less reasons to live in 00
i fully agree the fleet advert is still illogical
in the name of change for the sake of change i propose the following lock changes to the gameto lock enemy ships you must use the standard cntrlclick to lock radial menu locking being no longer an option the only exception being minmatar haulers which must be locked with click keys if you lock someone new an chance exists for you to lose lock on your previous targetthe overview will be can be sorted by avatar hair color standing to guristas pirates number of times the pilot has said u mad in the last 10 minutes but not by anything combat pilots would consider remotely usefulyour overview settings will not save from one session change to another maximum lock range shall be 80k and you shall like itthese changes should probably go into effect on sisi quite soon and then the rabbling they received being soundly ignored shortly thereafter onto tranquility
something like this needs to happen currently things are way too predictable sleeper ai is a good start more scrams also officers that let you warp out wtf is this stupidity i would also like to see some variation so they arent so easy to tank for example coming across angel rats raiding sansha space

do you all know why the current bounty system in eve doesnt work and is a joke it is actually quite simple there are no real consequences or penalty for being one a pirate or having a bounty even if you do run up a 10 security rating you can hang in null sec and never worry about it even if some idiot post a 1bil bounty on you it can easily be exploited  just have a friend pop you in game and split the rewardno you want this system to work youll have to add a real threat of consequences and a real threat of penalty for choosing the life of an outlawthat means when you are killedby anyone to collect the reward  even if it is a friend or your own alt you are captured by concorde for the next 10 days you cannot do anything  nothing  you cannot log the toon in and you cannot train that toon it is in stasis your character is in stasisprison awaiting trial after 10 days your character goes to trial depending on how low your security rating is and the crimes you have committed to get that rating will determine how much it will cost to set you free from prison if you cannot pay immediately you must stay in prison another day each day you spend in prison it cost you a  of the total amount due  raising your fee to get free higher and higher cost to be set free from prison depends on your security rating at the time and crimes committed this can all be worked out by people involved in actually setting up this system  but it cannot be something that doesnt sting it should sting so unless your pirate buddies are willing to put forth the isk to set you free or you yourself are willing to spend isk to set you free youll sit in jail and incur more expenses costing you more isk to be set free after 30 days of being in jail if you cannot pay you are automatically set free however you are released with no isk and lose all items you once had in your possession no matter where they were you start at 0 security rating and a starter shipif you continue to wish to be a pirate and incur the penalty of someone placing a bounty on you again each time you are caught the consequences get steeper and steeper the game keeps track of each time you are placed in stasis first time in prison it is ten days next is 12 next time is 14 next time is 16 eventually youll be spending more time in prison than playingand that is how you make a real bounty system in game work this mamby pamby no consequences for ones actions is why the current system and the one proposed will never work it can be too easily manipulated and exploited this way even having a friend pop you will cost you dearly in fact youd want to avoid getting popped at all if you can help it then the only people who will truly be wanting to pop you are real bounty hunter type players they will go out of their way to pop you theyll want to collect the reward and watch your tears flow as your character becomes a prisoner of concorde in fact theyll want to pop you whenever there is a bounty placed on you  almost strictly for the tearsthen the real pirates and their pirate gangs will become notorious outlaws that should be feared if they can escape being popped those are truly the pirates to fear with out real consequences and penalties  the bounty system in this game will always be a joke add consequences and real penalties and the bounty system will be something to fear  as it should be
your proposal is harsh enough to satisfy my wish to see all griefers rot in hell but precisely because it would drive griefers out of the game nobody is going to buy it ever having proposed it myself i obviously think that the proposal that the bounty is only a fraction of the actual cost of whatever has been destoyed would sting enough to prevent abuse nobody is gonna blow 1 billion isk to be paid back 500 million or 400 or 300 unless those billion isk are somebody elses billion iskwhere my sistem becomes tough is in the target being actively tracked by every npc sesion changing structure and the local chat leaving breadcrumbs that anyone skilled enough can track until give the target an unpleasant surprise upon undockinglogging in to a safespot
the gist of your post is something that i utterly and irrevocably oppose it completely contradicts the entire point of having a working bounty system which is player consequences for player acts and would in fact gut the whole system if you want to argue that ccp should take sides in player disputes and punish people you dont like for being mean to you then make your own terrible proposal thread and confine your terrible ideas to that thread instead of trying to contaminate mine with them
in fact im going to pay the wardec fee for goons to dec you just for making that postthats how bad it is
okay first this goes against game law you cant detain a capsuleer they will just kill themselves and wake up in a new clone where ever they want secondly bounties are put on capsuleers by other capsuleers and have nothing to do with concord thirdly this would be very very prone to exploiting a new player fresh out of the tutorials could put a 1 isk bounty on every member of goonsawm and the next time any of them died they would end up not being able to do anything whilst they awaited trial you could cripple an entire alliance practically for free fourthly its only broken because the method of payout and ability to choose who takes the bounty is broken no other reasons fithly nothing in a game should ever have consequences that harsh because it might as well not be a game after that point nothing in eve is that harsh nothing and eve is the harshest game i can think of off the top of my headi could keep going there are seemingly infinite problems with your suggestion in future dont bother posting unless you understand what your implicating if you really do understand what your implicating then you want ccp to lose all its customers andjust be a generally terrible game in which case you should find another gamein the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
lets stop crapping up the thread with further discussion of the worst idea in eve history no overstatement and get back to the awesome ideas of giving bounty hunters a reason to existedit in fact i think weve mostly discussed the idea out  so perhaps the op could be edited down to the summary of the concepts  broken down to the two parts weve compartmentalised it into  1st step  bounties   of loss 2nd step  detailed bounty contracts   for easy reading  followed by the existing detailed description of the reasons behind it
yes lets totally ignore that no bounty system you come up with that is ran completely by players can be circumvented easily  and when i mean easily  your system is no better than ccps current system because it doesnt stop anyone with a bounty on their head from being taken out by a friend in game also this was merely a proposal a proposal to actually add a layer by which players could not circumvent i didnt work out the fine details and make a mega post about how all it would work and how much it might cost a player in the end if they pursued being a pirate btw who said it would cost a billion isk to get of or staisis oh and about a noob placing a 1isk bounty on a goon rules  the bounty system would have you knowrules about how it would work a good bounty system would have rules so that people couldnt use it as a means of griefing it would actually require a player to break one of games tenants in game before someone can just slap a bounty on you willy nilly and also require a certain level of security rating rules regarding the bounty system would need written upalso you people are always saying how hardcore and harsh this game is but when someone actually submits an ideal that has a harsh undertone to it you toss it aside and scream  thats too mean for a bounty system to work  there has to be consequences and penalties  otherwise youre just pissing in the wind malcanis i am sorry you think someone discussing the bounty system in a thread about the bounty system is a bad thingeven if you created it  when you posted in this forum  it opens it up to all for discussion i was pointing out and you said it yourself that even your system can be exploited so that people can circumvent anyone other than someone close to you collecting the bounty and splitting it i think it is silly to sit and type up a huge thing about reworking the bounty system then sayoh yeah there is still loopholes that you can fly a titan throughbut hey at least we have a new system  even if it is no better than the previous one come up with a serious bounty system and stop coddling players
nothing can totally stop that you can only make it as difficult and uneconomic as possible which is what the large majority of the propsal is concerned withas it stands with my proposal you have to somehow get an alt into the specific corp which gets the bounty contract or be an individual who can socially engineer the aggrieved party to somehow assign the bounty contract to your bounty hunter alt as i said back around page 2 if youre smart and lucky enough to pull this off then you probably deserve to be able to remove the bounty at 50 of the cost to yourself mark that  even in the best or from your point of view worst case the perp will at best be able to lose no more 50 of the isk and bounty hunting corps will have a very strong incentive to root out alts insinuated into their ranks for this purpose since their reputation will be their primary asset
btw id be interested to see you post 2 of these loopholes you can fly a titan through there must be at least 2 if you can speak of them in the pluraldetail them for us please
i think i know what kind of system you are describing now you want an in game system of bounty contracts you wish to be able to write up a bounty contract between yourself and a player or a corp to take someone out in essence you just want to be able to pay someone of your choice to make a hit someone  you being able to transfer kill rights to that induvidual and or corp youre rightthere is not much wiggle room with your systemits just a matter of putting the mechanics in place to trasnfer kill rights to a particular player or corp of players this is the basis for your system  rightsorry i was thinking of a built in game system that allowed anyone to pop a wanted person my bad a friend had to set me straight  she smacked me upside the head my badhad this big  tree in front of my face
in that case i retract my offer of a free wardec
plus  the idea of making it so anyone can pop them is not a bad idea as an ingame alternativeif you put a 1b bounty on your target and they destroy 1b of their own stuff and get a 500m bounty  insurance back  they still lost 500m isk that is not a cheap option the fact that they blew it up with an alt is funny and will look bad on a killboardfact is simply adjusting the payment ratio would change the likelyhood this would happen regularlyif the ratio was 75  95 of the real loss value then yes  this might be a good idea but if its at 50 of the real loss value then it becomes quite harsh lower still 33 would be stupid to selfdestruct away  but would still be a valuable boon to a genuine enemythis is why i think that both options should be available if you want to hurt someone and dont care too much how it happens then an open bounty is just greatperhaps the payout ratio could be adjustable so that players themselves could police it  but then it gets complicated and the chance that ccp doesnt bother or screws it up increase
i would like to mention how happy i am now that corpses retain again the name of the soul formerly dwelling insidenot only that the nameless corpses have regained their original identitieshooray for stored labelled and now identified virtual corpses
be that as it may dawn i am pretty sure that those working on all of these projects where relevant keep in mind security and making it more difficult to use macrosbots if possible so long as it doesnt mean compromising the game itself to where it is no longer enjoyable to play ie captchas every 30 minutes in game or else you get logged out etcthis is the same as any other business ensuring that its employees understand the importance of customers not being allowed to simply walk off with product and not pay for it  like people who bot unless they practice business entirely different then they do in most places modern places in the world then it would make complete sense for one to assume that memorandums are sent out as reminders and as new information is collectively gathered as well as meetings etc etcyou would be very narrowminded to think that an international company wouldnt be concerned about this to some extent and do the same things small family run businesses do right on up to top businesses are you saying something about ccp in that merely 3 people are the only force that even thinks or tries to help security in eve online in relation to bottingmacros someone had to put those 3 people you mentioned in their position did they not which leads me to believe there is at least a 4th person who does something to try to ensure that bots and macros are not used in the game you would be a fool to think that if upper or middle management was so concerned about this that only 3 people in the entire company worry about this or try to help in this matter actively as part of their normal daytoday job  just because 3 individuals are specifically given a specific positions to solely work on this or have it listed that this is part of their duties among other things is in a way to show us the consumer that something is being done about it instead of saying nothing or did they mess up and it would have been better if they never said they had anyone appointed in any capacity to address thisand last time i checked they had 600  employees and that was years ago now they have dust wod and eve on top of those two little pet projects that simply dwarfs them entirely plus all of the related  that goes without saying and keeps most of this spinning  the gms it techs customer support etcif i wanted to justify botting i would do so what i was saying in the post clearly is that you cannot stop it you will only delay it period let me make it simple for you  ccp cant even manage to release an expansion that works how it should let alone fix bugs and improve small things most other games dont let get released because they actually fix the  or make sure it is done correctly the first time with the end result being what they want put out on the market and you think that they can handle botting or macro users well i dont and i spoke my mind whilst considering the aforementioned and many other thingsin fact it completely eludes me why they dont stop putting new stuff into the game and start fixing everything that is wrong with the game broke etc stop adding new  start fixing  that has been around for yearsthink of it this way  if you stack  on top of  what do you have a big pile of  stop stacking  ccp you cant tell me there are errors in the game that havent been fixed or are solely related to the newest expansion and not a previous one where the bug exploit or whatever is screwed up and was simply forgotten or wasnt more important than a new ship in the game with its own sets of problems it could potentially create considering every time you release something new its always frakked up and you have to release multiple patches to fix it because you dont test it or dont test it extensively enough period
they have an effect on them who says something else it lies
simplea ship that can destroy a 250mil ship should cost 250mil or damn close5mil v250mil is bullsht
you fail horribly at eveleave now and turn in your pod stop the evemail spam
i dont often agree qith drake often just on principle butthis time i feel he sums it up very wellit must always be possible to take down expensive ships in cheap ones because otherwise eve becomes fattest wallet wins and a mining vessel is not a combat vessel wow really i mean whodu thunk right so they must be easy to kill with combat vessels what you should be doing is guarding your vulnerable vessels it isnt hard
so by that measure i should only be able to kill a titan with another titan or a blackops ship should only be killable by another blackops or some other ship which for some reason is valued at roughly the same price valuethis is wrong on oh so many levels and you should be ashamed for suggesting this
your logic is a horrible indictment of the education systemby your logic the only way to keep the game balanced then is to prevent that 250mil ship from ever killing a 5mil ship under any circumstances all of combat will devolve into fleets of every hull in the game and 1v1 fights with no one coming out a winneryour logic is pointless and just plain idioticall of this crying about getting your ships blown up is simply aggravating as hell to those of us that took the time to learn how not to die youre typical of the occupy morons who demand society give them everything or dumb it down so they can function screw that improvise adapt and overcome or die thats life thats eve neither is fair and neither is going to be made easier to accommodate your laziness or stupidity
i dont want to start a trend and i dont want to say too much but there is a very viable way of stopping suicide gankers its not been there long use your head
its that commoncommonwhat was that againoh yeahcommon sense stop the evemail spam
here is a prime example of proportionality saying a ship that can destroy a 250m isk ship should cost close to 250m isk is tarded as in real life a 750 dollar rocket propelled grenade launcher can take down a multimillion dollar airplane or helicopterjust remember it is never too late to give me your stuff and biomassi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i dont get your argument anymore gizznittyoure claiming its easy to avoid the majority of gatecamps which we can assume at a minimum means bubbles fast locking tacklers and some dps but killing ratters is somehow easy and im assuming were still talking null here not wormholes this despite that the ratter will know the instant you enter their system by having local chat window visible and will instantly know youre not a friendly because you wont show up as a blue who are these pve people youre killing they must be either afk and not botting very careless and stupid or newbies ignorant of basic game mechanics its pretty obvious how what you are saying doesnt add up i dont doubt your eve knowledge i doubt the sincerity of your arguments i think youre just pulling anything you can in hope to justify your position which is largely to keep the status quo i mean really using stealth bombers and covops to get tackle until your gang arrives right you have a gang of ships likely not even covops backing you up thats not an indication of how tough covops ships are could have been an industrial ship and the helios comment really how is it covops if you dont even fit a cloak or are you killing people in a helios with one gunno in regards to pveers in null the end result should be that a reasonably competent player who is not afk should still have a reasonable degree of vulnerability to another solo pilot while they are engaging in pve not what youre effectively stating that a solo newbie or dumb person should be vulnerable to an entire gang and any other circumstances pveers are safetheres a lot of stuff you say which i agree with i just dont see any of it leading to the same conclusions on local and cloaking as you
somewhere there is a very big communication mishap let me explain imo with the current game mechanics 1 avoiding a gatecamp is fairly easy you just need a prepared scout to guide you along your path if there is a gate camp you simply avoid it getting through a gate camp is quite a bit harder as it requires the ability to kite off the camp speedy ships the ability to avoid being tackled covert ships or the ability to fight through the camp in a covert ship its mildly risky but typically not to hard in big ship its almost impossible to get through a gate camp 2 hunting ratters is not easy killing ratters is very easy most ratters have blatant weaknesses in their setup which can be exploited by any competent pvper i can point to many examples of pve ships solod be frigates the only difficulty in hunting ratters is tackling them 3 my helios and sb examples are there for two reasons a to brag about my combat helios and b to emphasize that these ships can easily perfrom a tackling role and are not extremely vulnerable just because the majority of time these ships are not fit for combat does not mean they are completely combat neutered if people fit them for cloaky tackling they are very effective with your changes 1 hunting ratters becomes extremely easy by making ratters easy to catch youre removing the only hard part about hunting a pve ship once caught theyre easily killed especially since your mechanic allows you to bring an entire cloaky gang ongrid with them before you decloak and aggress 1 if a pveer in nullsec is vulnerable to a solo covert ship the are even more vulnerable to a gang of those ships you might want to solo cloaky camp a system in a covert ship and kill targets of opportunity with maybe a little risk to yourself however most people will use your mechanics bring out entirely covert gangs and gank targets with virtually no risk to themselves 2 what is a reasonable degree of vulnerability in my mind a reasonable degree of vulnerability is that for every 40 scout pilots coming through system looking for targets i get snagged once with your setup for every 40 covert scout pilots that come through system i get caught 39 times or more in eve once you are tackled especially in a belt you rarely get free considering the rewards of ratting need to be balanced with the risks of ratting how can you possibly think your system is appropriate

csm has stated that there is no way that the games preinferno inventory system can be reintroduced because of the coding issuesi call bullshit on that onesurely ccp saved a preinferno complete build of the eve codeso my poll questionwould youa prefer ccp to retain the existing code and have ccp try to fix it on the flyb have ccp rollback to preinferno this may include a worst case scenario of all players having to wipe their eve folders clean and having to download a 5 gig set of files and do a complete rebuild of the game on your computers clearly this would mean the loss of all features of inferno including the ui
you are wasting your time and your not paying attentioncsm has nothing to do with itthey are a representive body of playersperiodno special accessno powersvery little influenceits ccp who said that they are not going backthey did not say they cant go backmaking an opinion poll is like starting a flameand i ought to report you for inciting such a thinggo simmer down or go yell in feedback thread where this belongswe dont need yet an another inventory whine thread wrong or right and yes i agree its messed up but for cryin out loudknock it off people stop the evemail spam
i see so as an analogy if the people hold a plebiscite the elected representatives just ignore the results because the government is too powerful and will just ignore the elected representatives if so in the world of eve if the players masses speak loudly about an idea in this case a complete rollback is it not the csms mandate to present the results to ccp
oh for fck sake give it a rest
ok if you want to go ahead and make 100 threads about the same damn problem then go right on aheaddont you think the csm would have already snapped their fingers and reversed everythingoh hell why not ccp at that ratesurely you could use your head eh stop the evemail spam
as a wh inhabitant i do a lot of scanning one of the things that continually frustrates my scanning is when im trying to click on a handle to drag a scan probe to a new location but instead the mouse grabs the perimeter of the probe radius and i end up resizing the scan range by mistakeccp should be able to fairly easily create some way for you to disable the ability to clickanddrag on the probe spheres to resize them and let you do it on the probes in space panel of your scanner onlyim not suggesting it be removed entirely because no doubt there are some out there who like to change the scan range of their probes by clicking and dragging on the bubble itself but for the majority of people i suspect who use the solar system map window to move the probes it would save us some frustrationheres an older thread with the same issue
absolutely yes been wanting this since i starting messing around with scanning just a toggle would be nice  allow clickdrag scan radius or something so irritating
well as someone who uses the map to both change size and move probes i wouldnt care for that at all i wouldnt object if theres a box you could tic to turn off resizing on the map but they shouldnt change the defaults just add an option see probing filters for one reason why changing defaults is bad
o new eden this is reddy with another idea i have in mindafter reading nearly every article in eves lore i came up with an idea that is kinda stupid but i like itthe plani want to make a separate server like singularity and in no way connected to tranquility that has a new game play element in it i came up with the idea that if aliens or terrans or some highly advanced civilization found our little corner of our universe and decided to burn us from it can we survive if every null low and high sec system comes under attack and every faction in new eden has to fight it do we stand a chanceissuesone is the concept of more servers as ccp said when they created eve that it will be single shard or 1 universe only if this comes out and everyone loves this invasion server and plays it what will happen to tranquilitypossible solution is to make it that you need a paying account in tranquility and be active in it for you to access this serverso if you have not played tranquility in like 20 days it will block you from the serverto wrap things up i know this is very stupid to attempt and will prob make eve not fun to play anymore so maybe ccp can just release a chronicle etc saying what will happenwell that does it if anyone has questions please comment and thank you for taking your time to read thisfly safe guysreddy
nostop bringing this bloody idea back from the deadits bad enough we had to shoot this one down to death  fail idea stop the evemail spam

because they got free tickets to island  ai give to you a wise advice forget draconis idiot he is just a sick troll
burn the csm with fire
uh wtf do you want us to say here the new inventory system has some really sucky parts and some pretty nice parts from what i have seen on the forums you guys are doing a pretty good job of bitching to ccp all on your own csm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
try reading againthis has nothing to do with the invetory systemas far as what i was getting atif anything you just proved my point stop the evemail spam
what is the pretty nice part of this inventory  the bugfest  the mess  the unusable and really hard handling part dont forget you guys  you are here not for the ccp alckng you are here for the protections of playersuse your jobthats why you are elected to csm
mostly we are not raging in public because it doesnt help those days are past now because ccp isnt dropping the ball on things the day after they put them in the game thats why soundwave pushed his update blog out  to prove that they arent going to just walk away from this as for the calls to revert back to the old system thats not going to happen it can only evolve forward from here if you think that the changes to the inventory system involve a couple of lines in the client then you have no idea of the complete and utter mess that is the 10 year old server code implemented by dozens of previous employees many of whom no longer work at ccpspeaking for myself im not disagreeing with anyone that the inventory system was released far too early and needs to work better the unified inventory has removed a boatload of previous inventory functionality and replaced it with a laggy click fest which is downright painful to use i almost stabbed my monitor last night trying to find a couple mods to refit a ship before a fightright now im not raging but i am annoyed as my gameplay has been unecessarily made much harder and for now i am biting my tongue and giving ccp the opportunity to demonstrate that they will get this crap fixed quickly just because the csm is not writing a ton of words about it constantly doesnt mean we dont understand what is going on or isnt going on we have spent quite a lot of time this past couple weeks talking to the specific devs doing the unified inventory stuff linking threads  posts and trying to help prioritize what needs fixing  iteration first several of the csm members have blogs  twitter accounts and have been on several podcasts and eve radio we have published the schedule for the first summit next week well in advance and have asked for feedback on the schedule in jita park as well here is the thread specifically about the ui team im pretty sure that the unified inventory changes will be front and center in that session and after hours as well feel free to continue bashing the csm were going to keep fighting for you anyway
good words seleenedo you think part of the reason the unified inventory system went live war against bots
yay a step in the right direction
seleene i think there would be less rage directed at the csm if the handful of you who were on the town hall had said a bit more than its fine in response to the suggestion that it was a ragestorm waiting to happenim glad to see theyre not dropping the ball on it postrelease but in my eyes  and those of many others  several members of the csm dropped their own ball when they gave that response to the issue in a public venueits pretty disheartening especially for those of us who voted for those csm members in particular 
thank you for the encouraging words seleenei think the point that the technically savvy amongst us are trying to make is that in a clientserver system such as eve there is a strong distinction between data whats in the hangar and presentation how its displayedwe are trying to make the point that regardless of the reasons of the underlying data changes the presentation should not have changed and it can indeed be reverted in isolationno its not a couple of lines but neither does it require rework on the server i am making the assumption here that ccp are using industry standard bestpractice here  something along the lines of the controllermodelview paradigmthe current presentation is a thin veneer over the underlying data structures  that much is obvious to anyone who writes these things for a living me included players do not need this  they need an immersive contextual and convenient interface the fact is that for most of us the old visual interface was far superior i think all we are asking for is that the new one is made to look and feel like the old one and we can start adding improvements from theredoes this make sense
i just love it when csm show up and do a song and dance only to completely miss the point stop the evemail spam
i fully appreciate that and in hindsight youre not wrong i can only really explain my own feelings on this which is that because were talking to ccp pretty much every day we see that they arent ignoring whats going on the people directly responsible for this mess are understandably pretty stressed out they should have paid more attention to the sisi feedback before release but at this point they cant wave a magic wand and change things no matter how easy some selfappointed expert thinks it is perhaps its due to being a bit jaded after nearly 10 years and almost expecting something to go wrong with ever major release that allows some of us to just shake our heads and hope for the best the difference today compared to last year though is that ccp isnt just dropping a broken feature on us and walking away  they are going to fix this and hopefully the finished final product will be something we all might come to appreciatehave no doubt though that the csm doesnt have special game clients which are somehow different than everyone elses  some of us are pretty mad too were just spending our time trying to be constructive with the devs and help them filter through all of the communities righteous ang ummm quality feedback
i understand exactly what you mean and its certainly something i want to get clarification on next week at the summit perhaps there is a middleground that can be achieved until the presentation side is better developed i honestly dont know until we do a bit of face to face but i will be relaying every nonnda bit of info i can get on this onto twitter as it happens and then blogging it later onofc it makes sense it should be intuitive and easy to grasp i can say with confidence that this particular point has been hammered home like a rusty nail in the skull to the people working on it striking the line between omfg where the  is that module this sucks and guys if you would do this and move that there i could find my module is a daily struggle
theres a great reason for this  its entirely inefficient to have every single one of us reply to every single mail we get we save time that we can be using to work with the developers by having a single person take the lead usually on each mail we could spend all our time raging on the forums posting every day and having every single csm member reply to every single individual mail but that would also mean wed accomplish very little actual work remember we see a lot of what ccp is working on for subsequent releases whether or not we can speak to them publicly and so naturally our level of rage at ccp will be lower than the publics because just like with the inventory we were aware of not only the communitys concerns we were aware that ccp was already working on a set of fixes for the common complaints i know how frustrating this can be for some players remember it was only a month ago i was on the other side of the looking glass but one of the realities of working on the csm is that communication we share with ccp happens over skype and in private forums out priority simply has to be taking the time to write extensive notes and suggestions in those channels where they will be most effectiveone last thing ive learned since taking office  players should know that developers dont respond well to raging jerks that call them names and accuse them of not doing anything that kind of behavior is a quick ticket to having your posts ignored that reaction is expected of every single change to the game so youll have to bring something more to the table if you want to make a difference they respond much better to calm constructive respectful criticism and frankly so will the csm
yep and anything you just said doesnt still justify the fact that this junk remains in tranq until it is fixed this might take weeks as the fundamental core of it is broken persistent windows will be pretty hard to implement to something what wasnt built to handle thosethis should have remained in sisi warning bells were hammered with cannons however now when it still got released and crap hit the fan least they could do is to take it back down and fix it somewhere where it doesnt annoy us in other words take it back to sisi and give me the old inventory system which allows me to play the game when new system is closer to actual prime time try it on live server againtranq is for serious business  current version of unified inventory certainly is not
once again seleene thank you for taking the time to respond well i would argue that the middle ground is to move the presentation layer to where we were and then introduce small incremental improvements from thereplease argue strongly for this on our behalf
im not trying to justify it i think its a mess and have to live with it too so im pretty motivated to push for something that works cripes have you tried running several dozen industry jobs with this
it is not about the bitching it is about the fact that the thing remains in tranq if they cant fix it in few days as the newest dev blog indicates it should be taken down asap for further developmentthink it this wayyour new car breaks down and needs few weeks of repairs will you be happy if they come to repair it to your yard every day so you can still use your broken car to do nothing  or will you be happy if you get replacement for the time it takes to get your own car backthis is not rocket science
yes when we reported feedbacks back to ccp and we told to everyone why so sucks this ui csm what did i tell to you they are just told gushy words to everyone in the eve radio what a successful thing is the new inventory system echo of ccpbut the new inventory system on sisi wasnt really fine we tested every day and we instantly realized it is not true what the csm said
in matter of fact i did try and havent touched my any other characters than this since i dont even want to go pvp or do missions because buying and fitting one ship made me burn my nerves with this improved usability alreadyat the moment i just want the persistent windows so i can open all the extra windows what i need daily in stations with my characters then i can close the nice side bar and drag and drop items back and forth like before without all the extra scrolling up and down in a menu which is lagged and a mess of random entries i dont usually even read what windows say i know where them are and what is in themsimple tasks have turned to be nightmares everything takes longer and takes more clicks there is no fun using folder menu i rarely touch it in my operating system either as there are faster and more convenient methods to handle files i have short cuts for all the most commonly used directories in my desktop opening 2 windows with those is much more smooth action than opening one and browsing it back and forth to find targets and cycling between them or opening new windows through those you can think those as ships and itemsbuttons in old system current unified inventory doesnt provide any short cuts what so ever always when you start you have to start from point 0there is plenty of more stuff which i would like to say what i think about this and the neocom for instance but to be honest im so fed up already that the patience to write nice constructive stuff has run very slim it is better i stop here
if it wasnt for the fact i have the inability to travel at the will of a corporation based on my lack of a passport and my contractual obligation to the us military id run for csm my damned self and if i could you better ing believe id be rolling in with a fistful of player concernsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
so you are saying that you would roll in with fist fulls of player rage like the monk in diablo 3 and round house kick the dev mobs so they go flying and then teleport in to lightning punch them to the face
except the cooldown timer would probably be close to a year
so the csm missed the mark on this one it happensdo a mae culpa and get working on itmocking the people who elected you while trying to say you didnt miss the mark well thats probably not going to go over well

its scaryand i realize this may shock youbut i might actually vote for you stop the evemail spam
pretty sure were already working on it pretty sure jack didnt elect either of us pretty sure no one in this thread even knows what the point is in the first placebut do continue to increase your post counts ill be over here doing real work to address real problems from players who just want their sandbox experience to be as seamless rich and enjoyable as possible communicate when that isnt happening in a clear reasonable way and listen when the target of those communications respondimpossible to please whiners and trolling alts will be largely ignored outstanding ones will be made targets of ridicule for my amusement and the amusement of voters at large have a great day
yeahsurego ahead and run off to your little club houses and back rooms and twiters and facebooks and blogs and ignore the people who actually live here at eve gateforums trying to better the game and hash things outagainmissing hte point and doing your own thing works great dont it keep that up stop the evemail spam
the only thing we missed the mark on was explaining to the players what wed been up to its not like we hadnt already been writing up feedback in the forums and referring the devs to all the relevant threads on the issue that was my earlier point communication with the players is important and theres of course room for improvement but our priority will always be making sure ccp has everything in detail first whether or not we than repost all the same complaints in a public forumwere also allowed to have a sense of humor especially when players come at us like we have a magic wand to revert the ui into its old system or charm ccp into obeying our very whim its important that players understand that the righteous fury often exhibited in forum threads just isnt a tool the csm has at their disposal especially when leveled at developers who are already addressing the problems as we speak its obnoxious to be yelled at to go do something youre already doing and it would quickly get the csm ignored as much as it does players who abuse the same tactics does it make for a quiet or boring csm sometimes absolutely but were not here to entertain inspire march in protests or lead crusades were here to calmly clearly and effectively communicate player concerns to ccp in a manner that gets results as you can already see by the most recent dev blog the first batch of results is on the way
maybe if you spent a little time just hanging around here and various areas of the forums youd find us a little bit more receptivebecause right now you only show up when the  hits the fani dont epxect you to snap your fingers and get things donei expect you to partiicpate actively and at least look the part of doing somethingthats not much to ask for for all things considered stop the evemail spam
for some rl reasons i havent had much chance to spend time with it and form and official position what little ive seen of it i have to admit i found it confusing at best as to how to untangle it and make it a net improvement from the old system not sure at this point but i intend to spend some time with it this weekend and see if i could come up with anything as well as look for ideas from the players as to possible fixesremember the csm is only advisory its not like we have access to the source code and could make changes ourselves or we can order ccp to change things this looks to be one of those waffle features where the first attempt was less than ideal but we need think about how to make the second waffle the one we wanted in the first place because in the current mess there are some good ideas filters for exampleissler
this whole matter is hugely exaggerated i see a problem but not one worth opening extra threads in the assembly hall forcalm the fck down and carry on
the council of stellar management csm is a playerelected council who represent the views of the members of the eve online community to ccp now csm guys just go to testserver feedback and go to
id be tempted to give you a pass on this particular issue i know you where heavily focused on the war dec changes for which there are other lovehate threads but your attitude frankly sucksstop trying to be mitanni its not helping
we have already seen those threads and pointed them out to the developers like i said this thread is predominantly angry individuals ordering us to do what weve already been doing you can link the threads again one more time if youd like or start even more threads linking old threads but its neither necessary nor helpful the devs are quite aware of these issues and are working to address many of them yelling at the csm who by the way have nothing to do with bug fixes and customer service  we work with development not the gms wont make this process go any faster there is a difference between saying everything is fine meaning that there are zero problems with the ui and saying everything is fine meaning that there are known problems but that they are actively being addressed you can make the assumption all you want that we are somehow brownnosing ccp and telling them it smells like roses but youve heard plain and simple how we feel about the ui it clearly needs further iteration before its the really cool feature it could be everything is not fine would mean that not only are problems but ccp doesnt appear to be doing anything about them either this would be major cause for alarm but this does not appear to be the case we should have clarified this more during our radio talks lesson learned
seleene hardly as i would review the ones that had obvious merits and dismiss the ones that stunk of blatant emorage but mocking those who vote to keep you in office is hardly a way to inspire confidence you are a representative of the players but are doing a fantastic job to lose respect which is what wins votes and thus electionsdrake as shocking as that is at least i listen to people and take advice or suggestions under advisement i dont usually agree with you but here i fully agreei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
it happens there was a lot to keep on top of in inferno that looked like it might turn out poorly wardecs fw first steps at ship balancingmy main point at this juncture is that being mocking and dismissive of folks that have legitimate concerns and criticisms is not constructive it only serves to alienate you from the playerbase their anger is feedback to be passed on and learn from not something that needs to be repressedpeople by and large dont expect you to run ccp they do expect you to listen to and represent them they get understandably angry if they feel that is not happeningis that being unreasonable and worthy of mockery

i think this would be neatbasically when you have a single ship and get kills with it it keeps tracks so you will see the ships veterancy such as you got 21 kills with this drake the most kills youve ever gotten with a single drake is 25could create a veterancy tab somewhere and give a lot of stats like this other than info it shouldnt do anything just some neat statisticsa kill should be anything not a podshuttlerookie ship that you got on the kill mail for pod kills could be tracked separately though
i honestly dont see this happening it would require that the server pull info each time a ship enter grid and thus would consume large resources whe you have large 100 man fights all for a bit o fluff
there is no csm as far as i know he was banned and removed from the game last i heard other than that i do know our word has not been heard no matter what we say inventory will not be fixed i posted a topic on how to fix it and keep the same system in the suggestions board but no one is bothering to look or support
can i get some input on this design i plan on working the monolith next then the pelican and finally the pillari am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
first thought was  an overweight imperial shuttlebut this has some potential right now seems like a modified fenrir so this seems something more like a tech 2 ship but keep the ideas rolling and maybe we can see these on sisi by the next time it snows d
thanks angry like i said next will be the monolith when i get a chance to draw it hopefully i get a shot to do it sometime this weeki am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
well heres a surprise for you i finished the design for the monolith last night however seem to be having some technical difficulties with my scanner so as soon as i get that  sorted out ill link it herei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
mal would you be able to update the op to include that you think the bounty payout system needs fixing first and keeping seperate from the contract system it would be much easier to rally support if thats clear in the op lets face it this thread is huge now no one is going to read it from start to finnish just to get an idea of what were talking about in the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
i know i should but i have some other projects competing for my limited time and also im no longer confident that posting in here is a good return on invested effort
i agree with lady flute vocal isk elites and super nerds are ruining the game game is slanted away from new subs for sure if another player friendly scifi indy game is developed by another corp ccp will be ganked and ccp will be qqing and will quit eve like hitler did and play dust instead real life gaming developing  null sec in the same waydUFFFDyou see in this world theres two kinds of people my friend those with loaded guns and those who dig i digUFFFD  clint eastwood misquote
so in effect a tengu fleet should be completely invulnerable to other subcaps rightand a cap fleet should only ever die to a supercap fleetand supercaps should only die to other bigger supercap fleetsand hell rifters shouldnt even be able to kill stealth bombersdo you even play this game
youre an idiot
i dont have a lot of isk but what i do have ive earned every penny as far as being slanted away from new subs its always been that way even when i started new players were targeted because older players were smart enough to not fall for stupid shenanigans we all started blissfully ignorant of what eve is you have to either accept it and get smart and learn how to keep yourself alive or quit those are your options there is no make the game easier way out one thing i see all the time is new players banding together in corps youre never going to learn anything that way youre just compounding your ignorance join an experienced corp that will actually teach you something eve university or agony unleashed are another way to go if you want to learn how to stay aliveanother thing i learned a long time ago 00 is way safer than empire if youre a miner join a 00 alliance and go mine abc ores deep in your alliance space youll rarely have to worry about getting jumped because the intel channels tell you when theres a hostile coming your way long before hes in your system even if he does manage to get to your system unnoticed he still has to scan down the grav site giving you plenty of time to get to safety i only died once in a mining ship on my indy alt and that was because some jackhole gave me the wrong intel channel when i first moved out there and i was dumb enough to mine in a beltthis thread is just a bunch of people complaining that they want eve to be easier so they dont have to put in the time and effort to learn it ccp has already made being a new player easier by leaps and bounds in the last year and a half so quit cher bitchin and grow a pair
why is it that good ideas are so difficult to keep in the first page of the assembly hall it seems to me like they are just drowned out by bad and controversial threads there is something wrong with a system where bad and controversial ideas spend all their time in the spot light and everything else is just ignored in the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
sounds like a good ideaperhaps have extra screens or holograms at stations with variable costs so a market hub system would be much more expensive than a 05 backwater
supportedalso maybe price can be dictated by average number of peeps in system a day diviided by some funky other math
one more cant hurt 1
i dont see why all the hate for the new system yes it has issues and those can be fixed but it isnt the end of the world
no those cannot be fixed revert to the old inventory
revert bandwith is free my time mucking about because ccp cant code for crap is not
bif this inventory nightmare purged from eve i dont care the other changes such as ugly amarrian ship changes frigate cosmetics etc
the old system was crap the new system is crap in differant ways but the new system is crap in ways that can be fixedif you dont like change play an mmo where the developers create it asign a skeleton crew and then abondon it in the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
its can be disableable so its will not be annoying when not neededor for what else do we have so detailed models of those missiles we are not seing them anywhere except a preview 
i like this idea alot im not sure im going to update the op yet to include it just because it is a complicated idea to describe and i think it turns a much simpler system into a potential ui and programming nightmare but i may update the op at some point to include this i just need to think it through more thoroughlyin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
your idea is sound but the suggested implementation is built upon a broken system what we need is a complete rewrite of the industry system a new industry system that is designed from ground up that has player cooperation at a corp level at its core is what is needed ccp needs to learn to not be afraid to throw away code and just redo things
likewise
get out
not empty quoting
go play star trek onlineif pvp is the heart of eve then the concept of a single unsharded universe is the spine and brain of the whole thingplease keep any brilliant ideas that require a complete restructuring of the game you may have in the future to yourself
time and time again ive come and gone from eve simply because i get bored with missions i believe there are many of us that do not have the skill or the gall to risk jumping into a 4 system or below only to be destroyed minutes later as it stands though were in a vast galaxy of space there are roads into and out of nullsec increasing the likelihood of running into a pirate almost to 100 in my humble opinion this is unacceptable and not a risk worth taking any road into nullsec is packed with pirates just waiting for the unsuspecting or overly curiousbrave soul to pass through this i believe is very stifling and severely prohibits travel into the unknown and more profitable regions of the galaxy most players are sitting in high sec space because it is the only safe place to be if we leave high sec space we are going to die there needs to be a chance of at least sneaking past the pirates guarding nullsec deep space needs to be more accessable therefore i propose a solutionjump drives  more ships with jump capabilities ships able to jump from system to system or even farther  jump drives fairly deep in skill progression 20m sp or so  plot coordinates on the map the farther it is the more fuelbigger jump drive it takes  refueling stations to supply players jump drivesdeep space combatpvp  redefine how pirates acquire there targets  hubs will form in deep space they must be protected by players from pirate players  have ships hackable pirates can hack into other ships that are not properly protected to discover bookmarks andor waypoints for travel have skills required to hack into ships as well as skills to create firewalls and counter measures to protect ships from being hacked  make pirates explore they have to find pve combat zones through scanning if they find them they can ambush unsuspecting players  allow pirates to hack into station computer systems and chat channels with required skills to gather information about players meeting to exchange goods form parties etc etc the only sure fire way to have a private secure conversation is to meet in person on a stationmake local chat a decision  join it if you want dont if you dont want your presence known  instead allow system wide scans if your corp owns a particular system allow them to set up and array that will alert them to a players presence in their systemkeep jump gates  they will be the road most traveled pirates can still camp them  allow players to choose their entry point into a system a particular planetstationbelt etcopen space up
this already exists and there are already enough ships with jump drives no to more jump drives unless new shiptypes are createdpeople already scan down people doing pve and blow them upthis has been discussed many many times noif you want to get deap into nullsec or lowsec without taking the common travel routes then scan down a wh go into that wh and see where it leads if it doesnt lead to lowsec or null then scan down another wh in that wh and you will eventually find a route deap into empty null sec space that is a simple solution to your problemas for gate camps you can check your map to see how many people are in space in lowsec systems and even see how many people have died there over the last hour so you can see gatecamps coming just avoid them or take a fast enough ship to get through basically learn more about pvp before you start proposing to change the game for your inadequaciesin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

seleene wrotejack carrigan wroteseleene hardly as i would review the ones that had obvious merits and dismiss the ones that stunk of blatant emorage but mocking those who vote to keep you in office is hardly a way to inspire confidence you are a representative of the players but are doing a fantastic job to lose respect which is what wins votes and thus electionsmate maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate if you cant handle some lighthearted joking and take everything this serious you probably wouldnt want to actually run for csm much less deal with some of the good times trolling and hilarity that goes on when dealing with ccp directly i dont respect the fact that so many seem ready to burn the csm at the stake because we are not somehow magically getting ccp to turn back time  revert the changes now now now or take remote control of the development servers and turn them over to people that can do it better as has been pointed out by no less than four csms in this thread we are not sitting on our hands and we are doing what we can to help alleviate the problem that we are all suffering from atm your post which i mocked seemed to ignore that we are already doing exactly as you say you would do if you were able just without the seeming outrage that so many seem to be baffled the csm is not righteously displaying it was also completely dismissive of replies that had already been given in this thread links to other threads and the content of the same insinuating that you would somehow be able to do more without so much as acknowledging the aforementioned efforts already being made marked your post in my eyes as a blatant come at me bro troll i actually read your post and my reply to it reflected my mood  you were ignoring the replies id made in this thread so i wasnt really moved to take what you said seriously either if your post was serious then it certainly didnt come across as suchhere is what i see happening as of right now ccp isnt going to roll back the changes they will keep working to evolve the current feature as quickly as possible not much is going to happen in the next 48 hours because its the weekend i could be wrong and the dudes responsible may work all weekend to iterate on the united inventory feature doubt it the csm will be in iceland next week and this subject will obviously be front and center i will be sending out nonnda updates from the summit as much as i can as we talk to the various teamsat this point there is quite literally nothing else the csm can do that weve not already done over the past few weeks especially since inferno went live the onus is on ccp to now act on how the csm and the community has reacted to their decisionsthanks for the good responsei think its still fairly valid to wonder why there was little more than itll be great in the townhall i do seem to remember some acknowledgment of concern there too to your credit the forums where exploding with little or no acknowledgement from the csm and two step was right to an extent the people angry about this where doing a fine job of getting the point across but still in the middle of these issues is where i think we expect to see the csm i do think there might be something to learn here about at least acknowledging concerns a bit earlier if you guys where working hard behind the scenes great still a dialog with the players might be goodfor example this point is it seriously impossible to revert the inventory and run the unified version as an optional secondary way to look at this until the performance and other issues are resolved as a software engineer i think this should be possible but it depends on good version control and how it was implemented it may or may not be feasible but one wonders if the devs are just being stubborn on this pointwe were told something similar about the orca corp hanger but that got fixed one way or the other in reasonably short orderanyway thanks for hanging in there and weathering the slings and arrows
wow look at all that support from our elected leadersbought out for the price of a ticket to iceland and you all turn in to lapdogsreal edit i posted that prior to reading selenes postings as 2steps response blowsthanks to selene for the rational follow up
careful with that lighthearted humor seleene  didnt work out so well for your predecessoris there somewhere that shows what exactly csms position is on the ui what changes are you advocating i mean there are a lot ideas out there so which do you think should be on ccps hitlist wouldnt mind actually seeing each members positionthanks
as the player who asked the inventory question which the csm answered unsatisfactorily im disappointed that people are using it to attack the csm process at the time of the town hall broadcast i was irritated by the csm response to my question as i felt it showed a general lack of awareness of the inventory issue to a degree i still believe this however i appreciate with the impending summit there is undoubtedly a host of other issues which also demand their time and attentioni think the more militant and vocal players should remember that no csm member is being paid for their time  any and all effort they put into their role is entirely voluntary the commitment they have made is on our behalf and theres absolutely no point in fingerpointing and namecallingits at times like these with issues impacting so many subscribers that players should be supporting and empowering the csm
all i see in the reaction from the csm here is a kneejerk reaction to them as a whole being put up on blast for their lack of interaction quite sad reallyi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
dittowhole lot of backpedaling and excuses and not so much participationgonna take a lot more than some scattered words of confidence to put any faith back into itagaini know you guys cant do squat as far as taking actionbut you sure as hell could be doing a lot more than sitting there in silence stop the evemail spam
create thread about lack of csm participation and forum postsgets csm to post in threadtalk about issue with csm members learn how they are dealing with issue have csm members completely miss point of threadit really is a art
indeed it ispoint still missedi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
do you know why they didnt communicate with players they didnt communicate with ccp and they didnt read the ui topic for information check seleene answer to jack carrigan from weekendnow read ccp soundwave answer from fixingwe should have another round of fixeschanges coming this tuesday monday is a public holiday in icelandthe testers made enough feedback for easy fix the testers pointed out the problems to ccp and for csm too but csm did nothing
i like the fact that the csm are putting some effort into this threadthat said i think the whole point of it is that the csm is not communicating their efforts effectively enoughthere doesnt seem to be a presence in the player threads that are either a trying to make sensible constructive criticism or b btchslapping ccp for such a massive failthe ui sucks and we all know it  i just think that the csm needs to be louder not quieter and working in the backgroundalso  csm tags should be clickable so we can see posts by them  they should show on the forumtldr  more communicative csm please  we were spoiled before and you seem a bittoothless
i thank the csm for looking into this and putting it at the top of the list
which major powerblocks do issler and trebor representoh wait youre making  up to excuse your lack of involvement
heyi dont post much and not sure if this is in the right part of the site just a suggestion to ccpwith the new patch much of the war decs has changed all for the good it seems i like the new war menus they are great it would be great to see and new tab though the same as the old war menu just to let you know what are active for you atm a start and finish date this menu is very simple but also very effective for the corpsalliances that are in alot of  this is a great way to see who exactly you are at war with at any given time cheers tas
you must be doing something wrongbecause usually you get things called notificationsand you have to be joking that your not able to see your current active wardecs stop the evemailUFFFDspam
you must be doing something wrongbecause usually you get things called notificationsand you have to be joking that your not able to see your current active wardecsim not saying i cant see my active  what i am saying is that the old war menu was so much easier to read it was simple it said who you were at war with and if you could fight yet i dont want to get rid of the new menu i think its great what i think would be nice is to have another tab with the old menu just as reference cheers tas

get a pad of paper or an excel spreadsheet and you can do this yourself no need to waste dev time or server power on something that doesnt help the game at all when you can do it all yourself
yesunnecessarygo program your own damn killboard and go hog wild with statistics to your wildest dreams and leave the devs out of this tripe they already have enough to deal withyou got the api librarysstop being lazy and get off your dont know how to program well get busyno one got anywhere doing nothing stop the evemailUFFFDspam
i have always loved the idea of stats being kept on ships ie who manufactured it number of final blows age of ship etc etcbut due to some rather unavoidable programming issues this will probably never be a good ideain the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
still having tech difficulties with my scanner so lets discuss the bedouin for a biti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i know youve posted the pic but for minmatar it wouldve been very cool to have exposed ship docks instead of internal bays look at that that things lugging two machs get it
bollocks they can implement a record something along the lines of previously known as alias etc if a recruiter is stupid enough not to vet them properly then its his fault if he gets scammed one can currently just buy an alt and do the same damage if they really wanted tooi do not see any downside to allowing a once a year change or some such it is not game breaking and it keeps the game fresh for those that perhaps are unhappy with there name choice i would happily pay rl money or plex for this opportunity so i back it 100 eve since incarna seems to be about identity so who cares what my avatar looks like if you are not happy with your name

actually it is hard you tell me how to stop a hulk from getting suicide ganked by 4 destoyers its not possible especailly for newer players concord protects gankers and people with wanted bounties on them broken system is brokeneve is about largest wallet wins happens all the time and thats ok it inspires people to make more isk but there is no credible defence to suicide ganking at the moment and thats broken pvp should never be certain kill any more than having a big shiny warship should never guarantee victory without skill
 except ccp has made this game tons easier than it used to be know what that tells me they want the subs they need the new players to stay so they have been changing the rules over and over and over to keep them if players cant come up with good ideas to retain new players in face of gankers and greifers running amok then ccp will hardcode changes they have done it before and will do it again if things dont improve
its called start paying attention to the fing game and stop being so stupid about itget the message nowanyone who mines and doesnt pay attention to localintel channels and everything deserves to be ganked stop the evemail spam
and now for some numbers on how risky space should beif you are going to live in a space you need to get more resources out of it than you lose in itlets say i buy a belt ratting bc that with todays market prices costs 100 mil and we say anyone living in null should get 20 back on whatever they put into it so that belt ratting bc should survive long enough to make 120 mil in bounties before exploding a 200 mil haven running battleship should be able to make 240 mil in bounties before exploding and a 400 mil hulk should be able to mine 480 mil worth of minerals before explodingso back to our 200 mil haven running bs example i think 240 mil worth of havens is about 8 havens or so so if someone is really trying to catch ratters they should be able to catch 1 in 8 people running a haven thats about a 125 mortality rate in havens you could even say something like havens should have enough scramming frigates to keep someone warp scrambled 125 of the timethe problem with both of your arguments is that they both result in two extremes of safety and mortality while trying to pve in nullwith local in place and nobody cloaked in local you have plenty of warning when someone enters system between them having to scan down your site 10 seconds and then the time it takes to warp to you basically you just have to be paying attention and warp out as soon as you see someone in localwith no local null becomes a cloaky hot droppers paradise every system has a cyno alt in it looking for wrecks on d scan every site becomes a death trapif you are going to remove local which does feel a bit to metagamey then you need to replace it with an intel tool that feels safe enough for the ratters and risky enough for the gankerspersonally id like to see something that has more to do with game mechanics and less to do with a chat program something that cares more about the scan resolution of my ship and not weather i pop into locali honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
hah noyou still havent learned anything about how they do things have you even after the shipspinning removal ccp dont keep old code they save over it
if you look at every race they each have two main frigates more importantly they all have the same number of low medium and high slots  10 gallente has the incursus  4 low 3 med 3 high and the tristan  3 low 3 med 4 high minmatar has the rifter  3 low 3 med 4 high and the vigil which is one short as well but still better balanced than the kestrel at  3 low 3 med 3 high amarr has the punisher  4 low 2 med 4 high and the tormentor  4 low 3 med 3 high and finally caldari has the merlin  3 low 4 med 3 high and the kestrel at  2 low 3 med 4 high the kestrel is hard to fit and make effective since it does not have 10 slots it has only 9 i believe this causes it to suffer in pvp and pve i propose that it be given another medium slot to aid in pvppve since all shield and tackling modules are medium slotswhat do you think ccp spitfire
amarr has the punisher and inquisitor the tormentor cannot be used for any comparisons because it is part of the new unfinished balancingon that topic ccp is rebalancing everything
you mean like the new unified inventory that went down well after alldont get me wrong i agree whole heartedly i just think that because of all the recent whining and bitching ccp wont be in a rush to rebuild a system from the ground up again even though i think they should
that wasnt a rewrite of the inventory system just a new ui what i mean is take all the crappy code and ideas in the current industry system cough blueprints cough and start over i dont want a face lift or bandaid as it will turn out like the unified inventory
that wasnt a rewrite of the inventory system just a new ui what i mean is take all the crappy code and ideas in the current industry system cough blueprints cough throw it out and start over i dont want a face lift or bandaid as it will turn out like the unified inventory
im aware we have player owned starbases already im a big fan of immersion and would really dig a smallmediumlarge player built and anchored home that i can dock my ship at and get out to stretch my legs all the while checking up on all the latest bountiestrade routesincursions with a room much like the cqs but then i also want a trophy room a room where i can put trophiesribbonsmedals up on display for any whom i invite into my little abodeplayer cities anyone have player homes grouped up in deadspace complete with our own starbases and refineries corporate buildings and item malls linked directly into the market bars with craps tables slot machines drugs alcohol and hookers a pool table wouldnt be bad either another profession choice the gambler i want to sit down at a table with corp members and play some  pokerthis idea is solely to appeal to those that want a realistic and immersive environment an eve that brings much more to the table than is currently
plans for that died with incarna
pretty much this after 4 to 6 years of development only being given one little room with no content and ignoring many glaring issues with the existing game incarna took away almost any hope people have for a total immersion aspectthe whole thing will be revisited in the future of that im sure just dont hold your breath
i couldnt have said it better myself
i cant imagine what this might say about you
being able to sneak your way through a wormhole into nullsec is unpredictable and a risk many simply will not take having a single road into any nullsec region is not realistic its seriously like walking a path to school the only path you can take and having every  bully in the city waiting for you at regular intervals to beat your ass its nonsense the way it is we can either be willing to have a 100 chance to lose considering there is not a cap to skills and many players have years more skill training time under their belts there is no way to win there is no way to organize a nullsec endeavor without serious losses its stifling at bestit takes an open mind to realize the possibilities of what im proposingwe need ships that dont take years to train for that can equip jump drives
nullsec is as safe as the sov holders make it if its impossible to keep hostiles out which is what you want it pretty quickly becomes impossible to rat for more than about ten minutes
but there is always more than one way in
remember elite 2  hyperdrives generated scannable jumpportals where the ships jumpedthe ship not landed directly to station they jumped to randomly position and they needed to moving toward them without warp
csm please point out to ccp the growing  storm in regards to the player base i cant say the new ui is universally despised there are at least two people that like it probably ones that dont have towers or corp hangers or manufacture anythingthis is growing into a major firestorm and seriously it is not going away please before we drop another 5k subs please point out to ccp the sense of rage regarding this diseased barely funtional laggy ui improvementim not sure there are words strong enough to describe how important that is it is enraging people it just feels like incarna again
csm before the st storm go ccp go ccpafter hmm we are aware there may be some problems but ccp its working on it not in weekend ofc but they are really really stressed about it it will be fixed in severall weks or several months cose you know they are really working hard on itcsm what a jokeyou even succed in making me regret the mitani and let me tell you ladds that was a thing i never ever imagined
i do all of those things and i still dont find the new ui a problem also most of my corp think the following of the ui  meh get the occasional comment about the estimated prices and filters being cool one or two odd comments about its going to take some time to get used to even the corp my alt is in doesnt have any problems with it i dont understand how all the forum trolls have such a problem with ityes there are problems no they are not a big deal where do you get your stats from having talked to so few people in game who have a problem with the ui and having not seen anyone rage 1 sub ccp on the forums i cant see that anyone has left over thisthis is just such a massive overreaction over practically nothing as far as i can tell
happy to be wrong about ccp not working on a weekend today on an icelandic holiday sunday no less ccp soundwave has released another dev blogthis week in the unified inventorythe money lines of this blog areas a remedy weUFFFDre going to try and provide you with weekly changes to it until we get it into a state where youUFFFDre happy with itagain you guys have my deepest apologies for this situation weUFFFDll do whatever we can to rectify it were going to continue to take your valuable feedback and add it to the list of changes we want to makei dont think ive ever read anything by ccp where they publicly commit to weekly changes on a feature one thing i know is that ccps management is not taking this lightly at all on friday night i spoke with ccp unifex jon lander eves senior producer about this issue specifically while i cannot detail the whole conversation i can say that this is something which is getting a lot of attention internally at ccp and will be front and center in our discussions at the summit this week
i have been quite vocal about it and have said many negative things about ccp to the point of damaging my relationship with them the fact that they quite obviously dont care that they have made the game much more tedious for most of us is obvious it doesnt seem to phase them that the system sucks and they are much more worried about their public image than the players well being i have asked for an optional system where we can choose if we want the new or old system and i doubt they will listen they didnt seem to care before releasing the crap system that virtually everyone said it was crap why should they listen now they think we will get used to it and are oblivious to how much more difficult it is on the people who actually play the game
from other topicagain you guys have my deepest apologies for this situationfrom devblog this is lol and ridiculouswe dont want apologies we reported all problems from new uianyone listen from ccp our feedbacks  we created video etc but we got the answer from developercan read everyoneccp arrow wrotein the sessions the whole team observed the live feed and took notes on everything the participants did we dont do user tests because we dont believe you when you say there is a problemwho enabled this crap unfinishedinventory to put tq  who is the responsibility for this we hate this inventory unusableit is a torture for players a nightmarewe dont want apologies we dont want this ui and we never asked this crap uido you know what we want  we want eve client without unfinished inventory put back to sisi fix it there we are subscribers not alphabeta testers beta testing is a job and they get payments for test but we paying for game and we want play not testing crap unfinised workschop down this horrible treepanel we dont want win 31 file explorer in evewe want a handly tools what the old inventory was
ribikoka i think everyone knows that you are mad but you are not going to get what you want they are not going to revert it no matter how much you  about it they will evolve what they have on a weekly basis that is the commitment they have made they made a big mistake now they have to fix it and they have said they are going to you can why why why all you want but this is still night and day different than what happened with incarna where they actually tried to defend that bullshit for months on end
saying a csm member who was voted to csm with mandatory alliance lettera pet of ccp who did nothing to arrest this ccp mistake just put his hand for free tickets for enjoying journey to icelanddo you think an old mc video enough for csm membership  no brownnoiserdo you think wont be happen nothing but the mmo portals started to write from this fiasco againplayers started to left the game because you csm guys dont save players interests and did nothing when free testers from sisi reported the unfinished inventory feedbacks for everyonedifferent than what happened with incarnadifferent than what happened with incarna  this is same they didnt listen their playerbase and testers when they said we tried on sisi but this is bad just you say on ui topic hurray this is our flawlessperfect ui without try after 6 minutes when ccp created their devblogs from uibut this is worsen than incarna the players dont have choice they must to use this crap inventory they cant turning off the door to windows because they dont have option for this
minimizing windows and then shiftclicking on the ones i want does the trick close enough but was really painful until somebody told me about the shiftclick option
pls candidate was elise randolph who also got booshed by rdn and ncdot no alliance mails got me onto the csm
yea im too working in a weekend cose im writing on a forum its a hard work indeedand one more thingwe all know that when ccp make a promise they will keep it no matter what like they did one hundred times before oh wait like they did when the ceo of ccp sayd they wont ever bring content that we players dont want yea im sure they wont just patch 23 things till the player rage go down a bit and then forget about this problem for years no ccp wont do that ever
well we can agree on a couple things here the unified inventory blows donkeys people are going to continue raging about it until it is fixedwell ccp said theyre going to make weekly changes and hey look the entire point of this thread has been achieved as the csm is actually updating us on  that they are allowed to tell us nonnda information and whats being done to fix our concernsi think we can chalk this one up as a win and now see if the inventory gets unedi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
im only frustrated with the inventory laghavent found any other reason to rage
 public raging thread got what it wanted interesting though as a forum warrior i do want to say that a thread like this four weeks ago would have been much more useful and part of the point of the continuation of this thread public csm support or condemnation of changes that are going to go live before they go live  are important  and after they are actually available to be tested rather then the ui thread which csm posted before it was actually available to be testedi understand that you may have blogs twitters and whatnot but the lack of csm posts on the official eve forums is just what you posted feeling about this everywhere but here really
this and getting tired of being forced to use their  when im content to have the eve online forums themselves stop the evemail spam
are you tigers alt you have a very similar debating style you just repeat yourself over and over without listening to anything anyone is saying you look like some nut randomly ranting in the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
they should try the wizard in diablo 3 hes got a pretty nifty wandthere are no stupid questions just stupid people ccp goliath wrote
so basically this i cannot believe this topic hasnt been brought up before maybe it has but im relatively new to eve but wow what an idea imagine if a hisec mining corp was forced to dec another mining corp due to competition over a particular systems belts hisec war would suddenly make sense imagine a null sec moon gets mined out and its resources appear in another part of space suddenly that alliance you were somewhat friendly with has a resource that your alliance desparately wants maybe a backstab and some fleet ops are in order mission rats get defeated and move on to another area of space you dont feel like moving all your mission gear to a new area and are kind of peeved by that other corp farming out the available missions so quickly declare war really the possibilities over competing over limited resources are endless and would add sooo much to this game and the game could finally function in the way it was meant to
this is downright stupidif resources are as limited as irl wars would happen as often as irl in other words not oftenresources are what sustain wars lack of resources are what bring wars to an end wars dont happen when one has no resourcesruns out of resources but rather when one has more than enough resources and thus uses the excess to obtain yet more review your history take note on when wars happen
adapt  survive or fail  die
from the inferno fw dev blog posti would like to say that defending sites and getting zero rewards is not fun attackers can easily drain the lp from ihubs on anything but upgrade level vi would like to propose that for every 1 the defenders take back that 1000 lp be put into the ihub for example if i run a minor site and bring the contested value from 20 to 197 i think it is 3 but i really only defended a few times because it sucks 300 lp would be placed in the ihubthis would get around the possible farming that ccp was worried about as the lp would be going to the ihub rather than playersthoughts
seconded
seconded as well capturing in defense plexes is mostly boring make it at least a little bit useful
the closed bays would make for easier design for the game versus having to put work in place for when this ship changes cargoi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
to help out i still have 3 thrashers on the market that need good homes to help create more emobearragei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
come try to gank my hulk next time i mine ill even put you in fleet so you can warp right next to meto save time here is the outcome ill be in warp before you exit warp ill have about 3 seconds to identify your ship and a dessie or bc3 means im gone cruiser depends on the ship bs i wouldnt care at this point it would be funny and frigindie i would just laughhint every ship can instawarp if you have it set up
obviously youve never heard of an instalock before youre locked and alphad before you even hit warpive already demonstrated this to several people in ice and ore belts an exhumer isnt going to get to warp before i can scram and kill it with hot mods
how can you alpha a ship thats already in warp if theyre aligned at warpout speed its not going to be difficult to get out before youre out of warp
protip you hit warp as soon as something out of the ordinary loads on your grid so long as you are actively aligned nothing with catch you and yes there is effort involved in being actively aligned
1 agreed this is an old clumsy mechanic and the possibility of more variation in acceleration would be a fine thing
gizznitt your last post certainly did make more sense i still dont follow you to the same conclusion but it no longer sounds like total crazy talk i do think your setting scenarios where the player that is pveing is as hopeless as you can conceive solo no friends or alies no alts doesnt watch dscan fits for pure pve and so on where as at the other end its an organized pvp gang with scouts fast dscanersprobers no other possible threats but the poor lone pveer etc thats not exactly going to lead you to a balanced conclusioni completely agree that resources to be gained in dangerous space need be worth the risk this is the key reason high sec pve is such a huge problem in eve particularly high income low risk activities such as incursions that needs to change to my knowledge eve is the only sandbox mmo built around player conflict that has high value pve in areas protected by unbeatable npcsi also agree there could be more intel tools especially in the event of local intel as it is now disappearing the idea presented here doesnt completely remove local intel but it certainly makes it far less effective also while not part of the op proposal it is made with assumption that a form of cloak hunting is also introduced ccp has hinted they want to change local several times over the years but in their last meeting with csm 6 they also brought up their interest in cloak hunting something i strongly believe cannot happen without first doing away with local chats 100 effortless intel function or the result could well be the same as removing cloaks from the gamegiven the ideas in the op and the additions mentioned in the thread that the delay on showing local also applies to ships entering the system seeing ships already in it means to hunt cloaking ships an improved dscan and of course an appropriately balanced risk vs reward across all of eve space what would you suggest to bring the proposal to a point you consider a balanced point that you would support
only way id get behind this proposal is if it works both ways ie if you dont show up on locan local does not show up for you 
whelp if we need a new intel tool to replace local then we are going to have to design a new intel tool to replace local i hate proposing completely new mechanics on the eve forums but its the only alternative to arguing around in circles about afk cloakingso here goes1 remove local as an intel tool local is only there for chatting and smack talk so itll probably have to be the wh style delayed local2 this new intel tool should probably be a beefier and more robust version and replacement of dscan and the system scanner and it should be automatic so people dont have to keep clicking scan every 10 seconds3 all friendly ships blues should have some sort of iff that makes them show up automatically without needing to show up on scan4 the new intel tool should be entirely based on in game mechanics maybe the time it would take to detect someone new comming in system could be based on a combination of sig radius scan resolution distance in au active modules weither or not they are warping and any other status effects5 by basing detection on gme mechanics this makes ships in the scout role more important think of the interceptor with its low sig radius and high warp speed it could get to sites faster and take longer to detect jumping in a scout ahead of the rest of the roaming gang to catch ratters will be more of an option6 cloaked ships should not be 100 undetectable this leads into whatever cloak hunting system ccp is working on cloaky hunting finally needs to be possible7 the new intel tool needs to take up less space on screen than what most people use when they pull out local chat and itd be nice if it was a little more engaging to look at than a list of people in local8 this new intel tool could be some sort of upgradable sov module that people can improve with effort in highsec  lowsec it should be in its most informative state low risk  low reward space and in wormholes it should be in its lowest informative state high risk  high reward space9 personally id like ship detection in the new intel tool to be time based so you will always eventually show up on scan its just the amount of time it takes for someone to show up that changes based on how slippery their ship is this would make camping a system less effective than fast roaming gangs when trying to catch people although this is just personal preference id like to see more roaming gangs as a gameplay style instead of people just periodically checking cyno alts to see if anyone is doing anything in locali honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
ok so i have been giving this quite a bit of consideration and like the majority i accept can flipping as a normal if some what frustrating part of eve and the risks that go with solo mining but should we accept this as a valid criminal act and put up with it or should we be recognizing this as a loop hole in the game mechanics thats being exploitedyou see for as much as i like all who experience it dont like it the simple act of having my hard earned ore or anything else i may store in a jetcan stolen is something i can begrudgingly accept as a rightful act of criminality if some one has the means to come in and steal my stuff and are confident they can get away unscathed then fine that is all part of what eve is abouthowever where id draw the line is when some one steals from me with a clear recognition they took what is mine by the very fact i am now allowed to take aggressive actions against them with no repercussions from concord and yet to take what is mine simply by it being within their jetcan is to afford them the same rightsmy problem with this is that it seems like a complete contradiction to one moment recognize a theft of my property to the next simply by means of where it resides now treat it also as though it is their property which i am able to steal i should not be able to steal what is mine but only take it rightfully no matter where it is unless that place is inaccessible to me ie secure container station or within a shipmy initial suggestion would be that an item stack has a marker which denotes who it belongs to when legitimately transacted this marker would be changed or acceptably when stolen items are sold on this would change but when an item is simply stolen this marker would stay the same and so allow the owner where possible such as in jetcan storage to take back there items with no repercussionsthis i think would benefit game play in a few ways not least that it would even the odds between miners and those who seek to commit criminal acts against them it would mean that by current means those stealing would only be able to smash and grab relatively small amounts if they want the protection of their fighting ships to help ensure they can get away with it it would allow miners the chance to salvage at least some of the haul they have just spent the last 3 hours or so collecting but most importantly it would mean those wanting to make their living of this sort of criminality would require the right tools as apposed to now where they leave what they take in a jetcan for half hour while their friend turns up in a hauler and the miner has to frustratingly just accept their loss while all their hard earned ore just sits there right in front of them instead the thief would have to come in a hauler if they wished to ensure they can take as much as possible before the miner is able to get any out of there because the fact is most miners who have spent their time on that route of training dont currently have the means to match let alone out gun those who can flip but if stealing required that the thief used the right ship for the job such as a hauler less the miner move most of their haul out then it would allow the miners at least the chance and opportunity of chasing down and apprehending the thief there would be a chance that the thief may actually lose out there would be a chance the miner may actually get their haul backto conclude this is something that could truly bring more balance to game play it would encourage more tactical play and provide a greater medium to allow more miners to engage in some pvp aspects by simply recognizing ownership of items beyond just who is currently in possession of them it would remove a major point of contradiction in the game system afford a sense of owner ship to those who spend hours of game play on extracting resources and most of all encourage far more fluent interactions between playersedit alternative changebassed on suggestion and concerns about my initial suggested method to acheive the goals stated it would perhaps be better to simply change the way jetcans workps please like this topic if you would support this kind of change and remember its not about stopping criminality as thats an important part of what makes eve just about evening the odds
stop can mining and get an orcayou people are just flat hopeless stop the evemail spam
orcas take time to train and i think till then can mining is a valid if acceptably risky way to solo mine i just think how those risks are posed should change to provide more balanced game play and give those working for something greater possession over what they work for
mining of any value shouldnt occur in high sec under the protection of concord then under those circumstances can flipping is irrelevant
mining high sec is as acceptable a way to make profits as anything else in the game and with what i propose no one would be under the protection of concord its just about evening the odds and there by encouraging more fair pvp between criminals and those they target
you have no flipping clue how to mine in the first placeif you had you woudlnt be posting this tripeyoud be using secure cans until you have a corp to work with or an orca to flyjust like everyone elsecan mining is stupidyou should not do ityou dont do it if you have any common senseif you do it its because you dont flat careor your lazyor your looking for a fighteveryone knows thisanyone who pays attention that is stop the evemail spam
jetcans hold allot more than most secure containers and are far cheaper and i wouldnt call it laziness but efficiency its far more efficient to sit on a belt longer and take out one large haulnow plenty of people use this method and if you dont know that then perhaps you are ignorant of course it comes with risks and im saying that i accept that im prepared to have my haul stolenwhat im trying to put across though is that in the interest of avoiding contradiction and to provide more balanced game play balanced game play being the theme of damn near every aspect of change ive ever seen to the game that perhaps a change in the way ownership is perceived and works would be a good idea
stealing is also an acceptable way to make profit as anything else in the game
koreli you are missing the point posting in forums only attracts a negative response you will not interact with peers exchangeing ideas  saddly only spewn hatetred for expressing your ideas eve is not the problem it is the people who play it they enjoy the challenge of combating unarmed participants they love to cause player misery for no other reason because they can and they actually take pride in that how could you ever expect to change that the in game issues and mechanics are merely breeding grounds for this type of behavior and they use it as a shield proclaiming that its only a game and they are not like this in real life truly the greatest lie ever told your idea has merit and will fall on deaf ears my friend
well thanks dr quantom but it said this was the place for ideas so i thought worth a try mallak azaria please actually read what i have to say as ive stated multiple times that i accept stealing and criminality as a part of eve however i am saying the way this works and is viewed should change it should not be possible to steal back what belongs to you only to take it rightfully and in making this change it would create more balanced game play as an example imagine i came into your home and took the computer on which you are viewing this and playing eve among other things then knowing where i live you come and take back your computer for it is still yours is it not would you have also stolen it from me then could i prosecute you for stealing the computer just the same as you could me that would just be crazy it would be thrown out of court assuming it could even make it thereso why should the values of ownership be any different in eve
you a 2 month old toon telling me that a jet can holds morethats funnykeep calling me ignorantlets see how far you getyou have no business making proposals or changes to a game you barely understand let alone know how to playhigh sec is not supposed to be a safe haven for mining its saferuntil you learn that lessonyou will never get anywherethis is not real lifethis is a gamestop making comparisons are suchand as for ownershipyou have every right to challenge the theif who took your ore and to take it right backso instead of ing about itfight back thenstop whining stop the evemail spam
this is perhaps a 2 month old toon but my old toon i played in a mining corp was a fair bit older hahaand this is the place for suggestions and debate now i pay like all ne like most players so if i feel there is a problem im entitled to voice it thats called consumer rights and of course you dont have to agree with it and i respect your opinion but it would be nice if you could just express it in a little more polite and constructive waythough thank you all the same for your in put
you should stop and consider that some of us such as me who have played since 2008 would rather eat dirt than tolerate people who get on a pedistal and consider themselves all that and experts after 2 months of playing this game in changing a very large portion of said game so dramatically that they completely ignore the ramfiications all because they dont like ityour mining corp is likely just as foolish as the rest of them if they think they are entitleneted to jet can mining without risk or concern doubtful as if they are old as you sayand sorry to sayyou are a true blue green earned noob prue and simplethe only time i have evered jet canned after learning the hard way you dont is in 00 or whswhy because your gonna die anywayso who caresas i saidyou have alot to learn before you start pushing such game breaking ideas on usuntil such timedont botherspend 6 months to a year first before you come back here and tell us you feel entitlted as such to that kind of miningif its that bad and you have no friendsgo fly a hulk and slow hoof it i had tooits not that hardjust dont think your entitlented to safety in that light either in high sec spaceas im sure many will be quick to point outagainyou can fight backno one said you couldntam i terese yesbut if you had done your researchand realized no one touches this subject without fear of getting burnedyoud understand stop the evemail spam
adding ownership tags would be an interesting idea however for one half can of ore you are talking about what 12 k tags  one on each piece of ore and with multiple characters mining into teh same can how does the game differentiate ownership between individual items in a stackbut more to the point the entire mining system weak ships long cycle times is very specifically geared towards being griefed you are starting from the bottom of the food chain 1 yes you would both be prosecuted be is still a crime in most places property theft even property obtained through illicit means is still theft  it would be interesting to see what this sort of change did to can flipping though corpmates couldnt help out as much which would make theft more risky2 jet cans are bigger then most secure cans and since jet cans are free they are also cheaper3 many people also die in half fit hulks i wouldnt suggest going out like that though the logic of a million people cant be wrong is patently wrong it is very easy for a million people to be wrong 4 you are arguing with drake who is not arguing your ideas merits but that can mining is stupid these are different arguments legality in eve is a very tricky subject ccp want a way to make people cry without breaking any local laws on bullying personal ideas of fair  just or right do not apply here is the universe it is not nice that being said ccp has also been insanely inconsistent with their own programed rules aggression mechanics do not transfer to logistics except in the case of concord now redacted  salvage  loot issues even the jetcan corp help issue i wouldnt hold my breath to get this changed simply because they ccp  has quite a bit on their plate not to mention all the other things they have to break before they get to aggression mechanics and object ownership also after the ui changes you really want them messing with jetcan ownerships
that the recent frigate changes were only phase one the kestrel will undoubtedly get looked at i am a little puzzled though as to why they decided to revamp a mining frigate rather than say the hilariously broken tier 1 frigates but what the hell theyll hopefully get round to those
lets hope so i cant wait for the kestrel to become an effective caldari missile boat we dont need anymore effective gun boats
well a buff to the eagle and vulture certainly wouldnt go amiss and the moa could use some love as well
any comments
so you want a pov of a suicide bomber
what the title says no war in high sec in any wayyou want pvp cool lowsec and 00 is right next door
why not just axe the servers and cut the power lines to them as well same basic effect
i like trolls but still not same basic effect that would stop both pvp and pve
id actually consider supporting that if it included removing any activity that impacts pvp which would essentially mean there would be nothing to do in high sec at all as everything in this game is pvp or impacts pvp your proposal could be interpreted as the removal of high sec from eve which is definitely not the worst idea ive seen on these forums
you still can have pvp in 00 and low sec whatever impacts you mention still applyproposal is to remove war and pvp out of high sec not to remove it entirely
my comments just flew right over your head wooosshhhhhhhhhhhhhtry to understand at least the basics of the game you are playing before posting about changing that game or in the event ive mistaken ignorance for just trolling dont do it in the assembly hall go post in general discussion youll get way more bites
says the idiot trollget outand stay out stop the evemail spam
i used to type out lengthy responses to these threads now i just do thissave me from nonconsentual pvp
you dont want pvp cool world of warcraft is right next doorsummary of eves last four expansions
sowhy do you play this game
and then there would be no new paying players cos they would never have a chance of getting any where and all of you who are getting some place would all end up rich enough to buy plex with isk and the game would go bust and shut downno high sec is important in nurturing new players which keeps the game from stagnating however there is very little non consensual pvp to be had in high sec any howlol id vote keep high sec and what little pvp exist there as it is all important for learning and simply cos pvp is in a way the back bone of eve
are ccp alts posting these horrible ideas to keep us from posting in the terrible inventory threads getting us to bump these instead of the ui threads so they can say  well they arent complaining about it anymore so i guess we are done fixing things
tldr giving remote assisters a full 60s timer for assisting an aggressed pilot will lead to stranded and often dead logistics pilots in lowsec and 00 having the assisting pilot inherit the gatestation aggression timer of the assisted pilot avoids this issue while still preventing logistics ships from playing gatestation games by themselvesas was originally pointed out having remote assistance give a full 60s gatestation timer massively breaks logistics and rrbs gangs in lowsec and nullsec since the original thread got locked due to its age im reposting here to raise awareness of this issue among those who might not have caught wind of it originally and also due to some of the statements made surrounding the crimewatch talk at fanfest 2012 which seem to imply tinfoilhatthat remote assistance will receive the full timer instead of inheriting the timer of the assisted pilottinfoilhatmadeup but plausible example of thisyoure in a 30man ahaclogi gang heading down from ls to roam down the mainpipe in curse your skirmisher spots a 20man close range bc gang with scimi support in jorund with bubbles anchored on the doril gate your fc says yeah well engage we think we can beat them with numbers here so your gang jumps in and engages the hostile gang after they jump on your skirmisher after a few minutes of fighting with the enemy gang local spikes as the bc gangs 40odd reinforcements arrive from further down the pipe your fc decides that the time is ripe to disengage so everyone in your gang deaggresses and starts back to the gateas it currently stands the logis can simply burn back and jump out with the rest of the fleet if the logis got a 60s timer for remote assistance though itd continually propagate back and forth between the logis via rr and cap transfer modules leaving them unable to tank or jump through the gate for a full 60s after the rest of the fleet is able to deaggress and they stop their remote repairs and capacitor chain this leaves them with two options try to scamper out of the bubbles and make it to a safe in jorund which leaves them split from the rest of the gang they are supposed to be supporting or do nothing and bite it because of broken game mechanics however if remote assistance gives the timer of the assisstee instead of a full 60 second timer then the logistics in this case would drop timer at the same time as the main fleet and be able to jump back to doril with everybody else instead of being stranded on the battlefield without any good options to deal with the situation in front of them
everything ive read about crimewatch has indicated that they would inherit the timer of the ship they are repping not get a fresh 60s timerthey also were quite specific that the the infinite aggression loop would be impossible
good to hear im glad that i can stuff my tinfoil hat off in a hangar somewhere then
in further thought on making faction warfare count and capsuleer actions actually matter i was pondering the followingi was thinking about the reduction of highsec stations idea maybe with the mighty fires of inferno and faction warfare just maybe capsuleers can have an impact what if faction warfare actually changed the sov and sec status of systems how about a few weeks of successful matar warfare actually made amamake into a 5 system and pushed the 43 status further toward amarr what if faction warfare squads could freely attack a standing highsec station and remove services that would eventually come back if the defending side came back to rep it i like the idea of faction warfare space changing and moving i also like the idea of highsec wenches needing to rep their 12 stations in system or go somewhere else in order to refine or repair nonfaction enlisted people might be enticed to join faction warfare if only to rep up a station that they need while nonenlisted they would still be afforded full concord protection but would also be unable to rep station services
but some fo the toughest armies historically ahve also come from areas where the only reason they go to war is ebcause they have no other way tog et resources that they needjust look at denmark russia most of their exapnsions historically were due to a dire need of reaching a aprticular resource whether that is stategic economic or geographic and fo course america who always si looking for mroe oil to sell the mining righst off to a european country so that they can buy their own oil off someone else
do you want to pay a billion isk for a hulk or a vagabondnothen dont remove the supply of tech
like i said they have more than enough resources and use the excess to obtain more
limited resources wouldnt be a bad idea at least putting an end to truly limitless resources like missions however the op doesnt contain an actual implementable proposal should have posted in fiwhat theres warsconflicts going on all the time in the real world and there has been since the dawn of civilization further more fighting over resources as the oper stated is a major driving factor for most of these wars

hmm i wonder if it is part of the logistics that a ship of a certain size just needs to be repackaged and re assembled when transportingand what stops it being the case that to move even more of these ships people just package them up and use this type of shipbut then it does add in multiple new career opportunities to the game not least full ship manufacture from grit to fit ready for sale although considering almost everyone ends up using the same fit so its not like you could be doing custom fits for specific game styles to give an edge would that worki think these things should be considered but when it comes to it it is down to ccp to figure the ins and outs and the balance and i like it enough so you get my support
this is utter nonsense thats like saying well threaded plumbing could never work because it would obviously just leak all over the place so solder is the only way to gothen someone calls you an idiot and hands you a roll of teflon tapeanything that might break up some of the monotony of the current alphacentric fleet paradigm warrants at least some consideration
valerie tessel wroteinterception physically block part of the shotlist defender missiles i fixed this for youthread
mallak azaria wrotevalerie tessel wroteinterception physically block part of the shotlist defender missiles i fixed this for youthread have a look through the threadthose only work against missiles this is about more than that granted making defender missiles worth using wouldnt be a bad thing this is about more than that though defender missiles will not lead to defensive play against hybrids lasers and projectiles reduction of alphacentric tactics positional play ie maneuver as a greater tactical component increased role for cheap disposable lowskill ships  modulesnot to mention that defender missiles only defend you if i recall correctly
really just stop whining and just learn how or join a corp there is no pig farming or boar hunting in this game if you planned to mindlessly farm there are other more suited mmos out there for you i earned my billions with the blood sweat and tears of lost ships all by myself with no corp have i been ganked yes lost hundreds of millions but looking back it was the best thing that happened to me and it taught me valuable lessons early on in my career here is a concept that may be foreign to you if coming to eve from main stream hack and slash mmos you will lose your ship everyone you will learn to balance risk vs rewards operating expenses vs profit if you dont youll leave the game eventually but not before you have filled the wallets of those who have learned to work the system here with your shattered remains of ships
haha notice how those who oppose such suggestions are always the gutless rats incapable of fighting a fair gun fight and so make themselves feel big by picking on the very people trying t help provide the very ships they fly and ammo they shoot in this that is supposed to be an economy driven gameless alt accounts might make the gankers appreciate the miners hard work to keep the chain of supply and demand going morei think it needs some refining of course but i support this they always bang on about balance when making updates but where is the balance for the industrialists it needs to change as said it doesnt matter your views on it the fact is this will only drive away new players and leave ccp with no income then you will have no game to gank in at alltheft is fine and is part of the game but i feel something like can flipping is more an exploit as i explain and make case for here
the above of course is a 2 month old nooblet who has no idea how this game works stop the evemail spam
i support this the game isnt balanced i should cost at least 30 of the price of the ganked ship to suicide gank someone because new players are important to low sec and 00 corps even when they start as miners we cant affort cheap ganking by players buying isk with dollars and push other players out of game highsec isnt secure but shoudnt neither be a playground for poeple dont be able to develop other combat strategies than ganking with destroyers
is that 30 of the cost of ganking a properly fitted tanked ship flown by an active pilot or 30 of a ship tanked only with an asteroid scanner cargo rigs and mlusif the former were already good if the latter then well we have a problemthe problem is that youre ridiculous
well lets see ive been ganked repeatedly build somewhere around half of my pvp ships with my industrial alt and even trained it into a hulk and ive only done a handful of ganks myself yet i fully support ganking in all its formsif you remove pvp from highsec exactly how can anyone disrupt the logistics of any nullsec alliance in any way with wardecs and ganks you can ruin your enemies day see for example test ganking a freighter with an outpost egg in it without them its asd simple as autopiloting a jump freighter from jita past the orphanage noir and all the other jita ganking guys past the swarms of tornados en route all the way to wherever you can jump straight into deep 00 from with literally zero riskthis is a game of risk and rewards and in highsec war and ganks are the only risks
i can see it now the popup coming with im sorry dave i cant let you do that dave youre not expensive enough dave
hi allyou can tank a hulk to 27k ehp eft warriors will know  it has the tech 2 resists and all that with that much tank it would take ships with modules more than the cost of a hulk to suicide it in that regard the field is leveleve does encourage greifing and things that outside the context of this game would be considered antisocial but they are part of this sandbox however im given to understand that ccp and the gms do take a dim view of greifing in the starter systemsthe mechanics of who can shoot what with regards to can flipping and the like can be confusing to newer people maybe this is something that could be made clearer to help newer players not become frustrated but i think the current mechanics do allow subtle games to be played which can be funthe easiest way to solo mine tbh is to get another subscription and have an industrial sat next to the mining shipand after that  the next safest thing to do would be to use a barge instead of an exhumer  as they are dirt cheap mining out your missions also gives an extra layer of protectioni dont think it is such a case that hulkageddon is winning rather that eve is winning because it can have a hulkageddonim an industrialist and have posted qq and raged before  but imho the mechanics do give you a subtle advantage that most people dont take advantage ofthanks
ha its oh so simple for all the rich btch irl players with no life and their multi accounts to sit and say this is what you need to do to get along but some of us dont just have money to throw away and yes we can join a corp and team up we do but that only covers maybe 75 of game play at most but there will always be times where e are left to our own devicesnow i agree pvp is an important part of the game and that there is always risks and suchbut seriously when did it become acceptable to pick on the little guy its utterly pathetic id like to say you wouldnt do it irl but i dont know your probably the type of people who would beat partners and children cos it makes you feel bigbut your not your crap you have simply played long enough to earn enough isk and train enough skills to fly these ganking ships and now you hide in high sec getting your little kicks hitting at the hard workers working to provide the materials you all need if you were actually any good truely had any skill you would p of and find a real fight more evenly matchedif the consensus is that ganking is fine then sure ill go with that ill watch my back and just try to get on but dont act like your the high and mighty for doing it if were playing it that way then accept your role you are the scum the lowest of the low of eve and nothing more
says the 2 month old toonwhere do you get off lecturing us stop the evemail spam
sorry if i offended you with my post it was prehaps not helpful to suggest you get a second account for the transport pilot the average age of an eve player is 32 and an eve subscription costs the same as two pints of beer in scotland  so i made a bad assumption and im sorrybut yes i too have been concerned that greifing is encouraged and rewarded by eve it is the same behaviour that would be seen as bullying outside of eve but eve is a game and it isnt personal i wouldnt and dont engage in greifing activities my in game persona is basically the same as my out of game one but in an fps where people shoot at one another the pvp there is not seen as greifingthere are simpler things to do to avoid problems there are lots of less populated systems which dont have many miners thus targets for gankers and where local will be quieter in these systems you will have a better heads up for incomming troubleotherwise  most missions contain asteroids you can mine why not take your stuff to one of these and clean them out after your missions suicide gankers are much less likly to scan someone down mining in a missions zone than to just warp to a beltalso  if you fit medium sheild extenders rigs a dcu a couple of invuls and then three i think medium sheild extenders  you hulk becomes quite tough  much tougher than suciciders in destroyers can easily take not saying they wont try or be happy to die in sufficent quantitiesalso  if mining is bothering you at the moment  try exploration there are some really cool things you can find in low population highsecstick with it though and take care
why would exhumers enjoy any sort of special casing in this regard if they were to do that this would have to extend to all t2 hulls which would be absolutely dumb
its not that you offended me not personally just that it gets frustrating that this suggestion always crops up lolnow im a student i dont have allot of money nor always allot of time to be on eve training everything up and earning mega isk i like to play in my spare time to just relax a while and have a chat with others and no i wouldnt complain about greifing in an fps but that is because an fps is specifically for fighting and killinghowever eve is an mmo rpg and a sandbox one at that that means its aimed at a wide base of players and fully intends to provide a rich variety of game play styles that includes both the fighting and killing side and the gathering and creating side what really gets me is that every point of development bangs on and on about balancing but this is only ever for military players where is the balance for newer players and miners getting blown up in high sec by ships that belong in low sec systems with adversaries of similar power and skill i use the word skill very lightly
less qq more pew pewadapt and overcome and you will survivefail to do so and youre ganker fodderi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i typed an answer it did not make it to the threadweirdim not typing it again
the problem with ganking is that you cant wrangle up some corpmates and have them help you outlet us fly ships that actively protect a friendly afterthefact repair is no good neither is buffing the hulk which only encourages solo play in an mmo give us aegis destroyers
100 agree there was a post by soundwave 23 years ago saying he wished they could do this some dayso as it allready has blue support this should really be pushed up again maybe the new carbonising of the game has gotten to a point where this is possible noweditthe pasrt that really boggles the mind is how they made warp speed implants and rigs when they dont even doing anything more or less as youve pointed out also a change in how ships warp should come with new speeds for every ship in game so that its not 45 times faster tarvel thats a bit much p maybe 25 times faster since if the system worked the way it should that would be enough
thanks for the support i hope now that ccp is adding significant consequences they do something to try to make plexing more of a pvp activity and less of a pve grind make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
this is very close to what i suggested replace local with an intel toolthe few changes id strongly suggest i think intel should automatically be shared with fleet members in system while having alliance members appear automatically im vehemently against blues appearing automaticly to explain why large bluefests have very little drawbacks however if having lots of blues means having lots of i dont instantly know you are friendly traffic the members within the bluefest region will typically become more complacent to unknown traffic resulting in easier pickings for the roaming gangs in short lots of friends means its harder to identify your enemies unless youre actually working together which is a very good thing
i dont know if youve been on many fast moving gankthelocal targets of opportunity style roams but 90 of the time the pveer gets caught in a belt anomaly or while traveling at a gate by the scout of a gang then the hostiles comes in and nukes them the majority of the time once your roaming gang lands the chances of survival for the target are almost zero once the hostiles catch a ship or two the locals typically safe up until you leave or ship up to chase you out of their area standing home defense fleets are rarely proactively setup and are almost always a reactionary force formed up to counter the hostile gang ie requiring several minutes to organize currently the most effective way to survive these roaming gangs is to avoid being caught once caught the second method to survive is to escape the tackler before the gang can arrive failing that you have to tank the gang until youre backup can survive and very few ships can survive even 4x af dps for more than 60 s
its pretty clear that he wouldnt want to link to the numerous numerous old threads because this idea is bad local allows small gang and solo pvpers the ability to avoid getting blobbed i mean we can go on and on with how bad delayed local is but some people are so intent on trying to gank pve ships they refuse to listen if you dont want local go to a wormhole but leave the other 90 of eve that prefers to live in a space with local alone make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
this here is a game of capitalist intentions those ore thieves as youd like to call them are simply reallocating resources away from bad projects to ones that have merit at the same time they employ economic means to keep you from interfering with their marketssilly peasant all is working as intended
yepnever said his idea was bad and it is to be honest but its mooti just said can mining is stupidand making changes to the game in that light is foolishthere are so many better ways to minewhy should we mess with the great sport of can thefti dont like itbut i get laughs and lols galore hearing about it stop the evemail spam
again if you read what ive been saying i dont want to stop can theft altogether and i accept thievery and criminality as a fair part of the gamemy thought was an entire stack would be tagged in some way not each indevidual piece of ore but of course then in spliting the stack all splits would need the tag but this i just as a base suggestion to help put across the ideaalso i get your concerns about how easily those working together could handle each others items but i see three points to this players working together even if having to steal each others items would do nothing about the agression flags given they would just ignore it players could always fleet and then simply as now they would be alowed to access each others cans and all stacks would instead have a fleet tag or somthing if ccp can already program for those im working with to share cans and ore with no penalty but for can flippers to be recognised as stealing then there must be some recognition of owner ship so it wouldnt be a great step to recognise what i own once its been moved and allow me to take it still as mine i see masses of tags tracking even just entire stacks might be a problem for game performance and i gues currently it is simply defined by the can itself hence taking my own stuff back is stealing but perhaps some sort of tag would only be applied at the point of theft the tag would then be removed again if the owner takes the items back the jet can they are placed in times out the items are sold on or used up so i think its plausible and just comes down to if for once people want balancing to involve industrialists also thank you kusum for your constructive points
it seems to me that jet can mining is the exploit and not the other way around the can in question is formed when you click on the word jettison usually when someone jettisons anything theyre throwing it out  and trash is free for all so sure it might not be great that you can get flipped but youre also mining into a container that was never intended to be used for ore storagetransfer and arguing to maintain rights to trash in some sense miners are the ones exploiting the system no it could just as easily be argued that you have given up your rights to rubbish in the bin this is doubly true if your complaint is based on a single player gamer trying to defend his right to abandon ore in space until he can switch ships to retrieve it which i hope isnt the case or your whole exploit theory is really shot lets face it trash bins werent ever intended to be used as a cargo transfer interfacefor my part id like to see eve implement cargo transporters to make the drop and grab from a trash bin obsoleteand no i dont want to see eve turn into sto if i wanted that id be asking for phasers and shuttlecraft too oh wait seriously though this is an idea in progress but i think it would be fair to both sides and to the cannon it might affect current game mechanics because there are so many people exploiting jetcans but it would still be more logical than having everyone mining into rubbish binson the one hand youd have the ability to transport ore directly into a sister ship but to do so youd have to drop shields i would expect some kind of visual effect that shows this has occured transporting would reduce noob can flipping which i agree can be annoying but it would also present a new risk to the mining vessel by temporarily lowering ehp and giving mercs a chance to gank as in all things eve risk vs rewardone drawback is that these cargo transporters would have to be an inherent property of all vessels to be fair  not just industrials just as all ships can now jettison cargo hulks arent going to give up a high slot but if this were so if a cruiser warps to a station and only needs ammo why dock just beam it up ccp can make the beaming process take 10 seconds or so thereby making it impractical for anything more than just one or two transfers docking would still be more efficient for loading mutiple item types but you wouldnt have to dock in every single instance you dont dock to retrieve ammo from a cha it could even make 12 item cargo runs to low sec more accessible to carebears and isnt increasing lowsec traffic a common refrainto help facilitate the change id suggest a nerf to the current volume of jetcans altogether at minimum id like to see jetcans directly proportional to the size of the cargobay of the ship creating them this should have happened a long time ago imo it makes no sense whatsoever that a frigate with 100m3 of cargo space can create an object that can hold 20x that amount where did it come from and if people were opposed or in a really safe system they still wouldnt have to use transporting but in other instances it could be valuable for example it could allow two people not in the same corp to work together on a onetime mining op without generating an aggression timer another potential bonus could be that transfer distance from an orca could be increased to the maximum transporting range  say 20km or so probably not what you were hoping for but for now thats what ive got just wanted to stir the pot since i was in the kitchenyonis kador
i agree it could well be argued and argue i shall haha please show me the point in any description that says a jetcan is a bin that any items within must be unwantedthere is an option built in to abandon wrecks and jetcans where the content is not wanted is viewed as rubbish but other wise it is treated as the players property that can be stolen i feel this completely negates your point on a jet can only being for trash items as were this the case the items within and the jet can would automatically be treated as abandoned and all contents would be truly free for all to take now if that were the case then the problem i propose to solve would not exist at all as those flipped would be as free to take back their items as the person trying to steal them so as this is clearly not the case id suggest in fact that jetcans are precisely intended for transferas such i feel my point still stands and again i repeat this is not about preventing theft only about ensuring players do it properly and in doing so evening the odds creating balance between players if some one wants to steal my stuff properly they need the right tool a hauler in order to grab as much as they can before i have the chance to counter them they would have to smash and grab as the risk would be i am actually able to chase them down and serve my justicepeople keep saying its all about risk vs reward but all the risk here is on the side of the miner and none for the thief i stress this is about balance and encouraging a greater depth of interaction between players playing these roles but as it stands it is a totally out gunned process which is as much about mindless destruction as it is taking the items this can not be denied as were it not the case they would not turn up in battle ships to leave my gods sat in space for half hour no if it wasnt the case they would just as i suggest be turning up in a hauler and taking the lot and getting lost right awayactually this is what i want a good constructive point against me and of course i will argue against you but so long as i can stand my ground it can only help my point if not i would accept my idea was not valid but as yet that is for others to read the points and decidebut so thank you i appreciate your input
holy wall of text batman thats a lot of words for a small conceptaside for the added database load of tracking owners of stacks this is a bad idea simply because of all the possible scenarios you arent thinking of youre making a proposal based solely on a single situation someone canflips a miner and leaves a jetcan to bait themhold the stolen goods until a hauler can arrive if something like this idea went live wed have a very long list of why it was a really bad idea within three days
really i dont see as it should make that greater difference in most areas its just about saying we have already recognized this was just stolen from you and now we recognize your free to take it back if they now choose to leave it laying aboutas ive said at most tags would only need to track entire stacks not individual items that make them up and these could only be applied to stacks at the point of theft so reducing greatly the amount of tracking needed at any one time but also this is just a base idea to get across the concept of ownership recognition perhaps as yonis suggested it is a can should just be recognized off the bat as abandoned so of course while people would be free to take the items if they moved it to their own can you would be free to take it back and thus no extra database load but also no retribution for taking back what you worked for hours for
and lookie here another thread full of carebear emorage looks like i need to get a couple more catalysts and thrashers sold for the good of the cluster hey at least theyre just stealing your  and not violencing your boat a la suicide gank and to be honest theyre mining more efficiently than you are as theyre having you do all of the grunt work for them meanwhile they can just haul it awayi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
go the other way how do you know its yours its in your possession its not whoops it must not be yours anymorecan flipping is annoying because eve offers just enough of a figleaf implementation of property to make new players think that it actually knows what property is in a realworld sense might as well just jetcan the whole idea and fall back on a simple intuitive rule its yours if you have it if you want to keep it protect it or take your chances
this isnt carebear emorage lol im not enraged leave the house to often and enjoy life to much and want pvpno this is just an idea something i feel would still provide pvp opportunities in high sec but they would have more balance balance being that thing that is strictly adhered to where fighter v fighter is concerned cos all you pew pew guys qq if you dont think your gun does quite so much dps as the next race and what everand besides ive already said if the consensus is that people cant have the guts to fight a fair fight and they are set on massaging their egos and making themselves feel big cos they can one shot the little guys in high sec thats fine ill accept it and play with that in mindbut i just thought no harm in bringing it to the table and hoped i might actually get a few more constructive intelligent answers whether it be in support or against the idea
i love the moa  and it looks like a 1980s handycam  and would support the kestrel getting another slot cheers
what in the name of
mining is pvp as well you compete with other players for the rocks so therefore its pvp you really want mining removed from highsectrading is also pvp the entire market is one big battlefield where people constantly compete for the best prices your suggestion would remove all kinds of trade from highsec toobasically you want to make highsec nothing but flying around in a ship not interacting with anything
posting in a not so stealthy i want pointless eve lite threadnot supported
hahahahahahahanopehello kitty online is thataway 
no just noalso never post againplease for the love of humanityin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
no no no they just dont want can flipping ganking and wars in highsec that way they can play eve in coop mode they dont care about the markets or any other pvp type theyre only concerned with combat and not losing their stuff
so what youre saying is theyre a bunch of little esi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
eve is a game that revolves around pvp you can even call marketing a more tame version of pvp since youre competing against other playersyou dont want pvp in hisec ok then youll find your markets in lowsec  00
a mod that allows you to connect to other paid for accounts and effeciotiely use your other toons as drones activation you activate the mod then a link to account box comes up were you have to put in teh username and pass of teh account you want to link to and choose the character to link to multiple accounts you just click the mod again rinse and repeat interfacethe interfacfe at least to start with could be pretty simple liek controlling drones a few simple commands would be enough such as follow me orbit me flee warp to a random planetmoonstation attack etc benefits  this would encourage more players to start 2nd or 3rd accounts  would be an enjoyable feature that would go a good way towards stopping constant screen switching  wouldnt make anyone op because the alts would just be like drones thus die far easier than an actual player piloted ship that can think on his feet negatives that i can seemay be difficult to implement properly and would likely result in alt accounts being more useful though dying a lot more
its been mentioned before and fairly severely shot down while it sounds handy and cool it would be an absolute nightmare to even think about programming such a system besides that the only people who would really want such a thing is people whose computers cant handle multiple eve clients since an ai controlling your other account and following you around would only really give you about 1 of the functionality itd be mostly useful for an orcafreighterboosting alt almost everything else would really need so much more control
what is the advantage to this over just having two clients open or using something like isboxer
ummm embrace the mmo team up with real people dont be alone  hahaor yea multi client if your comp cant handle that dont waste money on multi accounts
selfdestructing the egg after a ship loss when a huge fleet figh is ongoing is common because of the bubbles at the gates but when tidi is active it takes more than 15 min and often nobody shoots you because the action is more than 100km away this is annoying so i propose to take the selfdestruct timer out of tidi like the pos anchor timer
supported but only for pods it shouldnt help out people who self destruct just to avoid being on a killmail
i support the extension of my proposal the purpose is just to get a new ship elsewhere the fear of reshipping is unrealistic because its for single pilots unlikely to get into a tidi system and when they are able to reship and are back in fight congratulationsits more fun for all when we are able to get out of a tidi system with an egg
supportedminus the tidi shirt ok ok bad pun but only for pods stop the evemail spam
sorry not supportedtake this scenario your in a big fleet fight and youve just exploded at maximum tidi inside a bubble so you cant warp everything is really really really slow you realize you were really really stupid and have some really really expensive implants on you you weigh up the pros and cons and decide you dont want to feed your enemies killboard you hit self destruct and because your in max tidi you die well before anyone can lock and shoot you i know this is a potentially small problem but i think going afk for 15 minutes whilst you wait for your pod to explode is a small problem so the thing is i dont want to take up developer time swapping one small problem for anotherin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
kb is the biggest blight to greet eve arbitrary mechanics created purely for the purpose of kbwhoring at the expense of gameplay warrants no merit 1
as a very common pilot i dont have implants and most of my mates dont have them as well some pilots have like triage carrier pilots but they have different problems and egg from titan pilots will be excuted immediatly so i dont see any problem with the exception of beeing idle for a long time pls support
being held hostage for 15 minutes if your in your pod and your about to dienot justifable enough to be honestyour gonna dielet the man sd and get back into the gamein big fights people are likely going after the next ship and not the next pod unless they are slinging space bombs or smart bombsif anything one less player on grid would speed up the server stop the evemail spam
this this this and this
i started this on the eve general discussion forum here seeing what kind of response i would get i got alot of interesting ideas tweaking on this and now i want to get more attention for this and see what folks would say within here quite a few folks feel it is a good idea so here goes1 war targets under fire are not able to dock into the station2 disengaging from battle this is known to happen but should take longer then the 1 minute lets go for 53 kicked out from station 30km would be a cluster  so its not hard to do a random range when undocking so lets go 1530km keep the undock speed of the ship the same and this should limit the cluster of ships or roulette if ccp reskins the stations with multiple exitsentrancei know it was mentioned earlier in the discussion about the freighters jump freighters and the like should remain able to dock as it is with the normal set up ccp has right nowunless your a war target then you deserve to get blown upanother idea that i saw in my thread that someone mentionedits an idea thinking that hearing so many people like it and that would help bring about a more unique war style along with what is already out there of forcing people to commit to a fight or hide this will not only affect empire space but would also affect low sec and null sec space commitment thats what its all aboutalso empire folks would love to see crime watch come out today but i doubt it will happen
id love to see crime watch released to sisi todaythats not something i want to see rushed on to tq
so im thinking that bombers are a pretty well used tactic and used correctly can obliterate large fleets fairly quickly even when you are fit correctly due to the massive dps these put outseems a little unbalance dont you think that say 10 bombers can take out 30 ships quite quicklyso i thinking perhaps we can offer some kind of protection and introduce shield bubbles that can inly be used with hictors and dictorsthese will effectively act a shield bubble around ships the bubbles shouldnt be totally indestructable and have the same hp same time length and distance as normal bubbles do now so you can still knock them out so to speak this just gives that unexpecting fleet a bit of a chance of survival and would add another level of gameplay and warfare tacticsgraphically would also look quite cool with ammo and missiles bouncing off them editall i propose is to level the playing field a little however i do completely understand that in small gang roams and even solo this could cause an imbalance effectively having a shield around your gang good make a hugh advantage from this point yes i agreeso i propose to change the idea a littleshield bubbles should have a max flight time of 10 seconds can only be used every 120swith this it could offer an interesting new tactic for small gangs and give that solo guy a bit of a chance when gankedrgds
not supportedbombers maybe powerful but bombing is more of an art than a science ive seen far far more failed ohmygodwegotslaughteredfornothing runs and sad bomber killmails than successful bomb runs on fleets plus the idea of dictor deployable shield bubbles would im sure cause no end of balance problems
this would be true like last year but bombing runs have become alot more effective has people know how to do it better and more effectively now tbh even if you failed you still have a very good chance of hitting a large fleet and cuasing considerable damagedont agree with the balance issue i think its pretty unbalanced with bombers a group of very cheap ships can take out a large group of expensive ships very easily ok some bombers may fail and get caught but what do they lose a few million isk shipcompared to the isk ratio its a big unbalanceyou can have a fleet of 200 ships and have 3 bomber fleets going 10 bombers per fleet which could when staggered destroy this fleet in minutes literally something wrong there theres the imbalance you speak offall i propose is to level the playing field a little however i do completely understand that in small gang roams and even solo this could cause an imbalance effectively having a shield around your gang good make a hugh advantage from this point yes i agreeso i propose to change the idea alittleshield bubbles should have a max deployment time of 10 seconds can only be used every 120swith this it could offer an interesting new tactic for small gangs and give that solo guy a bit of a change when ganked
just as bombers take practice and mastery to be effective it should take at least a bit of effort to defend against them not just hitting f1 and becoming invulnerablethere are so many counters to bombers today that a succesful bombing run is much more often due to the fleet being bombed making a mistake than due to the bomber fleet doing everything right
well for one thing three waves of ten bombers wouldnt actually work the bombs would kill eachotherbombers only work if you know what youre doing i have also seen far more failed runs than successful ones but even a bad bomber fc will keep a fleet on its toes bombers are fine as they are
noit sure i can agree in whole bombers also have the element of surprise by being cloaked you cant counter for that
i did say staggered so they wouldnt be bombing at the same time probably 30 seconds after each run i never said anytnign was wrong with bombers i am just suggesting a counter balance becuase they are overpowered in a group of 1020 bombers
heres an ideapost with your mainotherwise walk awaybecause its obvious your crying over getting owned by a bomberstealth bombers are not overpoweredbecause you dont know how to deal with themstop changing the game to suit your needs stop the evemail spam
three staggered waves of ten wont work either theyll still kill eachotherand swarms of bombers like that are not overpowered you still need a decnet bomber fc for them or youre not going to do anything ive seen everything from bombs going to wrong way to mixed bomb types incinerating eachother to warping straight into a bubble far more often than ive seen a decent bomb run decimate a fleet properly led theyre a thorn in the side of a bs or bc fleet led by idiots they die like flies
oh look a thread screaming abloo bloo bloo i got killed by bombers nerf themwould you like some cheese to go with your whine or are you so injured emotionally that you need a waaaahmbulancebombers are not overpowered and your tarded idea would break game mechanicsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
hahah what an absolute idiot you are drake this is why you are the biggest waste of space and troll on these forums with nothing better to do but insult people gtfo get a life get laidfor your information i live in low sec lmao oh but sorry i cant have an opinion on the game in other areas according to you what a twt you are
id rather see something like remote shield extenders than a bubble theyd have a cycle time where say 25 of the time they are recovering their affect simply acts as a straight increase to the shield strength of the target
people have been asking for mechanics to counter the blob for years now you want to take away one of the few things that effectively counters a large fleetoh yeah a supersensorbooster artilleryfit muninntornadotempest or three will make very short work of bombersbeing spread out helps tooi once heard of an interceptor intercepting a wave of bombs using a rack of small smartbombs though that one does sound a bit far fetchedone last thing this idea you are proposing will have far reaching consequences for 00 pvp in general it will not be used strictly against bombers and fleets will try to bring as many of these bubbles as they can to safeguard logistics and other critical ships making fleet battles more of a grind than they already are
do you in real life carry all your money with your constantly if you do i would like to find you in a dark alley
first off i want to say that i was against the station lock outs and the new plexing system because i thought it would stagnate the battlefront and turn fw into a bigger farmfest than it was with just missions in some regard it has as ive run across many plex farmers that run at first sign of combat even still the plex farmers are now at the very least helping the war effortat this point i think ccp should hold off on any major changes for at least 6 months and see where things stand as it progresses a bit further because we are seeing a big increase in fighting  activity perhaps a wait and see approach may be best option for the short termi do however want to share a few ideasproposals on what i think could fine tune the current systemsystem upgrades plex tax  defensive plexing rewardsright now system upgrades are far too hard to keep and ccp needs to remember that fw has militias that are made up of many random individuals corps  now alliances however there is no ability or system that allows anyone to have authority over them aside from making space hitlers with power to control each militia which im against ccp should just work this into the system upgrades game mechanics and understand its just impossible for us to get everyone to work together much less spend their lps willingly on system upgradesi would like to suggest adding a plexing tax that automatically takes a small percentage of the lps rewarded for offensive plexing and puts that lp into a random systems control bunker for upgrading it optional set up could take the lps and automatically put them into the system with the lowest upgrade leveldefending plexes should also have some sort of reward but perhaps not a direct lp to pilot reward right now everyone is just hitting offensive plexes because they are the only ones that pay and its leaves the defense grinding of plexes to those few hardcores that take the hit for the teamthese guys defending should get some reward or they will burn out at the very least know that what they are doing is helping their militia more than just decontesting a system so some farmer can go contest it again my suggestion is to reward a small amount of lp to defense perhaps 50 of that given to offensive but then place the other 50 toward upgrading that systems control bunkerthere should be a built in cap that limits the amount the plexing tax can upgrade each system to stop each militia from having level 4s  v and extremely cheap ships in the lp store i would suggest capping the upgrades at level 2 or 3 from taxes and in order to move to level 4 or 5 should require investment by the players using their lpsbugs  abuse of bad game mechanicsthere are various plexing bugs that can be deliberately recreated in order to cause plexes to not spawn these bugs have to be fixed end of story i know they have been reported to ccp but you must act on them because it creates a unfair playing field for those of us that dont stoop down to that level im not a expert on plexing but i know there is 1 bug that is triggered by combat on the plex button and i believe there is also a way to stop the spawning by staying slightly off grid and or cloaking the combat bug must be fixed  the others ruled an exploit once a plex has been completed the fight for that plex should be considered over and it should always despawn allowing a new one to spawn any sort of triggering to stop this basic intended game mechanic should be petitionable and ruled a exploit resulting in a ban for those caught abusing the bugsi have other thoughts  ideas but this is already getting to long so i will leave it at these for now
defensive plexing absolutely needs some sort of reward and there needs to be negative consequences besides loss of the bonuses for losing upgrade tiers
the problem is that no reward for defensive plexing was ccps way to ensure that the winning side cannot totally win maybe something like you only get 50 of the ops for defending your factions original space but no lp for defending conquered space either way they will have to add something else to make sure fw remains a fairly even fight as long as both sides are trying
there is a reward for defending plexes it is that you keep the lp that is used to upgrade the system and if you dont think that is reward enough just go grind l4s you isk grubbing whiner
the lack of lp for defensive plexing is basically the only thing that might actually balance this system and allow a war that starts as lopsided as the minmatar amarr war to actually turn around short of some large alliance joining with the 16x multiplier the winning sides lp is going to be worth much more than losing sides if defensive plexing were paid even 25 what offensive plexing paid then the defensive plexing would probably in effect pay more than offensivemake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve

single shardits one of ccps major advertising points wtf possesses you people to think they would ever abandon that idea
to the op edit actually it reads a bit patronising sorry  i guess you are probably more experienced than this  but this might help newer people  doing pi and exploration in losec has recently become a favourite of mine and this is my experience  like i say  im rubbish at pvp but dont die like all the time in lo  the risk reward might just be okhi there i totally understand where you are comming from but if i might sugegst that there is more protection than what you think in the existing game mechanics for people wanting to travel into losec and then beyond1 with the reduction of session timers it is now quite possible to ab or uwarp back out through your gate should you find yourself looking at a gate camp2 take time to look around if you are in a camp while your cloak holds what ships do they have is there a good allign to a celestial or are you best to head back to the gate3 if theyve fired at you they cant jump through after you use that to get away4 the roads have regional jump gates that are massive and as such you are likly going to be quite some distance from any campers use you cloack time to work out an exit strategy5 once you are jumping to a varying distance from belts celestials pocos  etc you are very hard to get6 jump to celestials near a gate you want to use if local chat is full of enemies and then dscan the gate to see if it is safe remember  a fast frigate is very difficulty for a gate camp to take out  by virtue of its small sig radius and the small time it takes to alligntry moving through losec in a small cheap ship  use a jump clone to protect your expensive implants and youll find that this cat and mouse game can be quite good fun also  try a fight remember that a gate camper  small group will have fittings specific to their roles  you might well be able to get a kill especially if the weaker tackle ships can be picked offwatch eveiseasy videos or any of the other tutorialsdont fly a ship that will hurt your budget if you lose it  and spend some time in your local losec  learn whos whatim no great pvp expert  just look at my kill boards and youll see im rubbish but take heart  i fly through lo a lot and dont get blown up that often  and i am rubbish at pvptake care

i get what youre aiming at here but this idea has been brought up many times in the past  shot down each  every timelets say you have 2 blob fleets facing each other both completely protected by these aegis destroyers both fleets need smaller ships to kill the ship creating big shield preventing all incomming damage smaller ships race toward said aegis destroyer out of the protection of their own the small ships on both side get alphad the result 2 blob fleets are still facing each other  the only damage happening was on some cheap frigatesim not denying that its a cool idea in theory but cool theories often dont work out in this game
the difference here is that these destroyers should never be able to provide complete protection sniping destroyers could fire from protection to tear a hole in coverage have a read through the countering tactics post on page 2 linked from initial posttheres no big shield with these things as protection requires targeting a friendly and dedicating a module to it and they cant shield against small stuff presumably the big alpha is coming from cruisers and battleships which would also have trouble hitting frigates clouds of drones might prevent frigates from penetrating but the drones are vulnerable tooif its a good idea the balancing can be worked out and not necessarily by us here in this thread this thread asks that the proposal be put to the csm and brought up for discussion with ccp if you like the notion support it do critique it do help refine it but please support it
i can tell you the thoughts suggestions i havefirstly though a caveatyou have to read this with a thought to how this would work in the real world ingame story line of eve to our characters the world of eve is not a computer game with mechanics it is their real lives where they mine sleep eat make love fight flee work and steal concord and the empire navies are there to make sure that those that break the law would be punished which would likely mean something more severe than losing your ship you cant read this thinking oh i dont like this simply because it would make things harder for my pirate character too bad in eve just as in the real world a life of crime would have consequences these would be conceived by the governments police navies and other law enforcement agencies of the in game in character story line world of eve in terms other than game mechanics such as gcc gate negative sec status etc firstly1 yes transferrable kill rights are a very good idea thats the way bounties work in real lifethe fact that there is a bounty on someones head means they are too dangerous for the average person to handle so the authorities need to place a cash reward for a kill or capture the way i would do it is this lets say blackbeard the two year old pirate ganks marty the miner a newer player marty now has kill rights but not the skillpoints to take care of that pirate himself so the kill rights are useless to him now instead of paying a bounty on the pirate which the pirate will collect marty now has the option to file a complaint with the npc ded corporation ie the poiice for a small fee like a war dec is bribing concord when ded collects enough of these killrights along with the filing fees they start reassigning them through their agents to a registered bounty hunter player pilot ded is the already existing in game npc corporation that is supposed to be focusing their energy and efforts on the worst of the worst pirates in game of course they really do nothing except hand out missions for aspiring ded bounty hunter agents could be included in every station that has that bounty hunter button with each tranferrable kill right being assigned through a ded agent it wont be a random assignment there would probably be a way to match skill point levels of target and bounty or levels of danger risk displayed to become a bounty hunter you would have to grind your standings with ded to a high enough point that you would be registered or get a license this would involve hunting down some npc pirates in deadspace missions 1 through 5 before the ded agent would start assigning you kill rights those people who are truly dedicated to being bounty hunters would be willing to do this but a pirate would be unlikely to do with with an alt just to collect their own bounty the bounty amount would be an amount fixed by ded most likely something tied to skillpoints you would also get lp points and stores for both bounty hunter missions and player kills the target bounty would have no way of knowing how much the bounty on them was neither would anyone else only the wanted sign would appear on their profile it might be possible that a registered licensed bounty hunter could still see the bounty amount to allow for opportunistic kills i would also suggest that if a pirate with a bounty gets podded they lose their rights to use the legal cloning vats yes i know pirates wont like this restriction but it makes in game sense if you are a criminal wanted dead or alive by the police you are shot dead in space and if they know where all your clones are dont you think those inanimate stationary clones would either be arrested or destroyed before the pirate got podded if we discovered the exact location where clones of a condemned criminal were being grown dont you think the police would realistically seek out and destroy those clones there are of course already illegal clone vats in the game pirates with a bounty on them would be restricted to using this handful of illegal untraced cloning facilities or possibly one in a cap ship these illegal cloning facilities could all be placed in low sec or null sec or somewhere else slightly inconvenient i would even suggest their clones could reanimate already arrested in a prison system or penal colony the world of eve is a real place remember ded and concord arent computer controlled rats they are actual thinking human people who would formulate a rational logical plan to kill or capture those with a bounty im imagining something like an npc station that has factories and a refining centre with bpcs for mining ships and modules so the pirates would have to mine refine and build their own ships kind of like building your own shiv in prison pirates could raise their sec status by killing each other it would also be possible to do stuff like make drugs meet other pirates and so on this limited access deadend system would have its jumpgate entrance guarded by powerful but destructible rats like navy for things like jailbreaks and so on pirates could use their alts to haul things in and out of the system it should be a challenge but not impossible to escape from the prison system what i am also thinking though is that the pirates would have their own version of the bounty system the marked system while you can place a bounty on a low standings player through ded you can place a hit contract on another player though an npc pirate corp grind standings with a pirate corp to become registered as a hitman or assassin then you will be able to access assassination contracts against other players same deal as with the bounty hunters just on the other side of the law
well its a well thought out idea i give you that but like i have said before in other threads i hate getting npcs involved in new features why make an npc do something a player can do there are some issues aswellthe restriction of the cloning vats for pirates is daft though eve isnt like the real world where the police get a degree of respect from official establishments in eve the corporations rule if a corporation wants to let a pirate have a clone bay somewhere they arnt going to stop doing it just because the ded say so the corporations regularly go behind each others back their sovereigns back concords back deds backs so from your lore perspective that doesnt make sense also in the game lore ded dont concern themselves with pod pilot affairs unless they absolutely have to and if they do they are encroaching on concords territoryfrom a computer game perspective probably more important than a lore perspective in most instances i would say its unrealistically restrictive especially with the whol prison system which is even more restrictive and isnt fun for anyone there is also the issue that you want to make people who want to be bounty hunters run missions to be able to do it so the people who dont want to pvp carebears are going to be the only people with access to the system and the people who will want to do it pvpers will be forces to run missions which they probably dont want to do in the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
you were much nicer about that than i was going to be
1 for the opfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
lol this no idea why it was removed to begin with
its called pay attention to your environment and dont afk mine stop the evemail spam
make everywhere null sec but because that will not be happening find your self a corp that operates out in null sec and either join up or join their alliance operate in their space and you will find the protection youve been asking foryou cant trust an ai concord to protect you ever its almost laughable as your finding outnull sec is a lot more peaceful then you think and at the brutally calculating but brilliant same time it can be hell that indifference is simply the most exhilarating feeling of why didnt i come out to null sec sooner more simply put lose your ship to a ganker due to bad ai mechanics or lose your ship to a player armada but another player armada had your back at the time
what is so damned hard about paying attention to localnot mining whilst asleepand using a little common sense when living in high secare you people brain damaged or something stop the evemail spam
what is the 25 that you cant do
no because you have forgotten most suicide attacks on hulks are not 1 ship vs 1 ship it is multiple cheap destroyers vs hulk and the attackers always win unless they are stupid quite simply we have goons encouraging bad game mechanics to be used to force new and social orientated players out of the game not good enough either the mining ships need to be toughened up so you need to actually have some brains to kill them maybe 60 resist hull of 30000 points on a hulk etc or even better if ccp can sort their crap out the bounty system and security system being fixed there is no real risk to gankers that is the critical issue people keep talking about risk vs reward  but the gankers have no real risk they only attack if they are certain of victory and noone can do anything about them the only thing that hulkageddon has done so far is to encourage people to quit and to see new things invented like suicide alts who summon concord to the mining belt before the hulks come out so that the concord response is instant broken systems leading to nearexploits to counter the broken systems is simply rubbish  there need to be design fixes fastand yes if you dont provide good ideas then i think ccp should go with the suggestion above im sorry dave i cant let you do that
i have to say i agree fully with grace ishukone i usually run 3 accounts while mining but for the last two months ive been only keeping my main online and now that i want back into the game im waiting til hulkageddon is over ive also noticed that since the last time ive played ive been checking in alot lately rather impatiently waiting for the end of this crap that the avg number of players online appears to have dropped by about 25 used to be about 25 to 27 thousand online at any given time except right after resets now i rarely see more then 20k on i have no doubt this is because of many of these issues and just as grace ishukone said what risk do gankers have they complain about us hs players making bank running incursion missions in which we could easily lose a 350 million dollar raven if support and repair doesnt back up our tank a fight requiring teamwork just to stay alive and then they turn around and use cheap ships to take out mostly helpless unarmed mining ships and reap the profit of work they didnt do or target supply ships going in and out of jita carrying 100 times what there lil tin can is worth with us shippers having really no way whatsoever to counter such tactics other then simply not flying at all hows that a balanced risk vs reward ratio exactlysomeone suicides a worthless ship over there so a couple can suicide there worthless ships over here pop a defenseless minertransport and steal his valuable cargo     this could be considered teamwork but a ship meant to be lost when its lost is not a loss thats like counting a missile as a loss when it explodes its doing what its supposed to just like the suicide ships are doing what there supposed to so ultimately 0 risk  moderate to massive reward  ganking then they use these rewards to buy themselves ships to use in null and wh space that nobody else can stand up to why because were busy replacing the hulks and orcas we lost trying to make enough money to buy our own t2 and t3 ships and equip them which will never happen cus we keep getting ganked by suicide ships or worse the t3 super ships that are strong enough to pop you in 1 shot and then warp off just as concord shows up your an idiot if you think thats not possible ive seen it done to my mining ops and i think its friggin bullshit
my post got messed up  i cant be bothered typing it all out again
whati wish people would read and think before they pose weird questions and make pointsim referring to time not physical activity what only covers 75 of time playing is teaming up with people in a corp you see its all there in that one sentance but there will always be times where we are left to our own devices ergo refering to the remainder of the time spent playing the 25 you question as being solo playok just to be clear 75 team play   100 of time spent playing 25 solo play
maybe you should pay better attention to just who posted said question stop the evemail spam
the way you phrased your op made it sound like there where aspects of gameplay that could only be done with an alt if you are finding that your corp has noone online for large chunks of your playtime then thats a seperate issue
im starting to see people talking about this issue everywhere now its started leaking into other parts of the forum in game local chat and the eve facebook page this is obviously an issue people feel strongly about and i fear most are dismissing it for too readily yes the ideas people are creating to reduce the amount of suicide ganking are frankly terrible but you should be trying to think up more subtle changes that are more in tune with eve rather than just trolling so far you guys have just been arguing in here about grammar and petty comments made against each other not very productive i have to sayalthough i fear im repeating myself here i think there is a relatively easy way to fix this as a problem not by removing suicide ganking because im pro choice but by creating greater consequences for suicide gankersduring fanfest ccp mentioned that they are going to be changing the the way crimewatch and the security status system works but more specifically they said they want players to only be able to go down to 5 for normal criminal acts and only go below for suicide ganking or killing pods there may also have been mention of not having police intervention for people entering highsec until below 5 as well i propose the following 2 extra changes on top of the ones above that ccp have been talking about suicide ganking results in greater sec status loss gcc and outlaw flagged characters pods are destroyable without concord interventionso now suicide gankers can still gank if they wish and they will still be able to gank in highsec near lowsec bounties they have always been more dangerous and frankly they should be but it restricts their movements deap into highsec because they can lose their ship and then lose their pod and end up back in lowsec sure they can use implantless clones but it adds another level of subtle protection and its not strictly mollycoddling miners its just making the game harsher eve isnt about protecting players its about stealing other players cookies i believe a change like this would be more of the latter than the formerin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
just for future when you hit post and it goes blank go to the reply bit again it should pop up a little message saying it has this draft saved of your message and as to the previouse two posts  thank you  finally some sense being spoken not just pew pew guys coming in here ranting on trying to push us down to maintain there utterly gutless tacticswhat you guys have said is precisely the point i have been trying to get across to its supposed to be a sandbox game with many different roles and miners should be free to play a mining role without having to be military experts as well as i have continually said ccps main policy is balance and yet there is no balance for industrialists we are being pushed out of the game by players who have no real interest in playing an rpg and sandbox game for what it is and as it should be playedi honestly i couldnt say any more again this is precisely what ive been trying to get across and i can only agree with everything that you both have said
i like your ideas and perhaps it should be more subtlebut the fact is high sec is supposed to be low risk and before anyone starts crying im not asking for no risk but it should be low yes it should because other wise ccp would not have made a gradient of sec statuses at all the gradient from high to low to nul is supposed to indicate the varying levels of risk but as it stands the risk in high sec is far too highthe only suggestion i have made on this matter before was with regards to can flipping that being that if a theft from you can be recognized in order to flag another player then it should not be a great leap to recognize those items as yours and allow you to take them with no consequence no matter where they reside so long as that place is accessible to youthe entire point of this idea was simply to suggest something that would create more balance in game play those who want to steal would have to use the proper tools for the job such as a hauler to grab a large amount less i simply take my haul away before they get a hauler there yet as it currently stands they can leave our goods in their own cans for half hour while we are powerless to ever attempt to get them back furthermore to this point is that if they had to use proper tools in order to get away with stealing large worth while amounts they would now be in a hauler not an over the top fighting vessel so solo or group miners would be afforded the opportunity to chase them down and destroy them while they are in a relatively defenseless ship and with no consequence for doing so due to the aggression flag they picked up when stealing that players items now that would be true risk vs reward and far more balanced game playnow im not saying this is a great idea and perhaps it is not truely workable but at least it is in the right direction
a word about the new sec status system all of you high sec miners will be happywhen i understood right when you shooting a flashy 10 you will get some plus points like 5 or 10 so when you have a flashy low sp alt you shoot him twice and you will be cleaned for crimes this is going to be fun

your definition of high security space is incredabily delusional i suspect someone will be along to prove that fact at this rate stop the evemail spam
no im fully aware of what high sec space is like at the moment but my definition is based on what ccp and the tools they implement suggest it should beok drake im going to spell it out for you nice and clear because you really need to stop acting as though people with the same sort of views as me are wrongneither you or i are wrong at this pointwhat it comes down to is weather over all players decide they want a purely pro friendly game with very few new players entering which personally i only see leading to stagnation and collapseorwhether over all players decide they want a full sandbox rpg that encompasses all levels of difficulty and security as such providing a much more low risk high security areas that enable new players to grow more easily and so keeps the game fresh
you have only played this game for less than 3 monthsand you think you have any relevant idea as to what its supposed to beyour the new kidyour the noobyou have only just begun your journey into the dark world of eve and you think your an expert nowget this straight noobhigh security space is supposed to be safer not safeit is not a place where you can prance around and mine without fear or concernwhen you have played for over a yearthen you can make your argumentsnot until thenand im not talking in general im talking about when you discover war decsliteral pvpliving in low sec and nullsecetcetcetcwhen you learn its not about fairness and a matter of tacticspracticeexperincethen you will be a far better posisiton to discuss balanceeve is not faireve is eve onlineperiod stop the evemail spam

i disagreeeve online takes at least 6 months at best to at least get a good understanding of many basic conceptspeople assume after playing a mount or two they know everything and how it worksthis isnt the case arguably longerim not saying i wont hear good ideasbut i have yet to see one bloody good thing from this noob ever since he started prattleing off about can flippers and fair fightam i being prejudiced yes until such time he actually has a rational sane point that doesnt break game mechanics stop the evemail spam
1 here ofc you know you are talking to a rock when you are trying to explain this to themfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
what other mechanics are there to learn taken that the 3 month character or 6 month character however old he was had a hulk and had the notion of being able to fly the ship out to the belt and mine and also most likely ability use drones to shoot at the tiny belt rats which would indicate his ability to target things hostileyet players with even greater game experience think up even dumber ideas at least in your eyespeople know pvp exists in this game it isnt the end all be all of this game theres an overwhelming amount of pve content in eve which amazingly enough people get their kicks out of1 anomolies2 ded sites3 wormhole sites4 mining5 manufacturing6 hacking sites7 incursions8 missions9 cosmos missions10 salvaging11 sites with escalations12 incursions13 epic arcsplaying the market i think is suggested as a pvp activity so not sure if that would be included as a pve aspectheck even pvp content is pve1 shooting pos2 shooting ihubs or sbus3 shooting stations4 shooting pocosheck its not really pvp unless you got an actual person shooting backpve activities that can become group activities should be catered to in some way as much as pvp is catered took maybe i digressed a bit but just because someone has less gametime than you and that they choose not to spend their time in the hell hole known as 00 space doesnt make them any less qualified than you to make suggestions to the game a game which people people say is 90 pvp and argue that any suggestions that cater to pve gameplay will break the game
get used to this  because apparently hulkageddon is here to stay like mittens announced it being indefinitei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
you cant expect these people to have any skill to do these sorts of things you have listed they require true skill knowledge and tactics because the things there actually pose a threat to them thats why they so aggressively oppose such changes as suggested they are only capable of feeling big by killing the defenseless and industrialists
you really dont pay attention do youthe guy is defending you and detailing some of the higher end skills and yet you go off on himwe agressively oppose changes that break game mechanics that are far above and beyond over your head as a noobmaybe you should take the time to go talk to some pvpers in low sec and ask them about things like agression mehcanicsand how they deal wiht targets in high secthats just one of many things you have to learn in this game to surviveand you being defenseless speak for yourself you can fight backso get off your ass and do it stop the evemail spam
i know he is on my side and i appreciate what he is saying my point is trying to get that across to guys like you is like talking to a brick wall you will never see and take on and try to understand others points of view because you only want things they way they suit you
oh we see just finefact isyou dontand have yet to see yourselfweve been in your shoes beforecried the same crieswhined the same whinesyour just doing so with a little too much ignorance stop the evemail spam
so suicide gank the suicide gankersanywho it took me a little while to remember what the name was but alot of what you see from people in eve can be attributed to what is known as stockholm syndromebasically people get to a point where their enemy is their friend and they start to do things they normally wouldnt do because for whatever reason it now seems to be the right way to do thingsi can genuinely tell you from experience from the multiple corp mates i have had that stockholm syndrome does exist in eve
i didnt say youd be invunerablei said use common senseif someone wants your ass on a plattarthey will likely get itbut if your paying attention to localpaying attention to your surroundingsyou will generally not get hiti have never been the direct victim of hulkageddon or major suicide ganksoh sure ive been targeted repaetedlybut they generally dont bother beucase i tend to not show up when such things happen or be in known to be target areas for mining operationshalf the reason i moved to 00 was to get away from the  because herewe can fight dirtyeven then in high sec i can mine just fine wihtout the harassment because i dont do the obvious stupid things most miners domining ships should have a little bit extra defense in my opinion but half the time the only way to nail your oponent is to suicide gank because a war dec will make them dock up unless they are that  so that argument is a waste of timejust like this postso is that stockholmn syndromeno its called being rationala concept you people tend to lackthere is no perfect defensebut there are plenty of ways to not get dragged into the precurosor to a gank many waysif you cant figure that outthen you deserved to get gankedrepeatedly stop the evemail spam
the only way to not get suicide ganked is to not undock at all if that is how ccp wants people to play eve then that is how they want people to play eve you sir seem to easily judge people on the pve side of eve as them being wrong in how they play eve right to where you say a concept you people lack doing the pve thing is not playing eve wrongyou are insisting that pvp and ganking are the right things to do in eve when in fact there is pve content in eve to be enjoyed too mining missions invention exploration ratting manufacturing wormholes and incursions the people that like pve should be able to enjoy the pve aspects and have every right to push forward ideas that could improve their pve experienceeve is not completely pvp complete pvp is your first person shooters and halo and going out to play paintball if eve was completely pvp there would be no pve contentbut yes even the most craziest pve person likes the occasional pvp
no to this ideaafter reading the 4 pages of this thread i find it funny when you said that the one guy whos probably the most sensible one so far has been posting crazy talks id rather have other players get shot by other players than not interacting with others ccp soundwave
monthbump
i dosent really bother me the wayit is today still it might make the life easyer for some people and should be easy to do nise to se an intelligent proposal here for onceyou have my full support on yhis one
well i do like the idea that there would be lowsec surrounding the empires it makes me think of what happened in the dark ageshowever its not necessary to revitalize lowseci think the way to get more people interest in lowsec is to stop thinking of it as instadeath zone or even pvp or faction war zone instead i would consider it the bad part of town kind of dangerous but kind of fun its still empire space after all its just the place that the governments of empire have less reach and authority considering that both the amarr and caldari societies are authoritarian police states dont you imagine that the low security systems would seem like an attractive place for many people to live what i would suggest is this1 gambling probably the oldest game in human history there are already independent and unaffiliated eve gambling for isk sites spreading like a rash on the internet ccp is missing out on huge interest and revenue with this some gambling sites make a fortune with nothing more than online roulette or poker just declare gambling illegal in high sec and open up casinos in low sec watch the miners come to spend their money in the low sec casinos just make sure the gambling games stick with the eve theme please 2 pleasure centers ditto 3 black markets it seems like there was a halfhearted effort to start this in eve then it got pulled eve needs a black market with smuggling etc these would be trade hubs for illegal goods not available in high sec like drugs pirate faction things and so on have you noticed you can buy blood raider ships in amarr emperor station really how is that possible to me that seems as likely as selling a satanic death metal tshirt on the streets of riyahd in saudi arabia stuff that is contraband should only be available for sale at black market stations located in low sec that includes stuff like slaves drugs pirate faction ships and implants maybe it would be possible to sell contraband stuff in high sec through contracts but it shouldnt be possible though the highsec market system smuggling there are a lot of people in eve that would love to be smugglers but currently there is nothing to smuggle its not very profitable and the customs officer mechanism doesnt work very well even hauling sucks as a career isk wise smuggling should be ten times as lucrative as hauling and ten times the fun make it so that agents in high sec are addicted to things like drugs and give you a bonus if you can get them some crash dark side  i would argue that lowsec is the dark side of high sec not just an empty battlefield but a mirror image of high secs hidden ugly side settlement zones like australia or colonial america lowsec becomes a home to those persecuted in an authoritarian highsec obviously criminal is not always evil such as the amarrians that want to liberate the slaves for example or caldari socialists or other peculiar factions just as highsec is split up into various regions such as the holders etc so too would lowsec be split into different territories each with its own story and culture there could be weird religious cults in lowsec too and of course it would be a storyline mission to discover these cults and deal with them pirate faction war i would have the npc pirates such as the guristas etc hold territories and form alliances that player pirates can join this way the pirates would be fighting each other for territory as the militia does i would also make it so the pirates can capture stations too just as the fw militias can
this was done at one point it was removed because it broke eve the endread up on history if you want to know why or how it broke eve
first make mining vessels that dont blow up with one or two hits of a destroyer people will take them into low sec if they feel they stand a chancemost belts in low sec are unused while ppl stay in the comfort of high secits one positive incentive ccp can giveor just do what i propose and ban concord and make all of high sec into low sec systems and be done with it everyone for themselvessecond work out a sov light plan for low sec so random corps can own a system as they branch out and even become enticed into wh or null just an idea after all concord has no military authority in low sec other than to ding you on your sec status against themselves when you comitt an illegal actmaybe give manufacturing incntive in low sec that are better than high secfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
personally i would make adv arrays add 5 me to blueprints you cant make it so they use 10 less mins as then you start geting free minerals if you refine with your only been able to anchor them in 04 space or lowerbeen able to rent out those slots to people outside your corp as long as you have enough fuel in the pos to last as long as the job has been set to run for also not been able to offline the towerarray when someone has hired it out or remove items like guns from the pos or remove fuel  the main problem with low is they is no way of making it your own or upgrading it like null so grav sites will be random for miners as no mass mining to upgrade the industrial index like null no way to boost the amount of anoms which spawn for people who rati guess one option would be to make a new class of low sec which are out of the way eg low sec systems which only have 1 gate in them which players can do very limited options to upgradering mining might also help low sec if that comes in on the fall low sec has all types of moon all ready
you really need to stop making this suggestion its ridiculous actually consider it we are talking about empires here with seats of council and capitals and assets and areas they call theirs you would be breaking the very fundamentals of eve lore to suggest these empires have no sense of being civilized and that they should not enforce law and order cos sure lets take the met out of london and the nypd out of new yorknow as for the proposal i support it and actually i think it could make sensehowever perhaps the buffer would only be between empires that do not like each other or this being too tricky due to layout have a buffer round all empires but with perhaps high sec bridges between empires that are more friendly this would create far greater diversity in trade and may encourage a greater spread of players rather than such divergance on areas such as jita
to shrug a suggestion off as ridiculous is just to put a blinder on possible solutionsit is not ridiculous to make those suggestions i suppose your one of those that would say it is ridiculous that man could fly yet someones thinking out of the box made it happen i dont think any of it is contrary to eve lore ppl in the empires are meant to expand to the reaches of space not sit in the comfort of high sec and rake in cash yet there needs to be incentive to reach out of high sec ccp did well working on getting ppl to null we just need to improve lowfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
im not shrugging it off though perhaps it was a little bold to just label it as ridiculous but i gave my reasons for feeling so as no self respecting empire goes without enforcing law and order though perhaps each empire should be give their own rather than a unified concord marshaling races that are at war with each otherand i think that these buffers if done right would encourage people to move into low sec just as each race already has combat strengths and weaknesses this would allow greater opportunity to give them market strengths and weaknesses and varying abundances of resources between races there by traders especially would be encouraged to travel across the gulfs where their races abundances would be worth more fighters would be sent across to the rival empire on missions and higher level missions may be based in the low sec gulf closer to the front line so to speakso yes i feel it would very much encourage players of all types to venture into low sec and entice them into its game play between friendly empires there would be longer but safer high sec corridors though perhaps as the roid belts of say a 07 system has rats which concord does nothing about these corridor systems would have roaming rats concord does nothing about and then when it comes to trading between warring empires where the rewards would be greatest players would need to look at fitting warp stabilizers cloaking devices and other defensive tools to make it through as there would be no safe corridor but only low sec where pvp would be the fearall as i can say is that currently i have no encouragement realy to leave high sec as all the empires are conected and yet further to this i see no reason to leve jita and the surounding regions and im minmatar
the concept of a fair fight does not belong in eve onlineget that clearbecause this is not the place for fairness stop the evemail spam
i havent read the whole text because there is an obvious problem here from the startif you change this whats to stop the can flippers from turning up with ore in their cargo hold and then just putting it in its still stealing if you take it at the moment they are just avoiding carrying it in their hold but if you make this change the only thing you will do is make can flippers go  damn now i have to carry ten or so veldspar in my cargohold what a pain and then theyll carry on as normal you wont have stopped anythingin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
finally its nice to see a good point and thank younow my initial response would be assuming my point of recognizing ownership and such any stolen stacks would not mix with other stacks of the same item there by preventing what you suggesthowever i realize this makes the whole system more and more complicated to keep dividing things up yet there is still the idea of simply making jetcans be treated as abandoned off the cuff from the moment they are created i dont see as this would create any great change to weather people would try to steal from jetcans or not ill be honest on a previous character i intended to play as a pirate i used a hauler to smash and grab miners cans knowing it wasnt likely they would harm me i just let the countdown end while i sell off their ore but what it would mean is that this would have to be the sort of methods used thievery would have to be thievery for to simply move it to your own can would allow the miner to grab their hauler and take it backso while the method for achieving the goal here is different the premise of what it does is still the same and over all jet cans would still be used in much the same ways as they are now for quick transfer of items with little risk between players or as storage with high risk of theft
its called get an orcaproblem solved a concept you fail to understand or recognize as a valid solutionone that everyone in industry uses and swears by stop the evemail spam
oh yea i forgot they just give those out in the tutorials and take no trainingyou seem to fail to understand the concept i put forward to simply suggest a way a specific and unavoidable period of game play perhaps be provided a little more balancenow we all know your stand point but you dont speak for everyone you dont need to keep postingeither others will and not support it and so it will be dropped or others wont because they dont care and so it will be dropped or others will in support and so perhaps it would go forward
againyou missed the pointnot unusual with you these days stop the evemail spam
no
no to this onewar is good allowing concord to be made redundant by permitting suicide ganking isnt so good unless you want to remove concord altogether but thats another issuefight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
ummm why not pvp in hisecthe rules support it and im pretty sure ccp knows that people fight in hisec spaceme points to the login warning about burn jita etc etc
why in the name of all that is holy would you remove pvp from high i se two reasons for this1 you where droppen on your head as a baby2 you are lost in the world of mmo and need to find your way back home to hello kitty onlineplease promis us you never have children we dont want you to polute the common geen poll with your subpar geens
why do we need concordit is clear that ccp wants grossly inflated and ongoing rising prices on the market by permitting suicide gankers to come to high security to suicide gank players who make us ships at good priceseve is not for the faint of heart to begin with yet i nearly fell out of my chair when i saw an ad on my client talking about a newbie friendly eve surely newbs wise up on just how newbie friendly eve is when they get their covetor or transport ganked before they have a chance to figure out how to make isk in the game to replace it or have a chance to find the right corp or alliance to teach them the ropes even taught the ropes they will die in the same spectacular fashionhulkageddon is everyday now eve did not always have concord concord was put in place with the intention of created a secure zone for fledgling pilots to thrive until they got the nerve and knowhow to spread their wings for greater reward elsewhereccp has validated if not acquiesced the practice of subverting concord to kill carebears and newbswhy have concord why not just roll back to preconcord days and make everything concord freethat is my proposalinflate prices to record highs as they are now kill everyone without interference show the newcomers that they dont stand a chance and buy tons of plexes from errm ccp to replace your ships and modulesban concord from the game plz seriously renamed it appropriately by me fight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet

thanks for your replyim serious do you support a removal of concord or not it is now a redundant entityi dont play wow so i dont know about that but everyone deserves to play the game of eve online we were all newcomers at one timefight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
am i missing something or are you going against your own idea haha
well actually i just want consistency why have concord if it doesnt do what ccp originally intended by bringing it into the gamefight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
concord does exactly what its supposed to do its intended to provide consequences to any unprovoked aggression in highsec it is not intended to make it impossible to attack players in highsec it simply provides consequences if such an attack does happenso no im not supporting it at all
op  no i do not support removal of concordwhat made you think i did stop the evemail spam
no it wasnt how is concord being subverted exactly do you even know what that word meansyour whining has proceeded from a flawed premise if ccp had wanted you to be safe from pvp in high security they would have simply made it impossible to engage in pvp combat in high security this could be done trivially instead they1 intentionally opted to leave pvp combat as a permissible action in high security2 intentionally implemented a system that only provides consequences  not prevention  in the form of concord3 intentionally balanced that system so that its response time varies based on system security which carries the obvious implication that it is not supposed to be wholly effective in preventing pvp actions in high securitythese are all of the intentional design decisions that went into concord in lieu of simply rendering pvp impossible in high security ergo nothing is being subverted  the system is working as intended
ah i see but well no the solution should not be remove concord if it were an issue rather fix it however i dont believe it is the issue it is the rules of engagement and severity of risk posed that needs some re thinking in order to allow concord to work more effectivelyto surmise i believe what your saying is as like to say the police dont work when in fact it is the laws the govern and bind them that are the problem
no it doesntfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
right so the answer isnt removing the police but make it so they do their jobs the way intendedfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
there is no whining here except by your post about me having the audacity of identifying a problem on the forums you are so concerned that someone mentioned it that you had to post all of that in response stop emo raging and discuss it like an adult enless ofc you are not an adult then i understand your post and the lack of intellectual discussion behind itthe system does not work as intended any longer it is infact broken so either fix it or roll it backfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
its only your opinion that its a problem you are seriously outvoted here you havent had one supportive comment which should show you that your opinion is not appreciated please let this topic die so that more productive topics can be on the front page as it stands your just pushing better topics which actually stand a chance of implementation off the assembly hall first pagein the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
precisely 
you didnt identify a problem you identified something you dont like they are very differentyes actually it does work as intendedyou seem to have conflated it doesnt work the way i want it to with it doesnt work as intended but those are two wholly separate thingsit definitely doesnt work the way you want it to and that is quite demonstrably the intention
there is no vote here if you dont like the topic or cant add anything intelligent to it go troll elsewherefight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
heh i dont live in high sec it has nothing to do with how i want it to work it is just an outdated mechanic so your assertions are entirely irrelevant to the discussionfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
whether it directly impacts you or not you clearly want it to work in a certain fashion and that is clearly in conflict with how it is intended to workthat aside you seem to really struggle with the fundamentals of logical reasoningyou havent thus far made any credible argument that it doesnt work as intended all of your posts have proceeded from the faulty premise that concord is intended to provide safety in high security when it is common knowledge that this is not its intent
one wonders the caliber of pilot posting then if you have problems understanding whatever logic you think is being applied to a suggestionif you dont like it post elsewhere nothing making you read this thread except that you are failing to trollfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
one of the fundamental problems with posting in public forums people who dont agree with your infantile whinging get to tell you youre wrong learn to cope
you are the only one whinging like a fail troll ty for keeping the topic alivefight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
i pointed out several intentional game design decisions that were made demonstration the intent of concord you refuted none of it im just going to assume from here on out that youre a very young child and treat you as such ahemthere there its all going to be okay have a sucker
you gave no such evidence i didnt ask for it anyway either you agree with the proposal or not thats all i asked for as for your trolling get a life and move to another topic if you can add something constructivefight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
nobody really cares what you ask fornopeagain if ccp had wanted you to be safe from pvp in high security they would have simply made it impossible to engage in pvp combat in high security this could be done trivially instead they1 intentionally opted to leave pvp combat as a permissible action in high security2 intentionally implemented a system that only provides consequences  not prevention  in the form of concord3 intentionally balanced that system so that its response time varies based on system security which carries the obvious implication that it is not supposed to be wholly effective in preventing pvp actions in high securityoh and4 intentionally adjusted the system since then particularly with respect to insurance payouts to moderate the riskreward ratioare any of the above untrue if so how are they untrue if not why do you continue to believe that the intention of concord is to render high sec safe
they have been adding soemthing constructive they ahve been building a counter arguement to your proposal while all youve done is whine and complain about people not agreeing with youso far ive seen your one sentence of an opinion supporting this topicand about 8 paragraphs of irrefutable evidence pointing out that your opinion is based on a faulty perspective of intended game mechanics
wrongfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
deliberately not taking sides here perhaps the op can explain to me how concord is not fulfilling its intended function
simply put with relatively cheap ships in the highest security system players can be suicide ganked though i have no issue with they practice in theory i foresee that this growing trend and its ease and widespread existence will ultimately harm the game whe new or intermediate players are concerned these players are those who will become tomorrows well established players if they see a game they benefit from and enjoy ofc if there is no expectation by newcomers that there is secure space there is no harm done however since we have high security systems with a force like concord to intervene on behalf of the unwitting victim there needs to be a level of security beyond getting your new hauler or covetor suicide ganked by a destroyer in high sec with relative ease ive seen eve over many years now and the trend is rampant and with much greater ease today than it was just a couple years agosomething needs to changeoutlawing suicide tanking kills a valid dynamic so what needs to happen is to either fix this or just make all of high sec like low sec no concord so that there is no expectation of security at all new players are unforgiving when they subscribe to pay for a game and they immediately are suicide tanked with such ease in high sec systems whe they naively im sure believe they can learn the game and make a small amount of iskenderun safely eventually in the long term fewer ppl will be first time subscribersfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
if we outlaw suicide tanking more hulks might fit some extenders adn survive a gank or two wouldnt want to destroy teh ganking dynamic now would we
what the heck is suicide tankingand to be quite honestblunt here suicide ganking has never been any worse or any less than it was 6 months agoall you need is a little common sense and youll live just fineis it too easyyesso instead of arguing it been there done that then deal with it by adaptingand to be honesti never really had an issue with it unless i knowingly allowed itand bottom line  if someone wants your podyou will get gankedits just a matter of time stop the evemail spam
awwwweee is icle drakey all bothered by something does he not like getting nice friendly mails from people when its out of his controlahw its almost like being mail ganked but instead of it blowing up your ship it makes drakeys head explode cos he has to read all them words and we all know you dont cope well with lots of words thats why you write in all those spaced out broken up sentences right so you dont get to lost keep your mind wrapped round it allheres an idea why dont you just not read it and instead of trying to have things changed so you can make more isk for nothing do as suggested and block those who send it to youhmm it almost seems unfair that they are generally the players with enough isk not to care about the mail cost oh but yes of course this place being eve online well didumsoh or heres a final thought and dont worry about your mail so much if you just flew into jita
ok im going to assume you have a kindergarten education and never made it through high schoolthat saidthere is a difference expecting someone to have a fair fight planned when you get can flippedand an exploitation of mechanics when it comes to spamming the entirety of eve online for the singular intent of advertisement without consequencesthe can flipper you oh so hate is just as much at risk as you areyou can shoot him backand blow him up evenits a proven factyou cannot however stop the initial spam flood because at least 1 message will always get through regardless of cspanow if your nooblet carebear brain cant fathom thatthen you have no business making such ridiculous comments please go back to school and bother to learn to read and think before you respondthank you stop the evemail spam
my answer was very well thought out you call it ridiculous and yet its just the sort of answer you would give people when you dont like an idea condescending unconstructive and quite rude really and then you have the gall and hypocrisy to tell me that effectively im childish and need to think before i speak you are only truly speaking to yourself there im afraid to say its not just about my idea but all the ideas ive seen you post on that you dont like it only needs be said simply i dont support this idea and if you have a good constructive reason to say whynow in truth it would yes be a little annoying to keep receiving spam mail though personally im always in jita and have rarely experienced this perhaps that s the luck and a perk of being a nooblet carebear p haha though im not sure they are going to be fussy in mass player mailing but surely there can only be so many of these guys at any one time and if you just take 2 seconds to block them as they come its not a great effort and it doesnt just block their second mail it blocks them for goodthough at the same point while i see there maybe some reason to them doing this if its to look for gaining votes or what ever i can see other methods not least just plain old jetcan advertisement and perhaps rather than sinking isk just through paying the right to mail ccp could do this by charging isk to put a simple message on billboards for a certain time and just put a few more billboards in clearer view of gates and even outside stationsfor now for your own benefit just block them haha but in all i think its perhaps unneeded to mail and a change could even provide more immersion to the game so as surprising as it may seem i am going to support your idea
are you capable of posting without contradiction and hypocrisy or is this a past time for you stop the evemail spam
if i have been contradictory or hypocritical in what ive said it was with the greatest of intention in order to make a point to you about your own behavior toward othersbut beyond that i have given you a post that is rather light hearted tries to make helpful suggestion and over all supports your cause
ive gotten maybe 3 spam mails all year two of them were csms running for officei dont see it as an issue tbhfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet

pretty muchits not a serious issue right nowbut it can beand its just a matter of time before a group of people get it in their heads to exploit itits how some groups get ccps attention to introduce exploitation mechancis that ccp is slow to respondto use themwithout getting banned of course stop the evemailUFFFDspam
evemail has existed for how long and just right now the idea of exploiting it has become new and originali should probably make those credit card companies that keep mailing me their junk mail pay me for every letter they send me
dont knock itat one point in the usa there was a bill in congress concerning that very policyit nearly made it throughuntil the corporations and companys that advertise lobbied for it to get shot downgee i wonder whygetting paid for trash mailtheres a concept stop the evemailUFFFDspam
lol the way you say that sounds like you guys missed a trick presuming you are american and hence knowing thatconsidering the america very much coined the phrase so sue me and there after went law suit crazy lolwell here in britain people have made money from junk mail you see we just stick a little sign on our door saying no junk mail and then in some cases people have won compensation where such mail was still postedhmm you can do something like that in eve but just those who post it cant ignore you yea its called blocking them
i feel sorry for my uk friends noweither you start to read before you post or dont bother at allyouve repeatedly missed several key points as to the reasoning and debates stop the evemailUFFFDspam
first of all if this topic idea has already been discussed or mentioned before feel free to move it or delete as appropriatei myself have not any experience with capital ships so pardon me if i sound like a knowitallthis is a rough idea for what i think could be a potential solution to the many aspects of the supercap problemsthe chief concerns are blobbing usefullness and constructionblobbingmany people find that big spaceship battles that take hours to complete where you shoot and get shot hundreds of times and where you put most of your hardtrained skills to best use to be some of the best experiences in their entire eve career for whatever reason be it revenge territorial gain or simple good fights people love to do these things take a stroll through nullsector with alot of friends and you wont be disappointed of course the numbers wont always favour you or your enemies thats how a battle goes sometimes people make mistakes and sometimes the opposing force is just too much to handle and a desperate rearguard action has to take place in order to get out safelyhowever one thing is to be outnumbered by regular ships even in a fight to the death you could still take a few of the bastards with you in a blaze of glory this hope is crushed when suddenly facing ships that would take your fleet several minutes just to put a dent in should you face a large number of supercapital ships that suddenly jump in on your action the tide of battle will thus turn away from you like an unsatisfied girlfriend just sayingin other words supercap blobbing is an everpresent problem that has destoyed many a good fights in the spirit of this i propose limiting the number of supercapitals the each alliance can have at their disposal the numbers usually are the hardest part so let me start off with a rough estimate1 titan class super capital per 510 systems controlled13 mothership class super capital per 15 systems controlled think about it with this the rageing growth of supers wil be trimmed down in the future its not a perfect solution as there still is the current number of supers active in eve not to mention all the pilots who trained for supers most of them will have wasted skillspoints if this idea were to be introduced then again no one says that the current supers are to be dismantled it just means that when an excess super dies its down for good this could also spark more warfare in nullsector by trying to cull big alliances who have too much space for their own good this bring us over to usefullnessusefullnesscurrently supers arent what they used to be and for good reason as mentioned above supercarriers and titans lost their regular drone bay last winter and the titans have been nerfed recently to prevent them from being a threat to supcapitalssomewhere along the line this seems wrong i once saw a kill mailreport that showed an erebus class titan shoot down a flycatcher interdictor to me that seemed normal much dismay was had from all sides since people generally agreed upon that the erebus titan shouldnt be able to do that it leaves me baffled honestly i mean what good is such an expensive ship if it cant even defend against one little subcap ship it should be able to kill the ship noproblemhandsdowngone it should not have the same chances against a fleet of little ships anyone whos ever seen star wars will suffer no illusion of this whats the point of having that giant if all it takes is one lone hero tackler to stop it even luke skywalker would have been luke gonewalker if he had tried his luck against the death star alonei propose giving supers back what they once had albeit in a different way whilst taking something else away  remove the ewar immunity from supers but give them very high stats to counter lone heros if you want a super tackled you are gonna have to work for it i would imagine that supers have supercomputers the size of several houses so you would have to have a fleet of ewar ships to stop them from working makes sense as far as i can see  divide their drone bay into a regular drone bay and a capital drone bay give them a dominix worth or less prehaps a vexor sized bay of drone capacity to help them counter small fleets of tackler ships whilst retaining their current amount of fighters andor bombers titans dont get a capital drone bay since that would defeat the purpose of supercarriersnow these idea will spark no end of problems themselves but as i said before its not a perfect solution it will however give supers a little chance of living to fight another day instead of the now old oh oohh theres a single neut in local i better jump not too much and not too littlelastly this brings us to constructionconstructionmaking the construction of supers more difficult will prevent them being spawned like fleas from a dog this will make losing a super more telling than before as it cannot be replaced as easily and will also reinforce the aformentioned ideas above i dont have any knowledge of how long it takes to build these giants but it seems the current rate it too much for anyones liking as far as i can tell of course i might be wrongi propose that the time it takes to make a super is doubled or increased by 15x and prehaps a 2530 increase in production costs this may or may not have any effect on some alliances at present but hopefully it will leave an effect on the futurethats it let me know what you think is any of this viable or should we just forget that i ever wrote anythingover to you guys
would prefer a new class of heavy bomber which is designed to kill capital ships only cant hurt small stuff that much than trying to limit whats all ready ingame
limiting super capitals the way you suggest will just stagnate nullsec the biggest sov holders will have the most supers and so they will take space the easiest and will accrue more space and so on and so forth you would end up with one alliance owning almost all sov space and then no other alliance could ever fly a super capital and therefore could never take space from them for those reasons alone as well as many other reasons i cant be bothered to write walls of text on i will support this ideaalso people have repeatedly brought up the idea of increasing mineral requirement for supers the problem is supers dont die fast enough not that people make them too quickly people will find the resources no matter how difficult you make them to build if you make them too difficult to build you end up with the same situation i detailed above it only becomes possible for the biggest and already strongest alliances to build themas for your ideas about usefulness theyre neither here nor there reallyin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
if you know literally nothing about supercaps you should not be posting suggestions about supercaps especially when youre suggesting the reversal of several nerfsjust saying
a pilot belonging to a player corporation should be able to buy a 24hour jamming license from concord during that period that pilot and any member of their fleet may use ewar in hisec on any targets they choose in a solar system specified by the licensehere are the restrictions and consequences in bullet form for easier digestion not available to npc corp members license for one 24hour period restricted to a single system fee based on system size  population and security level players that get jammed have aggression rights license permits only jamming  disruption  dampening webbing scrambling target painting or any kind of actual firing is not permitted ecm drones are permitted licensed pilots are listed in a solar systems information licenses held by any given pilot are listed in that pilots information licenses are nontransferable rather than sit like fish in a barrel a miner can pop out a set of ecm drones and attempt to jam a ganker before getting ganked or better a defending fleet can jam the wouldbe ganker first without concord getting involved as aggression rights would then be available to the wouldbe ganker the ganker gets an actual fight if theyre willing to stick around for itlike can flipping jamming licenses would not be sold in newbie systems 10 yes this could potentially be canflipping on steroids only you dont lose the contents of the container you just lose a lock or miss the shotin the case of third party interference with ongoing hostilities the aggression rights cover that fight back
so i can fly up to a belt scare a miner into jamming me keep them bumped so they cant warp out and just wait for the drones to miss a cycle so i can kill the miner without losing my ship since it gave me aggression against the miner dont you think thats a bit exploitabletldr no its a bad idea this doesnt help anything at all
yes you can do that but itd be better if that miner had a pack of buddies in dessies getting in your way you wouldnt get aggro on the miner in that casemining solo is dangerous
doesnt add anything of any value to the game but it does add more stuff for people to moan about ie exploits etcso noin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
i disagree naturally it adds a mechanic for an initial punch in hisec without concord interferencelets talk about the exploits though how bad would they be
what is with the massive numbers of npc alts coming up with insane ideas stop the evemail spam
please explain why this is insane otherwise youre just blathering in electronic form
why should i repeat what already has been saidgo read what has been saidthat alone is enough for me stop the evemail spam
then dont repeat the only thing that has already been said is it doesnt add anything to the game which i refuted feel free to argue against my refutation that would not be repetition unless you just literally repeat the claim without giving evidence or a line of reasoning to back up the stanceas for exploitation i gave an argument for why i thought that kind of exploitation would be an acceptable addition to the game it wouldnt be an exploit it would simply be one more thing leading to a fight i thought the thesis of eve was that fighting is goodalso feel free to bump the thread again
your arguments only tell me one thingthis is a jokei try not to waste time on jokes stop the evemail spam
the proposal was not a joke your no shut up is kind of silly though
stupid idea is stupidi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
seei dont really need to say muchspeaks our overall opinion clearly here stop the evemail spam
yes but theres no reason at all just thats dumb why what are the flaws can they be fixed what would would a good solution for the problem beconvince me im wrong and ill drop the thread tell me your unsupported opinion should trump mine without giving a line of reasoning and i cant take it seriously
the whole concept is flawed as it would create another avenue for griefing and mechanic exploitation end up wit a bunch of neutral jammers during wars or 1v1s instead of neutral rrdo us all a favor give me your stuff and biomass you halfed a half idea you quartered twiti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
regarding neutral jamming the act of jamming gives the jammed aggression rights the moment you or your fleet does it youre fair game i addressed that in the initial post why would that be insufficientand uhhh you moronic jack of a wowtard go back to crying over error 37s is that how that part works
you know not what you do i would back off while you still have a chance stop the evemail spam
ooh i can probe out a mission bear wait till hes pointed by rats and just jam him till the rats pop him
lolbest one yet stop the evemail spam
or until he warps off yes and yes this actually makes hisec less safe
lmfao please drake provide intelligent reasoning pigs will fly hell will freeze the pope will renounce religion and become the worlds leading biology scientist bringing new and great advances in the theory of evolution anything else and everything else will happen before this guy gets some intelligence and can actually give good logical constructive reason to his views i mean just check a few of the other hot threads atm and you will realize thisnow as to your idea will this not in fact just further encourage ganking rich players with money to throw away not even having to worry about concord if they jam a defenseless ship i really dont think it will help us miners much only be exploited by those we already have problems with i can see it would allow miners to jam military ships in the hope they can get their hard earned haul out before they are locked scrammed and popped but i really dont feel it would end up working out like that
facepalmthat went right over your head didnt it stop the evemail spam
i would be more than happy to introduce to you why this is badexcept youd post a wall of text crying over why i stole your salvageblew up your multibillion isk mission shipand left laughing with your stuffso nonot going therego mission in any market hubs and be paitent and youll see why my little nooblet stop the evemail spam
the insult was deliberately absurd i know hes certainly not a wowtard i simply acted correspondingly to that part of his message id be happy to discuss whether its bad or good to create a new mechanic that leads to aggression id love to discuss the problems with a license to jam such as the issues with the current ecm system but no one has gone there
facepalm stop the evemail spam
i expect it would generate quite a few situations like can flipping does today with less sting because firing up ecm is an aggressive act i dont think it would benefit solo miners much at all but if those solo miners paid for mercenaries who provide a getouttadodge belt patrol that could be interesting youd even get to check out the bona fides of the merc corp because their fc would have to carry the license to be of use
i suspect your just bitter over 1 too many encounters with a falconclassic ecm whine post stop the evemail spam
not whining about ecm im saying give us a way to do it in hisec without a wardec and without getting concorded i guess the real aim is at nerfing concord not all the way just a little bit
ive got to agree with koreli here i think this would be slanted too far in favor of griefers and gankers youd have to charge a high fee to make it a worthwhile isk sink and if it costs more than miner earns in an hour or so then its too expensive to be worth it for the miner but still an easy expense for a gankeraegis destroyers on the other hand see sig
how can he warp out if hes tackled by the rats i can just jam him and go afk and hes stuck till downtime
note to self  danika is ebil stop the evemail spam
so is this another im another sad panda carebear miner threadyou know the kind where some one that got ganked whine and want to change eve so its an easy game because if thats the problem i have the fix for you and here it comes learn to play the game like yhe rest of us
no allows people defending a system to reship faster then the speed of the battle would normally allow all or none imo
skirmisherda hell is that supposed to befrom context i think you mean baitthis is not wow

eve might not be the game for you son go to your room and play the sims
now this just says it alleve im sure once upon a time in the now far flung dreams of the creator very far flung dreams flung as far away as possible was meant to be for you and me and players like us players who like to rp and to play out a story actually fulfill a rolebut then the cod monkeys came along the ones with just enough sense of self to want to act as though they are any different to any other cod monkey and they got in there battle ships and decided the game was all about solo grinding missions and feeling like they are big cos they can gank those who focus on a mining role in high secnow i love your idea but until eve can get the social interaction of the game sorted out so as miners are actually valued and industrialists can just be industrialists and not have to spend 6 months becoming war hardened veterans too just in order to get along i see no room for any other plans for providing more immersioni really do love it but i worry ccp just wants profits not to make a niche game for real rp immersion players 
i might be wrong but you dear sir sound butt hurt
haha no not butt hurt a little disappointed yes but only because eve turned out not to be what it said on the tin like a strawberry jam that says smooth and sweet but ends up being slightly bitter and seeded but no im happy having just moved on with it accepting it for what it isno not butt hurt just realistic
sorry my bad then
ive seen habitation modules and minmatar bunkers in deadspace complexes buti am beginning to think that the incarna captains quarters stations are our cities and homes i am aware that ccp has big plans for incarna which i am sure means interacting with each other in bars and such im not sure about fistfighting and such this might not be the same thing but a lot of roleplaying pilots create their own chat channels and mix it up there you are with the sebeistor tribe i think they have their own roleplay bar in a chat channel you can also create you own roleplay chat channel home or temple or whatever yourself as well i also think that our ships are our homes the ships are huge after all contain all the life support entertainment and conveniences you would ever need to sustain yourself there is not a lot to do in space the ship pretty much flies itself and its such a hostile environment that if we left our ships we would instantly die even a rifter is the size of a jumbo jet which is bigger than most peoples houses i dont imagine its all filled with equipment also even with the warp drive and jump gates it would likely take us a really really long time to travel across a solar system let alone some twenty jumps to other solar systems which are lightyears away from each other its not quite the same thing as kicking back on your couch in your duplex in the suburbs after spending an hour commuting back from the office in your toyota if this was really space travel it would be unlikely that you would be visiting the same system twice as for a habitation module attached to an asteroid or something which is what i am imagining would you really prefer that as a place to live compared to a spaceship with propulsion modules and weapons something an enemy could discover and destroyi had imagined something like a habitation module as a node for planetary interaction this would be a town a city a barracks etc where you could put the passengers or livestock you can get as a trade item and transform them into a different type put slaves into the habitation module and get freed slaves freed slaves become science graduates etc i see this as a mechanism for increasing the population of a planet which could be used as a scoring mechanism for faction war pi is kind of like sim city anyways and the whole minmatar slave thing is kind of underdeveloped there should be a mechanism for freeing slaves or capturing them and i think pi is the best avenue for this also if you were thinking of having a home wouldnt you prefer to live on a planet or on a space station in orbit around a planet
this now i have another button cluttering up my station inviting me to spend aurfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
how come we cant drag structures around on planets we can already to this with extractor heads we in theory should be able to do this with spaceports processors etc of course you would have to institute a fee to do so that would only make sense the reason i ask this is pi at least on my extractor planets are clickfests also an idea would be to search for structures on planets ie have a menu i know how eve likes menus and when you either doubleclick it or right click  go to it centers on said structure
i take issue with having to move my extrctor let alone having to move the other items hehfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet

the original incarnation while a bit too bright and heavy handed was a brilliant blue set of space clouds it was beautiful and impressive and was an excellent example of the art teams work with the new backgroundsafter people began to complain that the nebulae were too bright and a bit of an eyesore ccp decided to darken these nebula or move them to areas of the skybox that werent in direct view very oftenhowever lonetrek was not only darkened but desaturated to a dull tired grey while i understand the caldari ships are often less than brilliant or pretty the lonetrek nebula is frankly unimpressive at all its barely better than the previous ones we hadmy proposal is hopefully simple enough bring some of that blue color back to lonetrek it doesnt need to be ultra bright like it was before or too invasive but i personally dislike the greyed out versionany supportersold lonetrek too brightcurrent lonetrek too darkgrey

i agree eve is not fair in the end it is a business and ccp will do whatever it takes to protect the business i am sorry if all you ganking is pvp people think thats unfair but i can see hardcoded changes being introduced to stop or at least severely reduce attacks on industrials and mining ships in highsecyes there should be much harsher consequences for ganking yes concord should not be protecting people with bounties on them in highsecyes maybe if you have negative security status you should be podded by concord and your medical clone kicked to lowsec i do agree that since hulklageddon began there has been a drop off in player activity in highsec the if you dont like it leave advice has been followed why am i still here i want eve to thrive not limp alongand yes i have the tactics experience and practice to say with complete confidence that the current highsec ganking is simply not balanced its rubbish pvp and if that is the best pvp eve has going for it at the moment then this game is in much more trouble than i originally thought oh to the devs for every miner ship killed there should be an option for the miner to vote on targets for a concord incursion into null sec if goons mock concord then concord should conquor some of thier moon mining billions systems so what if that leads to 10 systems that goons cant go into themselves noone said anything was set in stone or fair and if null sec alliances are so bored that the most fun thing they can do is suicide highsec players out of the game then they need something to do revese incursions of empires  concord into null would be nice to see  if sansha can do it into highsec so can the winning sides in the great war
as a nonnoob i can confidently say that the game mechanics from the pure design of eve got thrown out years ago deal with it ccp can and will make changes to cater for the preferences of customers in the game they have repeatedly in the past a null sec corporation has effectively declared war on the most vulnerable segment of ccps playerbase because there is no way whatsoever for highsec miners to strike back at goons then ccp will need to act or lose subscribers and income as for the defenceless  you cant fight back against gankers the alpha strikes possible now days for tiny cost are literally laughable compared to 5 years ago in eve once upon a time pvp took skill  this highsec ganking takes no skill and indeed most lowsecnull pvp i have seen recently is noskill butchery too want real skill back in eve pvp get rid of logistics ships destroyers level 3 bcs all t3 cruisers hacs etc will they do that no real pvpers can still use a team of frigates to kill anything  but they are few and far between most pvpers will be cookie cutter battlecruisers who target the broadcast ship press one button and call it skill which all leads to an interesting idea if you have a bounty on you and negative security status you should not be allowed to use the highsec markets or dock at highsec stations consequences they have to be real or there are none gankers get rich that is currently all there is to it no risk and all reward thats broken and needs to be fixed one way or another

lady flute  who the hell ran over your puppy and shot itsheesh serious bitternessyou should quit this gameyour just flat not happy about it stop the evemail spam
no i have seen pvp game after pvp game close down in the past few years the only reason eve has survived against that trend has been because the highsec system provided an effectively nopvp playstyle option for customersthat is currently overunless ccp restores it then i am concerned eve will follow the long path of all those other pvp games that gave players a sandbox and pvp and closed when all the players did was turn it into a kitty litter box full of smelly things and most of thier customers simply quitbasically eve will need to get its act together or when darkness comes out eve will be in reinforced mode the best and brightest ccp have will be working on darkness which if it takes off will be the core growth area of thier business you can whine wail and complain all you want but the bottom line is simple ccp have been spending a ton of money on advertising eve to bring in new players if the community undermines ccps player base expansion efforts then it has only itself to blame if ccp implements hard coded changes you dont want i have seen that in other games too which tried too little too late to stem the loss of social  casual players which failures i am certain ccp will be well aware of so my guess is they will either accept the loss of customers and simply put their efforts towards darkness or they will go very strongly into creating carebear spacedo you want the current nopvp zones to get bigger i was shocked to find out they had been added while i was gone but they make sense how big do you think they will become if you keep advocating for players to quit eve and players keep doing so do i think ccp might give in and add gold star insurance for us1 a ship per month that such a ship cannot be attacked in highsec at all yes their aggressive plex marketing and the international economic situation suggests they need the money so watch this space and when things dont go the way you want them to remember you had this chance to propose positive systems changes that addressed the underlying issues wihtout breaking the freedom of the sandbox

i wouldnt be surprised if the only change ccp really needs to do is to make it so pods arent treated specially ie a 10 pod would get popped just like he would in a shipvov
and the nooblet bleats like the sheep we expect them to beso yeahmoving on stop the evemail spam
mhmmm a bit like conc just look the other way if anyone wants to warp scram and pod that defenseless little blob cos he is a gutless criminal sounds all good
yeah its always struck me as a bit weird how they shoot ships but not pods but i believe thats because ccp didnt want people to get podded by surprise but i wouldnt be surprised if ccp decides that the ganking problem has become so prevalent now that they have to change that part of the mechanicshonestly im not seeing what all the rage is all you have to do is really think of something simple like this and propose that to ccp
xd you gunu call any one sheep you with your cookie mold ship fit linked to you in some chat or found on some third party siteoh and dont tell me its not can tell just by the way you talk it is you wouldnt have the first clue about tactics let alone understand even the most basic of frigs can be useful past the first few days of play if you know how to work in a teamnope youll have the same old ship with the same old fit that is the greatest indication of stagnant things are becoming
yea no this is a good point eve if it had to just be that conc will pod any player it has to get involved with xd well just dont get involved with concordbut no like you say surely a certain negative standing could allow it and allow other players to do it with no concord retribution because of course just allow concord pure rights to pod would probably lead to people finding ways to get some one to attack them just to get them conced
obviously it wouldnt be based on the i just ganked someone concord will now shoot my ship code that would be ludicrous no it would have to just be an extension of the current system where you get shot at by faction police if youre in a ship below a certain security level and by concord below another level i think 25 and 5 respectively i dunno only extended to take the pod as well
go gank new players in the starter systems see what happens to you
that would be a very welcome change biggest problem is that concord protect reds in pods that should be changed
see 10 in pod grab seboed interceptor destroy pod scoop corpse rinse repeattheres your solutioni am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
im not going to read all the tears but you miners realize you are probably safer in null sec right and you get to mine those abc ores that will make you ten times as rich
good god its not hard to avoid ganks like thisstop mining in a system with hundreds of people in it go find a quiet highsec system watch local see someone new pop in check sec status and either dock up or go to a new system if its in the negative dont want to do that at least be aligned and ready to warp the second a new ship pops up on grid dscan until you know they arent there to gank to check for probes too much work welcome to the same  everyone else with a ship they dont want to lose has to do when they undock in itstop trying to have the game changed to fit your needs when all you need to do is ing pay attention
wolodymyralmost everything you posted is either covered by my proposal and linked thread in fi or its something i wouldnt have a strong objection to such as your third point on seeing friendliesgoing point by point1 remove local as an intel tool not exactly the approach in this proposal but obviously i support this in terms of intent2 improved dscan definitely however the devil is in the details i posted a number of ideas on this in the fi thread the general idea was a sliding scale between 3 factors where more of one would mean less of one of the other two they were distance of scan angle of scan in degrees and frequency of the scan in terms of how often the automated scan would activate3 friendlies automatically being identified in scans not one of my ideas but it seems reasonable at least for corpalliance i think anything which discourages blueing lots of other entities is a good thing so im not sure i would want it to apply to blues but it wouldnt be the end of the world to have it either4 the new intel tool should be entirely based on in game mechanics im not sure what this means in terms of your suggestions since youve only talked about an improved dscan and having local chat lose all its intel functions in terms of my proposal the time a ship shows up in local is based on ship class which while simplistic gives advantage to those ships i believe ought to have an advantage frigates and destroyers primarily and not those ships i believe should not have this advantage such as tech 3s unless of course their covops in which case they wont show at all if they stay cloaked5 by basing detection on game mechanics this makes ships in the scout role more important my proposal does exactly this and a ship as used in your example an interceptor being a frigate is the class of ship that benefits the most6 cloaked ships being detectable and a means to hunt them agreed but only after local chat intel is gone and with nothing similar replacing it also the detection system must not enhance gate camps in any significant way ideally the means of hunting should fall into the same type of gameplay as cloaked ships themselves cat and mouse sneaky gameplay shadowbane did this reasonably well7 improved gui for intel tools that doesnt take up lots of space yeah of course who wouldnt want that8 sov upgrades to improve intel functions my proposal has that9 ship detection in the new intel tool to be time based and eventually ships always showing on scan my proposal definitely has the first part the second part of always eventually showing up in the intel tool is the one point you made that is not part of my proposal and im unlikely to rush to add it either i think cloaked ships should be discoverable and huntable by very specialized ships in keeping with the cat and mouse type gameplay however i dont think cloaked ships should show up in local or its replacementreally apart from the last point what you listed as what you want to see and what i proposed arent that far apart as far as i can see like a lot of things the details matter but yeah i like most of your list
so i take it you avoid wormhole space like the plague thenbias is not a good idea if your going to be against delayed local stop the evemail spam

quick update on day 1 of the summit sorry if this is a bit of a teaser of a post but we dont want to spoil the minutescsm intro  white paperwe discussed a broad range of procedural topics including reforms to the csm election process and possible other structural changes there will be an internal discussion of these things followed by a public discussion period before anything is decidedwe gave the new meeting recording  remote conference system its first live test and it seems to work well we also discussed and will implement some ways to improve the level of detail in the minuteswhat is a stakeholdera very productive discussion with senior producer unifex about the role of the csm in the development process in particular release planning during the next development cycle some test projects will be undertaken to determine the best way to fold csm input into the process at earlier stageswinter 2012  eve futurebroad discussion of what ccp plans to do in the near medium and longterm including some preparation for discussions later in the summit some very interesting stuff is going into the pipelinethe state of incarnawe got a briefing on the goals ccp has for incarna large parts of this in the minutes may well be ndad but it was a very positive meetinglive eventsclosing out the day we had a session devoted to finding ways to encourage more live events both ccpcreated and also playercreated such as hulkageddon some interesting stuff imhothe final event was an excellent indian dinner at a restaurant fast becoming a csm favorite some of the ideas that came up in conversation were brilliant demented or both  the one about a special event during the alliance tournament being in the latter categoryccp unifex was sending email notes to himself during the entire dinner which allowed those seated nearby to consume more than their fair share of the naan
sorry if this is a nay sayer postbut what was the purpose of this againbecause i literally saw nothing of productive or constructive use in this postit might as well been completely ignored or droppedi mean all you said is you cameyou sawstuff was done but we cant tell you thatso we wontyou ateand you leftthats itnothing elsevery very poorwhats the point of saying anything at all if you have literally nothing to saynegative yeahespecially in light of recent eventsps and shouldnt this be in jita park since theres literally no content to benefit assembly hall stop the evemail spam
it is a life signt a reminder that we as the playerbase are not fogotten by our elected council i like it keep on
if you like political bull posting and fluff with candies and ice creams with promises of unicorns and rainbowssurewhatever floats your boat but i call bull stop the evemail spam
good teaser update ill be sure to check the final minutes img
i am sorry that you are disappointed that after 10 hours of meetings a working dinner and intense discussions late into the night your sleepdeprived and jetlagged representatives could not produce a detailed multipage synopsis of the meetings over breakfast and get it ndavetted before doing the premeeting prep for day 2given the 100 manhours of effort that will go into the production of those detailed notes  they are called minutes  and your obvious burning need to read them the only suggestion i can make is that you should run for the next csm get elected and attend the meetings in person no doubt you will do a much better job of informing the community than the current bunch of incompetentslove and kissestrebor
maybe you should learn to read before you respondi got more information out of twosteps posts in jita park than the horse crap you slung hereall youve told us is you went to a meeting and dined and thats itthere is litterally no contenta simple were posting the minutes soon so be patient with us would have been more productive than the tripe you posted therethis isnt jita parkwere not interested in your political grand standing and top hats with canes and monocles posturingif your going to communicatedo so with constructive information and not fluffattending 100s of hours meetings would imply a hell of alot more content than the mere excuse of ndathats like posting a document with black bars painted on the pagewhy bother posting in the first place if thats all you got stop the evemail spam
ah you gotta love your loyal fanbase
the way this works is that we are basically in meetings from about 0830 until 1800 local time with a few short breaks for three days straight we then all head out to dinner for some real talk chill time with the devs where a lot of the stuff discussed during the day that we ran out of time for gets delved into more deeply trebor managed to throw this quick summary together as he always manages to do somehow to give people at least a minimal update of our impressions of that days sessions after we all fly home well start working on the minutes while that is going on i will write up a blog that goes into a bit more detail about the summit as a whole more info is coming obviously but as the summit progresses it seems like folks would want to know at minimum that things are going well and there have been no incarnalevel type events take place yet v0v
which ones
dude for real what was political about that heres what i learned csm election process and structure are being looked into incarna discussons were started on day one always good more ccpplayer hosted live events and who doesnt like a dinner story you should thank your god of preference that trebor is there and posting and not darius
hillariousseriouslythats funnymara  oh the bulk of the threads where people are actually discussing crap that should be in this forummy point is theres something constructive going on over therethis is just grandstandingoh surewe are doing stuffokbut we cant tell you what it isyeahsure let us know when you actually start doing something thanks  stop the evemail spam
look at the cfc member crying guys
sorry drake i usually agree with most of what you say but over the last couple of days youve started making yourself sound like a complete tool you spent all that time trolling the other topic to say csm wasnt comunicative enough with us and now that you got what you wanted your complaining that they were actually paying attention to the player base just grow up man seriously its nice to get an update from time to time even if there isnt a great deal of content in itin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
i am as quick as anyone else to hold the csms feet to the fire but i call bull on you heretwo step is secretary and if hes putting out more informative posts that would be appropriate thats his officetrebor is nearlive blogging an ndaed event i think maybe you should cut him some slack here save the condemnation for a case where it is deservedthanks for the update trebor
hey trebor got a fan  of sortsinsert some waste of screen space here
thanks for the update trebor keep it up
to paraphrase a previous statement you made to me about my right to have my sayperhaps you should be a csm for 6 months minimum before you make any suggestions on the way they worki think most of us got plenty out of it and are glad to hear things are coming along well and it state very clearly it was but a teaser so i can only suggest that
nice writeup treb as a side note can you give greyscale ytterbium and other devs a spork with dev blogs are good engraved on them just to remind them that dev blogs of changes are good
csm is constantly encouraging ccp to communicate more and at the earliest possible stage in the process i think youll see more of this during the summer
drake you seriously need to calm the  down you were one of the ones yelling the loudest about lack of csm communicationat least trebor took the time to let us know about some of the basics that were covered in public speaking or presentations its a little thing called a keyword outline he let us know hey here is some of the stuff discussed to keep you all in the loop but ill get to details once the minutes are donethats a little thing called a professional courtesy so shove a pacifier in it and wait patiently like everyone elseand also learn to read he didnt say he attended 100s of hours of meetingshe said it will take 100s of man hours to comb through the detailed meeting notes to ensure there is no nda material in themi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
when are the minutes being released a week less more im looking for an estimate of posting date i havent followed the csm closely before so i dont have the schedules for the csm meetings listed anywhere drake has always sounded a bit like a tool this thread doesnt tell me anything other then youve had a meeting i guess that that is important but there is no meat in itof course teaser yeah little meat implied on a side note is there anywhere on the ccp forums that csm post their platforms
my point is communicaiton is pointless without contentthats itoh sure hes flapping his gumsbut thats all im seeing stop the evemail spam
i love how you get zero likes your basiclly asking for less communcation from the csm lol well if you dont like it keep your mouth shut so the rest of us can know what they are up too
you dont want to pvp give me your stuff and biomasswow hello kitty online and various other friendly mmos are over i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
sorry i just cant take people who use internetabbreviations seriouslyalso if they removed concord now theyd lose thousands of subscribers
can someone link where ccp has stated conclusively how concord is supposed to work or will this just be another i dont like gankers vs concords irrelevant threads
yes but if that were to happen what difference will these bombers make other than making the already existing weapons against supercaps less effecienti disagree with some of your points mainly because even if these ideas never take flight nullsec will still stagnate just like you described supercaps will spawn more and more there will be more supercap pilots as time progresses if what you say is true then with or without any new ideas the status que will remain as it is but let me ask you then what is preventing one of the big alliances from taking over nullsec right nowlets for fun say that this supercap system limit is the way things are with around 7500 systems 2500 of them are wormholes and not sov related by the 5000 remaining systems around 50 is npc controlled so an estimate is then 2500 systems which can be controlled lets say you get one titan per 10 system and 3 moms per 5 thatll be 250 titans and 1500 scs if you then take a look at this partial list of known supercap from eve24news link there should be around 471 titans and 1414 scs around numbers may vary of course since things blow up and get rebuild not to mention that not every single supercap has been identified would it not be better with just a little control that could be managed instead of limitless numbers that will eventually drown out everythingi shouldnt but i did it anyway what does that make me other than ignorant it makes me curious and helpful i see people suffer so i offer them a suggestion thats what this is these ideas are suggestions but they are not demands i do not claim any deeper knowledge of supers thus i do not demand any changes to them i simply offer helpful suggestions that other more proficient and knowing people can take turn and toss around and perhaps use to come to a new solution in short must i be a meteorologists in order to look up upon a dark sky and say i think its going to rainbesides its not like these reversals will doom you to eternal agony unless youre a hero tackler just saying
youve never fought supers so you wouldnt know anything about whod suffer it used to be drop supers  dd hics command ships logis  blap whatevers left no way to do a thing in supcaps then the dds got nerfed then the guns got nerfed so that supers would need a support fleet and were vulnerable to subcaps you want to remove the need for a support fleet and remove the vulnerability to subcaps putting us right back to where we were when the nc got steamrolledwhat else do you want to bring back aoe doomsday or even better remote doomsday
no ive never fought supers but i presume that you have right if yes then why not try to make something constructive of thisso far the only thing you have done is take one look at one part of my usefullness section and ignored the rest so much for useful posts from someone who seems to know alot and please dont presume to know all about my intentions what id like to see is multibillion isk warbeasts not getting cornered and captured by one or two lone people in some random system and then its offically game over from my view i dont really see that as fun or an aweinspiring moment basicly if you look at it what exactly can supers do today that a regular strong subcap fleet cant my point is why ever bring supers if they are good for nothing as far as i can see the only use they have is destroying carriers and dreads which is quite the freudian prospect paying upwards around 2070 billion just to stop two kinds of shipsdo be a dear and tell me exactly where i mentioned the vulnerabillity to all subcap fleets must disappear now in my first post as far as i know i only mentioned hero tacklers as a target
been flying in the geminate area recently and have noticed something that has really seemed to proliferate  sbu spamthat is the sov holding alliance places sbus on all gates within a system forcing any attacking entity to destroy those sbus then put up sbus then assault a system this is undesirable in my view as it creates more structure shooting and makes assaulting sov even more difficult than it already ishow can it be prevented i think the only way to stop this sbu spam practice is to render all sov based benefits inaccessible when a system is sbud no beacons no jbs no cyno jammers all upgrades rendered useless etc etc stations and station services can remain accessible in the interest of enabling pvp
honestly ive been out there before and gem changes hands so often and has so much fighting going on that sbuing your own system is the only way to prevent constantly having to grind sbus yourself its not horribly unreasonable for that to be going onalso if things worked like you suggest people would sbu just to harass alliances especially jb systems and would use sbus to take down cynojammers rather than having to actually fight the cynojammer pos itself i think ccp had the right idea when they kept sbus from affecting the sov upgrades
i personally agree with this just think everyone would have a prime opportunity to  in goonswarms corn flakesi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
its got nothing to do with goons you moran its got to do with a part of the game sbu spam which reduces the chance of a fight and promotes blobbing we cant drop into system with an 8man gang and drop an sbu to provoke a fight we can shoot one of the n sbus currently in place while the sov holder lols knowing we cant even carry enough ammo in our 8 ships to pop all his sbus if we do want to attack sov we have to start with 50100 dudes shooting sbus how many will the defender bring more to be sure
oops sorry youre quite correct my mistakeperhaps the license should exclude deadspace
i used to mine several years ago but moved on to missions more isk until they nerfed salvage lived in wh space for a while now i answer ctas and bash poses with the rest of my alliance mates in nulli just think that things are slanted a bit in favor of the ganker i want to provide some way preferably through a combination of player roles to even the odds a bit without buffing concord which is actually the cause of the problem in the first place
alright you misguided inbred selfabsorbed piece of walking human fecal excrement lets break this down in simple words that you can wrap your tiny intellect around im sure you dont have two misfiring synapses to rub together to jumpstart even the beginnings of a thought pattern without starting a fire in the big empty skull of yours a license to jam in high sec would spell disasterous results for already easily exploited mechanics lets break out an example shall wecorp a wardecs corp b corp b brings all of their friends in falcons with their jamming licenses suddenly corp a can not do  even with aggression from being jammed and suddenly there goes the fleet it will be like neutral rr all over again which created nothing but painfurthermore your weak argument of theyll have aggression on the jammer are you ing serious so lets say we get multiple ships that get jamming licences and decide to all go jam the same target at the same time tell me how are they able to aggress chances are they wont be able tobut i wouldnt expect you the child that should have been the load blasted on the wall after a quick pull out to understand that furthermore whos going to take a noob npc alt seriously stick around for a while and stop posting or even better just stop posting altogether and biomass because honestly wed hate for your blatant stupidity to rub off on any of the rookies that are actually worth somethingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

at last an actual argument thank youmy only answer to that is whats stopping corp a from bringing a bucket of jammers themselves but yeah that does sound like its opening the wrong door so how do we nerf concord the right amount

reasons why this is a terrible idea 1 incursion griefing get a license for a highsec incursion system find a nice blingy fleet running the incursion jam their logies scoop the blingy loot profit 2 griefing miners get a license for an ice mining system periodically decloak and jam the ice miners which will negate their entire mining cycle 3 grief the ever loving hell out of mission runners scan them down and permajam them preventing them from running the mission this is very easy to do to marauders if you want to attack people in highsec either declare war on them or suicide gank them i dont see how implementing this would be any good for the game
