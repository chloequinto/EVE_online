would you like to go ahead and show me where in the policy that an unlockable ship is considered to be in the shields or how in any way that was clarified want to field this one for me because right now you sound like an uneducated imbecile there a many situations where a ship may be unlockable perhaps a jammer on the tower has you jammed how would you know dont go pontificating on a topic you obviously know nothing about just to make your pedantic little self sound smarter than you actually arefreeaglon
its nice to see theres cohesion and serenity between ccp members and a very developed communication bridge between players and the gms im glad that the money im paying monthly is going for a good causesarcasmoffthis
okay now i have to ask a few questions at this pointwhere is the gigantic list of exploits that are not acceptable in one location ill take the time to read them as soon as i can find this list link please also the polite agreements outside official rules list and locationwhat does count as insideoutside bubble due to bad parking job and therefore bumpable in situations like these some clarification pleasei dont know any of the pilots involved on either side but i find it vaguely disturbing the lack of across the board gm communication and enforcement on specific decisions how whats acceptable in one region is a complete nogo in another etcis there a house rules book from one place to another i need to get ahold of so i dont get in trouble while learning eve and not wanting to bail as a rookie what are the variations of rules and their enforcement from highsec lowsec and nullsec are there differences if so please clearly explain as i dont understand that part of that whole sauce for the goose upbringing i had beat into my skull growing upif i dont know the sandbox arbitrary rules here and there im going to run into something thatll get me banned and i wont know it until its too latethe permaban in my opinion at this point either needs to be lifted or some reasons for it remaining passed to the player base the its an internal affair simply isnt going to fly on this one considering no clarification on the bumping in this titans situation has been released as why this is exploit when it does appear its occurred elsewhere and there was not a permaban handed out for those instanceseven the bestest peeps have kender moments this is sounding like one and the continuing silence reeks of if we ignore it long enough itll go awaythank you for your time this morningjeven
aglon has received a reply and was reduced to a 30 day ban still horse pos bumping does fall under pos bowling umbrellai would be detailed here but he asked not to be for fear of futher banningthey further state stuff about not being clear on circumstances so giving him the benefit of the doubt yada yadaso is this the latest rule no ship bumping unless lockable first still no clear post or word from ccp to the communityi will write off the lack of banning of the 00 guys as typical ccp favoritismgfygoofyps thanks for all of the support and effort put into this by so many people
i would still love to see what gm mails got the nc titan pilots p
good news that the ban is no longer permanent still heavy handed i feel but well take it i guess the bumpingpos bowling exploit notification still requires clarification or other groups will attempt to this down the road and this drama will repeat itself a central location listing all bannable exploits was a suggestion someone made earlier in the thread and is an excellent idea
glad to hear aglon will have the option to come back if he still wants to im not sure if anyone has gained any knowledge on the issue though i actually have a few more questions now that aglons sentence has been reduced and what that may mean
snip double posted
unfortunately no the question was never answered the point of the thread was to clarify upon the vague documentation about bumping a ship that is inside of a pos i am glad to see that algon had his ban reduced then again though i feel like the point of the thread was overlooked for any ccp members or gm members lurking in the thread or maybe monitoring the thread the question was the player was notified that if the ship is not lockable then it is in the pos can someone please show me the rule post etc that states this
i agree i can say the latest official response not seen by anyone or even read by the player in question because he is scared of getting banned even uttering the contents in his own head to one player is that unless it is lockable it is banablenow if they would just post that someplace for everyone the rule would be clear completely stupid but clear nice to know i can now bridge people with 40 of a titan sticking out of the pos and be safe make sense right ffs
just wait until someone gets bumped out and killed and is not reimbursed and the bumper doesnt get banned i give this about 3 or 4 weeks before it happens anyways glad he is not perma banned now we can finally shift our efforts over to the real issue of getting ccp to change this completely unrealistic and idiotic rule lockable may seem like a good way to define in or out for a newbie but we all know just how many situations can prevent you from locking a ship this is especially true when dealing around pos s so ccp you gonna use some logic today or just continue making ship skins for the lolsonly time will tell i suppose
i know ccp doesnt want to draw clear line for fear of people exploiting that but it would be nice if they at least told us things that are bannableand preferably issue temp bans and warnings when someone enters the grey area i dont understand why ccp permabans players when the rules arent clear
well thats better than expectedccp please surprise me and clarify the ruling in a way that makes legitimate sense
personally i dont like or use isboxerwould be hard to implement a fair accurate and consistent mechanism to ban people using itan attempt might cause more angst than its worth
its actually simple the problem is that it might generate a couple of false positives which imo is a fair price to pay
tldr if isboxer does not give an advantage to players that use it why do they use itit isnt about the single pilotcharacter of course any single pilotcharacter is no better than another its about the single player at a computer that is controlling the accounts the single player multiboxing 20 accounts with isboxer is gaining resources at 20x the rate of a single player with 1 accountlet us suppose that that second player also has 20 accounts all equally skilled but he is not using isboxer can heshe manage all 20 accounts as efficiently as the person using isboxer theoretically yes realistically hell no when an actual player has to manually input every action 20x he or she will make more mistakes than the isboxer it will also take 20x the time to make all those inputs if the activity is of a short enough duration it becomes mechanically impossible to do sothis kind of scenario comes into play when you get into pvp there is no way in hell one player can manually pilot a squad of bombers effectively without isboxer it requires simultaneous coordination across the entire fleet that cannot be attained with only one player across several accountsisboxer multiplies a single players inputs it reduces fatigue and the opportunity for mistakes by doing for the player what he otherwise could not do it is the difference between 1 guy running back and forth between 20 machine gun positions or 1 guy remotely controlling 20 machine guns when used for resource gathering it allows one player to gain an ingame advantage over other players that are not using it if it didnt there would be no reason to use itas for whether or not ccp could write code to detect isboxer of course they can they already have and use it to detect botswhen you have 20 guys in local and 18 of them are named borgcubexxx where xxx is a 3digit numeric sequence starting at 000 and ending at 020 all of them are in mackinaws all the ships are named the same and all of them are mining ice at the same anom from the same location in space or sitting at pos inactive because waiting for the ice anom to respawn its not hard to figure out what is going onccp already has detection algorithms for easily predictable botting methods ie specific actions being taken at specific intervals inhumanly long gaming sessions etc i see no reason they cannot do something similar for isboxer all it does is multiply one players inputs by however many accounts they have set up so the inputs should all arrive at the same time if they arent then either its not isboxer or they have another layer of automated input modificaton running to disguise or alter their inputsive seen the picture of some dude that tied 8 mice together with rubber bands and pencils as an illustration of how one could multibox in order to circumvent any multiboxing restrictions ccp might put in place of course i dare anyone to actually try something that obviously shoddy and facetious even if it mechanically and electrically worked good luck getting it to work consistently at that point youd be better off just buying plex and selling them on the market for all the rl effort being put into itthis is the unfortunate nature of sandbox gaming there will always be players that are so desperate to be better than the next player that they will take any advantage they can getimo isboxer provides an ingame advantage to a single player over other single players that do not use it as such it is my opinion that it should be banned
see soldarius gets what i was trying to portraywhere however pargellen you are like the player he was talking aboutlike the type i heard one of my brothers talking about with cod gamesthe twitch lag cheaters and suchthe ones that think they are so great and doing nothing wrongbut level the playing fieldand you are no better than the next guy in the belt
something else that at least adds to being suspicious is the striking similarities of the pilots of such fleetsto put it short im in full agreement to what you explained here thanks for that
interesting tell me more please
im not a ship balancer but in principle i like this idea
glad to see another person in favori am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
a secret star chamber is still a star chamber regardless of tinkering around who sits on it or how many the core of any ban reform must be the disclosure of who when and why bans are laid down for the community at large to digest and comment onfailure to do the above makes any proposed reform irrelevant imhoif ccp isnt willing to defend bans and their details in public on a case by case basis then perhaps said ban is ultimately indefensiblef
if they differ then by default the player should not be banned if the first guy feels strongly about it he should contact his supervisor who would make the final decision
this is really the problem if we were playing wow things would be much simpler in wow any sort of scamming or trolling is against the rules and doing those things will get you suspendednot permabanned on the first attempt so there is much less unclarityeve is much more grey and ccp ban process is influenced by community pressure they have dealt with undesirable behavior through immediate permabans this requires a much higher level of scrutiny to work
i can second this i have received death threats and racial hate speech multiple times i watchlist the offender and i have never seen one suspended the process is very inconsistent
this is what bothers me about the we cant give a line because players will toe it bit the point of the line is to correct player behavior most players even scammers and griefers will obey the rules if they know what those are if you screw up the line well you can always change it but you cant expect players to behave better if they dont know what they are doing wrongfalcons common sense reply makes no sense when you consider that most of the people being banned didnt believe what they were doing was banworthy and many gms dont even seem to believe its banworthy i think part of the issue comes down to slow inconsistent enforcement titan pos bumping has gotten a wide variety of responses depending the gm erotica1 was doing pretty much the same thing for several months with many petitions then we see sudden permabans over itwhen a group of people do x for months with no warnings they will continue to do x or may even do x1 still no warning so x2 then we see a permaban which is seemingly out of nowhere and people saying i have pretty much been doing this for several months why am i suddenly permabanned
thats the other part that is irritating about this whole charade most of this is being actioned by one gm and appeals denied by the same guy and they expect me to trust this
deciding whether or not to enable a new use for plex on the basis that it might change plex prices is not imo how one makes good balance decisionsthe only thing ops proposal will do is reduce the amount of tears one sheds every time one looks at all those level 5s they really want and have to spend a butttonne of time to get or accelerate one into some of those extremely high multiplier speciality skills the actual benefits are typically very smallplex for remaps sounds fine to me supported

thank  i was loosing faith in ccp for a moment due to the utter madness in permabanning a player who has been playing and contributing to the game for so long out of the blue like that we still desperately need clarification on the exploit at hand thoughthanks to all who expressed their concern at aglons ban and spoke up about it
hello i apologize for the long wait ive read every post in this thread and im going to comment on some of the major concerns raisedi can not make any comment on the outcome of individual reimbursement tickets or specific account suspensions this is a matter of policy and im sorry that some of your questions might go unansweredpos bowlingfirst off here is the clarification youve all requestedif a ship can be locked and fired upon it can be legitimately bumped if a ship cannot be locked due to its position within a forcefield it should be protected by said forcefield such a ship can only be legitimately bumped out of the forcefield with proper access rights to enter the forcefieldcyno bumping was also considered an exploit until it was fixed with the oceanus releasepublic exploit notificationsi acknowledge that theres been a lack of clarity concerning the exploit status of this particular nuance of pos bowling this was our failure we havent done a good job communicating about this exploit and i humbly apologize for this mistake on our part we will make an effort to react more quickly to requests for clarification of this sort in the future we will also take steps to improve visibility of public exploit announcements that are still in effect it is a very reasonable complaint that exploit announcements are currently only found buried under months or even years of news items moving forward we will per suggestions in this thread and from the csm maintain an archive of some sort of publicly announced exploits still in effect do keep in mind however that this will not be a comprehensive list of prohibited activity within the game such a list is not realistic as exploits are often not known to us until theyre abused the drone damage exploit from this summer is a good example of this the bug enabling this exploit had potentially existed for a long time before it became known to us it should however have been very clear to anyone abusing that exploit that they were utilizing a game bug to increase the damage output of their drones beyond what was intended by the gamesome exploits are also discovered and fixed before they see widespread abuse in such cases we deem it best not to publicly announce the existence of the exploit since it could very well backfire and result in widespread abuse before the bug is addressedin short lack of an official ccp announcement regarding is not a free license to abuse game bugs without repercussions abuse of an bugexploit is not okay just because we havent yet publicly stated that abuse of this particular exploit wont be tolerated if in doubt file a support ticket and ask if what youre doingintending to do is prohibited or not we do not punish players who stumble on an exploit and report it to us in good faithi want to clearly state that the variant of pos bowling this thread covers is a special case clarification was absolutely necessary and we fully admit our mistake in this regard it wasnt clear to you our players that this was an exploit and it is therefore a different case than to make a hypothetical example an item duping exploit which hasnt been publicly announcedexploits and account suspensionswe take exploit abuse extremely seriously especially when the exploit in question has been publicly designated as such action is taken when a player is verified to have exploited a game bug to hisher advantage the severity of the exploit and the players warningban history are both factors in determining which action is takenaccount suspensions are not a luck of the draw as some have suggested all gms operate under the same processes and procedures and we do not make any distinction based on a players corporationalliance affiliation the same ruleset applies to all eve playerswe will not suspend a players account based on player testimony youtube videos or playersubmitted screenshots alone a decision to suspend a players account must always be backed up by information in our serverside logs we do not arbitrarily ban players that is not to say that we never make mistakes we are after all human there are however strict internal guidelines regarding account suspension and we dont ban players for exploit abuse without evidencebest regards lead gm lelouch ccp customer support  eve online  dust 514
all the players require quite often is clarity its nice to see you put your hands up to failings in this instance and it seems a wrong from those failings has been rectifiednice post gm lelouch destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
if so whay warent the nc titan pilots baned im not talking about a perma ban
then please make it so that said ship is lockable if its partly sticking out of the forcefield having looked at the image of the original titan and bubble id have gone for the bump as well and would happily have whored on the resultant km if id been onlinei get cyno bumping is an exploit as clearly you can bump something out which is inside the forcefield completely i get awoxing the pos password andor corp is legit but if your titan is sticking out of the pos and isnt lockable then that is a game play  visual issue not an exploit issue eve is hard enough to play without having to worry about exploits especially when you feel you are playing within the rules should we take a screen shot and ask which titans we are allowed to bump out of the pos how much needs to be sticking out before it becomes lockable i know for instance that if you are repping a pos with a carrier and you are aligned along the shield line horizontally you are lockable and therefore a legitimate bump target however the second you turn into the pos your carrier is not lockable as the targetable zone is a cuboid and turns into the pos shield your ship does not need to move for this effect to happen it just needs to turn is this not abusing the same game exploit but from the opposite waythen what happens if someone is powering towards you in their machariel as you turn into the pos shield they lose target lock in the last 2 seconds before they hit you hey presto instant banhammer especially if that bump does put the carrier out of the shield technically the mach pilot has done nothing wrong herebut they have used an exploit just as much as you have by turning into the pos shieldyes i know this is edge case scenario but ffs make pos shields and bumping work sensiblyimho it should be quite simple  ship model inside shields ship safe ship model partly outside shields ship targetable bumpable and shootable it should not be that hard to make that code work if it is that hard give me a call and ill write it for youthis case specificallyas to the outcome  i get you cant comment as a gm but it seems every player that has looked at this has the same opinion  and when your entire player base including plenty of shadow cartels reds i hasten to add is on one side and one gm is on the other then perhaps that gm is wrong reduction to a timed ban is progress but really the ban should be revoked totallyfundamentally the underlying question is was this person trying to abuse an exploit
thankyou for the clarification and follow up gm lelouch
indeed thank you for the clarification it is not exactly the answer i assume all of us were wanting however an answer never less
thanks for the clarification ccp lelouch and thanks for looking into the situation about the ban and remedying itcheers
thank you for the clarification see that wasnt hard was it puts pliers awaynow that its confirmed unacceptable exploiting to interact with a titan from outside of the pos field when the titan is unlockable thus effectively making all posbridge titans unkillable i think you also look into the other potential exploit  unfair game mechanic which allows titans to interact with ships outside of the pos field whilst themselves being protected by the same ie bridging through the shieldthanks community manager wwwbattlecliniccom battleclinic loadouts  killboards  forums twitter anabariceve wwwthebastardsnet recruitment open
i believe the word youre looking for is suspended as banning implies something permanent
so how is one supposed to kill a pos titan theres no actual way to do it is thereseems like a bug to me
you dont i did not agree with the gms response
kill the pos
we live in low sec  caging does not exist
so if the ban has been overturned as a mistake is it safe to assume the reimbursement has been taken awayreduced to the same amount
huh that is really interesting i put it to you that your colleague senior gm karidor does not share this ethic
i assume this only applies to bans for exploiting otherwise how does this mesh with your policy on outofgame harassment which by its nature has to rely on playersubmitted evidence
soldarius wrotetldr if isboxer does not give an advantage to players that use it why do they use itahh but there is a flaw in youf logic the flaw is that ccp doesnt care about advantage to the player if they were concerned about one player gaining advantage over another player then anyone who had more alts than another player or any player who could afford to sell more plex or any of a hundred different things would be in violation ccp cares about giving advantagd to the accountbesides as has already been stated but youve chosen to ignore for your own convienence is that the main perks of isboxer can be duplicated through a pure hardware solution this pure hardware solution found on page 1 of this very thread incidentally is the reason isboxer was removed from the list of software that could get you banned for the price of a highend gaming desktop computer i can use this pure hardware solution to run 1020 accounts st once all performing the exact same actions all without isboxer
mmhmm more likes pleasewhat do you think of making the those 4 ships have really low mass 250300k tonnes with three lows to match it with jfs

i have been wondering all fine and dandy but this makes no difference to small entities aslong as 1000 baltecs ishtars or we its the numbers not the ships beeing fieldedif large null sec groups wont be able to bring in their mass archons they will bring in their mass subcaps still resulting in smaller groups not having a chance in any nulljump bridgesportal are affected as well but slowing down everything stops escelations to happen so this will most likely end in less pvp than actually more pvpsov holding alliances are basically locked in their own regions so smaller groups will have to venture into their sov ending up within 5ly and therefore beeing blobbed to fck againi am afraid that this change will infact buff large null groups instead of nerfing them as they can turn their space into a bulwark gettin phat of that moon gooits a nice idea but still needs a whole lot of workhow about working on a cyno mass limit within a certain range of the cyno for example like 5 supers per cyno within 25au 
introducing mechanics to slow down travel and make getting around more inconvenient no more suicideclones sounds like a bad idea part of a bad plan that is trying to fix a bad idea i dont think ive ever been playing and wished that i could travel more slowly getting from point a to b in eve already occupies a lot of time will increasing the time to travel increase the time required to play the game and get anything out of it im already on the verge of letting my account expire due to not having enough time to dedicate many aspects of the game already border on or cross into the realm of being a fulltime hobbyit could end up making the game boring for a lot of players if it doesnt actually work as desired
apart from death threats i had the police visit me a couple of years ago over an alleged  i committed on a 10 year old girl in a country ive never been to when id never even held a passport what made this worse was i had reported the people who threatened me with this all over an awoxed orca to ccp  they did nothing about it while likely giving the police the information they needed to track me down over a false allegation
its not inconsistentits biased and that is absolutely not okay
ccp is not a judicial body its a small video game company they can only devote very few resources to policing the online interactions of their hundreds of thousands of customers so it would be unrealistic to expected them to do it very well however with that in mind i think that we have a right to expect that in all but the most egregious of offenses they would use warnings and temporary bans to keep player behavior from straying too close to the line permabannings should be only used after multiple temporary bans and in cases in which a player poses an actual danger to the safety and quality of life of another player such as in the case of the fellow who accused mallak azaria of  and reported him to the police or the fellow who made threatening phone calls to psychotic monks girlfriend and employerthe practice of having appeals processed by the same individual who decided on the ban in the first place is so unprofessional that i dont even know what ccp could be thinking on that one
i feel there are only two ways to go with this and its the middle ground that ccp has gotten into trouble with1 publish every ban preceding warnings and narrative on cause for the community to review and comment on this way the community can at least be assured arbitrary star chamber executions are not being done by individual employees grinding personal axes they can decide on a personal level if they agree with said bans or not and make informed choices to continue subscriptions additionally they would get a clearer lens into where the line actually falls helping them avoid crossing it this is not a bad thingor2 ban in complete secrecy and cut the crap with nebulous real life harassment posts in the forums that use timely insinuations to smear players without sacking up to actually accuse individuals of anything letting the pansies in the mob do your dirty work for you ban in complete secrecy and only say no comment when asked and live with any player backlash accompanying thatany tweaks to process etc beyond that will be ultimately fail imho they need to go either full disclosure or full secrecy and live with all each choice entailsf
now before anyone cries foul and wants me tried for heresy hear me out i am a player who enjoys eve especially the carnage in space however walking in stations could be implemented without taking too many resources from other development assetsif a small team 13 devs were allocated to do piecemeal work on wis per patch cycle it could be expanded the primary focus of course would be the spaceships aspect of eve but here are a few suggestions just off the cuff decorum for cq interactable items ie drinks smokes medal displays etc being able to display certain loot items on the wall expansion of cq to include hangar not just the gantry leading to your ship gambling and vending machines in a promenade or concourse area shops agent hubs actual corporate offices and meeting rooms bars clubs et ceteraanything the imagination can really manifest in a reasonable fashion could be implemented bit by bit this way in a year or two there would be expansive environments for those who wanted them and you could still opt out of using it if you so choose hell allow pilots to even interact with dust bunnies on station i believe this reasonable but as initially stated space would still be the primary priority along with mechanicsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

iUFFFDll give you an outsiderUFFFDs view of what has just happened you knew that ccp would release a dev blog during october about the first nullsec changes sion indicated that the jump distance nerf and cooldown proposals were discussed at the summit when he omitted these from his list of what was not discussed you decided that a preemptive strike was required rather than working with ccp on the rest of the changes which were evidently going to be figured out before the second week in october the letter was an attempt to take the initiative from ccp on the changes and to drive the agenda in a desirable direction rather than allowing this to occur ccp published the dev blog early and you were therefore not adequately consulted in summary you gave the finger to ccp by trying to take control of the agenda along with the null bloc leaders they in turn gave you the finger by not consulting with you on some of the changes your position has been publicly stated and your usefulness to ccp is diminishedas an aside does this mean that you did not agree with the jump distance nerf and cooldown proposals at the summit my interpretation was that csm sentiment was generally positive following the summit i am puzzled  perhaps you were just afraid of being seen as irrelevant through lack of involvement also are you still broadly opposed to the additional changes as per the article or was this just kneejerk on sions partwhat else could we have done i hear you ask you clearly knew about the letter in advance and could have counselled that it should not be released it would obviously have been released anyway so you could have immediately published a csm statement in reply this would have been along the lines of UFFFDcsm understands why the letter was necessary csm understands the issues and these are the subject of extensive discussion with ccp csm understands that ccp has the right to drive the agenda in their game a roadmap of the alreadydrafted changes will be published in a couple of weeks and we suggest you wait for themUFFFDas it is the letter looks impotent and so does the csm now you have to choose how best to represent your communities i suggest that this is not done by always taking a popular position or a position that is defined by your leadersi think you have harmed the csm as an institution i think you have nerfed your own ability to guide ccp through the most important changes that have hit this game in a long time possibly ever i think that trying to wrestle the agenda from ccp when you knew that change was imminent was a mistake you have a privileged position which you have diminished by confusing null politics with your actual intermediary role
this serves no real purpose as it does not truly fill any role gaps i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
 im really speechless after reading that the mittani article about ccp greyscale and co throwing csm9 under the buseditbtw  is part of the csm boycotting the jump changes threadnaught cause i only see one csm posting recently in page mid 200s
fatigue numbers crunchedwith numbers in hand many short jumps are enemently managable as are a few long jumps it is only the redeploy from north to south where it becomes entirely unreasonable killing this sort of projection across half of eve so you can effectively deploy any capital you can log on into something like br or asakai limits their scale but also encourages more capital production to prestage at least a moderate response force within a single jump of most of the border of alliances and have clones ready to go it pushes strategy from 23 hours ahead and pick a timezone to days and weeks ahead and pushes building schedules out further its a good and bad thing at the same time it kills the pl what will we drop next and deescalates the insanely large cap and supercap fights because of the inherent inability of many of your pilots to disengage back out of the kill pocket as putting high dps low ehp fleets on the gates of the main fight should also start spreading load and still be relevant to the capitals slugging it out
honestly any empire sprawling as much as n3pl or goons should have been forced to divide membership into regional fleets the lul lets throw everyone into a single fight and be back to defend our timers all over our territory in an hour was ridiculous to start

tinfoil
huh what bit it is all thoroughly defensible i am not suggesting any grand conspiracy but rather criticising actions
i cant speak for the members who did sign it i can speak for myselfi didnt sign it because it struck me as pointless grandstanding at least from the perspective of nonnull csm membersfor those members who live out in null i can see a couple of pressures on them to get their name on such things 1 from the alliance leadership for the alliance theyre part of 2 so when it comes round to election time again they can point at it and say look i did stuff at something which isnt as dense as the minutesthe csm works best when its not pressuring ccp assuming that ccp isnt doing something batshit insane when you have to be willing to burn all your bridges as theres no way for the csm to force anything to happen or for particular developers to interact with them
yeah im gonna agree with mallak here this is pretty tinfoily and more significantly pretty wrong the short version is i signed it because i agreed with it and the letter had been something in the works long before any of this had been discussed
i have idea how to fix sovereignty system this idea makes it completely impossible to maintain sovereignty in inactive solar systems i made earlier this proposal in long thread in featuresideas discussion but i think no one noticed it in middle of endless supply of messagesall kind of activities like mining and ratting have change to produce sovereignty objects in each capturable solar system i call these objects now sovereignty crystals each capturable solar system has its own sovereignty crystal territorial claim unit needs these sovereignty crystals to be activeonly way to maintain sovereignty is to do something in that solar system these sovereignty crystals can be sold in market solar system truesec would determine drop rate for sovereignty crystals 00 would be the easiest to keep sovereignty the highest drop rate for crystals and 10 would be the hardest to keep sovereignty since there is the lowest drop rate for system sovereignty crystalscomments are welcome for my idea

in general i like the direction ccp is going with the rebalance of ships and items and expansion of content over the past 2 years or so but along the way a lot of little things some bigger than others need fixing and affect game play in a frustrating way ccp has put up forums for UFFFD10000 little thingsUFFFD but iUFFFDd like to add to thatUFFFD most of these fixes should be simple1 war history the system really needs a better filter system as it sits the war history goes by the start date of a warUFFFD which is understandable for when a war is pending but if say that war lasts for months and you have a lot of wars when it ends itUFFFDs listed in the history at the beginning date this is a pain if you are wanting to see what wars have most recently ended thus a filter should be implemented to go by either start dates or by end dates i would further suggest being able to see a history page of just wars between two sides as it is nowUFFFD you have to go through an entire history list to scroll through in order to surmise say a total wars kl history2 overview filter i like the improvement of the ov filter but a glaring mistake was made the filter currently and stay with me here filters out any condition that a pilot may have so iUFFFDm talking about an exclusion list with an option to have an inclusion list simply put all pilots are neutral to you unless you change his standingUFFFD ok but a pilot may also have a bounty on him or have a 5 sec status say you donUFFFDt care to see pilots with bounties on them or those with 5 sec statusUFFFD but you do want to see a pilot you set to terrible standing if you turn off UFFFDbounty has pilot on himUFFFD in your filter and the pilots you want to see have a bounty on himUFFFD guess what the filter blocks it out so basically the filter doesnUFFFDt do the job you want it to do the solution as i stated before is to have an UFFFDinclusion optionfilterUFFFD so that if a pilot fulfills only what you want to seeUFFFD no matter what other condition he hasUFFFD he shows up on your overview this to me seems like a reasonable request on ccp and probably isnUFFFDt that difficult to do3 local updating ok so this may be more of a technical glitch but weUFFFDve been seeing a lot of issues with pilots not updating on overview properly be it war targets suspects kill rights or even blue status tags on overview or in local chat this has created a lot of issues up to not being able to shoot at a known war target because it didnUFFFDt update properly4 sisi seriouslyUFFFD is there a reason why thereUFFFDs no faction mods available to purchase for builds would love to test some fits but every now and then a faction mod is part of the build and if i donUFFFDt already have it i canUFFFDt buy it on sisi 5 corporation office fees iUFFFDm sure just about everyone in real life pays rent or a mortgage to someoneUFFFD right we sign contracts with set terms of a course of a specified time frame you know what you are going to pay to your lender every month and when that contract period is up if you are renting you resign a contractUFFFD maybe at a new rate or you say UFFFDno thank youUFFFD and you move out typically any increase is a nominal percentage everyone with me so why in eve do rental office prices change every fraking month and itUFFFDs not even a noticeUFFFD itUFFFDs just changed on your billUFFFD so like most i have autopay on for rentUFFFD cause rent isnUFFFDt typically all that muchUFFFD under a milUFFFD maybe a little more if it was higher than that iUFFFDd just say forget you iUFFFDll go somewhere else but noUFFFD price change is just adjusted any to amountUFFFD no nominal percentage and suddenly that 1 mil rental due to some sudden spike in tenancy just went to 50 mil ladies and gentsUFFFD call me dumb for not caring to check my pending bills in eve for rent that shouldnUFFFDt be my main concern but i didnUFFFDt notice till my corp paid a 123 mil bill in rent and i was looking at the corp account scratching my head saying UFFFDwhere the hell is this isk goingUFFFD then i spotted itUFFFD dramatic escalation of rent on 3 locationsUFFFD so i had rent of 126k isk then a freaking 123 mil isk seriously whereUFFFDs the common sense to that a gm kindly told me prices are adjusted monthly and you get your bill in advance so you know the cost changes while that in itself isnUFFFDt cool i rather didnUFFFDt expect a 1000 increase for an office rental does this really make any sense to you ccp thatUFFFDs just straight out mess up solutiona contract lengths and terms of cost the whole world does this why donUFFFDt youb send an eve mail notification of 30 day 15 days and 5 days before contract end with new terms to continue the rentalc have different rental length terms 1 month 3 months 6 months  1 year d maybe have a payment option of per month or per terme why the hell did i really have to give this example on something so common sensemore to be added in second post
the more troublesome issues1 interceptors i donUFFFDt know how many people warned you boys at ccp that the bubble immunity on interceptors would turn ridicules and it has theyUFFFDre already the most nimble ship in the game and with the immunityUFFFD youUFFFDve made it the travel safe ship without any reasonable counter youUFFFDd have to have a huge camp of smart bombing ships that can be close enough to the interceptorUFFFDs drop off from a gate to have any hope of destroying one whereUFFFDs the risk in this ship the nil tank hardly an argument when the interceptor can very easily pick its fights UFFFDbut itUFFFDs a cool bonusUFFFD yes but itUFFFDs on the wrong ship an interdictor would have been a far more logical choice that helps that class fill its roll and not instantly become fodder from an opposing fleet because itUFFFDs trapped by its very own role UFFFDbut an interceptor is supposed to be able to interceptUFFFD yes but itUFFFDs speed and agility are its assets if an enemy fleet on gate has a bubble up theyUFFFDre locked in too unless theyUFFFDre in a bubble null t3 if an interceptor is chasing a target itUFFFDs still going to be far superior in speed to get out of that bubble and if an enemy fleet is sitting on that bubbled gateUFFFD itUFFFDs not exactly UFFFDinterceptingUFFFD anymore if your buddies are on just the other side of the gate the logic is lacking for this bonus to be on the interceptor pure and simple2 along with that issue is the crazy align times of frigates any frigate can just about evade a none bubbled gate camp that even has an interceptor with them and high scan res obviously not all but any interceptor properly fit should be able to lock another interceptor much less a frigate without much issue weUFFFDve had an interceptor with a 4000 scan res that canUFFFDt even start locking another interceptor this mainly due to a target being still invulnerable while the cloaking effect comes off but for that traveling interceptor or frigate heUFFFDs already aligning and in warp before that cloaking effect barely even begins to come off does that make any sense now to add to that server lagUFFFD so many times in general weUFFFDve locked a target our mods are preheated but nope point doesnUFFFDt land because UFFFDtarget already in warpUFFFD soUFFFD whatUFFFDs the use of an interceptor that canUFFFDt even properly intercept even when itUFFFDs boosted through the roof does that make any sense noUFFFD solution and i know everyone will groan and hate but honestly any ship with combat or tactical ability should not be nigh unlockable by another high scan res ship now i hear people say UFFFDwe catch them all the time l2pvpUFFFD iUFFFDm not talking popping them as they undock on station other than that i call bs if you claim to catch a guy thatUFFFDs alert and blows through your campUFFFD not auto piloting or just being stupid the solution isa to increase align times across the board through the ship classes take into account server lag leave the fastest align times to pods and then shuttles that gives shuttles a worthy advantage but itUFFFDs not armed nor can be fit with anything tacticalb make a target lockable the moment it appears on overview obviously if he begins to move heUFFFDs at hisher keyboard actively piloting 3 cloaks iUFFFDm gonna get hate here as well but you all know this is rightUFFFD this game is based on pvp not always avoiding it real simple here cloaks have a delay to recloak right itUFFFDs already in thereUFFFD so why the hell can people immediately recloak after coming out of a gate cloak now before you blow your top and say itUFFFDs not the ship mod used going through the gateUFFFD i understand thatUFFFD but itUFFFDs the cloak effect that should cause the delayUFFFD period UFFFDbut now youUFFFDve penalized ships that have cloaking bonuses rageUFFFD easy work around give those ships with cloaking bonuses another bonus to negate that people in regular combat ships again having a near free pass to align cloak decloak warp is pure bs UFFFDbut they take a locking penaltyUFFFD yeah theyUFFFDre also in a ship not designed with cloak in mind having that cloak delay at least properly inhibits a ship that doesnUFFFDt have that cloaking bonus in all areas think about the good of the game as a wholeUFFFD not just how it affects you point is ships get subverted in use because other ships exploit the loopholes i tend to think thatUFFFDs a bad thing so here are just a few issuesUFFFD i know thereUFFFDs plenty more some should be a no brainer to fix or incorporate while others will take time to figure out this isnUFFFDt a whine thread for goodness sake iUFFFDve been playing this game for over 6 yearsUFFFD i roll with the punches and adjust as needed for the most part i know iUFFFDm not the only one that feels this way on most of these topics weUFFFDre all in the same ccp boatUFFFD it would just be nice if ccp rowed in the same direction as us more often than they do i love the game will always play it but that doesnUFFFDt mean i like all the things they do while i donUFFFDt expect all things to changeUFFFD it sure would be nice if even just the simple ones were handled in a timely mannerthanks for reading try to be constructive with comments i know where the flames will come in but at least try to acknowledge all the items on the listUFFFD iUFFFDm sure thereUFFFDs a few on there that just about everyone would like to see
opiniongood start but it needs tweaking which it has been doing as we wade through the threadnaught ie deathcloning and max fatiguei think i wont win all the arguments but i keep trying anywaysthis is one step in the null changes on the roadmap please do not consider it the solution but a startm
in any way you suggest this and in a way i agree with you people will just say those 13 devs could have been working on something else spaceship related especially in regards to broken stuff which there still isive heard it suggested that ccp should do it but not advertise that they are doing it and at one expansion that has other cool additions slip this new content out saying oh btw theres new cq content too enjoywhich tbh would be the best way to handle it

i dont think name changes should be brought into eve however i can understand why some people would like the chance to change a name they picked in their earlier yearsfor me the only way to introduce name changes into eve is to let every character have one name change you dont need to purchase it or have a certain security status every single character gets one chance to rename themselvesthe new name gets placed on the main character sheet so its easy to seeeg archibald thistlewaite iiiformaly known as mad dog mcgrueit is also highlighted in the employment history when and which corp you were a member off when the name was changedby limiting it to only once it reduces names changes being the way to avoid the consequences of your more dubious activities although your old name will appear right next to your new name when people show info on youfor the character bazaar it allows you to ask a premium for your character if it has a name change available if you are buying you can either pick a character with a name you like or pick one with a rename available then its up to you if you want to rename and reduce the value on any sell on
not a fan of this idea mainly got issues with people buying a char then renaming them you want to pick your toons name then you have to start from scratch like the rest of us also some eve lore and history might be effected not to mention renaming bait alts
thank you for both the clarification and the upcoming hopefully very soon consolidation and easy to find current exploitstrouble for youse listingthat really was what ive been after and though there was something of a delay in getting an official reply on this instance in particular and some other complaints posted here in general there was a reply and i do thank you for thatyoure right mistakes do happen were humanand we all have our kender oops moments as wellthank you for owning this kender moment and taking the initial steps to keep this particular oops from happening againjeven
agreed my history of pvp have been horrible fc choices of leaving single targets alone for attacking a target on a gate in a system of 300 reds as if the other reds in system wouldnt respond or you meet blobsmy clone i think cost 52m which is the minimum i need for 154m sp so without implants even then a death if a good amount when you dont make isk or takes most of a day to make up for a frigate death so now i avoid pvp and have to try and get an alt up to go do that and keep it limited
i have ships spread across high and this would be a big boost to move them in one spot
well hopefully this can be made a realityi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i like the idea moving of fitted ships are a pain i would love to see a t2 variant with less tank ability but gain jump capabilitybut this idea i give a 1
why thank you id like to see that too but one step at a timei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
what ive always noticed is that the more offices at a station equals more rent ive seen places that be far more then that
and there of course is something regarding cloakingit is the most balanced mechanic in game and is working as intended quit trying to break working mechanicsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
eve  everyone vs everyonewith that said best to assume everyone hostile until otherwise proven removing local without something to replace it would not go well unless you want to hear bleating carebears for months on end id say let ccp figure it outi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i support this but i would like to see previous names on the characters bio also keep alliance standings the same for a nrds player i need standings to survive
ok i like the potential sp loss mechanic i actually do and ive ended up retraining skills for like a week at a time the thing i do not like is the monumental cost of clones after a while now i am only somewhere around the 1 million mark on the cost but that makes it really really easy to go broke really fast just flying frigates into pvp i imagine that after a while i wont be able to pvp on this toon at all due to the extreme cost keep the mechanic but drop the cost of the clones way the  downccp says they want to generate more fights thats great and all but if our clones cost more than our ships after a while youre going to find that most of us are going to avoid pvp
still no as it still serves no purposei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
ojust updating this thread after the announced jump changes and this en24 article thanks for the nod matterallmedical clone costs are obviously an older mechanic than jump fatigue despite this explanation its still part of the game and theyre about to coexist as game mechanics if this is allowed to happen the message sent by ccp would seem to be something along the lines of stop playing the game so much youre exceeding your share of load on our serversthats a relatively serious accusation to make but it is a simple fix and mostly a mistake of treating medical clone replacement as if eve was default freetoplaywith just one character at 100 million sp i could exceed the value of a plex in medical clone costs within a week thats assuming i only lose my pod every other outing a plex per week just to play with one character i dont see how a player is supposed to have that type of income per charactermost if not all other aspects of the game as well as common sense promote sp as a good idea but medical clone costs make me wonder if subscriptions are designed to taper off after a few yearsmeanwhile dear everyone in eve dont die
imagine a society where anyone can come up a deck you in your face with no consequences that is eve
that too is a valid point at some point it would be nice to be able to take a stroll through the station and explore see things interact et ceterai am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
first i must say your really pushing and sound very needy constantly posting to bump it up however i would like to see something happen to that door that stops even immortal capsuleers but not something that extensive maybe a gathering area for all of eve to talk to dusties and pilots all in one placei do know i have put something to this extent on every single survey i filled out for this game for several years
so i doubt it will happen any time soon
1instead of having your devs recruited by riot you could give them something to work on
im gonna support you on this one lets face it for a lot of us the time spent online is spent docked up and just chatting so in those regards wis would actually be a nice change
i still say what i said before incarnawalking in stations for the sake of walking is completely boring people may do it once or twice to watch the scenery but other than that they will sit in their ships and just put it on ignore as they do about the captains prison one of the first things i do after a fresh install is to move to hangar view and then never ever back to the prison celladd fighting in stations boarding stations and stuff like that and you have something interresting however
they can already do this on the serenity server not sure what the requirements are for it though
dude with 120 srf complaining clone costs are too high what a time to be alivealso  no
thank you for replyingnevermind my org its true im covered and ive made up my mind to make myself a strategic assetonly ive had my fill of riskfree pve before arriving here but now its time to see what i can bring down to bear for the sake of my fcas for your org assuming the highest reimbursement category available to you how many losses can you incur before your medical clone costs are out of pocketif you do a drilldown of all the orgs that have a reimbursement policy in place and assume their best reimbursement category how many of them provide reimbursement that will cover clone costs until eventually the character requires an injection of isk for medical cloneshow much gameplay are you being kept from by medical clone costs i see you spend a lot of time shooting deployables in high sec and participating in irrelevant lowsec pvp where pods are left alone by all but the more killmailhungry groups i assume the safety of your pod was a consideration in these gameplay choices are you free of this issue now that youve made a sarcastic remark on the stellar reimbursement policy i have so graciously been covered byso arent you the one who stands to get hit consistently by med clone costs out of pocket or is your plan to stay in highsec shooting mtus foreverwhat im saying is its cute that you feel safe but thats due to your risk averse choices medical clone costs affect everyone and especially those who are not gsfare you about to tell me the solution to medical clone costs is dont die i hope im not the one to break this to you but some groups like my groups promote ship loss on ops lest we become station camped like blwere not just skilled were suicidal so please try to kill me before we kill you in fact make me primary and get my pod so some other corp in a hictor doesnt get a lone pod kill to justify his existence i need my reimbursements so i can reship and throw myself at you again
cfc for 3 years i know how space rich everybody down there isi have flown an ishtar in havens and hubs as stated for 3 years if you cant afford a high grade clone with all that srf and ratting you are doing something wrong despite your clone costs so if you check up on me do it properly at leasthigh clone costs are a good way to balance the game and give vets with a high isk income something to spend that stuff on especially in the extremely safe and profitable null sec regions but despite that it counts for all areas of eve from null to high to wh secso if you are afraid to loose your fancy pod leave the blue donut back to high sec or do it like i do shoot mtus in high sec and engage in irrelevant low sec engagements like that would ever be more fun that 1000 ishtar f1 also stop talking like a  or i have to assume that you are trollingmy point standsedit  or is it the issue of isboxing rain 6635 6636 6637 6638 and 6639 and having to pay for their pods 
no i dont think were trolling were just being mean and when i replied to you i may have been on ambien i wasanyway ishtar ratting for three years then mtus then lowsec i think we are on directly opposite paths here except i dont plan to rat i recall doing that in a drake in curse back in 2009 it was not fun the activities you list are either pve or nonsov pvp so im still not sure you can relatethis isnt about being afraid to lose muhpod its about enjoying welpy live peoplecontent but being unable to afford it indefinitely youve decided not to deal with it is that correct
today i must announce from the csm thanks to ccp and anyone who voted for me for giving me this unique opportunity i also wish the best of luck to my replacementaxiossilva

why not you already said youre bringing a new guy in despite the lack of time so that cant be the deciding factor
is rolleyes appopriate here 
i hope so probably
i did sign it and stand behind the ideas posted there as direction the piece has been overtaken fast by the current null changes that ccp laid down i can asure you that the csm is very much involved with ccp and that there is no breach of trust or sofor example out of my personal experience is eve online facebook and twitter both naming my eve 24 interview and pushing it therefore internally forums and channels are filled with interaction with ccp today and yesterday we have life meetings about this and eve s future if anything the letter showed unity amongst most null sec focused csm members and a believe in eve s future and its direction was it in hindsight necesarry nopei feel i function just as  or good as i did before
the idea that the sov crystals could be sold is terrible just means renting alliances would mandate you give them your crystals  really simple fix  track the amount of time logged in the system by a given corp congratulations you live there and affect the sov
ive been waiting for this since they originally announced it the ability to have an avatar that could interact with other toons would be a boon for the rping communityi could see special player events that could start out in stations and lead into spacewe could have player sponsored poker tournaments in game not some side websiteit could be an additional resource for recruitment of new players i know of a handful of mmorpg players that avoid eve simply because they cant walk in stations these same folks love to pvp craft and rp however they wont commit to a game that only has the pvp and crafting the fact that i cant them to try eve due to the lack of a walking avatar is frustrating as hellbesides id love to be able to sit cloak spinning instead of ship spinning any day
well this is actually going better than expected thank you all for the inputi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
how about first they fix the bedsnot only are they shorter than any of us  theres no damn room for a second personbesides above or below of course
never even thought about that how about adding a bathroomshower otherwise we will have some really smelly capsuleersi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i certainly do not smell like anything but pleasure you may sniff  but contain yourselfraising my arm slowly towards you
well playedi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
ccp you know i love you i also want you to know i sat on this possibility for a day and i dont see alternativesthe short of it is i think ill have to consolidate my accounts down to 1  3 of their current number a couple inactive the rest transferred im very saddened to reach this conclusion med clones will cause me to hemorrhage isk in lockstep with my pace of gameplay i cant afford it and i dont expect anyone else to underwrite it either even though i pay real money for subs my gameplay will repeatedly drive me iskbrokei still have a few months give or take but now that im diving into boldfaced podme gameplay null i have to downsizeyes medical clone costs would turn all of this around right now i cant go out in t1 frigates or cruisers and what i cant do with one account i certainly cant do it with more i still want to play and i want to support you with my subs but doing so in my current assortment of accounts means most of them will just idle even worse theyll keep training which makes the medical clone cost issue even worse
i would like to let the general public here know that the op keeps coming into missions chat and begging for mission fits advice how to run missions best etc all stuff that can be found with 30 seconds of googlingin short he is one who wants eve served on a silver platter for him
i dont get why people are so thick on thisall that isboxer allows you to do is duplicate your keyboard input to other pcs i could even do this running vms with other software that exactly copies what i do into those vms it doesnt adjust your account it does not circumvent game programming to gain an unfair advantagesometimes i wish ccp would ban those who keep asking the same question they answer 200599235 times give or take but oh well
you forgot to calculate into your astounding difference in terms of wealth that the 1 guy pays 1plex per month and the 40 man isboxer fleet pays 40plex per monthyoure basically offering us your calculations as if the isboxer fleets is fueled by one single plex that the one solo player would have to pay anyhowive redone your calculations and this is what comes out421200x275000 115830000000 isk or 14755 plex figured at 785 million isk per plex  368875 plex per account10800 x 275000  2970000000 or 3783 plex  3783 plex14755 x 3  44265  40x3  32265  806625 per account3783x3  11349  3  8349  8349 per accountaccording to your own calculations the 40 man isboxer fleet actually makes less than the average solo player  in truth it makes more due to that 40man fleet having boosts that you solo dont have so they actually mine about 40 more than you do per cycle on each account  but im just pointing out your flawed logic please if youre going to represent the deranged people who have no clue at least do it right and make it look like the 40man isboxer fleet has astounding difference in terms of wealth as an advantage
iain cariaba wrotesoldarius wrotetldr if isboxer does not give an advantage to players that use it why do they use itahh but there is a flaw in youf logic the flaw is that ccp doesnt care about advantage to the player if they were concerned about one player gaining advantage over another player then anyone who had more alts than another player or any player who could afford to sell more plex or any of a hundred different things would be in violation ccp cares about giving advantagd to the accountbesides as has already been stated but youve chosen to ignore for your own convienence is that the main perks of isboxer can be duplicated through a pure hardware solution this pure hardware solution found on page 1 of this very thread incidentally is the reason isboxer was removed from the list of software that could get you banned for the price of a highend gaming desktop computer i can use this pure hardware solution to run 1020 accounts at once all performing the exact same actions all without isboxerthere was no flaw in my logic you posted all those words and the end result is that none of it actually disputes my conclusion that isboxer provides a clear advantage to a single player over another single player instead you tried to pick at a point that has no clearly identifiable borders the reliability and reproducibility of a hardware solution and is based entirely on the skill and will of the player to try a purely physical solution to gain an advantage over othersthe advantages of isboxer cannot be reliably duplicated by a purely hardware solution and maintain the advantages for which it is used rapid input of commands to multiple accounts without error over a long period of time and many iterations i seriously dare you to tie 20 mice together with rubberbands and pencils configure a home computer for 20 screens and make it work perfectly for an extended period of time extended meaning hours on end not 10 minutes or for one mining cycle do it a thousand times and see how many times you have to stop and adjust one mouse out of 20 because oops one of them slipped or realign your mousecage because it got twisted around by 2 degrees and isnt aligned properly on all 20 screens anymoreyou make only 1 valid point ccp either doesnt care or is unwilling to venture into this realm ive played games that prohibit multiaccounting and religiously enforce it it can be done but ccp has chosen not to for what i assume to be financial reasons all dem cyno alts dog
except youre wrongccp only cares on a per toon basis not a per personbehindkeyboard basis thats why they dont care about the 40 miners his total income is much higher yes but his pertoon income is still the sameand isboxer is only as reliable as the person behind the keyboard it takes a lot of skill to use perfectly and there are numerous ways for something to go wrong there are a ton of microsettings that can break your game if you mess with them the wrong way and another bunch that will cause poor performance in short it cannot be operated by dimwits to its full potential
it seems this post is better suited here
i liked to raise the issue of people cross posting stuff on the forums that can be dealt with via the petition systemdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
oh god
youre tearing me apart lisaseriously dude this last week has been an emotional rollercoaster wondering if ill ever hear your dulcet tones again fly safe  youll forever be in my heart
hypotheticallyhow many csm members would need to resign for me to be next in line
thanks for your service and work silva best of luck in all your future endeavors
pretty much all of them twiceccp falcon  eve universe community manager  ccpfalcon
it depends on who leaves but we actually checked and unfortunately what falcon said is true and as i mentioned before we wont be bringing anyone on the csm9 anymorenothing stops you from trying to get into csm10 though 3
falcon 3
hypothetically speaking what are the chances of someone getting elected on the platform of i dont account share supercaps and cyno pilots this thread has degenerated to the point its become like two bald men fighting over a comb  doc fury
chances are the same for everyone its 5050 you either get elected or you dont 
everyone who ever played the game would be inline before you
i meant wonder who will leave next
thanks for all the well wishes ladies and gentsbest of luck to you with the csm 10 election
why do these people always complain about cloaksccp has already told you repeatedly on these forums that afk cloaky campers as example arent going to be changed
that is a ridiculous idea and doesnt do anything but have people buy up these crystalsin my personal opinion the effects of any form of occupancy should carry throughout the complete space an organisation owns this could mean that any systems used at a bare minimum should get reduced effectiveness on income from different sources most importantly moongoo a raw exampleimagine the alliance owns five systems and uses a total of three effectively while two others arent used that muchwhen the participation rate for that system is less than a preset value derived from the total members versus activity count it becomes vulnerable to both players and npc sovwarfare it should lower effectiveness on towers so that your moongoo tower in that one random unvisited system no longer is giving you free moneywith participation rate i do not mean sitting in the system afk with a cloak but rather the amount of industry pvepvp a corporation does in that system
zarathustra was a messianic iconoclast that enlightened people through science i also want to add that if i am elected to the csm i will not resign
nice to see some talk on this topic going on again the ideas collected here are maybe not all to new but actually enough to maybe again let one or two devs have again a second thought on the avatar gameplay in eveexpanding the captains quarters like mentioned here would be damn nicei was always a supporter auf walking in stations ccp failed very with it in the incarna release but that was when 2011oh man i would so badly have the possibility to use this bad to rest on it while browsing the market or chat come on at least that little extra and i do not even mention a pole with one of those exotic gallente playing with it

1 for proposal to reduce medical clone costsi can understand the issue of having to upgrade multiple medical clones hell i only have one character active and i dont like the cost of upgrading its medical clone dmc
the first of my downsized subs cancels itself on the 18th heres hoping ccp pulls a white bunny from its hat during the eve vegas stream by announcing a medical clone cost reduction to accompany the unlimited skillqueueold thread by marlona sky paging marlona sky
this thread has come so far yet hasnt moved at all weve reached 13 pages the arguments have gone in circles  the csm still doesnt care
theres a statement by senior gm karidor in the german language forums which statestranslation if a click is sent to multiple clients this also counts as automation or to use the phrasing of the eulait effectively counts as patterns of play that facilitate acquisition of items currency objects character attributes rank or status at an accelerated rate when compared with ordinary game play
and in case this statement gets dismissed as a only in the german language forums or b made only by a single gm theres this note by ccp phantom a little further down in that same threadtranslation senior gm karidors explanation reflect the official stance the ccp customer support has on that matter
the arguments are going in circles because there is no legitimate reason to ban it other than boohoo my feelings got hurt
yes but dont forget that karidor is the guy that makes rulings such as telling people that your alt is you will get you permanently banned
is there really a point to this other than tears for tears sakei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
look at all of the sheeple being mad over something that didnt affect them 3 days ago  still doesnt affect them now
rekt
i dont evenyou didnt do the pos code originally by any chance
that was kind of the point of itif a cake is being carved anew then those nullsec leaders represented there are those who wish to hold the tool that carves the cake the most or participate in holding the carving tooltheres some nullsec leaders signatures missing however i guess not everyone has succumbed to all the changes being inherently bad in the long runany veteran of eve is going to have hisher own story of how they endured the hard times when things were fubar and how they persevered why cant we do the same clench your teeth and take it like a man then when its over go to your favourite proctologist and get a soothing ointment to spread around the hole that hurts the mostafraid much
well  besides this particular topic i wonder how we as players are supposed to measure the csms involvement besides the official minutes published  and the last one is from 2012 
isboxer is only the visible part of what i call the metacode iceberg other tools are even more efficient and customizable like autohotkeys and there are other tools that do achieve quite a bit to gain some forms of advantages in game isboxer is just the most obviousthere is no way to totally prevent the use of metacode much like there is no way to prevent players from metagaming both are similar in that they provide advantages ingame to the players that dabble with itthis problem is more of a perception issue simply put isboxing can easily be perceived as a paytowin even if its use has drawbacksthis perception has the potential to turn away players that would otherwise remain engaged with the game and limit the reach of a game that otherwise has much to offerfor that reason alone i believe ccp should actively make isboxing or macroing the game difficult by ui and design features that makes multi boxing more difficult than doing the same thing with the same amount of characters controlled by different players as well as openly take a stance against multi boxing rather than staying mute about itthey will not prevent it totally as they cant but at least they can project the idea that multi boxing is not ok in their game which in turn may keep other players engaged longer as they feel their contribution to the gamealliancecorp is not dwarfed by multiboxersisboxing is a hindrance to regular players a fleet of imultiboxed miners can go through a site way faster than regular players would and those are left empty handed it is lke the proverbial cloud of crickets passing over a systemlast but not least isboxing is also a control tool for powerful alliances to limit their exposure to leaks betrayalsor active mobilization of their minions reinforcing their power and control over the whole game with a limited number of power playersi truly dont believe ccp has anything to gain to continue remaining neutralmute on this subject with the breath of fresh air that the coming changes are going to make this may be for them the right time to reevaluate their position on thisoh and the likelihood a frustrated multi boxer would really leave the game they would of course threaten to is pretty low they have a bunch of assets to play with and to loose in the process id be curious to know the statistics but i would bet they mostly pay their multiple accounts via isk only so they do not contribute much to the game today
thanks for that ill quote the relevant part that directly adresses input mirroringmy bad that i took a gm statement that later got confirmed as official stance of ccp customer support as fact
your post is so full of ignorance and tin foil im thinking that you may actually be posting it with tongue in cheekwhy would ccp project the idea that multiboxing is not ok and why would they make it more difficultif its a perception issue its due in part to posts like yours and your ill informed perceptionthe macro type you talk of in this regard is already a part of the game should ccp remove that toomultibox miners cannot go any faster than the game allows which means regular players also have that ability in a fleet there is also plenty of ice fields out there so your left empty handed statement is ridiculousalso please pray tell how you think they pay for their accounts with isk and how that doesnt contribute i would sure like to knowdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
yes i looked at the gm you quoted and saw your errorplus i do not know what has been written only what you suggest seeing as many cannot even read the eula correctly and misquote that often in this regard ill stick to the english versions posted by respected membersalso i think youll find gm lelouch is the lead gm destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i doand for myself ill take this as an example of how much i should believe statements made by the gm team in general gm karidor especially i wast that previously aware of mallaks examples
oh i agree the majority of gms should be taken with a pinch of salt as long as you enjoy the game and dont break the rules you never have to interact with themyou say you do thats fine but even english speaking people misquote the eula to try and prove a point in this regard either that or they read only what they want to read skipping the relevant partsdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
unlike subs plexes do not contribute to ccp bottom line today like monthly subs do
youre joking right just how do you think a plex is createddestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
the loudest part of the crowd against isboxer are the ones  who can not deal with the fact that others are better than themccp  ban these insteadthanks
i dont understand this post what would i be afraid of i dont have a problem with the letter itself although i think it ended up lacking much impact what i would have a problem with is csm members making decisions designed to benefit themselves or their corpalliancecoalition at the cost of the game or the csm as an institution it appears that the csm has built up a lot of ccp capital over the past few years resulting in them being taken seriously by a larger number of teams it would be unfortunate if this was spent on something pointless thats all the csm posts above indicate that this isnt the case thanks for posting btw so thats good if the letter didnt prompt an early release of the dev blog then greyscale should be ashamed of shunning the csm on such an important matter
the entirety of the post wasnt directed at you zappity but at the signatories of the accordletter  i just used one of your viewpoints to quote a reply sorry if i wasnt actually clear which target audience im addressing in my reply
yes open the door already there is fun to be had on the other sideit was announced at pax australia that the first multiplayer avatar areas to be opened in star citizen will be the social ones and they are slated to be delivered next yearits annoying that ccp once dreamed of becoming an ultimate sci simulator failed to deliver and now a competitor is coming in to deliver what ccp cannotfortunately the avatar stuff in eve what little there is still looks far superior to what is currently in star citizen especially the player characters ccp still has a competitive advantage that they can capitalize on should they choose togiven that ccp is more than willing to devote an entire development studio to a game that they would eventually abandon world of darkness i think it is stupid that they wont assign a few devs to enriching their current game with station interiors
couldnt agree with you morei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
no way  sorry for being that frank here the one and most outstanding difference between eve and any other mmo has been that particular part the brutal consequences of bad management of ones character  which mainly refers to the usage of medical clones implants and jumpclonesas of today its completely free to get a jump clone due to several corporations offering that kind of service  so that part doesnt even require any big personal management anymore implants  well i am not starting to talk about inflation and availability here  this is a selfrunnerso what is left to manage seriously keeping your clone updated and freeking pay for it if your character becomes that smart you force the clone producers to invest a hell of time and technology to stuff all that smartness into a new body the risk reward principles of eve would be completely disabled by lowering those prices no one forces anyone to become smarter in eve  its your personal decision you can leave your skill queue empty and save money that way
so dont use the new unlimited skillqueue hell i agree
of course it has been bought at some point possibly even this month but this not a certainty with real money and even at a higher rate when used for 30 days of time than a subscription but as any ingame commodities there are plexes in game that have been bought long ago and stocked these plex do not provide income right now to ccp albeit they certainly have provided income before still ccp has to pay their monthly expenses every single month going forward no matter what for the game to continue to existso it all depends on how ccp manages over the long term the income from their plexes but this is why plexes are fundamentally different from subscription incomeusing isboxing to make enough isk to buy enough plexes to get characters game time is bad for everybody else
plex sit on ccps books as deferred income until theyre consumed or destroyedits money they cant do anything with until the plex no longer exists the moment a plex is consumed the money is freed up for useas for the original point in the topic its something i cant talk about
well steve has just told you how and when ccp get the income from a plex but even so you really are stretching reality if you think they do not contribute even if it was as you suggested and paid some time agoyour argument was that they do not contribute thats blatantly false and not even founded in reality plex users pay more than i do and it seems ccp get the money as and when they use themthe joke is i pay yearly so ccp do actually get my money a full year before the end of my sub so using your logic i also do not contribute i had at some point in my sub changed my credit card doing so took another payment and my days left were almost 600 i guess i really wasnt contributing at all then destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
just as a small notemulti month subscriptions also count as deferred income though its more certain as you cant pause it or stockpile timeaccountants far prefer it when you know when income will become available rather than being carried on the books youre right about the plex though ccp like it when people use plex reduces their liability though they prefer it when they explode
makes sense regarding the multi month subalso i can see why ccp like it when we use or lose a plex im just amazed at some peoples lack of understanding in regards to their contribution to ccp and the gamedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i wrote a email to ccp in regards to the exploit of 10 criminals ganking players mainly new ones in high sec see belowfirst of all let me say im not saying that ganking in high sec should be stopped ganking is available anywhere anytime my issue is the exploit of there security status in high sec and killing shipseve in most parts is a good game however you never address this issue or criminals and the acts that they do to exploit killings in high seccurrently we have 10 sec status people in and around my system ganking miners they are freely aloud to roam the systems as long as they are in a pod or shuttle then the concord police will not do anything so how do they beat this they get a neutral in a orca etc to fly to a safe spot and then allow them to get in to ships then fly to someone to kill before concord then decides to get themsounds like a exploit to me i have no issues with being killed by them but now with the exploit that allows them to do it over and over and over simple rule states if you are a criminal then you pay the consequences for those actions the easy fix for this is to have security id on gates and if you are below the required sec status you are then not allowed to use that gateccp needs to start looking at the big picture with the game and to cater for all players and not what just suits ccp have you ever wondered why eve is not in the league of other games with the number of players im not tallking 000s of players im talking 000000s its cause this game has the risk for you to lose all and i enjoy that that but you need to look after the player group that cant or want a safe enjoyable game to play or just want to stay in high sec im happy with no where being safe and there is the element of being killed but you have made it so easy just now two 10 chars killed a mining barge even though he is 10 was then flagged for 10 mins and is now free to do it all over againafter 11 years of this game i would have expected 000000s of players and that would mean more income for you and more development of the game look at why some other games keep the player base i myself left 7 years ago for over a year because of the exploits that allow negative players to exploit postive playersi know of alot of people who just cant be arsed to pay a subscription and then lose there ships and have to start all over again thats why they have gone back to wow or diablo 3 as some people just want to enjoy if something is not done with the game to help out the new players and with the upcoming new games eve is going to lose even more players by them not subbing i love eve but you need to address the issues and not just keep adding new content make the game enjoyable risky rewardingyou ban or take action on certain exploits when it seems to suit you so why do you allow some exploits to happen and some to not i pay to sub this game but ccp is not fulfilling its promise to stop exploits when you get chars who repeatedly use the exploit to there advantage in high sec there were two negative payers including 1000 and 99 who are allowed to constantly gank mining ships then they wait there 10 minute period and then can repeat it how is this not different to other exploits definition of harassmenthi sec systems where concord the police force is in force high sec is currently classed as systems where by the police concord will intervene when a illegal activity is happeningharassment  the act of systematic andor continued unwanted and annoying actions of one party or a group including threats and demands UFFFD bullying mining ships which cant fight backUFFFD having to pay blackmail to be able to mine in high secUFFFD the loss of income gained in game which is paid for through subscriptions of real cashUFFFD continued and repeated acts to force persons to either leave quit or pay the ransomthe purposes may vary including racial prejudice personal malice or attempt to force someone to quit a job apply illegal pressure to collect a bill ransom to mineor merely gain sadistic pleasure from making someone fearful or anxious people will not play due to fear of losing more in game and not being able to play the game which they have paid real cash for
its not up to you to decide what is and what isnt an exploit in eve only ccp can make that judgement and apparently they dont agree with your point of viewhtfu or gtfo
thank you and i value your opinion but was htfu or gtforeally needed 
agreed i see a lot of people that leave eve very soon after starting even some people that have been playing for a while have left since ganking and blob warfare is now elite pvp there are also so many loop holes that a ganker can use to be in space and not be shot at if they bother
hoo boy where to startfirst offthe definition of harassment is determined by ccp as jpoll pointed out yes there is a written definition in the eula but it is still vague enough to allow for player freedom and ccp to make judgement calls in specific situationsso far the current working definition of harassment in eve is this sustained targeting of a player or group of players over a period of time despite the targeted players best efforts to avoid it and the targeters do not gain anythingwhat does this mean it means that ganking is by itself not harassment it is just another aspect of the game it means that player activities that run counter or are detrimental to yours is not harassment it is merely a part of the game ie the game is centered around player on player conflict it means that a player cannot simply move to a different stationasteroid belt or one system over and claim that tried to avoid unwanted contact you have to put effort into it see moving several systems over at least and yes this is an intentional part of the game it means that if the target consistently make themself profitable they cannot claim that they are being targeted for no reasonnowand they do allow me to list them offif you suicide gankdirect penalties you lose your ship you lose any insurance you have the ship you lose security status you gain a suspect flag for 1015 minutes and can be shot at by anyone and everyone in the game without penalty you gain a criminal flag for 15 minutes see cant undock in highsec in anything other than a pod without being concorded againindirect penalties if your security status goes low enough see below 50 then you can be shot by anyone anywhere at any time if your security status goes below certain levels then you will find yourself less and less able to enter higher security systems without the faction police attacking you see you cant use any ship bigger than a cruiser in highsec unless you are willing to tank the npcs with lower security status you will be less and less able to get new supplies from highsec trade hubs andor must buy from lowsec stations at a premium andor must rely on friendsalts to resupply you if you want to raise your security status you must either kill pirate npcs for a godawful amount of time or spend a fair bit of cash to buy the security tags neededother risks you botch the gank attempt and eat the cost of the ship and gain a security hit and 15 minutes of idle time for no reason the target may be tanked more than you think resulting in a failed gank attempt where you eat the cost of the ship and gain a security hit and 15 minutes of idle time for no reason the target never shows and you have wasted time the loot that you are ganking for never drops resulting in a failed gank where you eat the cost of the ship and gain a security hit and 15 minutes of idle time for no reason the gank is successful the loot you want drops but someone else picked it up before your friendalt did resulting in a failed gank where you eat the cost of the ship and gain a security hit and 15 minutes of idle time for no reason you dont have enough people to properly suicide gankoutside of these things it is up to other players to make people with low security status pay for their actions the game only stacks the odds so much in your favor and the odds are very much in the targets favor you have to do the restconcord are a reactionary force there were never designed to be proactive that is a players jobthe neutral alts well you can ban them for being used to avoid consequences sure but then you have to ban all other neutral alts that are being used to avoid other consequences of the gamefor example neutral haulers industrialists miners etc that stay in npc corps to avoid dealing with war declarations awoxers thieves etcfair is fair after all they do but they still stay true to the overraching theme in eve player versus player conflictplus you also have to consider this in a single player game a sandbox means you can do anything you want to do in a multiplayer game a sandbox means that not only can you do anything you want to do but other players can do the same even if it runs counter to yours to ban or limit a style of play because you do not like how to affects you or others means that the people whose gameplay has been bannedlimited can ask the same thing on your style of play for the same reasonsand when that happens the game is no longer a sandboxbecause eve online is a niche product that caters to people who like difficult gamesniche products may never gain the popularity of some other titles that try to be as inclusive as possible but they do tend to last longer
htfu or gtfo is necessarywith that said if youre not gonna htfu you can give me your stuff and enter the biomass queue over new eden is meant to be cold and unforgivingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
why play eve if you dont like itfirst of all citation is requested for your assertion that its mainly new players being ganked if youre going to suggest something back it upits been a niche game for over 11 years and will continue to be one its also been dying for 11 years and youre not the first to claim new upcoming games will take its players10 players already paid the price for their low sec status if you wish for them to pay another then make them pay yourself its not ccps job or that of concord to protect you and your assets its your jobthe easy fix is for you to take matters into your own hands and deal with it seeing as 10 players are open season for all you have no worries regarding concord yet another price we pay but being 10 and ganking in high sec is not an exploit who are you to say what is and isnt negative play or players just because someone has a negative sec status doesnt make them any less valid a player then someone with a high one to be quite frank in all the time ive played this game the likes of people who think themselves better because of that tend to be the ones not worth knowing at allthere is no exploit in this regard its just your self righteous attitude and belief you should be able to play and not be ganked you dont even seem to know the game mechanics behind it so how can you sit in judgement of themas far as your claim of harassment is concerned its disingenuous at best people playing the game by its own rules does not harassment make your attempt to include racial prejudice and personal malice is quite frankly ridiculous they are already against the eula and if you have issues in that regard then create a ticketoh and we all pay in some form or another some in rl cash others in time that buys others use of rl cash but you still agree to play and agree to the terms and conditions of those are playing by the rules so either play the game or leave either way its not about to change for your benefitdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
did veers roll a new alt
wouldnt put it past itdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
oh wow and i thought nobody believes me xdseriously though does not smell like veers at allthere is currently no character profile with the name zakken kochthat was him too he biomassed already because i didnt fall for him we should get together and talk about this
the op is a wonderful example of why npc corp posters need to be forbidden from posting anywhere but new citizens and the character bazaar as for your conclusions op it is not possible to be more wrong than you are absolutely nothing of what you described is an exploit it is smart gameplay triumphing over stupid gameplay and as for the theoretical people you claim are quitting by the millions if they arent willing to bother defending themselves they are not wanted period good riddance i would rather have no eve at all than kowtow to the likes of you
they already have a way to fix this its called account audit where someone has to sit down and look at every ip addess and match the accounts accessed with it and see who owns each account i myself have been hit a couple of times over having eve gatherings and playing musical computers
council membersdo what you can to stop the ccp devs war on the players in the crius build the devs made billions of my bpos nearly worthless then when i changed to a different form of income and invested billions it that oceanus puts that in danger i made decision on operating locations based on my capabilities at the time when this next deployment occurs the devs will implement restrictions that will make it impossible for me to jump to my towersim just a small entrepreneur i can deal with the player traps the ccp dev incessant nerfing is killing usx sienna

correction its killing you im making a small fortune by planning ahead and proactively changing my operations based on anticipated changes not to say that i dont sometimes i take it in the butt because ccp does something i didnt expect but theyre hardly killing us this thread has degenerated to the point its become like two bald men fighting over a comb  doc fury

interesting i guess i will have to just run for csm 10its hard to formulate a platform beyond vote reform when ccp seagull is literally doing everything i would advocate for were i in her shoes its some high tier jungian ish when somebody so many deviations from you as an eventuality comes to the same conclusions you do

from 1st post1 yeah the war history does need some love2 you do know that adjusting how the different criteria are organized effects the outcome right if you uncheck something move it to the bottom of the stack so other criteria take presedence3 this has been an issue for years and all it takes to remedey locally is to close and reopen local it also has zero effect on overview so youre not going to be accidentally shooting blues4 because sisi uses the old system before nearly every single item on the market was put there by players and factiondeadspaceofficer mods were always put on market by the players5 it is your fault youre not keeping up with what your corp expenses are like you were told you get informed in advance of the price changesthe second post is just a whine post about things generally covered to exhaustion in other threads go read them to find the answers

thanks for the insight then isboxing is not as bad as i thought economically for the gamei still believe that it projects a paytowin perception that is detrimental but at least isboxers do continue to contribute income to ccps coffer every month then
not as bad as you thought economically even if it wasnt deferred your argument was still wrong and without any basis in reality as i pointed out my yearly sub was just as poor in your logic as a contributor as plexwhether or not it projects something is also relevant isboxer cannot be held responsible for illogical thoughts baseless accusations and pointless argumentsdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
so where to go from here
hopefully across the cluster in new shipsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
what could be done about this terrible thing ccp has done to us and the real time we have spent in research and is just like skills  anyone who has done any amount of research knows it takes for ever and for ccp to just take that time from us is simply not right as with skills where ccp refunds points when they remove a skill the same should be for research as both have taken real time trainingresearching what could be done is ccp instead of giving the research of so many players the big middle finger and all the time we have spent doing research and that is quite a lot for myslef as well as many others just like skills where points are given to players who spent time to train skills unallocated for the player to allocate where he sees fit when a skill is removed from the game so should be the time players have put into research be give to players to allocate as they see fit to new and unresearched or partially researched blueprints that would be a way of giving players our time back just like with skills real time for real timepslove me pssplease fix this  3i love this game please put more thought into how changes effect your players you wonder why more and more people are starting to leave eve online im cool with change as long as my real time that ive put in is not taken away
if only ccp had given us several weeks of warning so we could plan ahead  not lose out
this is so incredibly false that i really cant be asked to read the rest fix it and well see about sentence 2tia
do not quit adapt that is what a sandbox is and this is your sandboxa new miner can get into a procurer within 10 days and be decently tank fitted within 30 daysa fitted procurer will only cost you around 40m isk and will require substantial firepower to eliminate as john e normus so eloquently stated in the thread belowwhen the miners adapt it will be a new horizon for eve
oh dear
it is not an exploit
i would like an official statement from a senior gm or dev regarding isboxer ganks and their subsequent replacement i am specifically referring to ganking a person in highsec with nados and them having that persons ship reimbursedi do not understand ccps policy with this as there is no statistically significant difference from using isboxer to coordinate a gank using a mechanical setup like this guy a fleet of dedicated gankers using ts to coordinate their alpha  dps or just opening multiple windows offset them by a little to allow space to click and rapidly clicking on the next window and hitting f1the reason i say statistically significant is because of the server cycle time if the eve server was set up in such a way that milliseconds actually counter then it would be understandable however since the servers are set up to send commands in a stack for a measurable period of time there is no reason why ganks should be reimbursed i await a response from ccp and welcome any contributions from the playerbase
basically the same thoughts in my head also would like to add that you even getting singular pilots together to do said ganks still wont save you so should you start replacing all ganks official response requested as well
i watch some incursion runners get ganked by isboxer to have their ship replaced because  1 pilot is the player and the rest are considered bots which comes to the person getting this ship back but yet isboxer is legal if the isboxer is legal then why are these people getting their ships back and a 10 man gank fleet considered 1 pilot and 9 bots and no other use of isboxer isthey tried to have an isboxer in one of the tournament to prove isboxer isnt all that but he also wasnt controling something like a team of 10 nightmares either due to tournament rules which i might add would put isobox at a disadvantage using the rules as isboxer is made to control account clones and not a fleet of individual ships of different kinds
i am not entirely sure where you going with this op after a quick glance a the upcoming patch dev b and the proposed changes from the linked blog there for researchwhat are you losingis there a skill being taken awayfrom what i saw it seems the required skills for certain items to be researched copied invention etc are just being juggled aroundif you have not basically researched some skills to cover these changesthen i guess you should start instead of whining about it a true researcher or industiral person for that matter would make sure they got all the skillsnot just the ones they need for what they wish to build
i am referring to the time spent on research several years put into a single bpo for material and time effiency and the time taken to research those bpos and now they have been backdated to only a couple months worth of research done on them myself as well as many others who have done the same are having our real time taken away
hmmm the use of an orca as a fleet carrier or other similiar ship orcafreighter tandem is not an exploitits a viable tacticreally op you should of picked a better lke idkmaybe inability to dock up dependent on sec status to make easier to killthough active pilots in pods are fairly dificult anywaymany ways to smarten up or tactics already exsistso yeah i guess all i have left ishtfu
if there is one thing i keep telling new players after recruitment by ganking it is the key to survivability is adaptability either you remain flexible and adapt or you get slaughtered like a carebears bleating for a safer new edennew eden is meant to be a dark cruel harsh and ruthless place so long as it remains this way eve survives you make it too safe and it dies this is the one mmo that caters to those who are thinkers planners tacticians and strategists this is why most who adapt remain as it is a game that requires conscious thought not mindless leveling the beauty of eve rests in its brutality i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
1 i want to flag orcas that provide ships to suspect and criminals with a suspect timer for the orca pilot  ship itsselfie suspect or criminal uses orca services  orca goes suspect that provides pvp and a nice way to fight back for miners you eli
then ccp should tell us so we dont waste time with battlecruiser skills would love to see a definitive answer from ccp as my endgame goal was a fleet of alpha nags for nullsec giggles but what would the point be if my targets will just get reimbursed
still this same setup can be achieved mechanically just alot more thought behind it
those ganks are reimbursed because the gm staff exhibits a pretty enormous procarebear bias simple as that
after the reports of caldari predators rapier supposedly being reimbursed because it was killed by an isboxer i also petitioned ccp requesting clarification on the rules relating to the use of isboxer in pvp and was told by ccp we cannot discuss the terms of our policies how can ccp expect a player base to follow the rules if when requested for clarification on said rules they refuse to discuss iti use isboxer yes but i do also see the objection alot of players have with it and my stance is this if you are going to allow isboxer then you cannot reimburse players who lose their ships to one if not then just get it over with and ban the use of isboxer you cannot have it both ways either allow it entirely or ban it

so you want free orca kills because youre too lazy  chicken to just gank them
i definitely cant immediately think of a way i could make this blow back on you for a highsec orcapocalypse heres a hint you cant exactly set parameters for someone to use your orca it would bring a whole new level of awox you wouldnt even be able to figure out who flagged your orca for you if i did it fast enough hell itd be worse than a normal awox since you couldnt even fight back or rep your orca without flagging yourselves tooand all because you two chose to cry about a tactic that a few people actually use in lieu of insta undocks yeah bring on the mass flagged orcas
this is so pathetically simple to bypass its almost funny orca pilot opens ship maintenance bay right clicks on cata selects option to launch ship into space then is shocked when the ganker in a pod suddenly boards the catalyst that is sitting in spaceno access to orca services by ganker required

ive noticed this as well even with ccp you know only the people that wrote and enforce the eula in the first place telling them they are wrong they still choose to believe they know better bafflingedit quote fail
ban isboxer ill still be here granted it may take abit to setup but im quite aware of how to do this exact same setup i personally use with hardware not to mention i publicly can state that there is over 1000 accounts in the channel i currently privately invite to and yes we do communicate

what real time is being lost the few seconds it took to add the bpo to a research queue before heading off to do something else in gamethe only way you lost real time is if you sat and watched the timer on your bpo research count down instead of having a life
ah i think i might understand nowyour upset that stations no longer have que times is that it if it is all i can say is deal with it because it is change for the better if you spent years already having your stuff maxed outthen ok good what are you complaining aboutthat those that havent can now do the same sheesh htfu and stfu will ya
and that is all that matters
saving jack a bumpon the plus side once carriers are hit with the jump drive changes dont you think there might be a shade more support for this conceptmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
thanks mike and i have a feeling that you may be right ive got my fingers crossed on this one still and im still working out the idea for my next proposal but itll hit fi before it shows up herei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
yes
i see what you did there
i would like to thank everyone who helped me come up with this everyone who posted and liked and mike azariah for keeping his campaign promise of speaking for the communitysurprise covers it welli am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
congratulations
thanksi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
wooo its comingthere will be neither compassion nor mercy nor peace nor solace for those who bear witness to these signs and still do not believe  the scriptures book of reclaiming 2510
take a bow couldnt have done it without the supporti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
oh wow this is really happeningi thought ccp gave the use of isboxer their blessing is it only allowed to be used in pve farming or somethingi hope to see a ccp response as well
im enjoying the eve vegas stream very much im looking forward to the goodies that come with the hd subscriptionthankfully and oddly the accounts that i am uprooting dont expire until late december so regarding foxfours teaser that something is happening cool this issue has already been addressed beyond what i hoped at eve vegas and i can wait until decemberi want to keep playing i will keep playing if i started downsizing without explaining myself clearly that would make me a walkout and it would be very immature i should share my thoughts for the sake of communication i also think the talking points listed in foxfours presentation miss me by quite a bit and i still have some explaining to do things like lack of choice punishes older players and the 4 isk sink figure specificallychoice never would have occurred to me as a reason to inquire about something like medical clone costs for me this is all about the math maths specifically an equitable relationship between the player and their organization where the player contributes their time and energy in return for a reasonable amount of support in replacing losses you know sustainablei am interested in what type of choices you have in mind for medical clone costs it was completely unexpected but ok in the meantime as they say the beatings will continue until morale improvesregarding reimbursements theyre an excellent indicator of a successful organization and confidence great but reimbursements are abstract and outside of the game mechanicsmembers have to apply for reimbursement somewhere and are subject to review and only then is the give money function used if reimbursements were handled ingame then maybe its something that could be balanced but for now i hope you agree its outofbounds and it should be losses need to be evaluated on a casebycase basis which requires human intuition i dont see you replacing that one or organizations putting their isk into such a system if it was created please tell me were on the same page heresuggesting reimbursements as a solution to medical clone costs is kinda bad too its basically suggesting a player farms their organization for someone like me with several accounts that are not controlled with isboxer or used for mining thats the big question what does this joker plan to do welp several characters at a timeto answer that question definitively with a no especially without isboxer i cant multibox at all without admitting to some degree that i was not playing at my best while split between more than one client on grid having accepted this downsizing and the rp of my characters being put on ice or not being at the helm of their own account im starting to see this as a good thingespecially considering jump fatigue changes and decloaking changes to a lesser degree it seems multiboxing in null is a completely different meta not that copypaste isboxer gameplay was ever my thingit isnt never was i wont miss it but in order to absolve myself of the guilt and even the perception that im not contributing the same thing as the next player its time to go uniboxingdevs and players have talked about ship stashes in response to upcoming changes and seem to be okay with it im thinking along those lines but slightly differentyes medical clone costs punish higher sp players but an even bigger issue worth considering is those characters once they are trained to a satisfactory level can stop training and then share an account with other characters looking back that strikes me as more important than my 20 million isk per podas for the isk sink that 4 doesnt reveal anything about assets never undocked and player behavior that never took place due to medical clone costs you cant balance for gameplay that never happens which is what medical clone costs do at least for me it influences my decisions4 how does that compare to other isk sinks that go to bob like abandoned drones for example which unlike other items lost to explosions are not tractored by an mtu
please read through the full post and comments before replyingpoint many cool names for characters and corporations are taken by inactive accounts who havent logged in for years i want a way to reclaim these names because eves growing pile of inactive accounts and dead oneman corps shouldnt become a coolname graveyardcounterpoint reclaiming names will anger players who reactivate to find theyve lost their name and will cause confusion among people who knew the old characterlets address the first issue angering and surprising the former owner of the name i propose a simple tool either on the site or in the game where you can enter a name to request it it will only take inactive names it will send a ccp support email directly to the inactive account holder that if they do not reactivate their account within 30 days their name will be adversely possessed thats legal speak for use it or lose it to avoid spam only one request can be open for a name if the request is successful ccp lets the requester know when the name will go live so that they can be ready to claim itthe second issue confusion if a name is reclaimed all references to the old character should be changed in some way if the mod team takes away your names for other reasons typically your name is changed to the generic gallente citizen  which you can petition to change to something cooler i suggest that the same thing should happen here this means editing the full history of killmails contacts evemails etc this can be done during downtimeplease let me know what you guys think im especially eager to hear how some might exploit this so we can work on solutions to those exploits i want to make a working solution to one of the problems that has bothered me forever in this gametell me what you think about the following changesvariation 1 if no response from deactivated account name remains in place
and next i suppose youll want ccp to appropriate all items owned by characters inactive for more than a set period of time and contract them to you as well right
would any of you null bears be oposed to the idear of asystem soverenty handover systemmuch like the current system for pocosany charictor with suficiant rights executor can hand over soverenty of a system to an alliance of hisher chosingthe result of witch would bepocos will auto transfer to the executor corp of the new alliancescus owned by the owning alliance will transfer to the new allianceany stations and sov upgrade structures will transfer tot he new alliance all corppersonal assets will remain in the hands of thair respective ownersassets in stations will be frozen depending the the new alliances station settingsposs will not be affectedsbus will not be affected by the transfer the way i see it this will allow for better control of systems and facilitate frendly hand overs without the need for structure switching and the logistics involved there in
im just waiting for the loss of a tug filled with shiny fit incursion battleships rather than the sensible option of unfitting the modules and just moving the rigged ships before moving the modules seperately
well that is a risk that will likely be taken i want to score a killmail like thati am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
congrats jack
wtg manlooks freakin awesome
wowwell if ships lost to a boxer gank are now reimbursable i would expect to see that every ship lost to an isboxed bombing run since pretty much forever will need to be reimbursed immediatelyor is there some greater form of favoritism at play here
hello csmthis is probably a terrible idea and im sure youll be able to tell the many many reasons why nevertheless since sperging on the forums is a godgiven right of all eve players  here goes nothingthe new patch structure poses a particular challenge to the csm the current scheme of having a trip to iceland for an information bonanza with smaller catchup sessions behind the scenes via skype  your forums worked well under the old model it doesnt really seem fit for purpose under the new release schedule however the fine details of exactly what is being released are far more fluid than they ever were in the past the recent drama over jump range changes seams to attest to this i might be wrong but what i gathered from it was rather than the csm being actively mislead they were simply left out of the loop at the vital stage and we can probably except similar situations to arise in the futureburnout is also a factor to consider you guys do fantastic work but i think sometimes we can forget that ultimately youre volunteers rather than this being your an allconsuming job im sure the reality is different but on paper your workload has effectively gone up by a factor of five assuming each patch will require roughly the same amount of faffing about in terms of providing feedback preparing statements etc what id like to suggest is doing away with the trip to iceland and instead hiring a full time csm tribune to spy on ccp by no means am i suggesting that the trip is worthless or that its a holiday for you guys i dont think anyone whos read the minutes could ever argue that but rather that this might be a better use of resources in our brave new reality hopefully the effect would be to give the csm more of an active day to day presence within ccp and simultaneously make your workload more manageable ive assumed that having both would be a nonstarter with ccp but that the cost of the trip could be exchanged to cover their salary the fine details would of course be up to yourselves and more importantly ccp but for illustration purposes heres an example of how it could work they should be employed by the csm rather than ccp with their full 40 hour job description at the csms disposal they wouldnt be a direct member of the csm but rather a resource for it to use their principle job would be to serve as boots on the ground reporting to the csm finding out what each teams doing on a weekly basis sitting in on meetings booking conferences making sure questions are followed up on etc rather than receiving snapshots of information there would be a more continuous flow which hopefully would be more manageable they could also be made responsible for a lot of the tedious collating and releasing of information taking meeting minutes keeping a calendar of whats currently under nda or due for release etc when the csm has a unified position on an issue they would be able to bang the drum in person on its behalf their permanent presence would presumably help smooth transition periods between one csm and its successor i could ramble on and on but hopefully you get idea i look forward to hearing the dozen reasons why im a drunken idiot in due course
i recently returned to this game to find things have changed a lot in the last couple yearsi would like to make 2 arguments1 the old canflipping mechanics were fun they produced distictly high quality player created content and lead to conflicts and learning within the game they were great for casual pvpthe duel system is no replacement for this mechanic can flipping seems to have been replaced by fulltime suicide ganks because suicide ganking is in some ways safer than can flipping under the new system i think the old system was better2 a possibly unanticipated effect of the 50 million isk corp war dec is the large wardec alliances who are now targeting small industrial corpsback when a wardec cost 2 million isk a wardec corp would typically be between 2 and 5 people that would declare war on a 2030 person industrial corp now small corps cant afford wars so everyone pitches in together and creates a 150 person war dec alliance then they pool their resources and open up 50 or 100 wars against those same industrial corpsthe difference is now the indie corp is 20 unskilled guys against a major alliance that doesnt really bother me but heres my argument1 the war dec guys are suffering in a big boring alliance when theyd rather be able to cause pandemonium on a small scale where they could make isk off ransoms and get more fights2 the industrialists would have more fun if they werent getting repetatively stomped by alliances they cant even hope to take the field againstthis is what i see i like can flipping on the old mechaincs better than the suicide gank game i see now i like small war dec corps better than large allianceswhat do you think eve
id recommend picking your fight over either the dueling changes or the wardec mechanic making a post trying to cover both is going to dilute the usefulness of any discussion herefor my part i would argue that the 50m wardec is not bad at least not for the reasons listed nobody is making highsec pvpers join a blobby alliance to go to war if they dont like something they dont have to do it as for people on the receiving end of the dec i counter with a question are losses under the current system greater than under the older system when there were more frequent smaller wardecs
okay lets cut out the no response means yes part could an unsubbed person release a name to you in other words were flipping it the deactivated account owns the name until it actively turns it over but can do so without reactivating and deleting the character
there was an announcement by ccp foxfour in his presentation at eve vegasall names of trial account characters who have never paid ccp any money or used plex that are older than 1 year old will be reclaimed i think he said rhea december release but my memory is a trifle untrustworthy right now if youve ever subbed your account in any way shape or form it wont be affectedthere are a lot of names which are going to be reclaimed
thats a helpful bit of information thats great news on its own i bet that covers the vast majority of taken names as csm do you have access to the statistics specifying what percentage of inactive accounts are unpaid trialsmore comments to come
yes considering that some of the most hilarious moments in eve occur because of botched sov transfers
yes i am totally against a mechanic that makes things easier for people who shouldnt be in charge of important tasks such as sov transfers in the first place
please put a warning when you go to rent an office that the rent can fluctuate which it doesnt mention at the moment or a an option to stop autopaying if it increases by a certain amountcurrent messageyou have been quoted an office rental fee of 11504 isk the rental period is for 30 days the corporation renting you the office can end the contract at the end of a rental period the contract might be automatically extended if the office has not been vacated at the end of a rental period this is done at the discretion of the corporation renting you the office if the contract is automatically extended then you will receive a bill for the extension of the contract if you do not pay the bill by the end of the extension then the office will be repossessed in order to rent an office at this station you must accept the fee do you accepti rented an office for 11504 then stopped playing leaving it autopaying thinking it would only cost 140k a year but come back to find the price had increased by a substancial amount costing me more than 36 million extradaterentadditional cost1309121150401310121000015041211121000015041212121000015041101131000015041002131000015041203131000015041104141000015041105131000015041006131000015041007132181910315090813204298925080913198528348081013196358131071113180266522071213158014297060114432403173605021443841323370703141894491779450604148187548072500605143538569352706505061410845145108336410507149289912927840804081462780816266577030914349359434820900310141689971167846736148518
i think this is a reasonable suggestion and could be easily executed
thanks all only one more question remainsi can has im just floored that this got through and hopefully it means we can get more good ideas through the maze of nerf incursions the afk cloakies scare me and eff carebears threadsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
and then any major power bloc with more than one seat could push their agenda through this role and leave out ideas that would benefit other players no thanksworking as intendedi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i question whether a ccp employee could represent and work for the csm in a truly independent fashion in the wide world of business you generally dont entrust a companychosen employee to recon for you
hi i dont think ccp will hire us a spy we do have a leeloo though and shes greatthe way things happen at the moment iswe have a whole bunch of skype channels which contain a bunch of ccp devs who we can chat with about anything in the general chat or about specific team areas in the serious business channels better signal to noise but less useful for just spitballingwe also have forums which they post stuff to for us to have a look at when it reachs an appropriate state or for when feedback is likely to be fairly lengthyall in all this all works pretty well the jump change thing was an abberation where while we had all the details posted up for us in the meeting some details were overlooked and not discussed as youve seen it was a pretty lengthy set of changes we talked a lot about them just missed a bullet point or two no malfeasance just missing something and a little overeagerness when it got posted there was a lot of talking after that got posted and as youll have seen revisions occuredthe trip to iceland is valuable as its always better to be able to talk to people in person where you get the full social bandwidth unlike with text chat or even video chat 3 days of 10 hours of meetings is somewhat tiring but it allowed us to more easily quiz people on things like the philosophy behind change as a group not just one to one
hi stevelike the title said it was a silly idea but i appreciate that you took the trouble to reply to my drunken wall of spergthanks and keep up the good work
the lack of canflipping opportunities is related to a different thing actually mining vessels have been changed a lot  so by now the cargo hold of most vessels are big enough to make the jetcans pretty obsolete on beginner level the simple venture takes a 5000 m3 load and is so fast that it beats the combination jetcanhauler as a single player any time with improving skills in mining the cargo holds for ore are getting even bigger for the following ships making it even less necessary to jetcan
fox i concede your point i probably did dilute my argument by making both at the same time however i think theyre valid my point is about the quality of the content i consider the new structure a destruction of the best pvp experience ive seen in any gamedwissi im not talking about a desire to flip miners though i like doing that most of the can flipping ive done is on stations with other people looking for a fight the fact that new mining ships have huge hulls and more tank than a battlecruiser is another topic completelycan flipping was a great informal way for people to mess with each other and manage agro most of the friends i have in this game i met can flippingfor both instances in which i ask for change the new rules have created an inversion ganking is now safer and more predictable than any other casual pvp option which doesnt really make sense can flipping used to be the casual pvp option of choice it had clear mechanics and escalation opportunitiesi find the duel option absolutely painful and without any reasonable option for escalation concerning war declarations i think weve made it too hard for a small corp to declare war and desperate pvpers have formed large albatross alliances who are bored senseless and are war deccing the same small industrial corps again i see this as an inversion of the intended consequenceeven if you dont want the old mechanics for the whole game perhaps you can do them somewhere i think the game is poorer for their loss
i could probably get that informationhowever itd be covered by the nda so wouldnt be of any real use to you from the presentation i think it said 65 million names are going to be reclaimed
in general i am not opposing the idea of a cleanup  but i do not like that the motivation is the reclaiming of cool namesi took a long break myself  eve is one of the few games that actually allow you to do that so anything connected to accounts that have been payed for in some form shouldnt be touched at all  thats perfectly in line with what ccp announcedbut many names have been blocked on purpose by people to avoid a copycat usage for scams and other things i know at least a few that created accounts to achieve exactly that another reason that some accounts might never been subbed after the trial period is that many people where using free mail accounts and might not have access to those accounts anymore or cannot recall enough details to reclaim them themselvesi would be very interested in knowing how many assets will be deleted by the purge considering how gamy we are in eve i am almost certain that there are many accounts who where created as parking lot for assets etc
all right so i misjudged that theres a large number of people who go inactive and dont want the possibility of losing their name i also appreciate that the vast majority of inactive names are being recovered in an upcoming recovery of trial account names id still like to see some way to recover names from inactive paid accounts who arent planning on ever logging back in from the above comments i imagine rules along the lines of1 a player can ask an inactive player for a name but its ultimately up to the inactive player to approve the donation2 if the inactive player declines to donate the name they will never be asked again since we interpret this as they want to keep the name3 the inactive player can donate the name without reactivating their accountcriticisms
that would hit the nail right on spot probably  only requires ccp to play along to forward that request somehow to the inactive player via the account systems information
as an older player attempting to return to eve i ran into mr borg x50 on one of my characters almost immediately the only thing that annoys the crap out of me about that person is that traffic control and lag get all sorts of messed up whenever i have to travel near the systems they are in they are like a giant ball of lag that slowly travels throughout lonetrek
congrats jack on your idea getting support from ccp i want a eve pinball machine confirming ccp cognac is best cognac
thanks ed and now we wait for it to be released in all its gloryi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
gotta agree with steve on thisthere is also the slight issue with who would run for a csm job as opposed to the volunteer postion you might not get the same people because committing to leaving your current lifestyle to actually be a full time game consultant might not be the dream of the people who would best represent youthen again maybe some would do a fine jobby being volunteers we can maintain the illusion that we are not beholding to the company but working for the players i say illusion because in truth we are both and neither are we working hard or harder hell yesgoodm
my understanding from the presentation and subsequent convoscomments at evevegas is that no accounts are being purged so therefore no assets will be purged only the character names are being released and i was told the characters would be renamed generic racialcitizennumber names ie caldaricitizen25341530958 the account itself and everything attached to the account remains in place just the character names will changemy understanding could of course be wrong
greygal thanks for pointing that out  i guess i missed that part of the stream and better have a second look at it
it wasnt a particularly well attended presentation which is a shame as ccp foxfour was quite quite drunk while making it
wow  no kidding lol  just worked through it my human speech decipher skills just leveled up by watching itedit that is one neat little trick to get all those people i mentioned above secure names etc to quickly subscribe those accounts so they dont lose the names well thought ccp
congrats dude always nice to see the community being recognized deletetheweak
option 2 looks goodi think you should buy a new mayan calendar mine has muscle cars on it  kenneth ohara
damn good idea dmc id be happy with both  would love to see more pve in this game  if i have to pick one it would be option 2 i want a eve pinball machine confirming ccp cognac is best cognac
would gladly support dmc in this proposal1 for option 2 pleasehost of high drag podcast
a relatively simple start would be to allow us to invite other players into our quarters to ramp that up a bit perhaps a bit of customization options to the captains quarters paint colors even placeable in game discoveries
a good optioni am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i had not even had a drink that day i was however really tired and thrown off by a few things
correct 
i know this is probably beyond the capability of ccps development team but i would like to see a deployable structure that allows view of a remote location in space for instance i could drop this item in space on a gate and it would pop a window in the ui with a view of that location in space this item would be not be visible to ships passing by remote cameras could be discovered by a small smartbomb type item that would decloak the remote camera within a 50km radiusremote cameras would be limited by skill and require a fairly long train with a max number of remote cameras deployed to 5if the graphics rendering would not be possible it would be nice to extend your dscan from the remote camera splitting your dscan results into sections from shipremote 1remote 2 etc remote cameras would be limited dscan 360degree for simplicity and could be configured individually with its own range slider or use the range slider from the shipit would be nice to be able to do this across systems but i would imagine this would cause more technical problems and would be limited to same system as the player that deployed them
dont stop believineve down under  a community for players in the autz
dude we are getting it was announced at eve vegasi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
yeah i was there dont stop believin even after its a thing p always never dont not stop believineve down under  a community for players in the autz
so for how long should i leave my account abandoned to get a rename 
you know we where messing with you right
nahyou already have intel channels across the board to cover your ratting1
actually ratting was not the reason for the idea more surveillance of hostile movement for pvp purposes if you look at my kb you will find that im not much into pve
they already have theseedit eh i kinda feel like an  just saying the above without explaining it i think the fog of war as it exists right now is a good mechanic and does not need alterations like the proposed change while it might provide an interesting shakingup of the dynamics of fair war there are plenty of practices like gate camping which would be buffed by this and i dont think that is a good thing
hello im not sure where to post this so i hope this is the good placei would like to know if it would be possible to change my character name from  random kheops to random kheopsi know this is not really important but it is to me thanks for the answer
file a petition ingame
thisthey will change the first letter of each word to upper case but it may take some time for the petition to be answered destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
im glad to see that the trial account names are being opened up in such a fashion there are certainly a few that i am eagre to try to snag up should they happen to have been created on trial accounts long ago as for the possibility of ever losing your character name on a paid account that is a legacy part of the history of eve for some a bigger one than others but to think that someone might snag up someone elses name simply because that person was gone for a year after 6 years of play or didnt respond to a 30 day query is a mistake that i hope ccp will never make while i think its neat to ask someone for their name i dont think that ccp should be in the business of allowing players to exchange names beyond one player deleting his character or selling it to the person who wants the name
im fairly certain that valve and a variety of other games already actively do this without legal hassle because a you are consenting to it and b because they are only searching for certain file types they are not snooping through personal data or information any more than an electronic security is used to scan for weaponsas for isboxer the amount of people that do run more than 30 accounts is so ridiculously small that its silly to address the entire subject based around them which is probably why ccp doesnt however if this really is such a big issue players can combat it if you are determined bump or suicide gank palyers like memory alpha sure having enough battleships to gank all his skiffs before they simply warp off is probably not cost effective and something he can probably replace quickly but having a few characters simply bumping his freighters repeatedly preventing them from warping out is particularly effective at shutting down his operation sure the miners keep mining but without anywhere to put the ore or ice itll overflow fast with 40 skiffs something that would create a real problem for him take it upon yourselves to combat the actions of mega players like this the general userbase that uses isboxer and similar applications are not a problem for eve
eulad monitoringyou agree that ccp may remotely monitor your game hardware solely for the purpose of establishing whether in playing the game and accessing the system you are using software created or approved by ccp or whether you are using unauthorized software created by you or a third party in contravention of section 6but as input mirroring is valid such monitoring doesnt matter anyway
nicely saidi was slightly annoyed by people using isboxer many times around me because i play with one single account and work with a corporation or even out in null with others cooperatively and these people using isboxer come in take everything i was doing leaving me in the dust because i cant keep up and they just click one button to do 10 things at oncei do know it gives ccp more income so they wont really ban it nor can they detect for it and there are ways of hiding its usage even if ccp were to poke into the privacy of their users by hiding a process checking tool into the game clienthowever its about the only way the game survives at this point solo players are becoming extremely rare im a rare breed now p being a miningindustry person with only one account it sucks when im mining with someone and a team of 1030 isboxer guys comes in and deletes the entire belt before i can get what i need shoving me off to have to leave the area but meh a reward for the solo account users that properly work with other human players or even work solo just fine would be pretty nicehowever there is no real way for ccp to reward those types of people because again they wont be able to detect the isboxer users from the nonisboxer guysanyway i dont support banning isboxer at this point even though users using it have annoyed me quite a lot
this is a question about the character naming policy and the lack of enforcement i wont copy the rules here directly but here is a link for anyone wondering
all you can do is report it i have seen ccp change the names of characters and corporations that were deemed offensive but as with forums i think they are inclined to let some edge cases stay this thread has degenerated to the point its become like two bald men fighting over a comb  doc fury
honestly it has to do with how much effort they are willing to expend towards something no one is complaining about or at least very few are since the age of most eve players is upper 20s to low 30s most people have learned to just ignore such names i mean its not as if theres a whole lot of impressionable youths runnign around the game or if there were theyd have been the ones picking those names to begin with anyways
bump
please see ccp falcons response to an identical thread herethread closed
report the character names ccp makes their decisions from there they do have a process to make these decisions
they may have a process but the question is whether or not they care to follow it
csm note hats were brought up in the art session please dont murder usno tf2 in eve tia in advance
sadly ive seen no indication ccp intends to do any real new development on eve since they havent really done any in the last three years either
i think instead of trying to add elements of second life to eve ccp should focus on the things that actually i dont know improve the game its a game about blowing ships up in space focus on that not some useless feature incarna was a horrid expansion alot of dev time and resources dedicated to catering to the rmt crowd and the game suffered heavily as a result
why not just let me pay another plex every month to be able to duct tape another bomber to my own skip isboxer altogether just give me a bomber that has double the gridcpuslots that is functionally what isboxer does ccp needs to handle this  if you are only controlling one ship and your commands are replicated huehue replicator to 30 others you are functionally controlling a massive voltron of 31 ships as one with all of their weapons grouped being able to do such with a bunch of plex makes eve p2w
okay so you think having a strong moral compass is important for a csm candidate ordo you think its more important to be taken seriously
it would be an added bonus to one of the upgrades dedicated to upgrading the graphics hell go full  sell stuff in the nex store to put in to your walk about station stuff added revenue to ccp looking at ccp anything is possible i would like to see something new other then spinning my ship in the hangerolgaso yeah like my post olga
starting from my own experience i have been in many corporations from highsec corps genuinely trying to build an organization eveuniversity lowsec pirate groups noncorporate incursion communities and various nullsec groups within the cfc and in another life on another main in the early days of eve i have even been a highsec carebear and a providence antipirate residenti would say that there is a scale of ease of access for joining communities and corporations some are open societies and some are closed societies we could place a group on the spectrum of how open they are to new members and strangerseve university and brave newbies are on the extreme end of open societies they will quite literally take anyone who wants to join them if you are new to eve without any friends or connections they would be among your best options for a well organized corp that is willing to take you inmost corporations that openly recruit on the eve online forums and the official recruitment channel would fall under the please apply and fill in the application booklet give us proof of your competence through your killboard and standby for antispy background checks and interviews routine their recruitment usually follows the tune of pvpers wanted industrialists wanted want cool pvp fun times explosions isk etcthen there are a great many that do not openly recruit vouch only corps exist in all areas of space you have to know someone to get in in eve there are many highprofile corps and groups that practice vouch based recruitment they do cool things they affect the sandbox in public ways and you are not welcome to join unless you are already connected to thembeing in the the new order belligerent undesirables and the cfc i have met and befriended a fair share of awoxers and people who join corps with alts or even mains to grief them i grant that to an awoxer or thief public recruiting corporations are lowhanging fruit the poor victims actually want you in their corporation and are rewarded with asset destruction and redistribution to the point of manly tears it is understandable that some people tend towards not trusting another eve player further than they can throw themaccording to the csm9 minutes ccp wants to remove awoxing to make recruitment safer for the recruiter and the recruitee and to mitigate the risk of recruiting someone which makes people not recruit i grant that when a large well organized entity gets awoxed or infiltrated they can usually shrug it off less organized groups and casual groups tend more towards not surviving the experience and for a carebear corporation i expect it can be hell and it is usually intended to be so by the perpetratorremoving awoxing will most certainly make it easier for people to join corps that cant defend themselves or otherwise survive an infiltration though i understand that everyone can try to play how they like i personally resent the intervention by ccp in trying to help the weak survive though my bias is probably due to being on the griefing factionbut from a perspective of the greater good of eve i would argue that making the game easier for the weak by changing awoxing mechanics is not good for new players or people who want to build corporations in the sense that it would encourage more of such risk adverse players and organisationsmany of us helpful griefers would tell you that new players and organizations survive eve by being informed and educated about the risks and then adapting to themchanges to the mechanics will help new players join bad corps closed societies and corps with high standards will not take them anyway at a demographic level this will harm the collective intelligence and adaptability of the eveborn newbie as you give them easy access to bad corporationsfrom a griefing perspective however bad corporations do not survive and never will what the future will most likely see is that other methods of doing harm to corporations in highsec will still be used to their fullest extent the collective screaming of the victims will continue to beg for more safety but they will never be safe without gamebreaking changes to make them totally safemalcanis law will always apply even in this situation as you make things harder we can only get more organized more resourceful and more brutal  i would know i will be instigating it
i agree with you 100 if you remove all risk from players you create a goup of complacent risk averse people that will do nothing to adapt to what eve is all about the answer is not to make eve a safer place but to educate and prepare players to be able to adapt and survive the path that ccp has been following lately is to say the least is harmful to the survival of eveimo players need to learn how to adapt to risk to minimize or eliminate threats to their safety to me it seems like people are whining to have their hands held because they cant seem to learn how to survive on their own eve is a model of how things can and do function in the real world the last thing eve needs is the same political correctness and hand holding of the weak that occurs in rl adapt to survivelearn to growfight to win giving handouts and free passes to those either too lazy or too inept to make it on their own is not the solution i fear as kid gloves are put on more and more ccp will alienate the majority of its player base in order to accomodate a select few my suggestion to ccp would be to implement actions that help teach and prepare new players or old players who just dont get it not remove them from all risk tbh the best teacher is experience for example getting ganked teaches you your mistakes and how to avoid them in the future for most people anyways just like getting killed in pvp teaches you your mistakes and how to adapt to certain situations take this away and what you have is a game like so many others i play eve because it is not like other games im sure many will agree ccppleasefix whats broken with everather than try to change what isnt there are so many things that have gone neglected that need attention protection for those too unmotivated to take the responsibility themselves is not one of them now i digress
ccp seagull why is not every corporation recruiting openly if this is not a problem i know that it is also corporation roles and access but you are smart enough to know what you are getting into but do you not agree this is hindering recruitmenti would like to add that it is not just awoxing that hinders corporation recruitment anyone that is not highsec does who not openly recruit fear something else the metagameawoxing is the least of their problems
i agree that taking away corpies being able to shoot each other isnt going to change whether someone will stay in the game or not if the new player isnt into eve there will be excuses offered if they bother with the survey on the way out annoying the daylights out of the player base that does subscribe long term  not so great an ideathat said if ccp really wants to make a positive change regarding shooting corpies how about thiscorp andor open kill rights assignable by a corp member with any official corp role beyond just being in the corp lasts until used by anyone and stays with the character for 30 days after dropping corp 1 active corp kill right per corp on a character at a given timeor if ccp wants to make less nerfing viable incentives for players to leave npc corps just boot them from their first npc after 30 days of the account being active into a no corp status with penalties likenot being able to set market orders or purchase from the market while in a no corp statusand orinability to use contracts while in a no corp statusand ornot being allowed to use reprocessing facilities in an npc station while in a no corp statusand ornot being being allowed to access any agents while in a no corp statusalso consider after 30 days of being an active accountif the character joins an npc corp after leaving a pc corp treat the character as in limited faction warfare for that corps main faction such as if gallente corp all amarr npc corpfaction warfare can fight said character etc at any time anywhere take away faction police from going after them unless faction standing would otherwise allow for itetc
interestinggotta run now but am curious what people think
i posted the following in the gd thread i think its appropriate to post it here too
the goal of this is to make the game more casual friendly so now instead of having to do research into someone applying to join your corp a lot of corps can just autoaccept players and move oni will grant that the hour application process to join many of the established corps sucks especially when you are a new player and dont really know if you like the corp anyway it put me off joining a player corp for a whilehowever i would prefer if this was handled by making the background check process easier the api system is very convoluted if that were streamlined it would help out
even the api wont save a corporation from an experienced and determined spy who would also be aware of these tools at least at the nullsec level the bar is set very very high to the tune of professional internet forensics what the api does do is make it more difficult for incompetent griefers like me to run amok with 10 hour heroes id actually need some kind of untraceable income for skillbooks and equipment metagame wise i believe that no serious corporation will ever autoaccept people and no game mechanic can change that
you are thinking from a null perspective this is a change directed at highsec high sec pve corps rarely worry about spies and they dont give their line members access to anything of value more members means more tax income and more people showing up to your mining opsif you are a high sec pve corp looking to recruit after this change there is little reason not to autoaccept members worst that can happen is they say bad things in corp chat then you kick themwhich is guaranteed to happen next downtime
hey just popping back in to get in touchall of my account downsizing has happened in the form of cancelling the recurring charges for the subs however there will still be transfer fees being made as i consolidate mains i just want to be clear this isnt about the irl  its about welping half a plex in pure med clone costs in a single outing i have no problem spending the  for what amounts to a database edit really in fact im already saving money despite these charges through reduced sub feesill have to eat those fees again when its time to unpack my mains and put them all on their own accounts againi just hope you take a very clear headed look at how game mechanics are changing the face of multiboxing in eve some things are far far removed from the code and are classic cases of the writing on the walli still love you just doing what i gotta
i recently posted in the relevant forum about this and got told to stfubut im concerned this change does nothing for gameplay i have not actively played eve for years but i keep my account i really only log on to change skills and check my corp my corp has over a hundred members and i think you could say that no one was a real player in eve but they all pay their subs if i can stack a years worth of skills what incentive have i to login and if in a year i remember to check my account why would i be bothered to keep it activeplease rethink this change i suspect it will lose more accounts than it will gain unless farmers click on to the possibilities thanks khem
just saw a dev mention the tug and a dec launch so came here to see if it was true i cant wait to see what actually comes out nice work
i think being good or true is always more important than being taken seriously i am aware that it isnt a good strategy but i refuse to yield my values
